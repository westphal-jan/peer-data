However, in the MMSB, all observations (both interactions and non-interactions) contribute equally to our conclusions about group affiliations and group-to-group interaction patterns. In practical applications, it is therefore useful to take into account littleness. To calibrate the meaning of non-interaction, we introduce a savings parameter \u03c1 [0, 1]. This model illustrates how often a non-interaction is due to node affiliation rather than transporting information about group affiliations of nodes. Instead of drawing an edge directly from the Bernoulli interaction given above, we reduce it to (1 \u2212 2) \u00b7 z > p \u2192 qB ~ zp \u2190 q. The probability that there is no interaction is greater than the interference (1 \u2212 4)."}, {"heading": "2.2 A case study of the Monastery network via MMSB: crisis in a Cloister", "text": "Before turning to the subsequent conclusions and parameter estimates, we illustrated the MMSB with an analysis of the monastic data described above (which we did not accept).In detail, Sampson (1968) looked at 18 novices in a monastery and asked them to rate the other novices in terms of four sociometric relationships: how / disapproving, appreciation, personal influence and alignment with the monastic creed. We look at Breiger's accumulation of Sampson's data (Breiger et al., 1975).The original graph of monk-monk interaction is illustrated in Figure 2 (left).Sampson spent several months in a monastery in New England where the monks were preparing for a monastic order. Sampson's original analysis was rooted in direct anthropological observations.

Empirical Bayes, on the other hand, direct the posterior inference to a region of hyperparameter space p supported by the data. Variational EM uses the lower limit in Eq.3 as a surrogate for probability. To find a local optimum of the limit, we iterate between qar: adaptation of the variation distribution q to approximate the posterior limit and maximization of the lower limit of probability."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments and Results", "text": "The three problems serve different purposes. Simulations are performed in Section 4.1 to show that both the mixed membership, ~ \u03c01: N, and the latent block structure, B, can be recovered from data if they exist, and that the nested variable inference algorithm is as fast as the naive implementation, while the probability is higher - coeteris paribus.Applying it to a student friendship network in Section 4.2 tests the model on a real dataset where we expect a well-defined latent block structure to inform the observed connectivity patterns in the network.In this application, the blocks are to be interpreted in notes.We compare our results with those recently published with a simple mix of blocks (Doreian et al., 2007) and with a latent spatial model (Handcock et al., 2007)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Exploring Expected Model Behavior with Simulations", "text": "In developing the MMSB and the corresponding calculation, we hope that the model can restore both the mixed affiliation of nodes to clusters and the latent block structure between clusters in situations where a block structure exists and the relationships are measured with some errors. To support this claim, we have evaluated diagrams of 100, 300 and 600 nodes from block models with 4, 10 and 20 clusters, respectively, using the MMSB. We have used various values of \u03b1 to simulate a number of settings regarding node affiliation to clusters - from almost unique (\u03b1 = 0.05) to mixed (\u03b1 = 0.25)."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Recovering the Truth", "text": "The variable EM algorithm successfully restores both the latent block model B and the latent mixed membership vectors ~ \u03c01: N.

In each panel, the estimated reordering of the nodes (i.e. the reordering of rows and columns in the interaction matrix) shows the block model that was originally used to simulate the interactions."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Nested Variational Inference", "text": "The nested variation algorithm causes the log probability to converge as fast as the na\u00efve variation algorithm, but reaches a significantly higher plateau. In the left panel of Figure 7, we compare the runtimes of the nested variation algorithm with the na\u00efve implementation on a graph with 100 nodes and 4 clusters. We measure the number of seconds on the X axis and the log probability on the Y axis. The two curves are averages over 26 experiments, and the error bars are three standard deviations. Each of the 26 experiment pairs was initialized with the same values for the parameters. The nested algorithm, which is more spatially efficient, converges faster. Furthermore, the nested variation algorithm can be paralleled because the updates for each interaction (i, j) are independent of each other."}, {"heading": "4.1.3 Choosing the Number of Groups", "text": "Figure 7 (right) shows an example where cross-validation is sufficient to perform the model selection for the MMSB.

We measure the number of latent clusters on the X-axis and the average log-out probability, which corresponds to five times cross-validation experiments on the Y-axis. A peak in this curve identifies the optimal number of clusters to describe the data. The nested variable EM algorithm was set to convergence for each value of K we tested with a tolerance of = 10 \u2212 5.

It contains approximately 8,000 protein complex associations in yeast. We analyze a subset of this collection of 871 proteins whose interactions with each other have been hand-curated. The institute also provides a set of functional notes, an alternative to genontology (GO). These notes are organized in a tree, with 15 general functions at the first level, 72 more specific functions at the middle level, and 255 notes at the leaf level. In Table 2, we map the 871 proteins in our collections to the main functions of the MIPS note tree; proteins in our subcollection have about 2.4 functional notes at the average level."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Brief Summary of Previous Findings", "text": "In previous work, we have established the usefulness of mixing latent block models to analyze protein protein interaction data (Airoldi et al., 2005), for example, using the MMSB to test functional interaction hypotheses (by establishing a zero hypothesis for B) and conducting unattended assessment experiments. In the next section, we evaluate whether and to what extent functionally relevant biological signals can be detected in MMSB. In summary, the results in Airoldi et al. (2005) show that the MMSB identifies protein complexes whose protein complexes closely interact with each other. Identifiable protein complexes correlate with the following four categories of Table 2: cell cycle & DNA processing, transcription, protein synthesis and subcellular activities that support these protein complexes."}, {"heading": "4.3.3 Measuring the Functional Content in the Posterior", "text": "In a follow-up study, we considered genontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000) as the source of the functional annotations that we consider to be the basis for truth in our analyses. GO is a broader and finer-grained functional annotation scheme when compared with the content generated by the Munich Institute of Protein Sequencing. In addition, we examined a much larger model space than in the previous study to test to what extent MMSB can reduce the dimensionality of the data while revealing substantial information about the functionality of proteins that can be used to inform subsequent analyses. We fit models with number blocks up to K = 225. Thanks to our nested variational inference algorithm, we were able to perform fivefold cross-validation for each value ofK. We found that a fairly parsimonious model (K = 50) provides a good description of the observed protein interaction network (providing qualitative prediction in line with a predictor of) of the quality achieved."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "Modern probability models for relational data analysis are rooted in the stochastic block models for psychometric and sociological analysis developed by Lorrain and White (1971) and Holland and Leinhardt (1975). In statistics, this line of research is extended in various contexts (Fienberg et al., 1985; Wasserman and Pattison, 1996; Snijders, 2002; Hoff et al., 2002; Doreian et al., 2004). In machine learning, the related technique of Markov random networks (Frank and Strauss, 1986) is used for link prediction (Taskar et al., 2003) and the traditional block models have been expanded to include non-parametric Bayesians (Kemp et al., 2004) and to integrate relationships and text."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we presented mixed stochastic block models, a novel class of latent variable models for relational data, which provide exploratory tools for scientific analysis in applications where the observations can be presented as a collection of unipartite graphs. The nested variable inference algorithm is parallelizable and allows for quick, approximate inferences to large graphs. The relational nature of such data, as well as the multiple objectives of analysis in the applications we considered, motivated our technical decisions. Latent variables in our models are introduced to capture application-specific substantial elements of interest, e.g. monks and factions in monasteries. The applications in social and biological networks we looked at exhibit considerable similarities in the way such elements interact, allowing us to identify a general formulation of the model we present in Appendix A."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partially supported by the National Institutes of Health under grant number R01 AG023141-01, the Office of Naval Research under contract number N00014-02-1-0973, the National Science Foundation under grant number DMS-0240019, IIS-0218466 and DBI-0546594, the Pennsylvania Department of Health's Health Research Program under grant number 2001NF-Cancer Health Research Grant ME-01-739, and the Department of Defense, all to Carnegie Mellon University."}, {"heading": "A General Model Formulation", "text": "In general, mixed memberships are stochastic block models ~ ~ ~ ~ Assumptions on four levels q = q q (population, node, latent variable and sampling scheme level.A1 population level Suppose there are K-classes or sub-populations in the population in question.

In this paper, we describe a latent variable model of such data called the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel.

We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We explore applications to social and protein interaction networks.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
