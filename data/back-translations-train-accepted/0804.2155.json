Although I am focusing on first-order conditional logic, it is easy to specialize all definitions and results in the propositional case, so I am not discussing the propositional formulas of first-order conditional logic. The first-order conditional logic syntax via vocabulary T, more complicated formulas are formed by closing themselves under the standard connectives of truth functionality (i.e.), the first-order quantification and the binary modal operator. Therefore, a typical formula is x (x) \u2192 y (Q) \u2192 R (y)."}, {"heading": "3 Axioms for qualitative and quantitative reasoning", "text": "In this section, I will begin by showing that qualitative thinking is characterized by the same axiom system for both | = and | = sp. Then, I will offer a complete axiomatization for \u01410C. Finally, I will consider quantitative conditioned logic. In the axioms, it is convenient to use N\u0442 as an abbreviation for euros \u2192 incorrectly. Note that if \u0441 is a closed formula, then M | = N\u03c8 iff, for some n *, Prn ([...] M) = 0 for all n \u00b2 and similarly with | = replaced by | = sp."}, {"heading": "3.1 Qualitative Reasoning", "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, Friedman, Halpern and Koller 2000 offer a complete axiomatization of AXC for \u0141C in relation to | =.
