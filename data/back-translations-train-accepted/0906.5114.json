Typically, one of three answers is given (Aikhenvald and Dixon, 2001; Campbell, 2006). Firstly, languages can be \"genetically\" related to each other, that is, they can all be derived from a common ancestral language. Secondly, the similarities can be due to chance. Some linguistic traits are simply more common than others, which is often due to the use of linguistic universes (Greenberg, 1963). Thirdly, languages can be spatially related. Languages occupying the same geographical area often exhibit similar traits, not because of genetic kinship, but because of sharing. Regions (and the languages they contain) called parts are called linguistic areas, and the traits that are shared are called areal."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "We describe (in Section 3) a non-parametric, hierarchical Bayesian model for locating linguistic areas and spatial features.

A recent article provides a brief introduction both to the problems surrounding area linguistics and to a list of many of the known linguistic regions (Campbell, 2005). A relatively comprehensive, modern treatment of problems around area diffusion is also provided by essays in a recent book edited by Aikhenvald and Dixon (2001). The essays in this book provide a good introduction to the problems in this area. Campbell (2006) provides a critical overview of these and other hypotheses relating to area linguistics."}, {"heading": "2.1.1 Established Linguistic Areas", "text": "Below we list some of the known language areas; Campbell (2005) also provides a more complete listing along with sample characteristics for these areas.

Meso-America: Cuitlatec, Huave, Maya, MixeZoquean, Nahua, Otomanguean, Tarascan, Tequistlatecan, Totonacan and Xincan. Northwest America: Alsea, Chimakuan, Coosan, Eyak, Haida, Kalapuyan, Lower Chinook, Salishan, Takelman, Tlinguistez, Tsimshian and Wakashan."}, {"heading": "2.1.2 Linguistic Features", "text": "Determining which linguistic features are easiest to share \"area\" is a long-standing problem in contact linguistics. At this point, we will briefly consider some of the most important assertions. A large part of this overview is taken from the summary of Curnow (2001). Haugen (1950) only looks at borrowability in terms of the lexicon, providing evidence that nouns are the simplest, followed by verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, etc. Ross (1988) confirms Haugen's analysis and deepens it to cover morphology, syntax, and phonology. He suggests the following hierarchy of borrowability (easiest to come first): nouns > verbs > adjectives > syntax > unbound function words > bound morphemes > phonemes. Starting from a \"constraints\" perspective, Moravcsik (1978) suggests that lexical elements must be borrowed before random properties."}, {"heading": "2.2 Non-parametric Bayesian Models", "text": "We treat the problem of understanding territorial linguistics as a statistical question based on a database of typological information. Due to the questions raised in the previous section, we do not want to commit ourselves to the existence of a certain number of linguistic areas or a certain size of them. (In fact, we do not even want to commit ourselves to the existence of any linguistic areas.) However, we have to \"unify\" the languages that fall into a linguistic area (if there is such a thing) using statistical parameters. Such problems have been studied under the name of non-parametric models. The idea behind non-parametric models is that one does not commit oneself a priori to a certain number of parameters. Instead, we let the data dictate how many parameters there are. In Bayean modelling, non-parametric distributions are typically used as precursors; see Jordan (2005) or Ghahramani (2005) for overviews. In our model described below, we use two different non-parametric procedures (the process for the precepituistic)."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 The Pitman-Yor Process", "text": "A particular example of a non-parametric process is the Pitman-Yor process (Pitman and Yor, 1997), which can be seen as an extension of the better known Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1974).The Pitman-Yor process can be understood as a particular example of a process in Chinese restaurants (Pitman, 2002).The idea in all CRPs is that there is a restaurant with an unlimited number of tables. Customers come to the restaurant and have to select a table at which they are seating.The Pitman-Yor process is described by three parameters: a base rate \u03b1, a discount parameter d and an average distribution G0. These combine to describe a process designated by PY (\u03b1, d, G0).The parameters \u03b1 and d must be satisfactory: 0 \u2264 d < 1 and \u03b1 > \u2212 d. In the CRP analogy, the model works as follows: the first customer comes and sits at any table."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Kingman\u2019s Coalescent", "text": "In its full form, it is a distribution over the genealogy of a countable set. Consider the genealogy of n individuals living in the present t = 0. We can trace their ancestry back in time to the distant past t = \u2212 \u221e. Suppose each individual has a parent (in genetics, haploid organisms) and therefore genealogies of [n] = {1,. n} form a controlled forest. Kingman's n-koalescent is simply a distribution over genealogies n individuals. To describe the Markov process in its entirety, it is sufficient to describe the jump process (i.e. the embedded, discrete time, Markov chain over partitions."}, {"heading": "3 A Bayesian Model for Areal Linguistics", "text": "We consider a dataset consisting of N languages and F typological characters. We refer to the value of the character f in language n as Xn, f. For the sake of simplicity, we assume two things: (1) there is no unobserved data, and (2) all characteristics are binary. In practice, none of the data we use (described in Section 4) applies to either. However, both extensions are straightforward. In constructing our model, we try to be as neutral as possible with regard to the questions of \"territorial linguistics\" defined in Section 2.1. We allow areas with only two languages (although we do not show them in the results for brevity). We allow areas with only one family (though we do not present them again). We are generous with our notion of locality, which allows a radius of 1000 kilometers (although we consider Section 5.4 for an analysis of the effect of radius f)."}, {"heading": "3.1 The formal model", "text": "We assume that the value that a trait takes up for a particular language (i.e., the value of Xn, f) can be explained either genetically or spatially. 2 We call this by a binary indicator variable Zn, f, where a value of 1 means \"spatial\" and a value of 0 means \"genetic.\" We assume that each Zn, f is drawn from a characteristic-specific binomial parameter \u03c0f. By having the parameter label-specific, we express the fact that some traits are more or less likely to be shared than others. In other words, a high value of f would mean that trait f is easily spatially divided, while a low value would mean that trait f is difficult to divide. Each language n has a known latitude / longitude. \"We also assume that there are linguistic areas, whereas K is not treated parametrically, but linguistically, using the Pitman-Yor process."}, {"heading": "3.2 Inference", "text": "The only exceptions are: (1) the merger, for which we use the GreedyRate1 algorithm described by Teh et al. (2007); (2) the area centers c, for which we use a Metropolis-Hastings step. Our offer distribution is a Gaussian centering at the previous center with a standard deviation of 5. Experimentally, this resulted in an acceptance rate of about 50%. In our implementation, we integrate p and p analytically and only try via Z, the coalescence tree and the area assignments. In some of our experiments, we treat the family tree as given. In this case, we also integrate the parameters analytically and only try via Z- and area assignments."}, {"heading": "4 Typological Data", "text": "The database on which we are conducting our analysis is the World Atlas of Language Structures (henceforth WALS) (Haspelmath et al., 2005). The database contains information on 2150 languages (samples from all over the world). There are 139 typological features in this database. The database is sparse: only 16% of the possible language / trait pairs are known. We use the version extracted and pre-processed by thumb \u0301 III and Campbell (2007). In WALS, the language family a comprises ten genera, including: German, Romansh, Indian and Slavic. The Austronesian family comprises seventeen genera, including: Borneo, Oceanic, Palauan and Sundian. In total, there are 275 genera included in most known WALS data."}, {"heading": "5.1 Identifying Language Areas", "text": "In both cases, we use a known pedigree (for the IE experiment, we use a tree given by the language genre structure; for the experiment around the world, we use a tree given by the language genre structure of man. In the experiment around the world, we identify a tree given by the language family structure of man. We perform each experiment with five random restarts and 2000 iterations. We select the configuration of the MAP from the combination of these runes. In the IE experiment, we identify the areas shown in Figure 5.1. The best area identified by our model is the second, which clearly correlates with the Balkans. There are two areas identified by our model (the first and last), which comprise only Indian and Iranian languages. While we are unaware of previous studies of these as linguistic areas, they are not implausible (Indian) given (Indian) (Bairabi, Panjpuri, Kaljari, Sinjarati, Sinjai, Sinjarati, Nepal, Darashai, Kashai, Hindu."}, {"heading": "5.2 Identifying Areal Features", "text": "Our second experiment is an analysis of traits that tend to be regionally divided (as opposed to genetically). For this experiment, we use the entire world version of the data, also with a known linguistic family structure. We initialize a Gibbs sampler from the MAP configuration found in Section 5.1. We run the sampler for 1000 iterations and take samples every ten steps. From a specific sample, we can estimate a posterior distribution over each of them. Based on this beta distribution, we can ask the question: What is the probability that a value of the \"bet\" taken from this distribution (1 + \u2211 n Zn, f, 1 + \u2211 n [1 \u2212 Zn, f] will have a posterior distribution (1 \u2212 Zn,) that a value drawn from this distribution will have a value < 0.5? If this value is high, then the trait is probably a \"genetic trait\"; if it is low, then the trait is hierarchical."}, {"heading": "5.3 Genetic Reconstruction", "text": "s coalescence (see Section 2.2.2) as a probabilistic model of trees endowed with a binomial mutation process in terms of language characteristics. Our basic model is to execute the vanilla coalescence on the WALS data that reproduce the results of Teh et al. (2007), a method that has already been demonstrated to outperform competing hierarchical clustering algorithms such as agglomeration (see, Duda and Hart) and the reproduction of the results presented by Teh et al."}, {"heading": "5.4 Effect of Radius", "text": "Finally, we evaluate the influence of the radius hyperparameter on performance. Table 5 shows the performance of models with different radii. As purity and sub-tree values show, there is a \"sweet spot\" at a distance of 500 to 1000 kilometers where the model appears optimal. LOO (strangely) seems to continue to improve as we allow areas to become arbitrary in size."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "We have presented a model that is capable of restoring known linguistic areas. By using these areas, we have shown improvements in the ability to restore family trees of languages. It is important to note that, despite our successes, our model does not take into account many things: borrowing is known as asymmetrical; contact is temporary; borrowing must obey universal implications. However, although our model does not take these problems into account, it appears to be largely successful. Moreover, like any \"data mining\" expedition, our model suggests new linguistic areas (especially in experiments \"all over the world\") that should be considered."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Many thanks to Lyle Campbell, Yee Whye Teh and Eric Xing for the discussions; comments from the three anonymous reviewers were very helpful; this work was partially supported by NSF funding IIS0712764."}], "references": [{"title": "Areal diffusion and genetic inheritance: problems in comparative linguistics", "author": ["Alexandra Aikhenvald", "R.M.W.
