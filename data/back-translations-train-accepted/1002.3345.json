The query q reveals some adversarially chosen elements r (h) defined by the modular cost function c. In the precise active learning problem, the objective h is to be identified by questions.

A simpler strategy is to solve these two problems in series (i.e. first to identify h and then to identify h using the standard coverage algorithm and secondly to solve the submodular coverage problem for coverage).We show that this approach, and indeed any approach that accurately identifies h, can work very poorly. Therefore, it is important to look at the learning problem and the coverage problem at the same time. Theorem 3. Let's assume that H is integral to all h and that \u03b1 is an integer. Any algorithm that accurately identifies the h problem has an approximation ratio of at least H (H | maxi c (qi) / mini c (qi)))."}, {"heading": "6.3 Adaptivity Gap", "text": "Another simple approach is to ignore feedback and solve the coverage problem for all h-H. We call this the Cover-All Method. This method is an example of a non-adaptive method: A non-adaptive (i.e. non-interactive) method is any method that does not use answers to previous questions to decide which question to ask next. The Adaptivity Gap [6] for a problem describes how much worse the best non-adaptive method can be compared to the best adaptive method. For interactive submodular coverage, we define the adaptivity gap as the maximum ratio between the cost of the optimal non-adaptive strategy and the optimal adaptive strategy. With this definition, we can show that unlike related problems [1] where the adaptivity gap is a constant, the adaptivity gap for interactive submodular coverage is quite large.

In this problem, we are primarily given a graph and H is a series of possibly overlapping clusters of nodes. The goal is to find a small group of nodes that simultaneously form a dominant group of initially unknown target groups h-o-H. After selecting each node, we get a feedback indicating whether the selected node in the target group (Simultaneous Learning and Covering) simultaneously forms a dominant target group h-o and finds a dominant set for it. We compare two fundamentals: a method that first identifies accurately and then finds a dominant set for the target group (Learn then Cover) and a method that simply finds a dominating set for uniting all clusters (Cover All). Note that Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 apply to the coverage of all applicable methods, so these have no theoretical guarantees."}, {"heading": "8 Future Work", "text": "We believe that there are other interesting applications that can be used as an interactive submodular set envelope. In some applications, it may be difficult to calculate F-\u03b1 accurately because H can be very large or even infinite. In these cases, it may be possible to approximate this function by scanning H. It is also important to consider methods that can deal with incorrectly stated hypotheses classes and noise within learning. One approach might be to extend agnostic active learning [2] to a similar interactive optimization environment."}, {"heading": "A Additional Experiments", "text": "In the first group of results, we use a Class H hypothesis, which consists of 100 randomly selected geodetic balls of radius 2 (balls). Each group h-H is formed by selecting a node equally randomly from the diagram and then finding all nodes within a shortest path of 2. Target group h is then randomly selected from H. Using this Hypothesis class, we found that there is very little difference between the simultaneous learning and covering methods and then covering the learning methods, similar to the cluster hypothesis class in Table 1. Learning is then better covered on 3 of the 5 data sets, but the difference is very small (about 1 query). Coverage of all method results again significantly worse, because it must find a dominating group of all 100 geodesic balls. In the second group of results, Noisy balls, we use a Hypothesis class similar to the Noisy Cluster Hypothesis class."}], "references": [{"title": "Stochastic submodular maximization", "author": ["A.
