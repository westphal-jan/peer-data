Many different algorithms have been proposed for the propagation of compulsion (Leconte 1996; Puget 1998)."}, {"heading": "Formal background", "text": "We write D (X) for the range of values for X, lb (X) (X)) for the smallest (largest) value in D (X).

There is a class of problems where the enforcement of BC on OVERLAPPINGALLDIFF immediately detects dissatisfaction, while a search method that forces DC to decompose into ALLDIFFERENT constraints explores an exponential search tree regardless of the branch.

We compared the performance of DC, BC (LopezOrtiz et al. 2003) propagators and our decomposition into constraints (3) - (12) for the OVERLAPPINGALLDIFF constraint (OBC). We used randomly generated problems with three global constraints: ALLDIFFERENT (X-W), ALLDIFFERENT (Y-W) and ALLDIFFERENT (Z-W), as well as a linear number of binary order relationships between variables in X, Y and Z. We used a random variable order and executed each instance with 50 different seeds. As shown in Table 1, our decomposition significantly reduces the search space and solves more cases overall."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This generalization suggests a polynomial time algorithm to find a concurrent agreement in a convex bilateral graph. We have applied this to a problem in constraint programming of propagating conjunctions of ALLDIFFERENT constraints. Initial experimental results suggest that thinking about such conjunctions can significantly reduce the size of the search space studied. There are several possibilities for future research. For example, the algorithmic techniques proposed in (Puget 1998) and (LopezOrtiz et al. 2003) can be generalized to simultaneous bilateral linkages, resulting in more efficient multipliers. Furthermore, matchings are used to propagate other constraints such as NVALUE (Bessiere et al 2006) when it is otherwise possible to apply similar insights to develop multipliers for conjunctions of other global constraints, or to improve existing multiplication repositories for specific cases, such as 2008."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research is supported by the ANR UNLOC project (ANR 08-BLAN-0289-01), the Australian Department of Broadband, Communications and Digital Economy and the ARC."}], "references": [{"title": "Filtering algorithms for the NVALUE", "author": ["Bessiere"], "venue": "constraint.
