DLD09's finding was to use negative polarity elements (NPIs), which are words or phrases that occur only in negative contexts, because Ladusaw's hypothesis [7, 13] claims that NPIs only occur within the framework of DE operators. Figure 1 shows examples of the use of the English NPIs \"any\" 5 and \"have a clue\" (in the idiomatic sense) that illustrate this relationship. Some other English NPIs are \"ever\" and give a damn. \"Thus, NPIs can be seen as a reference point for the presence of a DE operator (although DE operators may also occur without NPIs).We base different outcomes from three extremely formatted channels."}, {"heading": "3 Getting a clue", "text": "In this section, we develop an iterative colearning algorithm that can extract DE operators in the many languages where a high-quality NPI6DLD09 policy applies: (a) \"NPI context\" was defined as part of the sentence left of the NPI to the first comma, semicolon or beginning of the sentence; (b) to encourage the discovery of new DE operators, these sentences, which contained one of 10 known DE operators, were discarded. In Romanian, we only treated negations (\"nu\" and \"n\") and questions as known environments.7DLD09 used an additional distilled score, but we found that the distilled score performed worse in Romanian.8http: / / www-personal.umich.edu / \u0445 jlawler / aue / npi.htmldatabase is not available, with Romanian being the best case study."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data and evaluation paradigm", "text": "We used Rada Mihalcea's corpus of approximately 1.45 million sets of Romanian newspaper articles. Note that we cannot evaluate the impact on textual conclusions because, to our knowledge, there is no publicly available text tracking system or rating data for Romanian. Therefore, we examine system outputs directly to determine whether the top rated items are actually DE operators or not. Our rating metric is accurate on the K of the ranking of DE operators of a given system; an evaluation of the recall is not possible because there is no list of Romanian DE operators (a problem that is precisely the motivation for this work). To evaluate the results, two Romanian native speakers referred to the system outputs as \"DE,\" \"\" not DE \"or\" Hard (to decide). \"The marking protocol, which was somewhat complex to avoid bias, is described in the externally available appendices (Section 7.1): The full 2010 system edition and available at http: / www.nell.cor."}, {"heading": "3.2 Generating a seed set", "text": "Although, as discussed above, the translation of an NPI need not be an NPI, a preliminary review of the literature indicates that in many languages there is an NPI that can be translated as \"arbitrary\" or related forms such as \"arbitrary.\" Thus, with little effort, one can form a minimal NPI seed set for the DLD09 method by using an appropriate target language translation of \"arbitrary.\" In Romanian, we used \"vreo\" and \"vreun,\" the female and male translations of the English \"any.\""}, {"heading": "3.3 DLD09 using the Romanian seed set", "text": "We will first check whether DLD09 performs well with the bipolar seed set described in paragraph 3.2 in Romanian. In fact, the results are quite poor: the accuracy is, for example, 30% below 50%. (See blue / dark bars in Figure 3 in the externally available appendices for detailed results.) This relatively unsatisfactory performance could be a consequence of the very small size of the NPI list used and could therefore indicate that it would be fruitful to investigate an automatic extension of our reference list."}, {"heading": "3.4 Main idea: a co-learning approach", "text": "Our main finding is that not only can NPIs be used as a guide to finding DE operators, as shown by DLD09, but vice versa, DE operators (if known) can potentially be used to detect new NPI-like cues that we call pseudo-NPIs (or PNPIs for short periods of time). By \"NPI-like,\" we mean \"to serve as possible indicators of the presence of DE operators, regardless of whether they are actually limited to negative contexts, such as real NPIs.\" For example, the words \"allegation\" or \"rumor\" tend to occur mainly in DE contexts, such as \"denied\" or \"dismissed,\" even though they are clearly not real NPIs. \"Given this finding, we are approaching an iterative co-learning paradigm that extends the search for new DE operators."}, {"heading": "4 Romanian results", "text": "Our results show that there is indeed a favorable synergy between the DE operator and the pNPI retrieval. Figure 2 shows the number of correctly retrieved DE operators in the top k outputs at each iteration. The point at iteration 0 corresponds to a data point already discussed above, namely DLD09, which is applied to the two \"arbitrarily\" translatable NPIs. Clearly, we see a general significant improvement over DLD09, even if the increases decrease in later iterations. (Determining the optimal number of iterations is the subject of future research.) Further experiments described in the externally available appendices (\u00a7 7.2) suggest that pNPIs may be even more effective clues than a noisy list of NPIs. (Therefore, a larger seed set does not necessarily mean better performance.) pNPIs also have the advantage of being automatically derivable, and may be worth a linguistic examination from your own perspective."}, {"heading": "5 Cross-linguistic analysis", "text": "In fact, it is such that most people who are able to feel able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves, \"he said in an interview with the\" New York Times. \"He added:\" I don't think we will be able to change the world, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we will be able to change the world, and that we will be able to change the world, and that we will be able to live in which we will be able to live, and that we will be able to live in which we will be able to live, in which we will be able to live, in which we will be able to live, in which we will be able to live, in which we will be able to live, in which we will be able to live, in which we will be able to live, in which we will be able to live, in which we will be able to live, in which we will be able to live, in which we will be able to live, that we will be able to live, that we will be able to live, that we will be able to live, that we will live, that we will live, that we will live, that we will live, that we will live, that we live, that we will live, that we"}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "Previous work on automatic detection of DE operators has assumed the existence of a high-quality collection of NPIs that renders them inapplicable in most languages where such a resource does not exist. We overcome this limitation by using a novel co-learning approach and demonstrate their effectiveness in Romania.We also introduce the concept of pseudo-NPIs. Auxiliary experiments described in the externally available appendices show that pNPIs are actually more effective than a loud \"true\" NPI list.

We chose distractors that resembled real system outputs so that the distractors did not appear to be \"unusual.\" The combined collection was presented in a random order to two native Romanian speakers (one author, one not) whose task was to designate each element as either \"DE,\" \"not DE,\" or \"hard,\" meaning \"hard to decide,\" and to justify their choice by providing a follow-up example of the kind we discussed in the introduction. Judges were informed of the presence of distractors; this served to protect themselves from the judges not recognizing only the \"DE\" label. We should mention that the annotation process was very time-consuming because the generalization of the number of examples we might get may be quite difficult."}, {"heading": "7.2 Re-ranking marginal NPIs", "text": "In this case, it is as if it is a reactionary party that is able to put itself at the head of the party."}, {"heading": "7.4 Corrigendum", "text": "In the procedural version, we overlooked the fact that the concept of pseudo-NPIs had previously been discussed by Hoeksema.
