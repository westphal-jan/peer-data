We present a theoretical framework for discovering statistically significant lexical co-occurrences from a given corpus.

We detect biases in span distributions of associated words, while being agnostic to variations in global unigram frequencies. Our framework has the fidelity to distinguish different classes of lexical co-occurrences, based on strengths of the document and corpuslevel cues of co-occurrence in the data. We perform extensive experiments on benchmark data sets to study the performance of various co-occurrence measures that are currently known in literature. We find that a relatively obscure measure called Ochiai, and a newly introduced measure CSA capture the notion of lexical co-occurrence best, followed next by LLR, Dice, and TTest, while another popular measure, PMI, suprisingly, performs poorly in the context of lexical co-occurrence.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 Aug 2010 11:37:32 GMT  (82kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.5287v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["dipak chaudhari", "om p damani", "srivatsan laxman"], "accepted": true, "id": "1008.5287"}, "pdf": {"name": "1008.5287.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Lexical Co-occurrence, Statistical Significance, and Word Association", "authors": ["Dipak Chaudhari", "Om P.

A small percentage of documents correspond to a strong document-level hypothesis and vice versa. We control the reliability of our decision in the face of all documents in the data corpus. A small percentage of documents essentially determines the strength of the document-level hypothesis in our test. A small percentage of documents correspond to a strong document-level hypothesis and vice versa.

A small percentage represents a high reliability (in the sense that there is a surprisingly large number of documents in the corpus)."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Datasets and Text Corpus", "text": "Since similarity and kinship are different types of word associations (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006), in (Agirre et al., 2009) two different data sets, namely 203 words sim (the union of similar and unrelated pairs) and 252 words rel (the union of related and unrelated pairs) are derived from Wordsim (Finkelstein et al., 2002). We also use these two data sets in our experiments. These data sets are symmetrical, since the order of words in a pair should not matter. As some of our chosen contemporaneous scales are asymmetrical, we also report on the results of the asymmetrical 272-word esslli data set for the task of \"free association\" (ESSLLLI, 2008).We use the Wikipedia (Wikipedia, April 2008) corpus in our experiments. It contains 2.7 million articles for a total size of 1.24 gigawords.
