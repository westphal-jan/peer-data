Introduction", "text": "Significant advances have been made in the scaling of plan synthesis techniques in recent years. We now have a technology that generates plans with hundreds of actions, but all of this work makes one crucial assumption - that a complete model of the domain is defined in advance. While there are areas where knowledge engineering makes such detailed models necessary and feasible (e.g., mission planning domains in NASA and factory planning), it is increasingly recognized (Hoffmann, Weber and Kraft 2007) that there are also many scenarios where insisting on correct and complete models renders current planning technology useless. What we need is a planning technology that can handle partially specified domain models and still generate plans that are \"robust\" in the sense that they are successful in the real and complete world."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "Although there has been some work to reduce the \"errors\" in plan execution (e.g. work on the non-deterministic planning error plans (Jensen, Veloso and Bryant 2004)), it is based on the context of stochastic / non-deterministic actions and not on incompletely specified ones. Semantics of the possible preconditions / effects in our incomplete domain models are fundamentally different from non-deterministic and stochastic effects. Otherwise, if the effects of the pick-up action are stochastical, trying out the same pick-up action multiple times in the Gripper example above increases the chances of success. Garland & Lesh (2002) share the same goal of generating robust plans among incomplete domain models."}, {"heading": "3. Problem Formulation", "text": "We define an incomplete model D as D = < F, A >, where F = > a > Conditions (P1, P2,..., Pn) is a set of suggestions, A is a set of actions that could be incompletely specified. < D = > Conditions (P1, Pn) is a set of suggestions that are known as their preconditions. < D (a) Add effects (a) F and delete effects Del (a) F, each action also contains: \u2022 Possible precondition of P (a) F contains predictions that an action may be necessary as its preconditions. \u2022 Possible predictions add (a) F (a) F (a) el (a) F) contains predictions that the action may add one (delete) after its execution."}, {"heading": "4. A Robustness Measure for Plans", "text": "Faced with an incomplete planning problem P = < D > dd, I, G > > (according to our definition), a valid plan (according to our definition) must succeed only in at least one completion of the plan. < D = 0.5 Failure can be prevented exponentially in terms of possible conditions and effects, but the validity of a plan is too weak to guarantee the quality of the plan. What we need is an idea that the completion of the plan is successful in most of the most likely completions of the plan. We do this in terms of a robustness measurement. The robustness of a plan is defined as the cumulative probability measure of the completion of plan P under which the completion of the plan is successful (in achieving the goals). Formally, let Pr (Di) represent the probability distribution representing the estimation of the probability that a given model in < < D > > > is the model of the completion of the plan."}, {"heading": "4.1 A Spectrum of Robust Planning Problems", "text": "In light of this lineup, we can now talk about a range of planning-related problems under incomplete domain models: Testing Robustness (RA): Considering a plan with the desired degree of robustness (RGR): Considering a problem P value and a robustness threshold (0 < B value): Creating a plan p value with greater robustness than or equal to its value (RG value): Considering a problem P value and a cost-related c, create a plan p value of maximum robustness subject to cost-related c value (where the cost of a plan p value is defined as the cumulative cost of actions in RG value). Considering a problem P value and a cost-related c plan, we can create a plan."}, {"heading": "5. Compilation to Conformant Probabilistic Planning", "text": "In this section, we will show that the problem of generating a plan with at least \u03c1 robustness, RG\u03c1, can be merged into an equivalent probabilistic planning problem, and the most robust plan can then be found with a sequence of rising thresholds."}, {"heading": "5.1 Conformant Probabilistic Planning", "text": "According to the formalism in (Domshlak and Hoffmann 2007), a domain in the state of conformity b = \"probabilistic planning\" (CPP) is a \"tuple D\" = < F, \"A\" >, where \"F\" and \"A\" are the sentences of proposals and \"probabilistic actions.\" A state of belief b: 2F \"\u2192 [0, 1] is a distribution of the states s\" F \"(we mean\" s \"b,\" if b \"(s) > 0).

Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we emphasized the need to synthesize robust plans under incomplete domain models; we introduced notes expressing domain incompleteness; formalized the notion of planning certainty; and demonstrated an approach to transferring the problem of creating robust plans to compliant probabilistic planning; we presented empirical results that reflect the promise of our approach; and for future work, we developed a planning approach that incorporates the incompleteness notes directly into the search and compares them with our current method of creation; we also plan to consider the issue of robustness of a given plan subject to a projected cost limit.
