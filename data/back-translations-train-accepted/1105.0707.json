Coalitions enable agents to achieve goals that they may not have been able to achieve on their own. Previous work has shown problems in coalitional games to be computationally hard. Wooldridge and Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 2006) studied the classical computational complexity of several natural decision problems in Coalitional Resource Games (CRG) - games in which each agent is endowed with a set of resources and coalitions can bring about a set of goals if they are collectively endowed with the necessary amount of resources. The input of coalitional resource games bundles together several elements, e.g., the agent set Ag, the goal set G, the resource set R, etc. Shrot, Aumann and Kraus (AAMAS 2009) examine coalition formation problems in the CRG model using the theory of Parameterized Complexity. Their refined analysis shows that not all parts of input act equal - some instances of the problem are indeed tractable while others still remain intractable.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 May 2011 23:03:52 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0707v1", "This is the full version of a paper that will appear in the proceedings of AAAI 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "This is the full version of a paper that will appear in the proceedings of AAAI 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.GT", "authors": ["rajesh hemant chitnis", "mohammadtaghi hajiaghayi", "vahid liaghat"], "accepted": true, "id": "1105.0707"}, "pdf": {"name": "1105.0707.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Parameterized Complexity of Problems in Coalitional Resource Games", "authors": ["Rajesh Chitnis", "MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi", "Vahid Liaghat"], "emails": ["rchitnis@cs.umd.edu", "hajiagha@cs.umd.edu", "vliaghat@cs.umd.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 110 5.07 07v1 [cs.AI] 3M ayWe answer an important question that Shrot, Aumann and Kraus have left open by showing that the SC problem (verifying whether a coalition is successful) is W [1] -hard when parameterized by the size of the coalition.

Coalitions allow actors to achieve goals that they may not be able to achieve individually. Therefore, understanding and predicting the dynamics of coalitions, such as which coalitions are more advantageous and / or more likely, is a matter of considerable interest in multi-agent constellations. Unfortunately, a number of previous studies have shown that many of these problems are mathematically complex [7, 8]. Nevertheless, hardship results, as Garey and Johnson [4] noted, should only be the beginning of research. NP hardness merely indicates that a general solution to all cases of the problem most likely does not exist. Nevertheless, efficient solutions for important subclasses may well exist."}, {"heading": "1.2 Formal Model of Coalition Resource Games", "text": "The framework we use to model coalitions is the CRG model introduced in [8], defined as follows. The model contains a non-empty, finite amount Ag = {a1,... a coalition, typically referred to by C, is simply a set of agents, i.e. a subset of Ag. The Grand Coalition is the set of all agents, Ag. There is also a finite set of goals. Each actor i. \"Ag\" is associated with a subset of goals. Agent i is satisfied if at least one member of Gi is reached, and dissatisfied otherwise. Achieving the goals requires the expenditure of resources drawn from the totality of resource types. Achieving different goals may require different quantities of each resource type. The quantity req (g, r) denotes the amount of resources r that is required to achieve the goal g. It is assumed that Req (r) is not a resource type. \"Each\" G \""}, {"heading": "2 Problem Definitions and Previous Work", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Problems Related to Coalition Formation", "text": "Shrot et al.

A resource is considered necessary when achieving a number of goals that are successful for the coalition would require non-zero use of that resource. So, if a necessary resource is scarce, then the actors who own the resource become important. We look at the NECESSARY REQUEL problem: If a coalition gives C and a resource r answer YES, if and only if req (G, r) > 0 for all G'succ (C).

Coalitions enable agents to achieve goals that they may not have been able to achieve on their own. Previous work has shown problems in coalition games to be computationally hard. Wooldridge and Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 2006) studied the classical computational complexity of several natural decision problems in Coalitional Resource Games (CRG) games in which each agent is endowed with a set of resources and coalitions can bring about a set of goals if they are collectively endowed with the necessary amount of resources. The input of coalitional resource games bundles together several elements, e.g., the agent set Ag, the goal set G, the resource set R, etc. Shrot, Aumann and Kraus (AAMAS 2009) examine coalition formation problems in the CRG model using the theory of Parameterized Complexity. Their refined analysis shows that not all parts of input act equal some instances of the problem are indeed tractable while others still remain intractable. We answer an important question left open by Shrot, Aumann and Kraus by showing that the SC Problem (checking whether a Coalition is Successful) is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of the coalition. Then via a single theme of reduction from SC, we are able to show that various problems related to resources, resource bounds and resource conflicts introduced by Wooldridge et al are 1. W[1]-hard or co-W[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of the coalition. 2. para-NP-hard or co-para-NP-hard when parameterized by |R|. 3. FPT when parameterized by either |G| or |Ag|+ |R|. \u2217Supported in part by Google Faculty Research Award, ONR Young Investigator Award and NSF CAREER award. \u2020Department of Computer Science , University of Maryland at College Park, USA, email: rchitnis@cs.umd.edu \u2021Department of Computer Science , University of Maryland at College Park, USA. email: hajiagha@cs.umd.edu \u00a7Department of Computer Science , University of Maryland at College Park, USA. email: vliaghat@cs.umd.edu", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
