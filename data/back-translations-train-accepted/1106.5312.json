While there has been a very active research community in Melbourne that has investigated these kinds of questions for well-known electoral rules such as plurality and Borda, there are other, less well-known rules that might merit attention. Specifically, we are putting forward two historical electoral rules that stem from Nanson and Baldwin related to Borda elections. There are several reasons to consider these two rules. First, they have features that might appeal to the two opposing camps that support Borda and Condorcet. Specifically, both rules are consistent with Condorcet, since they elect the candidate who beats everyone else in paired elections. Secondly, both rules are elimination procedures in which the candidates are successively removed. Other elimination procedures such as STV and plurality in runoff elections are consistent because they elect the candidate who beats everyone else."}, {"heading": "Preliminaries", "text": "A linear order on C is a transitive, antisymmetrical, and total relationship on C. The set of all linear orders on C is denoted by L (C. An n-voter profile P on C consists of n-linear orders on C. That is, P = (V1,...) is a function that assigns each profile on C to a unique winning candidate, i.e., r: F1, F2 (C). In this paper, m is specified as the number of candidates. (We let m specify the number of candidates.) A (deterministic) voting rule r is a function that maps each profile on C to a unique winning candidate, i.e., r: F1, F2 (C). In this paper, bonds in the fixed order c1 \u00b7 c2 cm aligers are broken."}, {"heading": "Nanson\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s Rules", "text": "The Borda Rule has several good features, such as it is monotonous, since increasing the score for a candidate only contributes to his winning. Moreover, it never votes for the Condorcet loser (a candidate who loses to everyone else in a head-to-head election), whereas the rules of Nanson and Baldwin always choose the Condorcet winner when there is one. Nanson and Baldwin's rules are derived from the Borda Rule. Nanson's rule eliminates all candidates with less than the average Borda score (Nanson 1882), and then repeats the rule with the reduced number of candidates until there is a single candidate. A closely related electoral rule proposed by Baldwin eliminates the candidate with the lowest Borda score until a candidate remains (Baldwin 1926). The two rules are closely linked and sometimes even confused."}, {"heading": "Unweighted Manipulation", "text": "We start by considering the arithmetic complexity of the two electoral rules applied in practice when we know several candidates. We prove that the coalitional manipulation problem NP-complete for both rules is even with a single manipulator. (We prove that the problem of manipulation NP-complete for both rules, even with a single manipulator. (We prove, if there are two or more manipulators, that there is unweighted coalitional manipulation for some other common electoral rules (Faliszewski, Hemaspaandra and Schnoor 2008) and ranking pairs (Xia et al. 2010). Xia, Conitzer and Procaccia 2010; Davies et al. 2011; Betzler, Niedermeier and Woeginger 2011).

We have therefore considered five approximation methods that are derived either from the methods used with Borda, or that are specifically designed for eliminating candidates who have the rules of Borda's and Baldwin's rulesse.REVERSE was used to manipulate the Borda rule (Zuckerman, Procaccia, Procaccia and Rosenschein 2009).LARGESTFIT: This method was proposed for the Borda rule (Davies et al). Unlike REVERSE, which constructs votes from one, we construct votes in any order, we construct votes in any order that puts the next largest Borda score in the \"best\" vote available."}, {"heading": "Experimental Results", "text": "To test the difficulty of calculating manipulations in practice and the effectiveness of these approximation methods, we conducted some experiments with a similar setup (Walsh 2010). We generated either uniform random votes or votes from a Polya Eggenberger urns model. In the urns model, votes are drawn randomly and are put back into the ballot box along with other votes of the same type. This captures different degrees of social homogeneity. We have a = m! so there is a 50% chance that the second vote is the same as the first. Our first experiments were conducted with 3000 candidates and 5 non-tampering voters."}, {"heading": "Other Related Work", "text": "Bag, Sabourian, & Winter (2009) demonstrate that a class of voting rules that provides for repeated ballots and eliminates one candidate in each round is consistent with Condorcet. They illustrate this class with the weakest-link rule, in which the candidate with the fewest ballots in each round is eliminated. Geller (2005) proposed a variant of a single transferable vote in which candidates are successively eliminated on the basis of their original Borda value. Unlike the rules of Nanson and Baldwin, this method does not recalculate the Borda value on the basis of the new reduced number of candidates; for each uniform Condorcet rule (and thus for the rule of Nanson and Baldwin), Brandt et al. (2010) showed that many types of control and manipulation are polynomic when votes are counted individually."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "With unweighted votes, we have proven that the rules of Nanson and Baldwin are difficult to manipulate with just one manipulator, but with weighted votes, we have proven that the rules of Nanson are difficult to manipulate with only a small number of candidates and a coalition of manipulators.
