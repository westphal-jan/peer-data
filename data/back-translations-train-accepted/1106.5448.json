Such partial information is described by an information set, which is the set of profiles of the nonmanipulators that are indistinguishable to the manipulator. Given such an information set, a dominating manipulation is a non-truthful vote that the manipulator can cast which makes the winner at least as preferable (and sometimes more preferable) as the winner when the manipulator votes truthfully. When the manipulator has full information, computing whether or not there exists a dominating manipulation is in P for many common voting rules (by known results). We show that when the manipulator has no information, there is no dominating manipulation for many common voting rules. When the manipulator's information is represented by partial orders and only a small portion of the preferences are unknown, computing a dominating manipulation is NP-hard for many common voting rules. Our results thus throw light on whether we can prevent strategic behavior by limiting information about the votes of other voters.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Jun 2011 17:10:55 GMT  (31kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5448v1", "7 pages by arxiv pdflatex, 1 figure.

It is not difficult to see that if the manipulator has complete information, the manipulation coincides with the standard manipulation problem. Therefore, our framework of dominant manipulation is an extension of the traditional manipulation problem, and we immediately get the following sentence from the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem (Gibbard 1973; Satterthwaite 1975). Proposal 1."}, {"heading": "Manipulation with Partial Orders", "text": "In this section, we examine the case where the manipulator has partial information about the voices of the non-manipulators, even if the number of voices is unknown in each case. We assume that the information is represented by a profile Ppo consisting of partial commands, that is, the amount of information is E = {P \u00b2 Fn: P expands Ppo}. We note that the two cases discussed in the previous section (complete information and no information) are special cases of manipulation with partial commands. Consequently, from Proposition 1, the information of the manipulator is represented by partial commands and m \u2265 3, no voting rule, the non-imposition and non-dictatorship is immune to dominating manipulation. It follows from Theorem 2 that STV and rank pairs are resistant to dominating manipulation. The next theorem states that the manipulator disregards only a tiny portion of the information, Borda becomes resistant to dominating manipulation."}, {"heading": "Future Work", "text": "An interesting open question is whether there is a more general relationship between the possible winning problem and the dominant tampering problem with sub-commands. It would be interesting to identify cases where the electoral rules are resistant or even immune to tampering based on other types of sub-information, such as the number of possible winners. We can also consider other types of strategic behavior with sub-information within our framework, such as coalitional manipulation, bribery, and control. We are currently working to demonstrate completeness results for higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy for problems that are examined in this paper."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Vincent Conitzer and Lirong Xia acknowledge NSF CAREER 0953756 and IIS-0812113 as well as an Alfred P.
