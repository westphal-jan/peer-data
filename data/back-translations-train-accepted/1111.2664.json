One of the first, and certainly the most well-known, was the Netflix Prize, which was released in the fall of 2006. Netflix, which aims to improve the algorithm used to predict the preferences of users in its database of movies, has sent a dataset of 100M ratings to the public and asked competing teams to submit a list of prediction results that are withheld from the public. Netflix offered $1,000,000 to the first team to exceed a certain threshold, a goal that was finally met. This competitive model for solving a prediction task has been used for a number of similar competitions since, and there is even a new company (kaggle.com) that hosts and hosts such prediction contests has proven to be very valuable for a few important reasons: (a) they use the skills and knowledge sourcing available to the public on a large scale, \"is widely known."}, {"heading": "2 Scoring Rules and Crowdsourced Learning Mecha-", "text": "We begin by discussing the concept of a scoring rule, a well-studied statistical object that produces \"good\" probability predictions [6]. We propose a weaker term, which we call a general scoring rule L (\u00b7, \u00b7), which is intended to reflect the loss function of the learning problem at hand. We then describe the CLM framework, especially the important case when a CLM implements a general scoring rule L. We provide a set of properties and results for L-CLMs."}, {"heading": "2.1 Generalized Scoring Rules", "text": "For the rest of this section, we will make a series of hypotheses that we assume to represent a convex subset of Rn. (D) We will make O recognize any set of results. (D) We will use the X symbol to refer either to an element of O or to a random variable. (D) We will remember the notion of a scoring rule, which is common in economics and statistics. (D) Let P (O) make a convex series of distributions on a result space O. A scoring rule is a function S: P) O \u2192 R, where for all P (P) P (P) an argmaxQ (P).P).In other words, if you are paid S (P), X) based on the statement that P (P) and the result X occur, then maximize your expected Utility by stating your true faith.

However, the goal is to select a binary encoding of that alphabet in such a way as to minimize the total bits required to store the data, since for each Bit.A first-order approach to encoding such a stream, a probability distribution q.n is assigned to the alphabet, and an encoding of the character i with a binary word of length (1 / q) is chosen.

Hanson [7, 8] has proposed a framework in which traders \"report\" to the market on their internal beliefs in the form of a sales guarantee. Each trader would receive a reward (or a loss) based on a function of his proposed faith and the faith of the previous trader, and the function proposed by Hanson was the Logarithmic Market Valuation Rule (LMSR). It was later shown that the LMSR-based market corresponds to what is known as the cost function of automated market makers, proposed by Chen and Pennock. Recently, a much broader equivalence of Chen and Wortman Vaughan [4] between markets based on scoring rules.The market framework proposed by Chen and Pennock allows traders to buy and sell securities."}, {"heading": "TT properties.", "text": "We are now wondering what is the learning problem that APMM participants are trying to solve more precisely when we think of an APMM as a CLM."}, {"heading": "5 Example CLMs for Typical Machine Learning Tasks", "text": "& & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & # 8222; & & # 8222; & & & & # 8222; & & & & # 8222; & & & # 8222; & & # 8222; & & & # 8222; & & & & & # 8222; & & & & & & # 822; & & & & & # 822; & & & & # 822; & & & & & # 822; & & & & & & # 822; & & & & & & # 822; & & & & & # 822; & & & & & # 822; & & & # 8222; & & & & # 8222; & # 8222 & & & & & # 8222; & & # 8222 & & & & & & # 8222; & # 8222 & & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & & # 8222 & # 8222 & & & & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 8222 & # 822 & & # 822 & # 822 & & & & # 822 & & & & # 822 & & # 822 & & & & # 822 & & & # 822 & & & # 822 & & & & # 822 & & & & &"}], "references": [{"title": "An optimization-based framework for automated market-making", "author": ["J.
