If these operations are a single instance, then the elimination of a single variable is one and consists of the elimination of V and the elimination of all operations that are incompatible with a single instance.

If an arc consistent instance I does not contain the pattern P, then it does not contain the pattern P \u2032, which corresponds to P, in which the dangling point a and the corresponding compatibility edge have been deleted. Thus, since arc consistency is a polynomic time operation that cannot introduce a prohibited pattern, we need only look at patterns without dots dangling. Definition 7. We say that a pattern P can be reduced to a pattern Q, and that Q is a reduction of P if Q is applied to P in the transitive closure of the three operations extension, merger, and dp elimination, where dp elimination is the following operation: dp elimination is the elimination of two points and the corresponding compatibility edge of P is transformed. Example: P. If two patterns are Q and two patterns are reduced to QP, QP can be reduced to QP."}, {"heading": "4 One-constraint patterns", "text": "In this section, we will prove a dichotomy for patterns consisting of a single constraint. We will also assume that some results relating to 1-constraint patterns that are essential for proving the 2-constraint dichotomy, in Section 5.Lemma 3. Let P be a pattern that a constraint in P contains two different incompatibility edges that cannot be merged. Let SAT1 specify the number of SAT incompatibility edges with at most one precomma. Let SAT1 specify the number of SAT instances with one precomma each. Let SAT1 be a variable in each clause. SAT1 is trivially equivalent to SAT, which is well known to be NP-complete. It is sufficient to give a polynomial reduction from SAT1 to CSP."}, {"heading": "5 Two-Constraint patterns", "text": "Let T apply the following pattern to two constraints. Then, P is portable only if there are two patterns: T1 T3T4 T5No pattern in T cannot be reduced to another pattern in T. As we will show, each Ti can be considered a tractable class of binary CSP instances as a generalization of 2SAT clauses to polyvalent logic. Let 2I represent the pattern consisting of two separate copies of 1I, i.e. four points a, b, c, d so that var (b), var (c), var (d) are all distinguishable and both a, b and c, d are pairs of incompatible dots. Let P be a pattern to two constraints."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "One possibility for future research is to investigate the possible generalizations of the five tractable classes defined by prohibition patterns T1,..., T5.
