We consider whether, and how, the way in which the information is phrased --- the choice of words and sentence structure --- can affect this process. To this end, we develop an analysis framework and build a corpus of movie quotes, annotated with memorability information, in which we are able to control for both the speaker and the setting of the quotes. We find significant differences between memorable and non-memorable quotes in several key dimensions. One is lexical distinctiveness: in aggregate, memorable quotes use less common word choices, but at the same time are built upon a scaffolding of common syntactic patterns; another is that memorable quotes tend to be more general in ways that make them easy to apply in new contexts. We also show how the concept of \"memorable language\" can be extended across domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Mar 2012 20:00:20 GMT  (32kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6360v1", "To appear at ACL 2012. 10pp, 1 fig.

[8] In the following, we construct a corpus consisting of all the lines of about 1000 movies that differ in genre, era, and popularity; for each movie, we then extract the list of memorable quotes from IMDb's page corresponding to the movie. 1A memorable quote in IMDb can appear either as an individual sentence spoken by a character, or as a block of dialogues with several characters. In the latter two cases, it can be difficult to determine which part is considered memorable (some include a build-up to a punch line; others include the sequence through a well-formulated opening sentence), and so in our comparisons we focus on these memorable quotes, which we typed some edit-distance-based alignment, since the exact shape of the line in the version."}, {"heading": "2.2 Pilot study: Human performance", "text": "As a preliminary consideration, we conducted a small pilot study to see if people could distinguish memorable quotes from non-memorable quotes, using our IMDBinduced labels as the gold standard. Six subjects, all native English speakers and no author of this work, were presented with 11 or 12 pairs of memorable and non-memorable quotes; again, we checked for extra-textual effects by ensuring that in each pair the two quotes are from the same movie, of the same character, have the same length, and appear as close as possible in the same scene. (This means that each subject saw a different set of quotes within pairs.) In addition, the subjects were asked not to consult external sources of information."}, {"heading": "2.3 Incorporating search engine counts", "text": "So far, we have discussed a data set in which memory capacity is determined by an explicit label obtained from IMDb. Given the \"production aspect\" of memory capacity discussed in Section 1, we should also expect that memorable quotes tend to appear more extensively on websites than unthinkable quotations, and this is something we can estimate based on the results provided by a search engine. Therefore, it makes sense to try to use these quotes as a second indication of memory value. We experimented with various ways of constructing memory capacity information from search engines, but this proved difficult. Finding a quote as a standalone phrase leads to the problem that a number of quotations are also sentences that people use without the movie in mind, and such high counts for such quotes do not attest to the status of the phrase as an unforgettable quote from the movie. On the other hand, searching for the quote is a distinct phrase in a conjunction with the title."}, {"heading": "3 Never send a human to do a machine\u2019s job.", "text": "We are now discussing experiments that examine the hypotheses discussed in paragraph 1. In particular, we are developing methods to assess the distinctiveness and universality of hypotheses and to test whether there is an idea of \"memorable language\" that works across domains. Furthermore, we are evaluating and comparing the predictive power of these hypotheses."}, {"heading": "3.1 Distinctiveness", "text": "One of the hypotheses we are examining is whether the use of language in memorable quotations is unusual to a certain extent. To quantify the degree to which a quote is distinguishable, we take an approach to the language model: We model the \"common language\" using the message wire sections of the Brown corpus [21] 5 and assess how distinctive a quote is by assessing its probability in relation to that model - the lower the probability, the more distinctive. To assess different levels of lexical and syntactical distinctness, we use a total of six laplace6 language models: 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram word LMs and 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram part-of Speaker7 LMs. We find strong evidence that memorable quotations from a lexical perspective are more distinctive than their unthinkable counterparts. As shown in Table 3, tactical quotations are tactically aligned with each other."}, {"heading": "3.2 Generality", "text": "Another of our hypotheses is that memorable quotes are easier to use outside the specific context in which they were pronounced and therefore have fewer terms that refer to those contexts. As a substitute for the generality of a quote, we use the following syntactic standards: \u2022 Personal pronouns usually refer to a person introduced earlier in the discourse. \u2022 Indeterminate articles such as a and an refer to general concepts rather than defined articles and are therefore considered more generally. \u2022 Past verbs refer to specific past events rather than present verbs, and thus expressions that use less general terms than defined articles show."}, {"heading": "3.3 \u201cMemorable\u201d language beyond movies", "text": "One of the motivating questions in our analysis is whether there are general principles underlying the \"unforgettable language,\" and the results so far point to potential families of such principles. Another question in this direction is whether the concept of memorization can be extended to various areas, and for that we have collected (and distributed on our website) 431 phrases that were explicitly designed to be memorable: advertising slogans (e.g., \"Quality never goes out of style.\") The focus on slogans is also consistent with one of the original motivations for the study of memorization, namely marketing applications - in other words, assessing whether a proposed slogan has features that match with memorable text. The fact that it is not clear how a collection of \"not memorable\" counterparts to slogans appears to be a technical challenge, namely marketing applications - in other words, assessing whether the proposed slogan's features match with the memorably."}, {"heading": "3.4 Prediction task", "text": "We will now show how the principles discussed above can provide characteristics for a basic predictive task that matches the task in our human pilot study: If there is no information in the text content of a quote to determine whether it is memorable, then an SVM using features from bag words should not perform better than chance. Instead, however, it achieves an accuracy of 59.67% (10-fold cross-validation), as in Table 7. We will then develop models that use features based on the standards previously formulated in this section: generality measures (the four listed in Table 4); labeling measures (probability according to 1, 2, and 3-gram models of \"common language\" at the lexical level and part of the language level for each quote, their differences, and pairs of comparisons between them."}, {"heading": "3.5 Other characteristics", "text": "In addition to the results in support of the two above-mentioned principles, we also describe some freestanding observations on the characteristics of memorable quotes compared to unmemorable ones; we consider them fascinating observations, which can ultimately combine with larger theories through some of the psychological work on memorable text discussed in \u00a7 4. Specifically, we find differences in the letter and8We have rejected terms that occur less than 10 times. Tone distribution (e.g. memorable quotations - after the removal of curse words - use considerably more \"foretones\" (labial or foreground vowels, as represented by the letter i) and significantly less \"backtones,\" as represented by u), word complexity (e.g. memorable quotations use words with significantly more syllables) and phrase complexity (e.g. memorable quotations use less coordinating conjunctions)."}, {"heading": "4 A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away", "text": "How the linguistic form of an article affects the reaction it elicits has been examined in several contexts, including product ratings [9], political speeches [12], online posts [13], scientific papers [14], and Twitter retweets [36]. We use another set of features that abstract the terms of distinctness and generality to focus on these higher aspects of formulation, rather than on certain features at a lower level. In the context of our interest in distinctness, advertising research has examined the effects of syntactical complexity on recognizing and retrieving slogans [5, 6, 24]. There may also be links to Von Restorff's isolation effect (see Hunt [17], which asserts that if all but one object in a list is similar in any way, memory is improved for the other object and retrieval of slogans [5, 6, 24]."}, {"heading": "5 I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.", "text": "Motivated by the broad question of what types of information reach a widespread public consciousness, we examined the effect of phrases on the memorability of a quote. A challenge is that quotations differ not only in their wording, but also in who said them and under what circumstances; to address this difficulty, we constructed a controlled corpus of film quotations in which lines that are considered memorable are paired with non-memorable lines that are spoken of the same character roughly at the same place in the same movie. Memorably quotes were found to show, on average (there will always be individual exceptions) significant differences from non-memorable quotations in several important aspects, including metrics that capture distinctness and universality. Our experiments with slogans show how the principles we identify can extend to another domain.Future work can lead to applications in marketing, advertising, and education [4]. In addition, the measurability of quotability is distinct from several important aspects, including the nature of several."}], "references": [{"title": "Implicit structure and the dynamics of blogspace", "author": ["Eytan Adar", "Li Zhang", "Lada A.

achieves widespread public awareness is a research question of significant interest. We consider whether, and how, the way in which the information is phrased \u2014 the choice of words and sentence structure \u2014 can affect this process. To this end, we develop an analysis framework and build a corpus of movie quotes, annotated with memorability information, in which we are able to control for both the speaker and the setting of the quotes. We find significant differences between memorable and non-memorable quotes in several key dimensions. One is lexical distinctiveness: in aggregate, memorable quotes use less common word choices, but at the same time are built upon a scaffolding of common syntactic patterns; another is that memorable quotes tend to be more general in ways that make them easy to apply in new contexts. We also show how the concept of \u201cmemorable language\u201d can be extended across domains. To appear at ACL 2012 1 Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. Understanding what items will be retained in the public consciousness, and why, is a question of fundamental interest in many domains, including marketing, politics, entertainment, and social media; as we all know, many items barely register, whereas others catch on and take hold in many people\u2019s minds. An active line of recent computational work has employed a variety of perspectives on this question. Building on a foundation in the sociology of diffusion [27, 31], researchers have explored the ways in which network structure affects the way information spreads, with domains of interest including blogs [1, 11], email [37], on-line commerce [22], and social media [2, 28, 33, 38]. There has also been recent research addressing temporal aspects of how different media sources convey information [23, 30, 39] and ways in which people react differently to information on different topics [28, 36]. Beyond all these factors, however, one\u2019s everyday experience with these domains suggests that the way in which a piece of information is expressed \u2014 the choice of words, the way it is phrased \u2014 might also have a fundamental effect on the extent to which it takes hold in people\u2019s minds. Concepts that attain wide reach are often carried in messages such as political slogans, marketing phrases, or aphorisms whose language seems intuitively to be memorable, \u201ccatchy,\u201d or otherwise compelling. Our first challenge in exploring this hypothesis is to develop a notion of \u201csuccessful\u201d language that is precise enough to allow for quantitative evaluation. We also face the challenge of devising an evaluation setting that separates the phrasing of a message from the conditions in which it was delivered \u2014 highlycited quotes tend to have been delivered under compelling circumstances or fit an existing cultural, political, or social narrative, and potentially what appeals to us about the quote is really just its invocation of these extra-linguistic contexts. Is the form of the language adding an effect beyond or independent of these (obviously very crucial) factors? To investigate the question, one needs a way of controlar X iv :1 20 3. 63 60 v1 [ cs .C L ] 2 8 M ar 2 01 2 ling \u2014 as much as possible \u2014 for the role that the surrounding context of the language plays. The present work (i): Evaluating language-based memorability Defining what makes an utterance memorable is subtle, and scholars in several domains have written about this question. There is a rough consensus that an appropriate definition involves elements of both recognition \u2014 people should be able to retain the quote and recognize it when they hear it invoked \u2014 and production \u2014 people should be motivated to refer to it in relevant situations [15]. One suggested reason for why some memes succeed is their ability to provoke emotions [16]. Alternatively, memorable quotes can be good for expressing the feelings, mood, or situation of an individual, a group, or a culture (the zeitgeist): \u201cCertain quotes exquisitely capture the mood or feeling we wish to communicate to someone. We hear them ... and store them away for future use\u201d [10]. None of these observations, however, serve as definitions, and indeed, we believe it desirable to not pre-commit to an abstract definition, but rather to adopt an operational formulation based on external human judgments. In designing our study, we focus on a domain in which (i) there is rich use of language, some of which has achieved deep cultural penetration; (ii) there already exist a large number of external human judgments \u2014 perhaps implicit, but in a form we can extract; and (iii) we can control for the setting in which the text was used. Specifically, we use the complete scripts of roughly 1000 movies, representing diverse genres, eras, and levels of popularity, and consider which lines are the most \u201cmemorable\u201d. To acquire memorability labels, for each sentence in each script, we determine whether it has been listed as a \u201cmemorable quote\u201d by users of the widely-known IMDb (the Internet Movie Database), and also estimate the number of times it appears on the Web. Both of these serve as memorability metrics for our purposes. When we evaluate properties of memorable quotes, we compare them with quotes that are not assessed as memorable, but were spoken by the same character, at approximately the same point in the same movie. This enables us to control in a fairly fine-grained way for the confounding effects of context discussed above: we can observe differences that persist even after taking into account both the speaker and the setting. In a pilot validation study, we find that human subjects are effective at recognizing the more IMDbmemorable of two quotes, even for movies they have not seen. This motivates a search for features intrinsic to the text of quotes that signal memorability. In fact, comments provided by the human subjects as part of the task suggested two basic forms that such textual signals could take: subjects felt that (i) memorable quotes often involve a distinctive turn of phrase; and (ii) memorable quotes tend to invoke general themes that aren\u2019t tied to the specific setting they came from, and hence can be more easily invoked for future (out of context) uses. We test both of these principles in our analysis of the data. The present work (ii): What distinguishes memorable quotes Under the controlled-comparison setting sketched above, we find that memorable quotes exhibit significant differences from nonmemorable quotes in several fundamental respects, and these differences in the data reinforce the two main principles from the human pilot study. First, we show a concrete sense in which memorable quotes are indeed distinctive: with respect to lexical language models trained on the newswire portions of the Brown corpus [21], memorable quotes have significantly lower likelihood than their nonmemorable counterparts. Interestingly, this distinctiveness takes place at the level of words, but not at the level of other syntactic features: the part-ofspeech composition of memorable quotes is in fact more likely with respect to newswire. Thus, we can think of memorable quotes as consisting, in an aggregate sense, of unusual word choices built on a scaffolding of common part-of-speech patterns. We also identify a number of ways in which memorable quotes convey greater generality. In their patterns of verb tenses, personal pronouns, and determiners, memorable quotes are structured so as to be more \u201cfree-standing,\u201d containing fewer markers that indicate references to nearby text. Memorable quotes differ in other interesting aspects as well, such as sound distributions. Our analysis of memorable movie quotes suggests a framework by which the memorability of text in a range of different domains could be investigated. We provide evidence that such cross-domain properties may hold, guided by one of our motivating applications in marketing. In particular, we analyze a corpus of advertising slogans, and we show that these slogans have significantly greater likelihood at both the word level and the part-of-speech level with respect to a language model trained on memorable movie quotes, compared to a corresponding language model trained on non-memorable movie quotes. This suggests that some of the principles underlying memorable text have the potential to apply across different areas. Roadmap \u00a72 lays the empirical foundations of our work: the design and creation of our movie-quotes dataset, which we make publicly available (\u00a72.1), a pilot study with human subjects validating IMDbbased memorability labels (\u00a72.2), and further study of incorporating search-engine counts (\u00a72.3). \u00a73 details our analysis and prediction experiments, using both movie-quotes data and, as an exploration of cross-domain applicability, slogans data. \u00a74 surveys related work across a variety of fields. \u00a75 briefly summarizes and indicates some future directions. 2 I\u2019m ready for my close-up.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
