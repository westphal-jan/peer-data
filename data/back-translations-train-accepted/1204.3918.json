This first round eliminates half of the candidates and makes manipulation of several remaining election rules, including plurality and Borda, more difficult. Elkind and Lipmaa (2005) expanded this idea to include a general technique of combining two election rules. The first round is run over a certain number of rounds to eliminate some of the candidates before the second rule is applied to the remaining candidates. They proved that many such combinations of election rules are difficult to manipulate."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In general, eliminating candidates does not necessarily increase the arithmetic complexity of manipulation. In fact, we have created an artificial electoral rule that actually reduces the arithmetic complexity. However, for many of the electoral rules used in practice, the arithmetic complexity increases. For example, NP was known to be difficult to calculate how a single voter can manipulate the outcome of STV (the elimination version of plurality voting), and Nanson's and Baldwin's rule (elimination versions of the Borda vote). In this paper, we have shown that it is NP difficult to calculate how an individual voter can manipulate the outcome of the elimination version of veto rules, the closely related Coombs rule, and the elimination versions of the general class of evaluation rules."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors are supported by grants AOARD-104123 and 124056 from the Australian Government's Department of Broadband, Communications and Digital Economy, the Australian Research Council and the Asian Bureau of Aerospace Research and Development."}], "references": [{"title": "Multi-stage voting, sequential elimination and condorcet consistency", "author": ["Sabourian Bag", "P.
