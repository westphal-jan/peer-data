In particular, approaches to NLP that rely on the use of web tools - long and tedious tasks for crowdsourcing - have emerged. Amazon Mechanical Turk, for example, has been used to collect upcoming data (Snow et al., 2008). However, approaches a la Mechanical Turk might not be suitable for all tasks. In this paper, we focus on evaluating systems and theories about persuasion work, see for example (Fogg, 2009) or the collection of compelling NL generation studies in (Guerini et al., 2011a). Measuring the impact of a message is of paramount importance in this context, for example, how affective text variations are the persuasive power of a message.The problem is that evaluation experiments present a bottleneck, they are time-consuming and expensive."}, {"heading": "2 Advantages of Ecological Approaches", "text": "The evaluation of the effectiveness of convincing systems is very expensive and time-consuming, as the experience with STOP has shown (Reiter et al., 2003): The design of the experiment, the recruitment of subjects, their participation in the experiment, the issuing of questionnaires, the collection and analysis of data. Existing methods for evaluating persuasion work are usually divided into two main groups, depending on setup and area: (i) long-term evaluation of behavioral changes on the ground (such as the aforementioned STOP example) and (ii) laboratory environments for evaluating short-term effects as in (Andrews et al., 2008). While in the first approach it is difficult to take into account the role of external events that may occur over long periods of time, in the second there are still problems in recruiting subjects and time-consuming activities such as questionnaire collecting and processing. In addition, sometimes carefully designed experiments may fail because they are too small (or too bulky) to solve the problems with (i)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Partial Solution - Mechanical Turk", "text": "A current trend for behavioral studies that is emerging is the use of Mechanical Turk (Mason and Suri, 2010) or similar tools to overcome some of these constraints - such as recruiting subjects. Nevertheless, we believe that this poses other problems in assessing behavioral change and, more generally, persuasion effects. In fact: 1. Studies must be as ecological as possible, i.e. in real, even if controlled scenarios. 2. Subjects should not be aware that they are being observed, nor be biased by external rewards. In the case of Mechanical Turk, for example, subjects willingly undergo a process of verifying their abilities (e.g. by completing comment tasks). Cover stories can be used to mitigate this effect of consciousness, yet the fact that subjects are paid to complete the task makes the approach to behavioral studies unfeasible. it is necessary that the reason for a behavioral strategy to take place (but the only one behavioral strategy to induce the response to take place during the experiment)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Proposed Solution - Targeted Ads on the Web", "text": "Ecological studies (e.g. using Google AdWords) offer a possible solution to the following problems: 1. Time-consuming activities: Apart from the experimental design and setup, all the rest is carried out automatically by the system. Experiments can yield results within a few hours compared to several days / weeks. 2. Subject recruitment: The potential pool of subjects consists of the entire population of the web. 3. Subject motivation: Subtle effect measurements can be aimed at the very people who are most interested in the subject of the experiment at that point in time around the world and are therefore potentially more susceptible to reactions. 4. Subject are unaware that they are being tested, the tests are being carried out during their \"natural\" activity on the web. 5. Subtle effect measurements: If the subjects are insufficient, just wait for more ads to be placed or focus on a subset of even more interested people. Note that similar ecological approaches are already being investigated: for example, in (Aral and Walker, 2010) an approach to evaluate the community impacts of social content, not being presented in the Wordline and not in the Wordline."}, {"heading": "3 AdWords Features", "text": "The central idea is that advertisers can only deliver their messages to a relevant audience through a keyword-based contextualization of the Google network, divided into: \u2022 Search Network: includes Google search pages, search engines, and properties that display search result pages (SERPs), such as Froogle and Earthlink. \u2022 Display Networks: includes news pages, topic-specific websites, blogs, and other properties - such as Gmail and The New York Times.When a user types a query like \"Cruise\" into the Google search network, it displays a variety of relevant pages that refer to cruise companies."}, {"heading": "4 The ACE Tool", "text": "AdWords can be used to design and develop different metrics for fast and fully automated evaluation experiments.This tool - released at the end of 2010 - allows us to test from a marketing perspective whether changes to 1For a thorough description of the AdWords tool see: https: / / support.google.com / adwords / a promotion campaign (e.g. a keyword offering) have a statistically measurable impact on the campaign itself.Our primary goal is something else: We are interested in testing how different messages affect (possibly different) target groups. Nevertheless, the ACE tool goes exactly in the direction we are aiming for, as it includes statistically significant tests and makes it possible to avoid many of the optimization and tuning actions required before its release.The ACE tool also introduces an option that was not previously possible, namely the real-time verification of statistical significance. This means that it is no longer necessary to define the sample size for the statistical experiment, once the difference between the statistical experiments can be evaluated more meaningfully:"}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation and Targeting with ACE", "text": "Consider the design of an experiment with two conditions. First, we create an ad group with two competing messages (one message for each condition).2For more details on ACE functions and statistics, see http: / / www.google.com / ads / innovations / ace.htmlThen we select the serving method (in our opinion, the rotation method is better than optimization because it guarantees the randomness of the subjects and is more transparent) and the context (language, network, etc.), then we activate the ads and wait. Once the data is collected, we can monitor the two conditions as follows: \u2022 Basic Metrics: The highest CTR measure indicates which message works best. \u2022 Google Analytics Metrics: measures how much the messages have been left on the page and how many pages have been viewed. Shows interest / attitude generated in the subjects. \u2022 Conversion Metrics: measures how much the messages have been converted to the final destination."}, {"heading": "5.1 Setting up an Experiment", "text": "To test the extent to which AdWords can be exploited, we focused on assessing lexical variations of a message. In particular, we were able to gain insights into a system for affective variations of existing comments on medieval frescoes (Guerini et al., 2011b). The various steps to set up an experiment (or a series of experiments) are as follows: Choose a partner who already has the infrastructure for experiments (website, products, etc.)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Tips for Planning an Experiment", "text": "It is a question of whether it is a 'yes' or a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no', a 'no'."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "We conducted two pilot experiments to test how affective variations of existing texts alter their persuasive pact. In particular, we were interested in gaining initial insights into an intelligent system for affective variations of existing comments on medieval frescoes. We focused on adjective variations, using a slightly biased adjective for control conditions and a heavily biased variation for the experimental state. In these experiments, we assumed that affective variations of a message work better than a neutral version (Van Der Sluis and Mellish, 2010), and we wanted to explore finer-grained tactics that include the degree of variation (i.e. a moderately positive variation versus an extremely positive variation). Note that this is a more difficult task than the one proposed in (Van Der Sluis and Mellish, 2010), where long messages were tested with many variations and with polarized conditions (neutral vs. biased). In addition, we wanted to test how fast two-week frequencies can be selected according to Google."}, {"heading": "6.1 First Experiment", "text": "The first experiment lasted 48 hours with a total of 38 thousand subjects at a cost of 30 Euros (see Table 1 for the full description of the setup) and was designed to comprehensively test how affective variations were carried out in the advertising body; the two variations contained a fragment of a commentary by the museum guide; the control condition contained \"soft knight\" and \"African lion,\" while in the experimental state the affectively charged variations were \"brave knight\" and \"indomitable lion\" (see Figure 1 for the full ads). As can be seen from Table 2, the experiment did not result in a significant impairment when looking at the overall analysis, but the segmentation of the results according to the keyword that triggered the ads (see Table 3) showed that on the keyword \"medieval art\" the control condition performed better than the experimental one."}, {"heading": "6.2 Second Experiment", "text": "The second experiment lasted 48 hours with a total of one thousand subjects at a cost of 17 Euros (see Table 4 for the description of the experimental setup) and was intended to test in general terms how affective variations in the title of the text are introduced to ads. Both variations were the same as in the first experiment for the control state \"soft knight\" and for the experimental state \"valorous knight\" (see Figure 2 for the full ads). As can be seen from Table 5, the experiment did not yield a significant result in this case either, if you look at the general analysis, but the segmentation of the results according to the search network that triggered the ads (see Table 6), which we discovered that on the search partners at the \"other\" position, the control condition performed better than the experimental one. Unlike the first experiment, in this case we segmented according to the ad position and search network typology, since we only discussed our experiment on a keyword in the match discussion."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank Enrique Alfonseca and Steve Barrett from Google Labs for valuable information and discussions about AdWords features.
