We synthesize the data using the DawidSkene model for three judges (J = 3) on a three-step metric (K = 3). For simplicity, we designate the three levels by \"A,\" \"B\" and \"C,\" the previous probabilities of which are assumed to be 0.05, 0.15 and 0.8, respectively. The three confusion matrices are shown in Figure 2. As you can see, the three matrices are not selected to favor any models, and in fact, the three matrices are not even suitable for rat hybrid confusion, because HybridConfusion never examines cells as 0. Through the experiments in this section, we examine the accuracy of restoring the basic truth for different models by varying the number of elements."}, {"heading": "3.1.

Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we generalize the DawidSkene model into a range of probable models under the \"TrueLabel + Confusion\" paradigm. Our proposed models, SingleConfusion and HybridConfusion, complement the well-known DawidSkene model to overcome its excessive drawbacks. We examine its advantages and disadvantages using both synthetic and real data, and demonstrate the benefits of HybridConfusion in different environments. In the future, we would optimize the assessment pipeline based on restored confusion matrices, such as targeted training and direction changes."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank John Platt for the helpful discussion and the anonymous reviewer for the insightful and constructive comments."}], "references": [{"title": "Maximum likelihood estimation of observer error-rates using the em algorithm", "author": ["A.P.
