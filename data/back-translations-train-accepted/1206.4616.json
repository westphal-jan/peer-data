Our seizure dataset contains brain activity recorded in typically more than a hundred individual channels for each seizure of each patient. The MLC-HDP model clusters over channels-types, seizure-types, and patient-types simultaneously. We describe this model and its implementation in detail. We also present the results of a simulation study comparing the MLC-HDP to a similar model, the Nested Dirichlet Process and finally demonstrate the MLC-HDP's use in modeling seizures across multiple patients. We find the MLC-HDP's clustering to be comparable to independent human physician clusterings. To our knowledge, the MLC-HDP model is the first in the epilepsy literature capable of clustering seizures within and between patients.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:02:12 GMT  (510kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4616v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.AP cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["drausin wulsin", "shane jensen", "brian litt"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4616"}, "pdf": {"name": "1206.4616.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "A Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Model with Multiple Levels of Clustering for Human EEG Seizure Modeling", "authors": ["Drausin Wulsin", "Shane Jensen", "Brian Litt"], "emails": ["wulsin@seas.upenn.edu", "stjensen@wharton.upenn.edu", "littb@mail.med.upenn.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "2. Model description", "text": "This data has multiple levels on which we assume clustering occurs. Each level can be considered a finite collection of atoms extending to more or less low levels, while this model is motivated by our seizure of iEEG data, it generalizes to all levels of data where multiple levels of clustering make sense. Furthermore, while our model contains three levels extending it to more or less levels, it is easy to describe the higher levels and any arbitrary distribution at the base level. Seizure and the patient levels - levels 2 and 1 - are each composed of multinomial atoms representing priors at the level below the level, so Level-2 seizure types denote different seizure types, each of which is a prior via the base atomic channel channel types."}, {"heading": "3. Model implementation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. Notation", "text": "Our implementation is very similar to the collapsed Gibbs sampler used by (Teh et al. 2006) for the HDP5. For simplicity, we introduce a count variable n and a sampled variable 6 m at each level of the model: n (3) 'k denotes the number of observations in baseatom k (channel type) about seizures at level 2 atom', with similar meanings for n (2) l 'and n (1) l for levels 2 (seizure types) and 1 (patient types) respectively; m (3)' k denotes a sampled weight parameter at level 2 atom '; m (2) l' and m (1) l are similar; a point (\u00b7) instead of a subscript denotes a marginal number of atoms, where in theory the number of atoms at each level is infinite, the number that exists at each given point."}, {"heading": "3.2. Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling", "text": "Figure 2 shows that there are a number of parameters of the MLC-HDP data that must be collected from each patient. We break these variables into three main groups: the atomic indicators, z; the level parameters, \u03b2 and \u03c0; and the base parameters, \u03c6k. An optional fourth step is to place priors at the level of hyperparameters \u03b3 and \u03b1 and sample values for them as well. Of these steps, the first is usually the most computationally intensive. 5Specifically, see Section 5.3 6Our variables n and m are equivalent to the number of foods that are eaten and the number of tables used in the Chinese restaurant metaphor. We briefly summarize each of these four stages. Sampling atom indicators We stamp atom indicators on each of the three levels that we use roughly the same technique: (a) compute the previous weights over the atoms (b)."}, {"heading": "4.

Simulated data", "text": "In order to explore some of the characteristics of the MLC-HDP in a controlled environment and to compare it with a similar model, we conducted a two-stage version of it based on the same simulated data presented in (Rodr \u0301 \u00edguez et al. 2008) and implemented the model of the nested dirichlet process described in their work. In short, samples were generated from one of four distributions (T1-T4), each of which is a mixture of two to four Gaussians. The parameters of the Gaussians are described in Table 1. We used a dataset of 5 samples from each of the four distributions, for a total of 20 samples. Each sample contained 100 observations from the respective distribution. We used the same hyperparameters described in (Rodr \u00d3\u00edguez et al. 2008). Posterior inference for each model was executed over 25 chains, each with a 5000 sampling fire in and 10 sampling surveys, with 400 samples in total, or 400 sampling estimates for each of M.DP being thinned."}, {"heading": "4.2. Human seizures on intracranial EEG", "text": "We compiled a dataset of 193 intracranial EEG seizure data on 10 randomly selected patients from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia because these patients exhibit characteristics commonly used in epilepsy intracranial EEG sets. Table 2 describes the number of seizures per patient as well as the number of seizures per patient and the differences in the number of usable channels within9We have all channel activity from -30 to + 90 seconds around the clinically marked onset of each patient. We have calculated a set of simple and intuitive features for each channel: the log10 power in four clinically relevant frequency bands (4-8, 8-13 Hz)."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "We describe a new hierarchical variant of the Dirichlet process, the multi-step hierarchical Dirichlet process (MLC-HDP), which collects simultaneously on multiple levels of a dataset. In a simulation study, we illustrate some of the advantages of this model over a similar model, the nested Dirichlet process. Finally, we show how the MLC-HDP allows us to create seizure models that take into account the importance of individual channels while integrating information from many seizures within and between patients. Such a model allows us to answer important clinical questions such as \"how many seizures does this patient have?\" and \"what seizures does this seizure resemble other patients?,\" questions that to the best of our knowledge were previously unanswerable in the field of quantitative epilepsy analysis."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Eric Marsh and Brenda Porter of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia for their continuous iEEG recordings, manual seizure clustering and helpful discussion, and Emily Fox for their helpful ideas and discussions.
