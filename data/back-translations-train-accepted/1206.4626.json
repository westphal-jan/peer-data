Empirical evidences show that stock's high and low prices are temporary and stock price relatives are likely to follow the mean reversion phenomenon. While the existing mean reversion strategies are shown to achieve good empirical performance on many real datasets, they often make the single-period mean reversion assumption, which is not always satisfied in some real datasets, leading to poor performance when the assumption does not hold. To overcome the limitation, this article proposes a multiple-period mean reversion, or so-called Moving Average Reversion (MAR), and a new on-line portfolio selection strategy named \"On-Line Moving Average Reversion\" (OLMAR), which exploits MAR by applying powerful online learning techniques. From our empirical results, we found that OLMAR can overcome the drawback of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve significantly better results, especially on the datasets where the existing mean reversion algorithms failed. In addition to superior trading performance, OLMAR also runs extremely fast, further supporting its practical applicability to a wide range of applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:07:23 GMT  (182kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4626v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.LG q-fin.PM", "authors": ["bin li", "steven c h hoi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4626"}, "pdf": {"name": "1206.4626.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On-Line Portfolio Selection with Moving Average Reversion", "authors": ["Bin Li", "Steven C.

Their price changes are determined by a price relative vector xt Rm + and xt, i = pt \u2212 1, i. Thus, an investment in assets i on the tth period is determined by a factor of xt \u2212 i. Suppose that portfolio xn = {xn} is determined as the order of the price relative vectors for n periods. An investment on the tth period is determined by a portfolio vector vector bt = (bt,.., bt, m), where portfolio i represents the proportion of assets invested in assets i. Typi. We assume that the portfolio is self-financed and no margin / short is allowed, so each entry of a portfolio is not negative and added to one."}, {"heading": "3.

A classic strategy is Constant Rebalanced Portfolios (CRP), which is the optimal strategy when the market i.i.d. follows (Cover & Thomas, 1991, Theorem 15.3.1). The best possible CRP strategy in retrospect is often referred to as Best Constant Rebalanced Portfolios (BCRP), which is the optimal strategy when the market i.i.d. (Cover & Thomas, Theorem 15.3.1) is the best CRP strategy after the fact, which initiates the research of online portfolio selection (Orderly & Cover, 1996) and the proposed Universal Portfolios (UP) strategy, whose portfolio is the historical performance-weighted average of all CRP portfolios."}, {"heading": "3.1. Analysis of Existing Work", "text": "Most existing formulations follow the basic routine of Kelly-based portfolio selection (Thorp, 1971). Specifically, a portfolio manager first predicts x-t + 1 with respect to k possible values x-t + 1..., x-k t + 1 and their corresponding probabilities p1,..., pk. Note, however, that each x-t + 1 denotes a possible combination vector of individual price relative forecasts. Then, he / she can calculate portfolio by maximizing the expected log yield, bt + 1 = argmax b-m-k-k-i = 1 pi-log (b-x-it + 1). Based on methods of predicting x-it + 1 and pi, most existing algorithms can be divided into three categories. Their optimization formulations and underlying predictions are summarized in Table 1, and their details can be found on their respective studies."}, {"heading": "4.

The basic idea is to maximize the expected return b \u00b7 x t + 1 and to maintain the latest portfolio information on the regularization date. Therefore, we follow the similar idea of PAMR (Li et al., 2012) and formulate an optimization problem, optimization problem: OLMARbt + 1 = argmin b-m1 2-bt 2 s.t. b \u00b7 x-x-t + 1. Note that we adopt the expected return instead of the expected protocol return. According to Helmbold et al.

Algorithm", "text": "The above formulation is therefore convex and simply solved via convex optimization (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004). We now derive the OLMAR solution as in Proposition 1.Proposition 1. Proposition 1. The solution of OLMAR without taking into account the non-negativity restriction isbt + 1 = bt + 1 (x-x-t + 11), where x-t + 1 = 1 m (1-x-t + 1) is the average predicted price relative and x-t + 1 is the Lagrange multiplier, which is calculated as \u03bbt + 1 = max {0-x-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t"}, {"heading": "4.4. Analysis", "text": "The update of OLMAR is simple, that is, bt + 1 = bt + \u03bbt + 1 (x-t + 1 \u2212 x-t + 11). Essentially, the update divides the assets into two groups by the forecast average. For the assets in the group with higher predictions than average, OLMAR increases its shares, for the others OLMAR reduces its shares. The transferred shares are related to the surprise of the predictions above average and the positive lagrange multiplier, \u03bb. This is in line with the normal procedure of portfolio selection, i.e. the transfer of assets to the assets with better growth opportunities. The OLMAR update clearly costs linear time per period, and the normalization step can also be implemented in linear time (Duchi et al., 2008). To the best of knowledge, the linear time of OLMAR is no worse than any existing algorithm."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "We are now evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed OLMAR algorithm by conducting an extensive series of experiments with publicly available and diverse data sets from real stock markets. Table 3 describes the four experimental data sets 2. Among these, the NYSE (O) is a data set that is evaluated by all existing methods, while the NYSE (N) is a data set collected by Li et al. (2011b) as a continuation of the NYSE (O). The remaining two data sets (DJA and TSE) are collected by Borodin et al. (2004). In this work, we are using the most common metric, cumulative wealth, to measure investment performance. Results with other metrics, including risk-adjusted return, are also included in the long version of this paper. We are comparing the proposed approach with all existing methods in Section 3, whose parameters are determined according to their respective studies. In our experiments, we are implementing the proposed parameters, including the OLMOLMAR parameters, and the MOLMAR parameters, we have determined the MOLAR-MAR-MAR = iAR for all the cases."}, {"heading": "5.1. Cumulative Wealth", "text": "Figure 1 (a) illustrates the main results of this study, i.e. the cumulative prosperity achieved through various approaches. It is clear from the results that OLMAR2All datasets, including composites, at http: / / www.cais.ntu.edu.sg / ~ libin / portfolios /. achieve peak performance among all competitors.On the well-known benchmark NYSE (O) dataset, OLMAR performs significantly better than the state of the art; the same observation can be found on the consecutive NYSE (N) dataset. Although most existing algorithms except Anticor perform poorly in the DJA dataset, OLMAR performs best. Furthermore, the maximum performance shows that it is possible to achieve better performance through an effective combination of experts.Finally, the test statistics shown in Table 1 (b) confirm that the results achieved are not due to luck."}, {"heading": "5.2. Parameter Sensitivity", "text": "Let us now evaluate the sensitivity of the algorithm to its parameters, that is, \"and.\" Figure 2 shows the sensitivity of \"with fixed\" w = 5 and Figure 3 shows the sensitivity of \"with fixed\" = 10. Of the former, we can observe that the overall capacity generally increases sharply when \"approaches\" 1, and flattens out when \"exceeds a threshold.\" Of the latter, we can observe that as the \"w\" performance increases, the performance increases first, then increases with a data-dependent value, and then decreases. In any case, its performance, with most of the choices of \"A\" and \"W, performs much better than the BCRP strategy and the market. Furthermore, the latter figure also shows that the\" buy and hold \"versions greatly flatten the performance with different\" W \"of the underlying experts. All the above observations also show that it is robust to the choice of parameters and is convenient to choose satisfactory parameters."}, {"heading": "5.3. Transaction Cost Scalability", "text": "In order to evaluate the practicality, we evaluate the scalability of the proposed algorithms in terms of the proportional transaction costs (Borodin et al., 2004). Figure 4 illustrates the cumulative prosperity that OLMAR achieves with increasing transaction cost rate \u03b3, and also the results obtained through four representative algorithms (two benchmarks and two state-of-the-art in different categories). On the one hand, the results clearly show that OLMAR can withstand reasonable transaction costs, as it often has high break-even rates in terms of the market. On the other hand, OLMAR can exceed benchmarks and state-of-the-art in various transaction costs. In a word, OLMAR performs excellently when trade is not smooth, which supports its practicality."}, {"heading": "5.4. Computational Time", "text": "Finally, we evaluate the computing time as shown in Table 1 (c). Note that we only list the computing times of methods with comparable performance. In theory, as we have analyzed in Section 4.4, OLMAR enjoys a linear computing time complexity. Empirically, as shown in the table, the OLMAR algorithm takes the smallest times for all data sets. Note that with daily frequency, the average times of competitors are acceptable, but their times are not acceptable in the high frequency trading scenario. This time efficiency supports OLMAR's large-scale real-scale applications."}, {"heading": "5.5. Discussion and Thread of Validity", "text": "Without a theoretical guarantee, the empirical assumptions in Section 2 are worth reviewing as performed by all existing heuristic algorithms (Borodin et al., 2004; Li et al., 2011a; b; 2012). As evaluated in Section 5.3, OLMAR can withstand reasonable transaction costs. All data sets consist of the largest index composite stocks with the best market liquidity. To limit the market impact when the portfolio is too large, one solution is to reduce the size of the portfolio, as is done by several quantitative funds. At this point, we reiterate that even in such a \"perfect market,\" no algorithm has ever performed so well. There may also be certain problems in the retesting. One possible problem is \"survival bias.\" As the composite stocks have never been disconnected from the markets after existing work and have survived for a long time, in particular the two NYSE data sets."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "This paper proposes a novel online portfolio selection strategy called \"On-Line Moving Average Reversion\" (OLMAR), which exploits \"Moving Average Reversion\" through online learning algorithms. It can solve the state-of-the-art problems caused by the one-time reversal of funds and achieve satisfactory results in real markets. It is also extremely fast and suitable for large-scale real-world applications. In the future, we will further explore the theoretical aspect of the reversal of funds."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was fully supported by the Singapore MOE Tier 1 Project (RG33 / 11)."}], "references": [{"title": "Algorithms for portfolio management based on the newton method", "author": ["A.

Empirical evidence show that stock\u2019s high and low prices are temporary and stock price relatives are likely to follow the mean reversion phenomenon. While the existing mean reversion strategies are shown to achieve good empirical performance on many real datasets, they often make the single-period mean reversion assumption, which is not always satisfied, leading to poor performance in some real datasets. To overcome the limitation, this article proposes a multiple-period mean reversion, or so-called \u201cMoving Average Reversion\u201d (MAR), and a new on-line portfolio selection strategy named \u201cOn-Line Moving Average Reversion\u201d (OLMAR), which exploits MAR by applying powerful online learning techniques. From our empirical results, we found that OLMAR can overcome the drawbacks of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve significantly better results, especially on the datasets where existing mean reversion algorithms failed. In addition to superior performance, OLMAR also runs extremely fast, further supporting its practical applicability to a wide range of applications.", "creator": " TeX output 2012.05.14:2345"}}}
