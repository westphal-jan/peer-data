Convex regression", "text": "Regression subject to convexity limitation has been the subject of renewed interest in recent years. An approach was the approximation of a function with a positive definitive Hessian et al. (2007; Aguilera and Morin, 2009; Yongqiao and He, 2012). These methods generally lead to a problem that is solved by a semi-definitive program with n semi-definitive limitations; solution methods are prohibitively slow for more than 1 or 2 thousand observations. Another approach is based on an alternative definition of convexity: f0 (x1) \u2265 f0 (x2) + g0 (x1 \u2212 x2), (1) for each x1, x2 \u0445g0 (x), whereby an alternative definition of convexity is given: f0 (x1) \u2265 f0 (x1) + g0 (x2) T (x1 \u2212 x2), (x) for each x1, whereby an alternate definition of convexity is given."}, {"heading": "2.2.

Optimization", "text": "Approaching objective functions or constraints for use in convex optimization is one of the most promising applications for convex regression. In this subsection, we use convex regression for response methods in stochastic optimization; see Lim (2010) for an overview. We want to minimize an unknown function f (x) with respect to x given n noisy observations, (xi, yi) n i = 1, where yi = f (xi, i), min x-XE {f (x,) | (xi, yi) ni = 1}.

Device and constraint modeling with convex regression", "text": "Functions without explicit generalized posynomial representation occur in two settings. In the device modeling setting = device parameters such as the inversion of transconductivity, gate-source voltage, inversion of output impedance, and intrinsic gate capacitance must be modeled as generalized posynomial functions of input parameters such as device width, length, end voltages, and outlet current.These relationships must be derived from data generated by circuit simulation or contained in standard cell library.Log convectivity of such data is not guaranteed and the goal is to find a low error generalization of posynomial approximation.In the limitation modeling setting, some limitations, such as the supply voltage for different gates, may be known, but do not have a generalized posynomial form of observation. In this case, the goal is to generate a low error generalized function on the sample."}, {"heading": "5.3. Power modeling", "text": "Here we adapt a generalized posynomial function to a known but not posynomial function, in which power is derived as a function of gate supply and threshold voltages Vdd and Vth. This example is examined in Boyd, Kim, Patil and Horowitz (2005). Total power derived for a gate is the sum of average static power and dynamic power subtracted. Dynamic power is a function of gate supply voltage, Vdd, Pdyn = f (Cint + CL) V 2dd, where f is the frequency, Cint is the intrinsic capacity and CL the load capacity. Static leakage is a function of supply voltage and average current leakage, I-leak, Pstat = I-leakVdd. Average current leakage is a function of both supply and threshold voltages."}, {"heading": "5.4. LC oscillator design", "text": "Here we compare convex regression methods for device modeling in geometric programming based on the LC oscillator design. Oscillators generate an oscillating output at constant frequency. An LC oscillator (L and C each represent approximately 0.5% coil and capacitor) sends electrons from a plate of a capacitor through a coil or loop inductor to reach the other plate. However, when the electrons travel around a coil, a magnetic field is generated that generates a voltage across the coil in the opposite direction of electron flux. Once the capacitor is fully discharged, the magnetic field around the coil collapses and the voltage is charged in the opposite direction. Additional voltage is applied to offset this loss of resistance. We implement the LC oscillator design problem given in Boyd, Kim and Mohan (2005) (the goal is to minimize current consumption."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we combine convex regression (CAP and Magnani and Boyd (2009)) and ensemble methods to create a piecemeal linear approximation method. CAP is a consistent, stable estimator that uses a tree-like search to generate a piecemeal linear model. Ensemble methods such as bagging, smearing and random search directions create uncertainty in the distribution boundaries. On average, these uncertain estimates result in a better fit. The Magnani and Boyd (2009) method is an unstable estimator that can achieve a very good fit by aligning a piecemeal linear model with the data used to generate it. Lubbing and sagging of the average over a large number of models and reducing the likelihood that the estimator will be determined by a few ill-fitting models. Although device modeling is a natural environment for ensemble convex regression, the low complexity, theoretical performance and strong optimization options are a promising combination."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Lauren A.
