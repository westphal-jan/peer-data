We present a measure of cliqueness that essentially counts the number of missing edges to make a subset of vertices a clique. With this measurement, we show that the problem of finding the most stubborn soft clique problem can be defined either as: a) a maximum-minute-long two-person optimization problem, or b) a minute-long soft margin optimization problem. Both formulations result in the use of a partial positioning method to solve the optimization problems.

Luce & Perry (1949) examined the adjacence matrices of friendship graphs to identify cliques of friends; they already observed that the criterion of all interconnected depressions can be excessively strict, and they introduced the softer n-clique criterion; later, Alba (1973) showed that some non-intuitive facts about n cliques, for example, that their elements may be completely separate in relation to the original graph structure; then many alternative constructions were introduced, see e.g. Scott, 1988 for a textbook overview; and (Robardet, 2009) for some recent developments in social sciences, other areas of research that deal with network structures."}, {"heading": "2. Persistent Soft-Cliques", "text": "In this section, we will formulate our most important contributions: a measure of how close a set of vertices is to a clique, and its generalization to multiple graph instances. First, we will introduce the notation necessary for this. In Section 2.1, we will raise the problem of finding a maximum clique in a single graph as an integer optimization problem, and in Section 2.2, we will expand this term to include the case of soft cliques persisting across multiple instances of a graph. Notation For a set of vertices V = {v1,..., vn} we will leave Et V \u00b7 V, for t = 1,..., T, several observed edge sets, and let kt: V \u00b7 V \u2192 R + non-negative weight functions between the vertices of V. We will form weighted graphs Gt = (V, Et, kt), for t = 1,.., T. In the following, we will refer to t as a \"time variable,\" but note that in a broad sense, this means we cannot respond to a simultaneity, but rather a simultaneity."}, {"heading": "2.1. Soft Clique-ness", "text": "s consider S-V as a vertex subset. To this end, we identify S with its binary indicator vector xi-0, 1-0, where xi-1 if vi-S, and xi-0 otherwise. The problem of finding a maximum weighted clique in a weighted chart (V, E, k) can then be evaluated as the following integer optimization problem (Pardalos & Xue, 1994): max x-0,1-0 | V-1 \u2264 i < j-n-xiximk (vi, vj) (1a) subject to 1 \u2264 i < j-nxiximI [(i, j) / ig E] = 0.

Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced the concept of persistent soft cliques, i.e. subgraphs that are almost completely or at least tightly connected and persist through all or most instances of the graph. This concept is particularly useful for characterizing key patterns more securely when multiple instances of a graph are available for analysis. We presented a soft clique measure that counts and penalizes the number of missing edges to make the selected subgraphs a clique, to deal with inconsistent patterns inherent in noisy graph instances. If this measure is used in an optimization frame to find a maximum weighted clique, we end up with a two-person game or a limp formulation. We demonstrated with a Lagrange method that the two formulations lead to the same solution.Our experiments with randomly generated inconsistent patterns in multiple settings of the original graph confirmed that a collection of, even loud snapshots, of a particular time leads to a specific graph."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank Ahmed Jawad, Marcello Pelillo, Zoubin Ghahramani, Adrian Ion, Tiberio Caetano and Viktoriia Sharmanska for the discussion.

In this work we address this challenge for the problem of finding maximum weighted cliques. We introduce the concept of most persistent soft-clique. This is subset of vertices, that 1) is almost fully or at least densely connected, 2) occurs in all or almost all graph instances, and 3) has the maximum weight. We present a measure of clique-ness, that essentially counts the number of edge missing to make a subset of vertices into a clique. With this measure, we show that the problem of finding the most persistent soft-clique problem can be cast either as: a) a max-min two person game optimization problem, or b) a min-min soft margin optimization problem. Both formulations lead to the same solution when using a partial Lagrangian method to solve the optimization problems. By experiments on synthetic data and on real social network data we show that the proposed method is able to reliably find soft cliques in graph data, even if that is distorted by random noise or unreliable observations.
