Model Definition", "text": "The generative process of L-LDA begins with a definition of a document-specific function label (j), which provides a set of observed label indices for document j. Then, for each document j, a multinomial distribution \u03b8j over topics is randomly selected from a dirichlet with parameters rj\u03b1, where rj is a random vector whose kth value is 1 if k label (j) and 0 if k / ji label (j). Then the word i, a topic zji is selected from this topic distribution, and a word, xji, is defined on the basis of a topic-specific multinomial distribution model. By using a document-specific indicator vector rj, the model can specify the topic."}, {"heading": "2.2. Construction and Predictive Distribution", "text": "We will now describe two perspectives that are important for inferring algorithms for DP-MRM: the stick-breaking process and the Po \"lya urn scheme.Stick-breaking process is a constructive definition for generating a Dirichlet process (Sethuraman, 1991). Similar to the model definition in the previous section, the stick-breaking process can be divided into two levels. For the first level random measure Gk0 we follow the general stick-breaking process given by the following conditional distributions: vkl\" Beta \"Beta\" Beta \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" s \"i\" s \"i\" s \"i\" s \"s\" i \"s.\" s \"s.\""}, {"heading": "3. Inference via Gibbs Sampling", "text": "We propose a Gibbs sampler for DP-MRM, a Po-lya urn scheme based on the marginalization of unknown dimensions (Escobar & West, 1995). For the collapsed Gibbs sampler, we marginalize the factors composed of factors composed of different proportions, and random probability scales, Gj, G k 0. Consequently, we only need to capture the index of each latent variable. Let tji the index variable be such that it can be the index variable so that it can be the index variable so that Gk0, and ljt the index variable so that it can be the index variable so that it is the index variable so that it is the number of index variables so large that it can be the number of index variables so large that it can be the index variable so large that it cannot be the index variable so that it is the index j0 large that it is the index variable so large that it can be the index j0."}, {"heading": "4. Application with Labeled Documents", "text": "We measure the performance of DP-MRM with three experiments. First, we compare the identification prediction performance of DP-MRM and LDA-SVM on single-line documents. Then, we compare the identification prediction performance of DP-MRM and L-LDA on multi-line documents. Finally, we compare the identification prediction performance of DP-MRM and L-LDA on heldout data. In the identification prediction experiments, we use a semi-supervised approach: divide the corpus into training and test sets, derive the posterior distribution of the training set with the observed labels (i.e. rjk = 1 only for k-label (j)), and then derive the posterior distribution of the test set with all possible K-labels (i.e. rjk = 1 for all k). In all evaluations, we perform each model ten times with 5,000 iterations, the first 3,000 as burn-in, and then use the samples with 100 gaps from iterations."}, {"heading": "4.1. Single-Labeled Documents", "text": "DP-MRM is designed to model multi-labeled documents, but it assumes that one label generates multiple themes, so this flexible assumption allows DP-MRM to also be used to model labeled documents. Note that L-LDA for labeled documents would match each word of a document to a single theme, thus modelling the document as a mixture of unique items (i.e. naive bayes). To measure the classification performance, we trained our model with five compound subcategories of newsgroup documents (20NG) 1. Table 1 shows the details of our data sets. 90% of the documents were used with the labels, and the remaining 10% of the documents were used without the labels. We classified each of the test documents according to the label with the most assigned words. As a baseline, we trained a multi-class SVM with the LDA-derived theme modelings above the labels. We classified each of the test documents according to the label with the most assigned words."}, {"heading": "4.2.

Predictive Performance", "text": "To compare the adjustment of the model, we measure the predictive performance of our model and L-LDA with the heldout probability of the test set. For each model, the posterior sampling was performed with 90% of the words in each document, while the performance of the test set was consistently evaluated for the remaining 10% of the words.

Image Segmentation with ddCRP", "text": "We describe an enhancement of DP-MRM built into DP-MRM by integrating ddCRP, a non-parametric Bayesian predecessor that takes spatial dependencies into account, illustrating the universality of DP-MRM in that it can replace HDP for data with page information. We test this DP-MRM-ddCRP model on the task of image segmentation for multi-labeled images without manually segmented training data. Image segmentation is often done with manually segmented and labeled data (He et al., 2004; Gould et al., 2009). DP-MRM can also perform supervised image segmentation, but such data is more difficult to obtain, whereas image collections with multiple labels and without segmentation are relatively easy to obtain (e.g. Picasa or Flickr). A recent paper shows a Bayesian model for simultaneous image segmentation and annotation (Du, et al, 2009)."}, {"heading": "5.1. Incorporating ddCRP into DP-MRM", "text": "The Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) is an alternative formulation of DP. CRP forms a cluster structure of customers by assigning each customer to an existing or a new spreadsheet. However, ddCRP forms a cluster structure of customers by taking into account the distances between them; customers who are relatively close to each other are more likely to be associated with each other than those who are far distance. ddCRP is the assignment of the customer i to the other customers, then the distribution of the customer assignment isp (ci = i \u2032 | c \u2212 i, f, D, \u03b1). [f (dii \u2032) i = i \u2032 \u03b1 i = i \u2032, (11) where dii \u2032 is the distance between customer i and i \u2032, and f (dii \u2032) is a decay function of distance that conveys how the distances affect the resulting distribution across the partitions. [f] There are many possible ways to define the decay function, and in this paper we follow (Gh\u03b7 \u2212 ler al, 2011) and use a decay function based on how the distances affect the partitions."}, {"heading": "5.2. Image Segmentation with Multiple Labels", "text": "For image segmentation, we use the eight scene categories in (Oliva & Torralba, 2001), which are fully segmented and labeled by human subjects and available in the LabelMe dataset (Russell et al., 2008).A widely used method of rendering images for sequences is a code book of images (Fei-Fei & Perona, 2005).In order to generate the code book, each image is initially divided into about 1,000 superpixels using the normalized cutting algorithm (Shi & Malik, 2000).Each superpixel is described via a local texton histogram (Martin et al., 2004) and an HSV color histogram. By using kmeans, we quantify these histograms into 128 containers, and superpixels i in image j are summarized using these code words xji = {MRDDP, MRDCji}, whereby the segments of MRDCji} should define the texture of the Bastji (Dixji DixH)."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "The results show that DP-MRM for labeled data produces interpretable topics with greater flexibility than the labeled LDA. A promising extension of our model is the inclusion of prior knowledge of external sources or domain experts in a Bayesian non-parametric topic model. It is outside the scope of this paper, but our model can use different \u03b2k for each base distribution, so the structured previous \u03b2k of domain experts (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) can be easily integrated into our model."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was supported by the Basic Research Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), which is funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Tehcnology (2011-0026507)."}], "references": [{"title": "Incorporating domain knowledge into topic modeling via dirichlet forest priors", "author": ["D.
