Posterior Updates", "text": "In this section we derive the updated equations for the parameters of the attack model with respect to the MCM and VB solutions. The updated equations are based on the full probability of the model, which can be written as follows: L (y) = p (y, x, w, \u00b5, \u03a3, m, V, b, \u03c0) = p (yi | xi, w, bi) p (xi | \u00b5, \u03a3) p (bi | \u03c0) \u00b7 p (w | m, V) p (\u00b5, \u03a3) p (m, V) p (\u03c0) (10) As can be seen, the probability (10) is in an insoluble form, since it is not possible to estimate all the model parameters directly from (10). Therefore, the solutions developed below by MCMC and VB update all the model parameters sequentially from their respective conditional posterior distribution. While the MCMC solution is based on precise conditional posterior distributions, the VB solution uses an approximation to the actual posterior distribution."}, {"heading": "4.1.

Synthetic Host Signals", "text": "In this subsection, we conduct experiments with synthetic host signals. We generated n = 4096, d = 64-dimensional host data points. Each data point was independently and identically drawn by N (0, IW (d + 1, IW (d + 1, I)), where I am the identity matrix. Thus, the host signal covariance matrix, although randomly drawn, imposes a structure on the host signal. DWR = 30db. The water signal bits were drawn by Bernoulli (0.5), and the water signal was shaped by additive spread spectrum modulation. The host image and the difference between water time images and host images are represented in the host image."}, {"heading": "5.2. Real Host Signals", "text": "We applied our algorithm to grayscale images. In the experiments, we used image sizes of 512 \u00d7 512 and 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels. The images were divided into 8 \u00d7 8 pixel fields, so that a total of n = 4096 and n = 16384 pixel fields were selected. The pixels within each patch were merged in rows to form the d-dimensional (d = 64) data points.The host signal was then normalized to have a zero significance. As in the case of synthetic host signals, the watermark signal was then scaled so that the DWR = 30db and the Fig real signal were shown by a multivariate Gausser image with mean N (0, IW (d + 1, I)) and covariance IW (d + 1, I).The watermark signal was then scaled so that the DWR = 30db and the Fig real signal were shown by additive spread spectrum modulation 1. (Pi = 0.5)"}, {"heading": "6. Discussion", "text": "We introduced a new attack model for repeating watermark systems based on Bayesian statistics. The proposed algorithm estimates the watermark signal and message bitstream directly from the watermark signal and without access to the watermark decoder. We developed MCMC and VB solutions that are comparable in error probability and relative watermark reconstruction error for both synthetic and real host signals. In both solutions, a fast convergence can be observed, especially in the VB solution, where the algorithm converges in less than 20 iterations, both synthetic and real host signals. While the MCMC solution should result in more accurate estimates for an infinite number of iterations, the VB solution is more computationally efficient and therefore more suitable for large datasets. We demonstrated that the attack model is capable of correctly retrieving a large portion of the message stream and simultaneously receiving a good water time signal."}, {"heading": "7.
