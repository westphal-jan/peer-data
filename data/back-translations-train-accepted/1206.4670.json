For the sake of simplicity, we are only looking at a one-dimensional case (i.e., the target falls directly to the ground), but the approach works similarly in a general 3D setting. The movement of the target is assumed to follow the equation (Li & Jilkov, 2001) [dr dv] = [\u2212 v a (r, v, t) + g (t) + u (t)]] dt + [qr 0 \u2212 qv], where r \u2212 d\u03b2v] is the height and v the speed of the target.

GPS Satellite Orbit Prediction", "text": "As a case study, we consider the problem of predicting the orbit of a GPS satellite and the acceleration of solar radiation. Accurate modeling of the forces acting on a GPS satellite is required in a number of applications and real-time applications that require predicting the orbit (Seppa nen et al., 2012). The motion equation for the satellite can be written as a (vector) Markov model whose acceleration is caused by unknown forces acting on the satellite. Here, r and v represent the 3D position and velocity vectors of the satellite in an inertial coordinate system fixed to an arbitrary frame of reference. The deterministic acceleration of the motion model isa (r, t) + asrp, where the acceleration is fixed on a satellite."}, {"heading": "6.1. Modeling the Unknown Forces", "text": "As a first step in modeling, we would like to get an insight into what the unknown forces look like. To do this, we assume separate GP smoothing priors for each component of u (r, v, t). Instead of placing the GP priors directly on the inertial coordinate system used in the integration, we place them on the radial, tangential and normal components of an RTN coordinate system with unit vector (r, v) uR (t) uN (t), where R (r, v) is a matrix, the RTN coordinates are transformed into the inertial coordinate system used in the integration. Thus, the model for the unknown forces isu (r, v, t) uR (t) uT (t), where R (r, v) is a matrix, the RTN coordinates are transformed into the inertial coordinate system used in the integration 9, and each of the latent forces isu (r, v, t) 9, 8, uR (t) uR (t) uT (t) uN (t), where R (t) is a matrix, the RTN (r, v) 9, the RTN coordinates are transformed into the inertial coordinate system 9, the RTN coordinates are transformed into the inertial coordinate system 9, 8, and each of inertial coordinate system 9, 8, 8, 8, and each of the unknown forces isu (r, v, t) uR (t) uR (t) uR (t) uT (t) uT (t) uT (t) uN (t) uN (t) is a matrix (t) uN (t) uN (t), t), where R (t) is a matrix is a matrix, where R (r (r, v) 9, v), 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, uT, uT, uT, uT, uR (t, t, t, t, t) uT (t) uT (t) uT, t) uT (t"}, {"heading": "6.2. Quasi-Periodic Model for Latent Forces", "text": "In order to model the quasi-periodicities of the latent forces, we use a stochastic resonator model previously used to model periodic phenomena in the brain (Sa \ufffd rkka \ufffd et al., 2012). We model the periodic component as an overlay of resonators of Form2cn (t) dt2 = \u2212 (2\u03c0nf) 2cn (t) + wn (t), (13) where the additive white noise components (t) have a spectral density qn. As Sa \ufffd rkka \ufffd et al. (2012) has shown, this model can be written in the state spatial formdx (t) = Fx (t) dt + L d\u03b2 (t) u (t) = Hx (t) + b + (t), (14) which is compatible with the frame presented in this article. In Equation (14) we also have a thrust term (which could also be time variable) to a noise layer used as a prelayer and a resonator to zero."}, {"heading": "6.3. Example Online Prediction Results", "text": "We are now applying the constructed quasi-periodic latent force model to predict the satellite orbit, and comparing the results with those achieved only with the deterministic model. We are considering an online prediction scenario in which we observe the position and velocity of the satellite at certain time intervals, and between these intervals the models are used to provide predictions. We are using 30 days of position data (collected every 15 minutes) of satellite 31 since early January 2010. The regions of the observed data are shown in shades of gray in Figure 3. In the quasi-periodic latent force model we are using 7 harmonic components for the model uR (t), uT (t) and 10 in uN (t). As a period, we have used a little less than one day that we have observed to be a clear period in the estimated latent forces. The rest of the model parameters have been optimized with respect to the marginal probability in which the smoothed mean model of integration of kuttas is given by a short-term segment of the GP model."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we have shown how nonlinear latent force models can be represented as nonlinear noise-driven state-of-the-art models, resulting in the application of efficient filtering and smoothing algorithms for state and parameter conclusions. The potential weakness of the approach is the underlying Gaussian approach to the state posterior, but as we have shown, there are many applications where the approach works well. The advantage of the approach is that it is computationally light compared, for example, with pure particle filtering and MCMC-based approaches, whose calculation requirements may be unfeasible for practical application."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors would like to thank Arno Solin, Janne Ojanen and anonymous reviewers for their feedback, which has significantly improved the work.
