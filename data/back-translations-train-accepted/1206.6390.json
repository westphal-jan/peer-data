In addition, we can imply a number of prior knowledge constraints K of the form X 99K Y (we do not call these positive constraints) or X 99K Y (negative constraints), where X, Y and other knowledge constraints must relate to modeled variables. A constraint X 99K Y (X 99 K Y) implies that X (is not) a causal ancestry of Y, i.e. there must (not) be a directed orbit X \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Y in P. Conversely, since the network is faithful to a certain distribution, if a path exists (we do not assume) that every piece of knowledge Y is caused in it."}, {"heading": "4.

Dealing with Inconsistent Prior Knowledge", "text": "Ideally, in this case, one should express uncertainty in both and derive new orientations from it in a probable but efficient way. However, such a procedure is not yet satisfactory. As an approximation, we now present algorithm 3, which constitutes a subset of K that is consistent with P and maximizes a score function that indicates preferences on the previous knowledge. For each piece of knowledge Ki-K, we use ui to denote the benefit of satisfying this knowledge in a MAG, and ci the cost (penalty) of unsatisfying skills. We can then define the score function of satisfying knowledge K-K: Sc (K) = Ki Ki Ki Ki + Ki Ki (K)."}, {"heading": "6. Experimental Evaluation", "text": "This year, it is so far that it is only a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "We present algorithms for including path constraints in PDAGs and PAGs that correspond to known, possibly indirect causal correlations, using a chronological traceability search with forward verification and a circumcision rule derived from the semantics of graphs, as well as an industry and cross-border variation in algorithms for handling knowledge that is not consistent with the given PDAG or PAG. Our experimental results show that typically, even some causal constraints can orient a significant number of edges. In a case study, we show how experimental studies (where some variables are manipulated) can be used to derive such causal constraints and incorporate them into an incomplete (i.e., structural) causal model. The algorithms could provide a basis for extensions that take into account the degree of belief in any limitation or network function."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank the reviewers for their helpful comments.
