Problem Definition", "text": "Suppose we have a finite set of elements X, {xi} and an identified subset R-X, whose members we will call targets. Let's consider the following problem. Suppose we do not know which members of X R belong a priori, but we can request binary observations y (x-X) successively for an undescribed element x-X. We would like to actively select a sequence of queries to maximize a given usefulness function.For the active search problem, we define the usefulness of a set of observations D, {(xi, yi)} as the number of targets found: u (D), \u2211 y. This simple expression, of course, describes the spirit of the problem defined above. For the active survey problem, we define the usefulness of a set of observations as the deviation of our induced probability distribution from the cardinality of R: u (D), \u2212 var [cardR | D].This expression also describes the objective of measurement: smaller surveys are preferred with error margins."}, {"heading": "3. Related Work", "text": "Active learning is a mature field with a large corpus of associated literature (Settles, 2010).In the active binary classification problem, the chosen target is usually linked to the characteristics of the associated probabilistic model.Examples include generalization errors (Zhu et al., 2003) and optimality criteria associated with Fisher information, such as A-optimality (Schein & Ungar, 2007).One of the simplest active learning methods for binary classification is sampling uncertainty (Lewis & Gale, 1994), which successively requests the label for point x with the greatest posterior variance: x, arg minx Pr (y = 1 | x, D) \u2212 1 / 2. Both goals considered in this paper are unusual in an active-learning context, as far as the authors know. A problem similar to the active search considered is the active discovery of hitherto invisible classes (He & Carbonell, 2008)."}, {"heading": "4. The Optimal Bayesian Policy", "text": "As already mentioned, our approach to actively searching for and measuring problems is motivated by Bayesian decision theory (we will then select a classification model that provides the subsequent probability of a point x based on previously observed data - hence we will assume that this model will receive a prioritization; however, the decision of theoretical analysis depends not on its number, but on the quantity of blank points. We will now assume that we will initially allow a fixed number of queries. In applications where the cost of obtaining a label is high, it is the total cost of the queries that limits their number rather than the quantity of blank points. We derive the policy for deciding the locations of our queries, which gradually result in the calculation of the expected usefulness of each of the remaining blank points, respecting the label for the point that we provide with maximum expected usefulness."}, {"heading": "5. Potential Gain from Looking Ahead", "text": "In this section, we will discuss the behavior of the \"step-optimal search policy versus the m-step policy, for\" < m. \"Let's first look at the behavior of the two-step policy versus the simple, greedy one-step policy. Note that the two-step policy allows us to make decisions that do not maximize the back probability."}, {"heading": "6. Bounding the Active Search Space", "text": "We will now discuss how, in certain situations, we can reduce the O (((2 cardX) benefit (1) required by the \"-step optimal active search policy.\" Our approach will include a \"branch and bound\" style strategy in which we will use a relatively inexpensive method of calculating inequalities in order to process sub-optimal branches of the search space from consideration, which will require the definition of a maximum of two inequalities. First, we will find a lower limit on the maximum \"-step active search,\" which will allow for maximum benefit between the unspecified points. Next, we will find an upper limit on the \"-step expected usefulness of a given, unspecified point, as a function of its current probability. Combining these limits together will ultimately provide us with a threshold that x with Pr (y = 1 x, D) < this approach cannot possibly be the optimal\" -step action. Following, we will assume that we start at Timest1 and Progress Timestep starting from a starting point of a \"Dep.\""}, {"heading": "7. Results", "text": "In our search experiments, we used a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier. We define nn (x) the neighbors closest to k of the point x in X and l-nn (x) the subset of nn (x) for which we currently have label observations. We define Pr (y = 1 | x, D), \u03b3 + \u2211 x-nn (x) y-n (x) y-n (x) 1. (7) Here, the constant g [0, 1] serves as a \"pseudo-number,\" smoothing out the probabilities at points that only a few labeled neighbors have. In our experiments, we have vivid, 1 / 10. This model worked empirically well, and we can easily derive the highest probability."}, {"heading": "7.1. Illustrative example", "text": "We start with a simple example problem that illustrates the behavior of the active search and active survey approaches in relation to the uncertainty in general very differently. We start with a simple example problem that illustrates the behavior of the active search and active survey approaches in relation to the uncertainty in relation to the sampling.Let I, [0, 1] 2 the unit is square. We repeated the following experiment 100 times. We selected 250 points evenly according to the random principle that formed our entrance area. Each point landing within the Euclidean distance 1 / 4 of each of the points (0, 0), (1, 0), (1), (1), (the four corners and the center) formed the target group R. We selected a point uniformly according to the random principle and added it and added its marking to a training set. We then used the one-step optimal active survey policy, which showed an optimal active measurement policy and uncertainty points were selected by the algorithms from the ten more points selected by the algorithms."}, {"heading": "7.3. The effect of search-space pruning", "text": "Finally, we measured the effect of our cross-industry and cross-border method described in Section 6. Using the same data and experimental setup as in the CiteSeerx experiment, we measured the time required to iterate the optimal \"-step lookahead search policy\" for 2 \u2264 \"\u2264 4, both with and without the benefit of our cutting method. These times were measured using 100 randomly selected start configurations; the results are summarized in Table 1. In this case, the effect of our cutting strategy is dramatic and allows us to broaden our search horizons far beyond what would otherwise have been possible."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusion", "text": "We introduced Bayesian Optimal Policy to two atypical problems of active learning related to binary classification, which we call active search and active surveying; the former focuses on actively identifying members of a set of identified targets as soon as possible, and the latter focuses on predicting the proportion of data set that belongs to a particular class; our approach was to define reasonable utility functions for these problems and derive optimal Bayesian policy for each of them; the optimal policy for each of these targets takes the same form, but in practice the behavior of each may vary dramatically due to the sharply contrasting underlying utility functions; in addition to introducing the active surveying problem, we expanded previous work on active search in two ways: First, we demonstrated a theoretical result showing that the potential benefit of more distant horizons is unlimited; and then we presented an industry and limited method of circumscribing exponential search that may be required for certain types of active search; and, the active search policy that may be applied to specific areas."}, {"heading": "Fouss, F., Pirotte, A., Renders, J-M, and Saerens, M.", "text": "Random-Walk Computation of Similarities between Nodes of a Graph with Application to Collaborative Recommendation. ieee Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 19 (3): 355-369, 2007."}, {"heading": "Garnett, R., Krishnamurthy, Y., Wang, D., Schneider, J.,", "text": "and Mann, R.
