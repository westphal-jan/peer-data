Introduction", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "2. Dependency-seeking clustering", "text": "Consider a p-dimensional random vector (rv) X and a q-dimensional rv Y, which represent two different sources of information about an interesting object. For example, multiple physical measurements of a patient and levels of different drugs administered can serve as two sources of information about medical treatment. We assume that X and Y contain cooperating samples (x1,.., xn) and (y1,., yn) with xi-Rp and yi-Rq, i = 1. The probable interpretation of CCA given by Bach & Jordan (2005) uses the following latent variable formulation: Z-Nd (0, Id), (X, Y) and yi-Rq-Block, i-Block, i-Block, i-Block, i = 1. The probable interpretation of CCA given by Bach & Jordan (2005) uses the following latent variable formulation: Z-Nd (0, Id), Y (X)."}, {"heading": "3. Copulas and Gaussian copulas", "text": "A multivariate distribution consists of univariate random variables that relate to each other through a dependency mechanism. Copulas provide a framework for separating the dependency structure from the marginal distributions. Formally, a d-dimensional copula is a multivariate distribution function C: [0, 1] d \u2192 [0, 1] with standard uniform margins. The following theorem Sklar (1959) determines the relationship between copulas and multivariate distributions. (Sklar) Let F have a common distribution function with margins F 1,.. (F d) Then there is a copula C: [0, 1] d \u2192 such a thatF relationship. (xd) = C (F 1),. (x1),., F d). Moreover, if the margins are continuous, then this copula is unique."}, {"heading": "4. Multi-view clustering with meta-Gaussian distributions", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1. Model specification", "text": "Consider the two Rv X = (X1,., Xp) and Y = (Y 1,., Y q). We assume that their common distribution is a Dirichlet prior mixture (DPM), where \u00b5G is the distribution of a Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1973) with the base distribution G0 and the concentration parameter \u03bb. New here is the choice of f (X, Y) | \u03b8, P. We model the boundary distributions and the dependency structure separately to allow more freedom: 1. The margins can be arbitrarily continuous distributions (provided the corresponding density is available): Xj | \u03b8 = Xj | surface types (F j | surface types, j x surface types, j = 1,."}, {"heading": "4.2. Bayesian inference", "text": "The separation of the modeling task between the specification of margins and the specification of the dependency structure for the previous distributions simplifies the selection of the previous distributions. If we assume a priority independence for \u03b8 and P, we can specify previous distributions for the margins and separately select a previous one for the parameters of the Copula CP. (2000) This previous one is usually a multivariate distribution into the space of the correlation matrices with uniform margins, i.e. Pij is a uniform variable for i 6 = j, and is associated with the inverse wishart distribution: if a coding matrix method is not available for the X method, we can distribute the standard InverseWishart models with the parameters Id and d + 1 degree of freedom, then we follow the corresponding correlation matrix R of the marginal distribution."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1. Simulated data", "text": "We simulate two different two-dimensional multi-view datasets with Gaussian intra-view dependency structure. The marginal distributions are Gaussian in the first view, and Beta or Exponential in the second. Each dataset consists of two clusters that can only be identified by taking into account interview dependencies. We initially simulated data points with a single cluster structure in each view, but a strong positive dependence between the first dimensions of the views, i.e. between X1 and Y 1. In a second step, we separated the data into two groups of different size and random permutation of their order within the groups to suppress any inter-view dependency within these groups. Figure 3 (bottom left panel) shows the resulting cluster structure in the common space of the two views, which are recovered by the copula mixing model. Parameters used for the simulations can be found in Table 1.Algorithm 1 Markov Chain SampC1."}, {"heading": "5.2. Real data", "text": "We perform a combined analysis of two sets of data that provide information on the regulation of gene expression in yeast under heat shock; each set is treated as a kind of view; the first set (published in Gasch et al.) offers gene expression phases measured at four time points; secondCM, view 1X1X 2GM1, view 1X1X 2CM, view 2Y1Y 2GM2, view 2Y1Y 2GM2, view 1X1X 2CM, view 1X1, view 2CM, view 2CM, view 2CM, which contains binding affinity between these genes and 6 different binding factors; similar data has already been analyzed in Klami & Kaski (2007). 5360 genes present in both views using a Gaussian dependency model."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "A fundamental aspect of clustering in dependence is that the partition has a semantic interpretation of dependence: the dependencies are captured by the cluster structure. However, this interpretation is only valid if the model is rich enough to adequately match each view, which can be particularly difficult for non-Gaussian data to achieve with existing models. This task becomes even more difficult as the dimensions of the views increase, as the model then allows a wide range of dependencies within the view while allowing for a sufficiently rich dependency structure within the view. The Kopula mixing model offers enough flexibility to cover both aspects: the margins can be specified separately for each dimension and the Gaussian copula allows for a wide range of dependencies within the view. Using a Gaussian copula also facilitates the conclusion and we offer an efficient MCMC mixing model. Experiments with simulated data show that the Kopula mixing model significantly improves cluster results."}], "references": [{"title": "A probabilistic interpretation of canonical correlation analysis", "author": ["F.R.
