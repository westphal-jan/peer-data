Matrix Completion - an Algebraic Problem", "text": "First of all, we present some definitions and notations that allow us to formulate the problem of matrix completion and to be able to present our results later on. The central observation is that the relevant sentences and maps in matrix completion are as follows: one begins with a lower ranking (m \u00b7 n) of matrix completion. Whether this is possible obviously depends on the known entries, and in this paper we will examine this question. We model the choice of entries as follows: Definition 2.1."}, {"heading": "2.2.

An Algebraic Combinatorial Algorithm", "text": "The necessary and sufficient conditions given in Propositions 2.12 and 2.13 give theoretical limits to the success of matrix completion. We would like to show that these conditions can also be used constructively to obtain new matrix completion algorithms. First, we describe an algorithm for noise-free entries with algorithm 1. It is based on the sufficient condition in Proposition 2.12, which is essentially algorithmic and with a slight modification yields an explicit procedure that completes the matrix by explicitly calculating entries for the R closing. Algorithm 1. Matrix completion by r closing. Input: A masked rank r matrix. (A) Output: The complete matrix A, or nil.1: Optional: Keep some necessary conditions in Proposition 2.13; e.g. Conditions (i) and (ii)."}, {"heading": "3. Experiments", "text": "In our simulations, we examine the necessary and sufficient conditions of Propositions 2,12 and 2,13 compared to our new algorithms (A).The presented version of Algorithm 1 uses heuristics to find the r-lockable subgraphs of G (B): For each edge in the bipartite graph G (A), the vertex degree in our comparison: The algorithm attempts to construct the lockable subgraphs from the highest degrees - in a certain number of attempts, the algorithm goes to the next vertex. We also include two state-of-art algorithms in our comparison: The nuclear standard heurist heuristiques in its entirety."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusion", "text": "In this thesis we have introduced a basic combinatorial algebra framework for the matrix completion problem, with which we were able to derive the first known necessary and sufficient conditions for the completion of a matrix in relation to the set of known entries, building on the introduced techniques that combine matrix completion with combinatorial graph theory and algebraic geometry. As a by-product, we have also obtained graph theoretical results. Subject to this sufficient condition, we have also been able to formulate an algorithm for the matrix completion problem that has proven to be competitive with known matrix completion algorithms and that works better than modern methods for small ranks. The results obtained lead us to argue that the study of the interactions between machine learning, algebraic geometry and combinatories has the potential to be extremely advantageous for the problem of matrix completion from any point of view."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank Takeaki Uno and Louis Theran for their valuable comments, which were partially supported by MEXT KAKENHI 22700138 and the global COE program \"The Research and Training Center for New Development in Mathematics.\""}], "references": [{"title": "A spectral regularization framework for multi-task structure learning", "author": ["A.
