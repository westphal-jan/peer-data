Introduction", "text": "Graphs are well-studied versatile representations of structured data and have thus become ubiquitous in many fields of application, such as chemistry and bioinformatics. Comparing graphs is a fundamental problem, and calculating meaningful similarity yardsticks is a prerequisite for applying a variety of machine learning algorithms to the field of graphs. Consequently, related problems have been extensively studied, taking into account key graph theory questions that are typically NP-hard, such as the maximum common subgraph problem. However, graph similarity can be defined in various ways, and their calculation does not necessarily require precisely solving these problems to obtain a similarity measurement suitable for a wide range of applications, such as ker-appearing in the proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012."}, {"heading": "1.1.

A graph of length n is a sequence of vertices (v0,.., vn) in such a way (vi, vi + 1) that a vertex v is for 0 \u2264 i < n. A graph is connected if at least one path exists between any pair of vertices and is otherwise separated.

Relation to the Pharmacophore Kernel", "text": "Mahe \u0301 et al.

To this end, a molecule is represented by a series of pairs M = (xi, li), R3 \u00b7 L} i, where xi is the coordinates of a feature i in a three-dimensional space and li is an associated label. The set of pharmacophores of a molecule M is P (M1) = (a1, a2, a3 = a2, a1 = a2, a2 6 = a3}. The apotheophor kernel is then defined as askp (M1, M2)."}, {"heading": "3.3. Kernel Computation", "text": "In this section, we propose an algorithm for calculating the CSI and subgraph matching kernels (=). Our technique is inspired by a classic result from Levi (1973), which shows a relationship between common subgraphs of two graphs and cliques in their product diagram. (V1, E1, l1) and G2 (V2, E2, l2), the (modular) product diagram GP = (VP, EP) of G1 and G2 is defined by VP = (v1, V1, V2, V2): l1 (v1) and EP, which contains an edge between two graphs (u1, u2).

Restriction to Subgraph Classes", "text": "In this section, we discuss limitations of certain classes of subgraphs, their relationship to cliques in the product graph, and appropriate modifications of the enumeration algorithm. Since locating a maximum clique or a maximum CSI is known to be a NP-hard problem, it may be necessary in practice to limit the size of the subgraphs under consideration. Changing algorithm 1 to stop recursion when a fixed maximum size k has been reached effectively limits the size of the cliques and thus the size of the matching subgraphs quantified by the number of verticals. Restricting to connected subgraphs can also significantly reduce the search space, especially if the graphs are sparse. Furthermore, separate subgraphs convey less structional information and can therefore be considered less relevant. This limitation can be realized by adapting a technique proposed by Koch (2001). A clique spanned by C-edges can only be modified to match a CSI algorithm, so that it can only be altered by a specific algorithm."}, {"heading": "3.3.2. Runtime Analysis", "text": "Complexity The runtime of the algorithm 1 depends on the number of cliques in the product diagram. Since there is a one-on-one correspondence between cliques and bijections that contribute to the core value, we can derive an upper limit for the number of cliques in GP by considering the number of possible bijections. There are (n k) induced subgraphs of size k in a diagram with n corners and up to k! isomorphisms between graphs of size k. Therefore, we have C (k) = k-i! (n2 i) \u2264 k-i = 0 (n1n2 i) cliques of size up to k in GP. Therefore, the worst case run time of the algorithm 1 (modified to stop recursion in depth k) O (nC (k) = O (knk + 1), where n = n1n2.Practical considerations The analysis of complexity shows that a reasonable performance can only be expected in practice size."}, {"heading": "4.

Results & Discussion", "text": "In terms of the classification accuracy of graphs with simple names, it is impossible to say which kernel can best be derived. CSM is proving to be the best way toward closer networking with attributes where WL and WLSP can no longer be applied. All approaches benefit from the additional vertex alignments that indicate the meaning of attributes, and CSM achieves the highest classification accuracy. Best of all are the attributes where WL and WLSP can best be applied. All alignments benefit from the additional vertex alignments that indicate the meaning of attributes, and CSM has attained."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion & Future Work", "text": "We have proposed a new graph core that incorporates complex graph structures that do not contain repeated vertices and fully supports assigned graphs. Experimental evaluation shows promising results for assigned graphs in chemistry and bioinformatics. Improving runtime for large data sets and large graphs remains work for the future. However, in practice, our approach is already working well for medium-sized graphs, large graphs when vertices and edge cores are sparse, or when they are limited to small or connected subgraphs. Therefore, we believe that assigned graphs are a viable alternative to existing approaches."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank Karsten Borgwardt and Nino Shervashidze for providing their kernel implementations and data sets.

While recently proposed kernels based on common subgraphs (Wale et al., 2008; Shervashidze et al., 2009) in general can not be applied to attributed graphs, our approach allows to rate mappings of subgraphs by a flexible scoring scheme comparing vertex and edge attributes by kernels. We show that subgraph matching kernels generalize several known kernels. To compute the kernel we propose a graphtheoretical algorithm inspired by a classical relation between common subgraphs of two graphs and cliques in their product graph observed by Levi (1973). Encouraging experimental results on a classification task of realworld graphs are presented.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
