We go back and reanalyse their subclasses, but this time using the more modern tool of parameterized complexity analysis. This provides new results that together with the old results give a more detailed picture of the complexity landscape. We demonstrate separation results not possible with standard complexity theory, which contributes to explaining why certain cases of planning have seemed simpler in practice than theory has predicted. In particular, we show that certain restrictions of practical interest are tractable in the parameterized sense of the term, and that a simple heuristic is sufficient to make a well-known partial-order planner exploit this fact.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Aug 2012 12:40:44 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2566v1", "(author's self-archived copy)"]], "COMMENTS": "(author's self-archived copy)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["christer b\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m", "yue chen", "peter jonsson", "sebastian ordyniak", "stefan szeider"], "accepted": true, "id": "1208.2566"}, "pdf": {"name": "1208.2566.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Complexity of Planning Revisited \u2013 A Parameterized Analysis", "authors": ["Christer B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m", "Yue Chen", "Peter Jonsson", "Sebastian Ordyniak", "Stefan Szeider"], "emails": ["christer.backstrom@liu.se,", "peter.jonsson@liu.se", "chen@kr.tuwien.ac.at,", "ordyniak@kr.tuwien.ac.at,", "stefan@szeider.net"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 120 8.25 66v1 [cs.AI] 13 Aug 2"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it will be able to fix and fix the mentioned bugs."}, {"heading": "2 Parameterized Complexity", "text": "We define the basic concepts of parameterized complexity and refer to other sources > problem of FPK classification (1999); Flum and Grohe (2006) for in-depth treatment. A parameterized problem is a set of pairs < I, k >, the instance in which I am the main body and k the parameters. The parameter is usually a non-negative integer. A parameterized problem is a constant that is tractable by both parameters (FPT) if there is an algorithm that solves each instance < I, k > the magnitude n in time f (k) nc, in which f (k) nc is an arbitrarily calculable function and c is a constant that is independent of n and k.

Then we can even relax P, so that for a constant d there can be at most d actions with the same effect. Proof is similar to that for Theorem 5, where the total number of causal links is limited by c (k + 1) and the branching factor in line 7 k + 1 + d. This is an important observation, since many application and example problems in planning satisfy these limitations, for example, many variants of the LOGISTICS domain used in international planning competitions, and the branching factor in line 7 k + 1 + d. This is an important observation, since many application and example problems in planning meet these limitations, for example, many variants of the LOGISTICS domain used in international planning competitions, and the branching factor in line 7 k + 1 + d. This is an important observation, as many application and example problems in planning, for example, meet these limitations, for example, many variants of the LOGISTICS domain used in international planning contests, which contribute to the gap between the theoretical planning parameters used by SNAR and NIN, as can explain this in international planning variants used by SNP."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank the anonymous reviewers for constructive comments.

We go back and reanalyse their subclasses, but this time using the more modern tool of parameterized complexity analysis. This provides new results that together with the old results give a more detailed picture of the complexity landscape. We demonstrate separation results not possible with standard complexity theory, which contributes to explaining why certain cases of planning have seemed simpler in practice than theory has predicted. In particular, we show that certain restrictions of practical interest are tractable in the parameterized sense of the term, and that a simple heuristic is sufficient to make a well-known partial-order planner exploit this fact.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
