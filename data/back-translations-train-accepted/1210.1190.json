Source codes for Hottopixx and GM come from the respective authors \"websites. In comparisons with Esser et al. (2012), it has been observed that it tends to select almost duplicate anchors, as also mentioned in Esser et al. (2012). This feature results in it consistently performing less favorably than other methods, unless the data is pre-processed adhoc to remove similar columns from X; therefore, we do not take Bitelines et al. (2012) any better than Hottora and Argori (since 2012)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Synthetic experiments", "text": "We perform a synthetic experiment in which a controlled amount of noise is injected to damage the separable structure. Each entry of the matrix W-R200 x 20 + is usually generated according to a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. The matrix H-R20 x 210 + is considered as [I20 x 20 H-N], in which each column of H-R20 x 190 + is generated according to a Gaussian distribution, whose parameters are uniformly selected in [0, 1]. The data matrix X is set to WH + N, at which each entry of the noise matrix N is i.i.i.d. generated according to a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and constant scope of development. Fig. 3 draws the fraction of the correctly recovered anchors (averaged over 10 runs for each value of \u03b4) against the noise level, which ranges from 0 to 1.5. The proposed x-ray (max) shows the best roughness resistance to the problem clearly followed by GV (although the problem is solvable)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Medium-scale Topic modeling problems", "text": "This year it is so far that it will be able to retrieve the mentioned rf the mentioned rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf ef the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the f the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the rf the f the rf the eg eg the eg the rf the f the rf the f the f the rf the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the f the"}, {"heading": "3.3 Large-scale Experiments", "text": "This year it is as far as never before in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "Our methods perform favorably compared to other recently proposed divisible NMF algorithms and provide highly scalable, minimal alternatives to existing local optimization techniques.
