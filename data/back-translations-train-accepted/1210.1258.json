Existing approaches for discovering latent structures often require the unknown number of hidden states as an input. In this paper, we propose a quartet based approach which is \\emph{agnostic} to this number. The key contribution is a novel rank characterization of the tensor associated with the marginal distribution of a quartet. This characterization allows us to design a \\emph{nuclear norm} based test for resolving quartet relations. We then use the quartet test as a subroutine in a divide-and-conquer algorithm for recovering the latent tree structure. Under mild conditions, the algorithm is consistent and its error probability decays exponentially with increasing sample size. We demonstrate that the proposed approach compares favorably to alternatives. In a real world stock dataset, it also discovers meaningful groupings of variables, and produces a model that fits the data better.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Oct 2012 23:30:24 GMT  (145kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1258v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["mariya ishteva", "haesun park", "le song"], "accepted": true, "id": "1210.1258"}, "pdf": {"name": "1210.1258.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Unfolding Latent Tree Structures using 4th Order Tensors", "authors": ["Mariya Ishteva", "Haesun Park"], "emails": ["mishteva@cc.gatech.edu", "hpark@cc.gatech.edu", "lsong@cc.gatech.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 121 0.12 58v1 [cs.LG] 3 Oct 2"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "2 Latent Tree Graphical Models", "text": "In this paper, we focus on discrete latent variables, in which conditional independence structures are defined by trees.

We created tree topologies by randomly splitting 16 observed variables recursively into two groups. Recursive splitting stops when there are only two nodes in a group. We introduced a hidden variable to join the two partitions in each recursion, and this results in a latent tree structure. The topology of the tree is controlled by a single partition parameter \u03b2, which controls the relative size of the first partition versus the second. If \u03b2 is near 0 or 1, we get trees of distorted shape, with a long path of hidden variables. If \u03b2 is near 0.5, the resulting latent trees are more balanced. In our experiments, we experimented with distorted latent trees \u03b2 = 0.2 and balanced trees \u03b2 = 0.5.

We offer conditions under which the algorithm is consistent and its error probability decreases exponentially with increasing sample size. In both simulated and real data sets, we have demonstrated the usefulness of our methods for discovering latent structures.

Existing approaches for discovering latent structures often require the unknown number of hidden states as an input. In this paper, we propose a quartet based approach which is agnostic to this number. The key contribution is a novel rank characterization of the tensor associated with the marginal distribution of a quartet. This characterization allows us to design a nuclear norm based test for resolving quartet relations. We then use the quartet test as a subroutine in a divide-and-conquer algorithm for recovering the latent tree structure. Under mild conditions, the algorithm is consistent and its error probability decays exponentially with increasing sample size. We demonstrate that the proposed approach compares favorably to alternatives. In a real world stock dataset, it also discovers meaningful groupings of variables, and produces a model that fits the data better.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
