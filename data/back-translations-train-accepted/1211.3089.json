However, in the face of an event and a related extensive collection of tweets, we face two fundamental problems in analyzing and understanding these, namely, extracting the topics covered in the event and in tweets, and segmenting the event into thematically coherent segments. Addressing the two issues is essential for applications such as computational advertising, community detection, journalistic investigation, playback of events, etc. While both current modeling and event segmentation have received considerable attention in recent years, they have mainly been viewed and examined as separate issues. For example, there has been significant efforts to develop Bayesian models that reflect the underlying themes from the document. (Lead, Ng, 2003, and Jordan Griffial)"}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Topic modeling methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Lead, Ng, and Jordan 2003) have achieved great success in discovering underlying themes from text documents. Recently, there has been increasing interest in developing better and more complex topic modeling programs. Further enhancements include (Dietz, Bickel, and Scheffer 2007), LinkPLSA-LDA (Nallapati et al. 2008), and RTM (Hofmann 2001) models of documents and their interconnectivity based on topic-specific distributions. Further enhancements include topic models (Dietz, Bickel, and Scheffer 2007), LinkPLSA-LDA (Nallapati et al. 2008), and RTM (Chang and Lead 2009). In addition, some work looks at the dynamics of topics that include a dynamic topic model (Lead and Lafferty 2006). Current efforts also include topic modeling on social media such as Ramage, Dumau and Libling 2010 and 2012."}, {"heading": "3 Joint modeling of Event and Twitter Feeds", "text": "In this section, we show how the event and its Twitter feeds can be represented by a hierarchical Bayesian model based on latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), so that topic modeling of the event / tweets and event segmentation can be achieved. Table 1 lists the notation used in this essay."}, {"heading": "3.1 Model", "text": "Our proposed model, called the Joint Event and Tweets LDA (ET-LDA), aims to model specific tweets. (1) The themes of the event and their development (event segmentation), as well as (2) the associated tweets and tweet behavior of the crowd. Therefore, the model has two main components, each capturing a perspective of our goal. The conceptual model of the ET-LDA is shown in the illustration that an event is formed by discrete sequential segments, both parts of which have the LDA-like model and are connected by the link that links the topical influences of the event to its Twitter feeds.Specifically, in the event part, we assume that an event is formed by discrete sequential segments, each of which discusses a particular set of topics. A segment consists of one or many coherent paragraphs Available1General Topics remains constant through transcripted segments."}, {"heading": "3.2 Inference in the Model via Gibbs Sampling", "text": "The calculation of the rear distribution of the hidden variables zs, zt, cs, and st is intractable for the ET-LDA model because of the coupling between \u03b1, \u03b2. Therefore, in this paper we use approximate methods such as collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm (Griffiths et al. 2004) for the parameter estimation. Note: Gibbs sampling allows learning a model by iteratively updating each latent variable. To start with the remaining variables, we need the conditional probability P (zt, zs, ws, wt, cs, st, z \u2032 t, z \u2032 s, ws, wt, c \u2032 s, c \u2032 s, c \u2032 t) where z \u2032 s, c \u2032 s, c \u2032 s, c \u2032 s, c \u2032 s, c \u2032 s, s \u2032 s \u2032 s, s \u2032 s \u2032 s, vectors of assignors of topics, segment indicators and segment choice indicators for all in the collection."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "In this section, we examine the effectiveness of our proposed common model against other baselines. Three main tasks are undertaken to evaluate the ET-LDA: (1) the topics extracted from the entire corpus (tweets and transcripts of events) are compared with the tweets extracted separately from the LDA model, (2) the ability to predict current influences of events on invisible tweets in the test set is compared with LDA, and (3) the quality of event segmentation is compared with LCSeg - a popular HMM-based segmentation tool in literature (Galley et al. 2003).Data Sets and Experimental Setup We use two large tweet datasets associated with two events from different domains: (1) President Obama's speech in the Middle East on May 19, 2011, and (2) the Republican primary debate on September 7, 2011."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we have described a common statistical model ETLDA, which characterizes current influences between an event and related Twitter feeds (tweets). Our model allows thematic modeling of the event / tweets and segmentation of the event in a unified framework. We evaluated ET-LDA both quantitatively and qualitatively based on three tasks. Based on the experimental results, our model shows significant improvements over basic methods. We believe that this paper represents the first step towards understanding complex interactions between events and social media feedback. In fact, ET-LDA can also deal with other forms of text sources that describe an event, such as how people react to an event (and how it differs from the reactions of journalists in the media) by applying our model to news articles and social media feedback about that event."}], "references": [{"title": "Statistical models for text segmentation", "author": ["Berger Beeferman", "D.
