Update for Z'i is done by (10), while for the masses in Theorem 2: Gibbs update is done for Z'i: Z'i | Rest-Exp (w *)."}, {"heading": "3 Dynamic Bayesian nonparametric ranking models", "text": "In this section, we develop an extension of the Bayesian non-parametric Plackett-Luce model to model rankings that vary over time, where the evaluation parameters of items can change smoothly over time and are reflected in a changing ranking order. Given a number of times indexed by t = 1, 2,..., we can model rankings at a time t using a gamma method that distributes the random measurement Gt as in Section 2.2, with the Markov dependence within the scale order (Gt) allowing a dependence between rankings over time."}, {"heading": "3.1 Pitt-Walker dependence model", "text": "We will construct a dependent sequence (Gt) that marginally follows a gamma process (\u03b1, \u03c4, H). Since Gt is atomic, we can write it in the form: Gt = \u00b2 lifetime k = 1 wtk\u03b4Xtk (24), in which a random variable Ct with conditional law is defined: Kt \u2212 Gt = 1 ctk\u03b4Xtk ctk | Gt \u0445 Poisson (\u03c6twtk) (25), in which t > 0 is a dependency parameter. Using the same method as in Section 2.3, we can show that the law is the Gt (\u03b1, H).

We extend the results of the previous section by characterizing the back list and developing a Gibbs pattern for the dynamic model.Since each observed element must at any time be an atom in its random measurement quantity Gt, and atoms in Gt can spread over adjacent random measurements (Pitt-Walker dependency model), we conclude that the set of all observed items (through all times) must contain all fixed items in the rear measurement quantity Gt. So, if we leave X, k = 1, k = 1, we are all observed items."}, {"heading": "3.3 Continuous time formulation using superprocesses", "text": "The dynamic model described in the previous section is formulated for discrete time data. If the time interval between ranking observations is not constant, it is desirable to work instead with dynamic models that evolve over continuous time, with the underlying random measurements (Gt) defined across all t-R, but with observations at a discrete set of times t1 < t2 < \u00b7 \u00b7. Here, we propose a continuous time model based on the Dawson Watanabe superprocess [14, 15] (see also [16, 17, 18, 19], which is a diffusion across the measurement space using the gamma process."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "We apply the Plackett-Luce discrete time model to the New York Times bestseller data, which consist of the weekly top 20 bestseller lists from June 2008 to April 2012 in various categories.

We consider that the correlation parameter \u03c6t = \u03c6 is constant over time, and assign flat improper priorities p (\u03b1) 1 / \u03b1 and p (\u03c6) 1 / \u03c6.
