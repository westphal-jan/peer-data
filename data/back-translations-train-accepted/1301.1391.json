The aim of this paper is to investigate theoretically how SAT can be utilized for the efficient solution of problems that are harder than NP or co-NP. In particular, we consider the fundamental reasoning problems in propositional disjunctive answer set programming (ASP), Brave Reasoning and Cautious Reasoning, which ask whether a given atom is contained in at least one or in all answer sets, respectively. Both problems are located at the second level of the Polynomial Hierarchy and thus assumed to be harder than NP or co-NP. We cannot transform these two reasoning problems to SAT in polynomial time, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jan 2013 02:29:37 GMT  (156kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1391v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary"], ["v2", "Thu, 2 May 2013 17:17:43 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1391v2", "A short version will appear in the Proceedings of the Proceedings of the 27th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI'13).

In particular, we show transformations from Brave and Skeptical Reasoning to Sat that occur temporally O (2kn2), where k is a structural parameter of the instance and n the input size. In other words, the reduction is fixable for the parameter k. As parameter k, we take the size of a smallest backdoor in relation to the class of normal (i.e., disjunction-free) programs. Such a backdoor is a set of atoms that make the program normal when it is deleted.

As instances from ConformantPlanninger have small backdoors, our translation seems practicable for these instances. Furthermore, we compared the size of a smallest strong normal backdoor with the size of a smallest strong horn backdoor [spruce and pointers, 2012] for selected sets. It turns out that for ConformantPlanning, smallest strong normal backdoors are significantly smaller (0.7% vs. 8.8% of the total number of atoms)."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "We have shown that small backdoors to normality capture structural properties of disjunctive asp instances, which lead to a reduction in problem complexity. In particular, small backdoors to normality allow fpttranslation from asp to satellite, thus reducing the complexity of fundamental asp problems from the second level of the polynomial hierarchy to the first level. Therefore, the size of a smallest normal backdoor is a structural parameter that allows a tractable reduction in complexity with fixed parameters without the problem itself becoming tractable. Our reduction of the complexity barrier offers a new way to utilize tractability with fixed parameters and extend its applicability. In fact, our approach outlined above for asp is very general and could be applicable to a wide range of other hard combinatorial problems beyond NP or co-NP. We hope that our work will inspire further investigations in this direction, as recently introduced to the application of strictures."}], "references": [{"title": "editors", "author": ["Abdelwaheb Ayari", "David Basin.

The aim of this paper is to investigate theoretically how Sat can be utilized for the efficient solution of problems that are harder than NP or co-NP. In particular, we consider the fundamental reasoning problems in propositional disjunctive answer set programming (Asp), Brave Reasoning and Skeptical Reasoning, which ask whether a given atom is contained in at least one or in all answer sets, respectively. Both problems are located at the second level of the Polynomial Hierarchy and thus assumed to be harder than NP or co-NP. One cannot transform these two reasoning problems into Sat in polynomial time, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses. We show that certain structural aspects of disjunctive logic programs can be utilized to break through this complexity barrier, using new techniques from Parameterized Complexity. In particular, we exhibit transformations from Brave and Skeptical Reasoning to Sat that run in time O(2n) where k is a structural parameter of the instance and n the input size. In other words, the reduction is fixed-parameter tractable for parameter k. As the parameter k we take the size of a smallest backdoor with respect to the class of normal (i.e., disjunction-free) programs. Such a backdoor is a set of atoms that when deleted makes the program normal. In consequence, the combinatorial explosion, which is expected when transforming a problem from the second level of the Polynomial Hierarchy to the first level, can now be confined to the parameter k, while the running time of the reduction is polynomial in the input size n, where the order of the polynomial is independent of k. We show that such a transformation is not possible if we consider backdoors with respect to tightness instead of normality. We think that our approach is applicable to many other hard combinatorial problems that lie beyond NP or co-NP, and thus significantly enlarge the applicability of Sat.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
