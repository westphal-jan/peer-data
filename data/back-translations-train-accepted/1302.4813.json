Such structures can be formalized by the notion of a frame (a.k.a. template), which comprises a set of related events and prototypical participants and event transitions. Identifying frames is a prerequisite for information extraction and natural language generation, and is usually done manually. Methods for inducing frames have been proposed recently, but they typically use ad hoc procedures and are difficult to diagnose or extend. In this paper, we propose the first probabilistic approach to frame induction, which incorporates frames, events, participants as latent topics and learns those frame and event transitions that best explain the text. The number of frames is inferred by a novel application of a split-merge method from syntactic parsing. In end-to-end evaluations from text to induced frames and extracted facts, our method produced state-of-the-art results while substantially reducing engineering effort.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 05:47:32 GMT  (149kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4813v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jackie chi kit cheung", "hoifung poon", "lucy vanderwende"], "accepted": true, "id": "1302.4813"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4813.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Probabilistic Frame Induction\u2217", "authors": ["Jackie Chi Kit Cheung", "Hoifung Poon"], "emails": ["jcheung@cs.toronto.edu", "hoifung@microsoft.com", "lucyv@microsoft.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "In fact, it is not that it is a way of imagining it, how one imagines it, how one imagines it, how one imagines it, how one imagines it and how one imagines it.

Let F be a set of frames, with each frame F = (EF, SF) comprising a unique series of events EF and slots SF. In the face of a documentD and a word w inD, Zw = (f, e) represents an assignment from w to frame f, F and frame element e, Ef and Sf. At the core of ProFinder is a generative model PTB (D, Z) that defines a joint distribution across document D and the assignment of the frame to its words Z. In the face of a series of documents D, frame induction in ProFinder boils down to determining the number of frames, events and slots and learning the parameters by summarizing the latent assignments Z to maximize the probability of the document."}, {"heading": "3.1 Base Model", "text": "In this paper, we design our ProFinder model to cover three types of dependencies. - A sentence that contains one or more clauses, each expressing a minimum unit, is unlikely to be a framework in which the words are associated with a framework. - On the other hand, clauses can pass between clauses, and we assume that the framework of a clause only depends on the clauses in which the clauses depend on the clauses. - The clauses will depend on the clauses in which the clauses are derived from the clauses. - The clauses from the clauses themselves, which state that the clauses come from the clauses. - The clauses from the clauses are automatically extracted from the dependency and further decomposed. - Let's see the experiments from the details."}, {"heading": "3.2 Model refinements", "text": "The basic model captures the most important dependencies in the event narrative, but it can be easily expanded to use additional linguistic intuition. ProFinder includes three such refineries. Background Frames Event narratives often contain general content interferences that are common to all frames. Thus, ATTRIBUTION is commonplace to describe who gives a specific quote or fact. To avoid contamination frames with generic content, we introduce a background frame with its own events, slots and emission distributions, and a binary switch variable Bi that determines whether clause i is generated from the actual content frame Fi (CNT) or Background (BKG). We also specify that when the background is chosen, the same remains as the previous clause."}, {"heading": "3.3 Full generative story", "text": "In summary, the distributions learned from our model are the standard distributions PBKG (B), PF \u2212 INIT (F \u00b2), PE \u2212 INIT (E \u00b2), the transition distributions PF \u2212 TRAN (Fi + 1 | Fi), PE \u2212 TRAN (Egg + 1 | Egg) and the emission distributions PSLOT (S | E, A, B), PE \u2212 HEAD (e \u2212 E, B), PA \u2212 HEAD (a | S), PA \u2212 DEP (dep | S). We used additive smoothing with uniform funnel priors for all multinomials. The general generative history of our model is as follows: 1. Draw a Bernoulli distribution for PBKG (B) 2. Draw the frame, event and slit distributions (slot)."}, {"heading": "3.4 Learning and Inference", "text": "Our generative model allows efficient conclusions through dynamic programming. Especially after the collapse of the latent mapping of frame, event and background into a single hidden variable for each clause, the expectation and the most likely mapping can be calculated using standard forward-backwards and Viterbi algorithms. Parameter learning can be done with EM by alternating the calculation of the expected number of events and slots. One solution is to adopt nonparametric methods using incremental EM, which has better and faster convergence properties than standard EM (Liang and Klein, 2009). The optimal number of events and slots is a challenge."}, {"heading": "4 MUC-4 Entity Extraction Experiments", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.
