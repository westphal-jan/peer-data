MAP inference (or, alternatively, MPE inference) is an important type of probable inference in graphical models that are also used as subroutine in numerous weight learning algorithms. MAP inference often translates into improved learning performance. Since Markov logic and Domingos is 2006, the most widely used statistical learning method (SRL) is formalized."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "The TUFFY system (Niu et al. 2011) deals with relational database management systems for soil-Markov logic networks, which are used more efficiently. TUFFY also runs on the soil model, which initially tries to split into separate components. MAP queries in SRL models can be formulated as integral linear programs (ILPs). In this context, interface inferences (CPI) are performed in several iterations, which it initially tries to divide into separate components. MAP queries in SRL models can be formulated as integral linear programs (ILPs). In each of these constellations, interface inferences (CPI) that have shown remarkable performance are solved (Riedel 2008). In each CPI iteration, only the soil formulas are violated by the current intermediate solution."}, {"heading": "Markov Logic", "text": "Markov logic is a first-order template language that combines first-order logic with loglinear graphical models. First, we examine the non-functional first-order logic (Genesereth and Nilsson 1987). Here, a term is either a constant or a variable. An atom p (t1,..., tn) consists of a predicate p / n of the art n followed by n terms ti. A literal \"is an atom a or its negation \u00ac a. A clause is a disjunction '1. The variables in clauses are always assumed to be universally quantified. The manufacturing base H is the set of all possible (instantiated) atoms. Each subset of the manufacturing base is a manufacturing interpretation. A Markov logic network M is a finite group of pairs (Fi, wi i \u2264 n, where each mode of operation is a prefabrication logic and wi-R.

The proposed approach aggregates ground clauses that lead to smaller symmetries and auxiliary symmetries. First, we show that evidence is often introduced symmetries in the resulting sets of ground clauses and clauses to test whether the ILP constraints are in the form of permutations of their columns and rows."}, {"heading": "Parallelism and Implementation", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "With the following experiments we evaluate whether and to what extent ROCKIT (a) reduced the number of constraints in the ILP formulation, (b) reduced the total time, and (c) exceeded the state of the art MLN systems. To ensure a fair comparison, we made a comparison with three MLN systems ALCHEMY (Domingos et al. 2012), MARKOV THEBEAST also with the ILP Solver Gurobi. Furthermore, we investigate whether and to what extent the performance of ROCKIT increases with the number of available cores of a common memory architecture. All experiments were conducted on a standard PC with 8 GB of RAM and 2 cores with 2.4 GHz, unless there are several established benchmark MLNs for empirical evaluation."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "We presented ROCKIT, a system for parallel MAP inference in SRL models that combines CPI and CPA.
