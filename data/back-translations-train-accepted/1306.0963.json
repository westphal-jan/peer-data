The human-robot interface has long been identified as a major bottleneck in the use of these robotic systems. (Jones et al. 2002; Cummings, Brzezinski and Lee 2007; Barnes et al. 2011; much of this previous work has focused on the simplicity of deployment in \"execution time.\""}, {"heading": "Problem Formulation", "text": "Civil protection teams are increasingly using web-based planning tools to plan their operations (Di Ciaccio, Pullen and Breimyer 2011), with dozens to hundreds of responders signing up to plan their deployment using audio / video conferencing, text chat and annotable maps. In this work, we focus on determining the final plan based on the text data that can be logged from chats or transcribed speeches. This section formally describes our problem formulation, including the inputs and outputs of our inference algorithm."}, {"heading": "Planning Problem", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is not a country, but in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a region and in which it is a country."}, {"heading": "Algorithm Output", "text": "The output of the algorithm is a inferred final plan, which is scanned from the probability distribution against final plans. The final plan has a representation similar to the structured utterance labels and is presented as an ordered tuple of grounded predicates. Predicates in each set represent parallel actions, and the arrangement of the propositions indicates the order. In contrast to the utterance labels, the order of the relationships in the final plan represents the absolute order in which the actions are to be performed. For example, a plan can be presented as ({A1, A2}, {A3}, {A4, A5, A6}), where Ai is a predicate."}, {"heading": "Technical Approach and Related Work", "text": "It is natural to take a probabilistic approach to the plan conclusion problem as we work with noisy data, but the combination of a small amount of noisy data and a very large number of possible plans means that an approach that uses typical uninformative predictions about plans will often not converge in time with the team's plan. This problem could also be addressed as a logical problem of partial order planning if there was no noise in the utterances. In other words, if the team only discusses the subplans related to the final plan and does not make mistakes or revisions, then a plan generator like a PDDL solver (Coles et al. 2009) could produce the final plan with global sequencing. Unfortunately, human conversation data is sufficiently loud to anticipate this approach. This motivates a combined approach. We are building a probabilistic generative model for the structured statement observations."}, {"heading": "Algorithm", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Generative Model", "text": "In this section, we explain the generative model of human team planning (Figure 2), which we use to derive the final plan of the team from it. We start with a latent plan variable, which must be derived by observing utterances in the planning session. The model generates each utterance in the conversation by describing in detail below a subset of the predicates in the plan and calculating the relative order in which they appear in the utterance. This mapping from the absolute order in the plan to the relative order of the predicates. As the conversation is short and the noise level is high, our model does not differentiate between utterances based on the order in which they appear in the conversation. We describe the generative model step by step: 1. Variable plan: The variable plan in Figure 2 is defined as an ordered group of predicates and represents the final plan agreed by the team."}, {"heading": "Gibbs Sampling", "text": "There are two latent variables for the sample (Q = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7"}, {"heading": "Experimental Evaluation", "text": "In this section, we evaluate the performance of our planinference algorithm through initial proof-of-concept experiments and show that we are able to infer the final plan of a human team with 83% accuracy on average.

Human Team Planning Data We have designed a web-based collaboration tool that was modeled using the NICS system (Di Ciaccio, Pullen, and Breimyer 2011), but with a modification that requires the team to communicate soley via text chat. Twenty-three teams of two (a total of 46 participants) were recruited by Amazon Mechanical Turk and the larger Boston area. Recruitment was limited to participants in the U.S. to increase the likelihood that participants were fluent in English. Each team was equipped with the fictitious rescue scenario described in this paper, and asked to plan a collaborative rescue operation."}, {"heading": "Future Work", "text": "We present an algorithm that combines a probabilistic approach with logical plan validation to derive a plan from the human team discussion.
