That is, the successive resample steps result in the particle diversity being very low for times that are far from the end point. To address these problems, we propose to use a sampler for particles of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC, [3, 13]). PMCMC relies on SMC to generate samples of the highly correlated state pathways within an MCMC sampler. We use a special PMCMC sampler called Particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling (PGAS, [4])).

If the previous one is factored through the hyperparameters between these two groups, we will obtain p (\u03b8 | x0: T, y0: T) p (\u03b8y | x0: T, y0: T) p (\u03b8x | x0: T). Thus, we can scan scan scan scan scan the two groups of hyperparameters independently of each other.

Furthermore, by introducing a sparse GP model, we can reduce the complexity to O (M2T), where M T. In Section 4.1, we present the sparse GP model, and in Section 4.2, we provide insight into the efficient implementation of both the vanilla GP and the sparse GP."}, {"heading": "4.1 FIC Prior over the State Trajectory", "text": "We do not regard the resulting model as an approximation of GP-SSM, it is still a GP-SSM, but with another previous superfunction. As a result, we expect it to sometimes exceed its non-sparse version, as happens with its regression siblings [16]. \u2212 Most sparse GP methods can be formulated in relation to a set of so-called inducing variables [17]. These variables live in the space of latent function and have a set I of corresponding inducing inputs. The assumption is that, due to the inducing variables, the latent functional values are mutually independent. Although the inducing variables are analytically marginalized - this is the key to the model not remaining parametric - the inducing inputs must be chosen so that, informally speaking, they cover the same region of the input area covered by the data."}, {"heading": "4.2 Implementation Details", "text": "As stated above, it is crucial to repeat the calculations over time to determine the conversion aspects of FIC.There are two costly operations of the CPF-AS algorithm: (i) the scanning of the previous (5), which is the calculation of (3b) and (3c) and (ii) the scanning of probabilities according to (6).Both operations can be performed efficiently by scanning the matrix of the K (3) and (3) matrix and (3) and (3) the scanning of probabilities according to (6).Both operations are performed efficiently by scanning the matrix of the K (3) and (4), (4), (4), 5 (4 (4) and (5), 6 (4), 6 (6 (5)."}, {"heading": "5 Learning the Dynamics", "text": "The algorithm 1 provides us with a tool to calculate p (x0: T, \u03b8 | y1: T).

One of the difficulties of this system is that the smoothing density p (x0: T | y0: T) is multimodal, since no information about the character of xt is available in the observations. The system is simulated for T = 200 time steps, using log normal priors for the hyperparameters, and the PGAS sampler is then executed for 50 iterations with N = 20 particles. To illustrate the ability of the GP-SSM-SSM to use a parametric model as the base function."}, {"heading": "6.2 Learning a Cart and Pole System", "text": "The dynamics of the system can be described by four states and a series of nonlinear ordinary differential equations [20]. We learn a GP-SSM based on 100 observations of the state corrupted by Gaussian noise. Although the training set examines only a small area of the four-dimensional state space, we can learn a model of dynamics that can provide predictions like the one in Figure 3 one step ahead. We obtain a predictive distribution in the form of a mixture of Gaussians from which we represent the first and second moments. Crucially, the learned model reports different amounts of uncertainty in different regions of the state space. Note, for example, the narrower error bars in some states between t = 320 and t = 350. This is because the model is closer to the predictions that are made in the areas where the predictions are made."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "A key contribution to this is that our approach maintains the full non-parametric expressivity of the model, made possible by the marginalization of the state transitional function, which leads to a non-trivial consequence problem, which we solve using a customized PGAS sampler. A special feature of our approach is that the latent states from the smoothing distribution can be sampled even when the transitional function of the state is unknown. Assumptions about the smoothness and economy of this function, previously embodied by the GP, are sufficient to obtain high-quality smoothing distributions. Once samples from the smoothing distribution are available, they can be used to describe a posterior of the transitional function of the state, in contrast to the conventional approach to inference in dynamic systems, where smoothing is performed on the basis of a model of state transitional dynamics."}], "references": [{"title": "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning", "author": ["C.E.
