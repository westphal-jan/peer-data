Our starting point is a new corpus of requests annotated for politeness, which we use to evaluate aspects of politeness theory and to uncover new interactions between politeness markers and context. These findings guide our construction of a classifier with domain-independent lexical and syntactic features operationalizing key components of politeness theory, such as indirection, deference, impersonalization and modality. Our classifier achieves close to human performance and is effective across domains. We use our framework to study the relationship between politeness and social power, showing that polite Wikipedia editors are more likely to achieve high status through elections, but, once elevated, they become less polite. We see a similar negative correlation between politeness and power on Stack Exchange, where users at the top of the reputation scale are less polite than those at the bottom. Finally, we apply our classifier to a preliminary analysis of politeness variation by gender and community.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 20:00:09 GMT  (103kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6078v1", "To appear at ACL 2013. 10pp, 3 fig.

Is it worth paying those costs? We address this question by studying courtesy in the context of the editorial voting system of the Wikipedia community of editors.7 Among Wikipedia editors, status is an outstanding social variable (Anderson et al., 2012). Administrators (administrators) are editors who have been granted certain rights, including the ability to block other editors and protect or delete articles. 7 Administrators have a higher status than ordinary editors (non-administrators), and this distinction seems to be widely recognized in the community (Burke and Kraut, 2008b; Leskovec et al., 2010; DanescuNiculescu-Mizil et al, 2012)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Politeness and power", "text": "In fact, it is that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able, that we are able to establish ourselves in the region."}, {"heading": "6 Related work", "text": "Courtesy has been a central concern of modern pragmatic theory since its inception (Grice, 1975; Lakoff, 1973; Lakoff, 1977; Leech, 1983; Brown and Levinson, 1978) because it is a source of pragmatic enrichment, social significance and cultural variation (Harada, 1976; Matsumoto, 1988; 12Due to the limited size of human-characterized data, however, we could not control the role of the user in the stack exchange's reputation experiment."}, {"heading": "PL name Politeness Top quartile", "text": "Ide, 1989; Blum-Kulka and Kasper, 1990; BlumKulka, 2003; Watts, 2003; Byon, 2006). Aspects of this theory have been studied from game theory perspectives (Van Rooy, 2003) and applied to language generation systems for interactive narratives (Walker et al., 1997), cooking instructions (Gupta et al., 2007), translation (Faruqui and Pado, 2012), spoken dialogue (Wang et al., 2012) and subjectivity analysis (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012), among others. In recent years, politeness has been studied in online contexts. Researchers have identified differences in politeness that are marked across different contexts and media types (Herring, 1994; Brennan and Ohaeri, 1999; Duthler, 2006) and between different social groups (Burke and Kraut, 2008a)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We construct and publish a large collection of courtesy-annotated requests and use them to evaluate key aspects of the theory of courtesy. We build a courtesy classifier that achieves near-human performance and use it to examine the relationship between courtesy and social factors such as power, status, gender and community membership. We hope that the publicly available collection of commented requests will allow further investigation of courtesy and its relationship to social factors, as this paper has only just begun to explore this area."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Jean Wu for carrying out the AMT Annotation and all participating Turks.

These findings guide our construction of a classifier with domain-independent lexical and syntactic features operationalizing key components of politeness theory, such as indirection, deference, impersonalization and modality. Our classifier achieves close to human performance and is effective across domains. We use our framework to study the relationship between politeness and social power, showing that polite Wikipedia editors are more likely to achieve high status through elections, but, once elevated, they become less polite. We see a similar negative correlation between politeness and power on Stack Exchange, where users at the top of the reputation scale are less polite than those at the bottom. Finally, we apply our classifier to a preliminary analysis of politeness variation by gender and community.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
