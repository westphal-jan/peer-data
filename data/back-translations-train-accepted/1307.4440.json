We perform our analysis within the framework of parameterized complexity, which supports a rigorous worst-case complexity analysis that takes into account the structural properties of the input in terms of parameters. A central concept of parameterized complexity is the traceability of defined parameters that extends the classical concept of polynomial time traceability by taking advantage of the effect of the structural properties of the input problem. We draw a detailed map of the parameterized complexity landscape of several problem variants that occur in the context of case-based planning.

Conservative re-use of plans maximizes the unchanged part of the known solution. The authors showed that such re-use of plans is not demonstrably more efficient than the creation of plans. Furthermore, they show that the determination of the maximum re-usable part of the saved solution is an additional source of hardship. Liberatore (2005) examined the problem of re-use of plans in another way and interpreted the case (or the base case) as a \"hint\" that makes the search for the solution plan more informed. The complexity results he provided do not improve the complexity of the uninformed plan creation. However, it provides a comprehensible compilation of planning cases that differ from the stored instances only in a constant number of assessments that differ from the original state and goal."}, {"heading": "Parameterized Complexity of Plan Reuse", "text": "In this paper, we cannot rule out the parameterized complexity of the reuse of a plan and where a similar plan is needed. However, since this work is motivated by the reuse of a plan in the context of case-based planning, we use assumptions that are common in case-based approaches to ensure that there is a solution at hand that can be reused. We also consider a more specific form of plan reuse (case reuse) and generalizations that result from the fact that similar problems in their general form are no better than the classical complexity of plan reuse. Liberatore (2005) has shown that it will be PSPACE-complete. However, the case-based approach assumes that similar problems have similar solutions (Leake 1996), meaning that cases can either be used to achieve a solution by applying only a limited number of changes or will not be helpful in finding a solution."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Within the framework of parameterized complexity, we provided theoretical results to identify situations where the re-use of a plan is demonstrably traceable. We drew a detailed map of the parameterized complexity landscape of several problem variants that occur in the context of case-based planning. Specifically, we considered the problem of re-use of an existing plan by imposing various parameter constraints, such as the number of steps that can be added to the existing plan in order to turn it into a solution for the planning instance. Results show that the fact that the number of modification measures is small does not guarantee traceability on its own. Furthermore, we must limit the number of measures that can be added to the modifications, indicating the need for a good heuristic function that identifies a limited number of measures that are used for modifications. In the future, these results may be expanded to include richer planning formalisms, e.g. by considering different types of prerequisites or using them in conjunction with specific expressions or variables."}], "references": [{"title": "Case-based reasoning: foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches", "author": ["A.

To overcome this high worst-case complexity, various heuristics, restrictions, and relaxations of planning problems have been developed that work surprisingly well in practical settings (Hoffmann 2001; Helmert 2006). Among the heuristic approaches is case-based planning, which proceeds from the idea that significant planning efforts may be saved by reusing previous solutions (Kambhampati and Hendler 1992; Veloso 1994). This approach is based on the assumption that planning tasks tend to recur and that if the tasks are similar, then so are their solutions. Empirical evidence suggests that this assumption holds in many settings, and that the case-based approach works particularly well if the planning tasks require complex solutions while the modifications required on the known plans are considerably small. So far the research on the worst-case complexity of case-based planning did not take into account the essential assumption that similar planning tasks require similar solutions.

For the hardness result, consider the case where the number k of values allowed in the set of actions A is 2. The problem then reduces to the problem of finding a solution plan for the Boolean planning instance \u03a0, in case we let (c, J) = (\u01eb,G).

Researchers have been investing significant efforts to develop heuristics or restrictions to make planning practically feasible. Case-based planning is a heuristic approach where one tries to reuse previous experience when solving similar problems in order to avoid some of the planning effort. Plan reuse may offer an interesting alternative to plan generation in some settings. We provide theoretical results that identify situations in which plan reuse is provably tractable. We perform our analysis in the framework of parameterized complexity, which supports a rigorous worst-case complexity analysis that takes structural properties of the input into account in terms of parameters. A central notion of parameterized complexity is fixed-parameter tractability which extends the classical notion of polynomial-time tractability by utilizing the effect of structural properties of the problem input. We draw a detailed map of the parameterized complexity landscape of several variants of problems that arise in the context of case-based planning. In particular, we consider the problem of reusing an existing plan, imposing various restrictions in terms of parameters, such as the number of steps that can be added to the existing plan to turn it into a solution of the planning instance at hand.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
