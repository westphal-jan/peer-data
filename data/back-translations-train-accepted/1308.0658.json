It is argued by researchers that semi-supervised learning is an effective approach to this problem since it is capable to mitigate the manual labeling effort which is usually expensive and time-consuming. However, there was a long-term debate on the effectiveness of unlabeled data in text classification. This was partially caused by the fact that many assumptions in theoretic analysis often do not hold in practice. We argue that this problem may be further understood by adding an additional dimension in the experiment. This allows us to address this problem in the perspective of bias and variance in a broader view. We show that the well-known performance degradation issue caused by unlabeled data can be reproduced as a subset of the whole scenario. We argue that if the bias-variance trade-off is to be better balanced by a more effective feature selection method unlabeled data is very likely to boost the classification performance. We then propose a feature selection framework in which labeled and unlabeled training samples are both considered. We discuss its potential in achieving such a balance. Besides, the application in financial sentiment analysis is chosen because it not only exemplifies an important application, the data possesses better illustrative power as well. The implications of this study in text classification and financial sentiment analysis are both discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 3 Aug 2013 04:20:21 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0658v1", "Appeared in The 27th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-13); Proceedings of AAAI-13 (AAAI Press 2013) pp. 1149-1155"]], "COMMENTS": "Appeared in The 27th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-13); Proceedings of AAAI-13 (AAAI Press 2013) pp. 1149-1155", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["jimmy s j ren", "wei wang 0065", "jiawei wang", "stephen s y liao"], "accepted": true, "id": "1308.0658"}, "pdf": {"name": "1308.0658.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Wei Wang", "Jiawei Wang", "Stephen Shaoyi Liao"], "emails": ["jimmy.sj.ren@gmail.com,", "issliao}@cityu.edu.hk", "wangjw2@mail.ustc.edu.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 130 8.06 58v1 [cs.CL] 3 Aug 201 3"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In recent years, many applications of sentiment analysis have begun to play an increasingly important role in creating value for different industries. Such a phenomenon should be attributed in large part to the rapid development of the web and the inevitable trend of big data. However, the number of product ratings in each e-commerce site is increasing. Management and use of such ratings through sentiment analysis is becoming one of the key issues.

In financial applications, massive textual data in social networks allow the prediction of stock prices using sentiment analysis (Oh 2011). Researchers also examined online financial reports and found management opinions correlate significantly with the future performance of companies (Li 2010). If we do a more careful review of the sentiment analysis literature, it is not difficult to discuss."}, {"heading": "Related work and research gap", "text": "While it is generally accepted that the use of unlabeled data in many text classification tasks is desirable, views on the effectiveness of unlabeled data for such tasks are fairly diverse in the literature. McCallum and Nigam (1998) combined active learning with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, demonstrating that this method is capable of reducing the value of unlabeled data by using unlabeled data, and then combined naive Bayes with the algorithm to illustrate the usefulness of unlabeled data."}, {"heading": "Methodology and dataset", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Research Methodology", "text": "The reason why multinomial event model is a preferred choice in most text classification tasks has been widely discussed in the literature (Ng and Jordan 2002, Nigam and McCallum 1998).Although there are a number of alternative methods for using unlabeled data in text classification, we observed that the combination of naive Bayes and EM algorithms was adopted in the previous pioneering work in this area (Nigam and McCallum et al. 1998, Cozman and Cohen et. al 2003).In order to keep our results relevant for these studies, we also adopted this method in our experiments. We briefly describe how the EM algorithm is used in the subsequent use of the unlabeled data. Since the samples in unlabeled data are not labeled, we do not have labeling labeling labeling labeling labeling labeling labels for the lettering of the lettering of the lettering."}, {"heading": "Motivation of Using Financial Data", "text": "The data we use in this paper are corporate financial reports that are publicly available online. There are both practical and theoretical reasons for choosing financial sentiment analysis as our experimental environment. In practice, we believe that the impact of effective sentiment analysis systems in these years is closely related to the rapid development of the web and social networks. As it is reasonable to predict greater growth of the web and social networks, we believe that the impact of effective sentiment analysis systems will continue to grow in the future. In addition, there are some theoretical considerations when selecting corporate financial reports for our experiments. It differs in a number of influential applications, including predicting future profits (Li 2010) and detecting corporate fraud (Humpherys, et al. 2011)."}, {"heading": "Data Collection and Labeling", "text": "We have selectively collected text data from the Discussion and Analysis of Management (MD & A) section of Form 10-K. The opinions and assessments of the Company's managers are normally presented in this section, in which the MD & A section is devoted to managers to discuss in detail the Company's business operations. In order to design our test results in such a way that they have a good chance of approximating the generalization error, the data collected must be comparable to random samples. We have used the following method in collecting data: We randomly selected 10 industries and subsequently selected only one company within each industry, because we avoid the possibility of similar writing habits within the same industry. By downloading the Company List, we have downloaded their 2011 and 2012 financial reports from the SEC website and have described the MD & A section as positive in pre-processing."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Why Design The Experiment This Way", "text": "We have already mentioned that most existing studies tend to understand the usefulness of unlabeled data by looking at the interaction of three factors, namely the amount of labeled data, the amount of unlabeled data, and the classification performance. It was concluded that in addition to the classifier itself, both the amount of labeled data and the unlabeled data would change the dynamics of the compromise between bias and variance, and thus affect the classification performance. The problem of performance deterioration was also observed with the increase in the amount of labeled data in the presence of the unlabeled data (Cozman and Cohen, et. al 2003). However, we argue that there is an additional factor, the choice of characteristics, which has the potential to significantly affect the compromise between bias and variance. For example, if the selection process for characteristics is not conducted carefully each time, we vary the amount of labeled and unlabeled data, the balance between bias and variance is likely to be disturbed."}, {"heading": "Experimental Procedure", "text": "In this study, we considered the choice of characteristics as one of the dimensions in the experiments. We used the following method to simultaneously vary the amount of marked data, the amount of marked data, and the choice of characteristics to see how they would collectively affect the classification performance. To better interpret the results and fit the results into a 2D image, we determined the amount of marked data in each subfigure of Figure 1 and Figure 2, within which we varied the amount of unmarked data and the choice of characteristics. We then conducted several experiments with gradually increasing marked data set. Therefore, we were able to generate a series of sub-images that collectively visualized the interplay of all the factors considered. To gain confidence in the generalizability of our results, we divided our marked data into the training set and the test set twice, and carried out the experimental procedure for each data division."}, {"heading": "Analysis of The Findings", "text": "There are some interesting results in the experiments."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "An Alternative Feature Selection Framework", "text": "We are now discussing why we should include both labeled and unlabeled data in the feature selection process. We can see from both Figure 1 and Figure 2 that the best classification performance is usually achieved through different choices of vocabulary numbers. For example, in Figure 2 (a) there are significant offsets between these optimal points. However, if we only use labeled data in the feature selection, only an \"appropriate\" number of vocabulary numbers can be selected, regardless of how much unlabeled data we have used. This implies that the bias variance trade-off is likely to be interrupted when we insert labeled data into the training if we perform the feature selection in the conventional way. On the other hand, this further implies that even rigorous feature selection procedures have been performed in the previous studies, and that the problem of performance deterioration may prevail if only labeled data has been used in the process. However, this is a weak assertion that we need to include the feature in the prior discussion, but will not include it in the previous experiment."}, {"heading": "More discussions, Limitations and Future Work", "text": "The results in this paper contribute to the literature on text classification by providing an opportunity to look at the puzzling problem of performance deterioration in a different and possibly broader perspective. We believe that this is an important issue that we need to address because the ability to use unlabeled data in text classification will only be more attractive in the future, as the rapid growth of the Web is inevitable. Such results should also be of interest to the community of sentiment analysis, because we expect more text-based sentiment analysis to appear in the near future. However, there are a few limitations in this study. First, although we tend to avoid any bias in data collection, data processing and experiments, we have conducted the experiments in just one dataset. It is possible that the results generated by our experiments have been distorted by some specific features of financial data. Second, our attitude is a problem of text classification at the sentence level. The generalisability of the text needs to be further evaluated in the couple of interesting findings."}, {"heading": "Concluding remarks", "text": "In this paper, we explored the use of unlabeled data in text classification using well-prepared financial text data. We added an additional dimension to the experiments and showed that the problem of unlabeled data degradation may be a subset of a broader scenario. We discussed such a scenario carefully and concluded from the experimental results that a feature selection process that takes into account both labeled and unlabeled data is a promising candidate to avoid performance degradation in semi-monitored text classification, and the implications of this study for both text classification and mood analysis were also debated.The findings contained in this paper were partially supported by the Innovation and Technology Fund of the Hong Kong government SAR (Project ITP / 021 / 09AP and ITP / 036 / 10AP).
