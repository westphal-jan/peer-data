Thus, zi corresponds to the block membership for nodes i. Let B be a K-K matrix, where Bab [0, 2] for all a, SBM is the probability of an edge between i and j."}, {"heading": "4.

The simulations compare (1) standard spectral clustering (SC), (2) RSC as defined in Section 2, (3) RSC without projecting to the unit Sphere (RSC wp), (4) regulates SC with thresholds (t-RSC), and (5) spectral clustering with perturbation (SCP) (Amini et al), which SC applies to the perturbed adjacency matrix Aper = A + a11T. Furthermore, Experiment 2 compares the performance of RSC with high values."}, {"heading": "6. Discussion", "text": "Our theoretical results supplement the current results by examining the regulatory step in a more canonical version of the spectral cluster algorithm. Furthermore, our main results do not require assumptions about the minimum degree of the node. This is crucial because it allows us to investigate situations where multiple nodes have low leverage; regulation is most advantageous in these situations. Finally, our results show that the choice of a tuning parameter close to the average creates a balance between several competing objectives. Thanks to Sara Fernandes-Taylor for helpful comments.
