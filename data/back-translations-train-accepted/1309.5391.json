Since real concepts have associations with certain color categories (for example, danger with red, and softness with pink), linguistic and non-linguistic information adds a number of advantages, including: (1) strengthening the message (improving semantic coherence), (2) easing the cognitive burden on the recipient, (3) conveying the message quickly, and (4) evacuating the desired emotional responses with appropriate colors, such as: Consider the use of red in the drops."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "The relationship between language and cognition has received considerable attention over the years, especially on the question of whether language influences thinking, and if so, to what extent. Experiments with color categories have been used both to show that language has an influence on thinking (Brown and Lenneberg, 1954; Ratner, 1989) and that it does not (Bornstein, 1985). However, this line does not explicitly address word-color associations. In fact, we have not found any other academic paper that gathers large word-color associations. However, there is a commercial endeavor - Cymbolism1.Child et al. (1968), Ou et al. (2011), which shows that people of different ages and genders have different color preferences. (See also the online study by Joe Hallock2) In this work, we are interested in identifying words that have a strong association with a color."}, {"heading": "3 Crowdsourcing", "text": "We used the Macquarie Thesaurus (Bernard, 1986) as a source for terms that are categorized by people on Mechanical Turk.5 Thesauri, such as Roget's and Macquarie. These categories can be thought of as broad senses (Yarowsky, 1992; Mohammad and Hirst, 2006). If a word is ambiguous, it is listed in more than one category. As we were additionally interested in determining color signatures for emotions (Section 7), we decided to comment on all 10,170 pairs of words that Mohammad and Turney (2010) used to create their word-emotion lexicon. Below is an example questionnaire: Q1. Which word is closest to sleep? \u2022 Car \u2022 Tree \u2022 OlivQ2. What color is associated with sleep? \u2022 Black \u2022 Brown \u2022 Green \u2022 Orange \u2022 Violet \u2022 Pink \u2022 White \u2022 Q1."}, {"heading": "4 Word\u2013Colour Association", "text": "In the second half of the last decade, the number of unemployed has tripled compared to the previous year.

We now determine whether there are categories in which semantic coherence migrates to a strong common association with a color. We determine the strength of the color association of a category by first determining the color c that is most associated with the terms it contains, and then calculating the ratio of the number of times a word from the category is associated with a color, to the number of words in the category that are associated with a color. We only took into account words that had at least four words that also appear in the word-color lexicon; 535 of the 812 categories from Macquarie Thesaurus met this condition. If a category has exactly four words that occur in the color lexicon, and if all four words are associated with different colors, then the category has the lowest possible strength of the color association - a score of 0.25 / 1 out of 19 categories."}, {"heading": "6 Imageability", "text": "It is natural for physical units of a particular color to be associated with that color. Figure 1 shows an experiment to determine whether there is a correlation between imaging capability and association with color. We define the imaging capability of a thesaurus category as the average of the imaging capability ratings of words in it. We calculated the imaging capability for the 535 categories described in the previous section solely by the words that occur in the color lexicon. Figure 1 shows the scatter plots of these categories on the imaging capability and strength of color associations axes. If higher imaging capability correlates with a greater tendency to color associations, then we would see most dots move from left to right up the diagonal. Instead, we observe that the strongly associated categories are distributed across the entire imaging axis, meaning that there is only a weak, if any, correlation. Imaging capability and color association between a product and a correlation of 0.16 percent correlation."}, {"heading": "7 The Colour of Emotion Words", "text": "Emotions such as joy, sadness and anger are abstract concepts that have to do with one's own psychological state. As explained in Section 2, there is preliminary work on emotions caused by colours. In contrast, here we examine the colours associated with emotional words. We combine the word-emotion lexicon compiled by Mohammad and Turney (2010; 2011) and our word-colour lexicon to determine the colour signature of emotions - the lines in Table 4. It is worth noting that all emotions have strong associations with certain colours. Note that anger is most strongly associated with red. Other negative emotions - disgust, fear, sadness - are most strongly associated with black. Among positive emotions: anticipation is most commonly associated with white and green; joy with white, green and yellow; and trust with white, blue and green. Table 4 shows the colour signature for terms that are described as positive and negative (including terms that may not be associated with the eight basic emotions)."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "A word selection question led the commentator to the desired meaning of the target word and to ensure data quality. We observed that abstract concepts, especially emotions, have strong color associations. Thus, using the right colors in tasks such as information visualization, product marketing, and web development can not only improve semantic coherence, but also inspire the desired psychological response. Interestingly, we found that frequencies of color selection follow the same order in which color terms occur in the language (Berlin and Kay, 1969). Future work includes the development of automatic corpus-based methods to determine the strength of word color association and the extent to which strong word color associations manifest as more than random coincidence in the text."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Thanks to Peter Turney, Tara Small, Bridget McInnes and the reviewers for many wonderful ideas.
