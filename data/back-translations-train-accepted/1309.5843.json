In these experiments, we will also use a learning framework that connects the various formulas.The underlying hypothesis is that we mix these formulas and seek the same information from different perspectives (i.e. the postional polarities that are combined by SWN)."}, {"heading": "3 SentiWordNet", "text": "SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is a lexical resource in which each entry is a series of dilemma-PoS pairs that have the same meaning, called \"synset.\" Each synset s is associated with the numerical values Pos (s) and Neg (s), which are between 0 and 1. These values - automatically assigned based on a bunch of seed terms - represent the positive and negative value (or posterior polarity) of the synset and are inherited from each lemma-PoS in the synset. According to the structure of SentiWordNet, each pair can have more than one meaning and each of them takes the form of lemma # PoS # sensory number, where the smallest sensory number corresponds to the most common sensation. Obviously, different senses can have different polarities. In Table 1, the first 5 senses of cold # present any possible combinations, including mixed values (cold # 4)."}, {"heading": "4 Prior Polarities Formulae", "text": "In this section we review the main strategies for calculating the previous polarities used in previous studies. It is worth noting that all proposed approaches attempt to estimate the previous polarity from the rear polarities of all senses. < p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p (s) and p (s) This results in two scores, f (posScore) and f (posScore), if f (posScore), for each previous polarity for each lemma-PoS, f (posScore) and f (negScore) can be mapped according to different strategies: fm = f (posScore) and f (posScore) if f (negScore). \u2212 f (negScore) otherwisefd = f (posScore) \u2212 f (negScore) where fm calculates the absolute maximum score of the two scores while fd calculates the difference between them."}, {"heading": "5 Learning Algorithms", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "6 Gold Standards", "text": "To gauge how well previous polarity formulas work, a gold standard with word polarities provided by human commentators is required; there are many such resources in the literature, each with different coverage and annotation characteristics. ANEW (Bradley and Lang, 1999) assesses the value of 1,034 words presented to commentators in isolation; the SO-CAL entries (Taboada et al., 2011) were collected from corpus data and then manually marked by a small number of commentators with a multi-class label; these ratings were further validated by crowdsourcing; other resources, such as the General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al., 1966), provide a binomial classification (either positive or negative) of sentimental words; the resource presented in Wilson et al., 2005, uses a similar binomial annotation for individual words; another interesting resource is WordNetAffect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004)."}, {"heading": "6.1 ANEW", "text": "ANEW (Bradley and Lang, 1999) is a resource designed to provide a set of normative emotional ratings for a large number of words (approximately 1,000) in the English language. It contains a set of words evaluated in terms of pleasure (affective value), arousal, and dominance. Specifically, for our task, we considered the value dimension. Since words were presented to the subjects in isolation (i.e. no context was provided), this resource represents a human validation of previous polarity values for the given words and can be used as the gold standard. ANEW provides two main indicators for each word: anew\u00b5, which corresponds to the average of the votes of the commentators, and anew\u043c, which indicates the variance in the commentator values for the given word. Similarly, these measures are also provided for the male / female commentator groups."}, {"heading": "6.2 General Inquirer", "text": "The Harvard General Inquirer dictionary is a widely used resource developed for automatic text analysis (Stone et al., 1966). Its latest revision3 contains 11789 words with 182 semantic and pragmatic terms and their share of speech. Words and their categories were originally taken from the Harvard IV-4 Psychosociological Dictionary (Dunphy et al., 1974) and the Lasswell Value Dictionary (Lasswell and Namenwirth, 1969)."}, {"heading": "7 Experiments", "text": "To use the ANEW dataset to measure previous polarity formulas, we had to assign a PoS to obtain the SWN Slemp # PoS format. To do this, we proceeded as follows: for each word that exists in both categories, we have to look around the terminology of the word using the TextPro tool suite (Pianta et al., 2008) and check if the Slema is able to find instead4 (i.e., the word cannot be aligned automatically) to remove the word from the list (this was the case for 30 words of the current language); the remaining 1,004 lemmas were then associated with all the PoS in SWN to get the final problem # PoS # PoS #. We can consider more than one PoS, for example, the author is only present as noun."}, {"heading": "8 General Discussion", "text": "\"I think it's going to take a lot of time for us to come to terms with the fact that we're not going to be able to do that,\" he said, adding that he would like to see \"a lot of people who are going to be able to do that, who are going to be able to do that, who are going to be able to do that, who are going to be able to do that, who are going to be able to do that, who are going to be able to do that, who are going to be able to do that, who are going to be able to do that, who are going to be able to do that, who are going to be able to do that, who are going to be able to be able to do that kind of thing.\""}, {"heading": "9 PoS and Gender Experiments", "text": "Next, we wanted to understand whether the performance of our approach using SWN3 was consistent across the word PoS. In Table 6, we reported the results for the highest-performing formulas and learning algorithms of the GI-PoS classes. Specifically, for ADJ, there were 1,073 words, 922 for NOUN, and 508 for VERB. Adverbs were discarded because the class was too small to provide reliable evaluation and efficient learning (only 54 cases), and the results showed greater accuracy in adjectives (p < 0.01), while performance was similar for nouns and verbs. Finally, we tested against the male and female ratings provided by ANEW. As shown in Table 7, SWN approaches are much more accurate in predicting male ratings than female ratings (MAE\u00b5 ranges from 0.392 to 0.323 with the best formula and from 0.369 to 0.292 with SVMfs. Both differences are significant < SW001)."}, {"heading": "10 Conclusions", "text": "We have presented a study on the problem of the previous polarity of words based on their posterior polarities. Using two different versions of SentiWordNet and 30 different approaches proposed in the literature, we have shown that researchers have not paid sufficient attention to this problem. In fact, we have shown that the better variants outperform the others on different sets of data in both regression and classification tasks, and that they can represent a fairer state-of-the-art approach using SentiWordNet. In addition, we have shown that these modern formulas can be further outperformed with a learning framework that combines the different formulas. We conclude our analysis with some experiments that examine the effects of word PoS and annotator gender in gold standards and show interesting phenomena that require further investigation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank Jose \u0301 Camargo De Souza for his help in selecting the feature films.

In this paper, we compare the most often used techniques together with newly proposed ones and incorporate all of them in a learning framework to see whether blending them can further improve the estimation of prior polarity scores. Using two different versions of SentiWordNet and testing regression and classification models across tasks and datasets, our learning approach consistently outperforms the single metrics, providing a new state-ofthe-art approach in computing words\u2019 prior polarity for sentiment analysis. We conclude our investigation showing interesting biases in calculated prior polarity scores when word Part of Speech and annotator gender are considered.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
