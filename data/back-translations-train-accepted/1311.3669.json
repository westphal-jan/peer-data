This influence estimation problem is very challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the task and the requirement of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a randomized algorithm for influence estimation in continuous-time diffusion networks. Our algorithm can estimate the influence of every node in a network with |V| nodes and |E| edges to an accuracy of using n = O(1/ ) randomizations and up to logarithmic factorsO(n|E|+n|V|) computations. When used as a subroutine in a greedy influence maximization approach, our proposed algorithm is guaranteed to find a set of C nodes with the influence of at least (1 \u2212 1/e) OPT\u22122C , where OPT is the optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed algorithm can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes while significantly improves over previous state-of-the-arts in terms of the accuracy of the estimated influence and the quality of the selected nodes in maximizing the influence.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
