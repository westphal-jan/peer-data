We propose a robust graph matching algorithm inspired in sparsity-related techniques. We cast the problem, resembling group or collaborative sparsity formulations, as a non-smooth convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using augmented Lagrangian techniques. The method can deal with weighted or unweighted graphs, as well as multimodal data, where different graphs represent different types of data. The proposed approach is also naturally integrated with collaborative graph inference techniques, solving general network inference problems where the observed variables, possibly coming from different modalities, are not in correspondence. The algorithm is tested and compared with state-of-the-art graph matching techniques in both synthetic and real graphs. We also present results on multimodal graphs and applications to collaborative inference of brain connectivity from alignment-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.

Specifically, let Ao be the adjacence matrix of a random weighted graph, and Bo be a permutated version of it, generated with a random permutation matrix Po, i.e., Bo = PTo AoPo. We then add a certain number of random edges to Ao with the same weight distribution as the original weights, and other random edges to Bo, and from these loud versions we try to restore the original agreement (or any agreement between Ao and Bo, as it may not be unique). We show the results using three different techniques for generating the graphs: the Erdo-sRe-nyi model (Erdo-s & Re-nyi, 1959), the model of Baraba-si & Albert (1999) for algorithm-free graphs, and the Thivalent graphs \u2212 graphs."}, {"heading": "5.2 Graph matching: Real graphs", "text": "Caenorhabditis elegans is a thoroughly studied roundworm whose somatic nervous system consists of 279 neurons that form synapses with other neurons; the two types of connections (chemical and electrical) between these 279 neurons have been mapped (Varshney et al., 2011), and their corresponding adjacent matrices, Ac and Ae, are publicly available. We compare both the chemical and electrical connection diagrams with noisy artificially permutated versions of them. The permutated diagrams are constructed using the same process used in Section 5.1 for synthetic graphs.The weights of the added noise follow the same distribution as the original weights.The results are shown in Figure 2. These results suggest that the prior art PATH algorithm is better suited for the electrical connection network, while the FAQ algorithm works better for both types of connections."}, {"heading": "5.3 Multimodal graph matching", "text": "One of the advantages of the proposed approach is its ability to deal with multimodal data. As discussed in Section 2, the Lasso Type of Penalty group promotes the support of AP and PB to be identical, almost independent of the actual values of the entries. This makes it possible to compare weighted diagrams in which the weights can follow completely different probability distributions. This is often the case when measuring with different instruments: when a network is measured with significantly different modalities, one expects that the underlying connections are the same, but no relation between the actual weights of these connections can be assumed. This also applies to fMRI data when measured with different instruments. In what follows, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method in two examples of multimodal graph measurement. We first generate a binary random graph Ab and a permutative version Bb = PTo AbPo. Then we assign weights to the distributions according to pA and pB (which are specified for each experiment)."}, {"heading": "5.4 Collaborative inference", "text": "In this last experiment, we illustrate the application of the permutated collaborative graph conclusion presented in Section 4 with real fMRI data that are publicly available (Nooner, 2012). Here, we are looking at test-retest studies, that is, the same subject that is at rest fMRI in two separate sessions, separated by a pause. Each session consists of almost 10 minutes of data collected with a sample period of 0.645 s, producing about 900 samples per study. The CC200 atlas (Craddock et al., 2012) was used to extract the time series for the massive 200 regions of interest (ROIs), resulting in two data matrices of XA, XB, R900 x 200, corresponding to test and retest. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we show that we are using only a portion of the data in XA and a portion of the data in a permutated version of XB, we are able to conclude the matrix to a matrix."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We presented a new formulation for the graph matching problem and proposed an optimization algorithm to minimize the corresponding cost function. Reported results show that the method is suitable for the graph matching problem of weighted graphs and outperforms previous methods in both synthetic and real graphs. Since the problem is not explicitly compared, the method can handle multimodal data and outperforms the other compared methods. Furthermore, the proposed formulation naturally fits into the collaborative network inference framework in which the permutation is estimated together with the underlying common network, with promising preliminary results in real data applications."}], "references": [{"title": "A linear programming approach for the weighted graph matching problem", "author": ["H.
