We model the buyer as a strategic agent, whose goal is to maximize her long-term surplus, and we are interested in mechanisms that maximize the seller's long-term revenue. We define the natural notion of strategic regret --- the lost revenue as measured against a truthful (non-strategic) buyer. We present seller algorithms that are no-(strategic)-regret when the buyer discounts her future surplus --- i.e. the buyer prefers showing advertisements to users sooner rather than later. We also give a lower bound on strategic regret that increases as the buyer's discounting weakens and shows, in particular, that any seller algorithm will suffer linear strategic regret if there is no discounting.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 Nov 2013 22:53:13 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6838v1", "Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2013)"]], "COMMENTS": "Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2013)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["kareem amin", "afshin rostamizadeh", "umar syed"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.6838"}, "pdf": {"name": "1311.6838.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["akareem@cis.upenn.edu", "rostami@google.com", "usyed@google.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 131 1,68 38v1 [cs.LG] 2 6N ov"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "When a user visits a website whose ad inventory is managed through an ad exchange, a description of the website, the user and other relevant characteristics of the impression, together with a reserve price for the impression, are transmitted to bidding servers operating on behalf of the advertisers, which process the data about the impression and respond to the exchange with a bid. The highest bidder wins the right to display an advertisement on the buyer's website provided that the bid is above the reserve price. The amount charged to the winner, if there is one, will be paid after a second auction. The winner will be calculated the maximum of the second highest bid and the reserve price. Ad Exchanges were a boon for advertisers, as rich and real-time data about the impressions allow them to align their bids only to those impressions that they value."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "Kleinberg and Leighton study a repeated auction with goods sold sequentially to T bidders who either have the same fixed private value or private values chosen by a forgotten opponent (an opponent who acts independently of the buyer's behavior) [15] (see also [7, 8, 14]).

[0, 1] In each round, the buyer receives an instantaneous surplus of at (vt \u2212 pt), and the seller receives an instantaneous turnover from atpt.

We show that in this area, a very simple price algorithm with monotonously decreasing price offers is able to achieve O (T\u03b3 \u221a T) if the buyer discount is indeed 1 and p0 = 1. Due to space constraints, much of the evidence for this section appears in Appendix A. Monotone algorithm: Choose a parameter \u03b2 (0, 1) and initialize a0 = 1. In each round t more than 1, allow it to be \u2212 1pt \u2212 1. In the monotone algorithm, the seller starts with the maximum price of 1 and reduces the price by a factor \u03b2 whenever the buyer rejects the price, and otherwise leaves it unchanged. Since monotone is deterministic and the value of the buyer is fixed, the surplus is the maximizing buyer algorithm (monotone)."}, {"heading": "5 Stochastic Value Setting", "text": "Next, we give a seller algorithm that shows no remorse when price fixing P is finite, the buyer's discount is in any case limited, and the buyer's value for each round is marked by a fixed distribution that satisfies a certain continuity assumption, detailed turnover and turnover of the buyer.

Note that if T = T\u03b3 - i.e., the buyer does not discount his future surplus - our lower limit proves that there are no seller algorithms that cause no regrets, and that it is therefore impossible for the seller to use information learned. Consider, for example, the seller algorithm that consistently selects the prices from [0, 1]. The optimal buyer algorithm is truthful and accepted if pt < vt, as the seller algorithm is not adaptive, and the buyer does not gain an advantage through a more strategic approach. In such a scenario, the seller would quickly experience a good estimate of the value distribution D. Surprisingly, a seller cannot use this information if the buyer does not disclose his future surplus."}, {"heading": "6.1 Single-Shot Auction", "text": "We call the following game a single shot auction. A seller selects a family of distributions indexed by b [0, 1], each Sb being a distribution to [0, 1] \u00d7 {0, 1}. The S family is revealed to a buyer of unknown value v [0, 1], who must then select an offer b [0, 1], and then (p, a) becomes the corresponding distribution. As usual, the buyer receives a surplus of one (v \u2212 p), while the seller enjoys income from ap. We limit the range of seller strategies to distributions that are incentive compatible and rational. S is incentive compatible if for all b, v [0, 1], E (p, a), Sb [a (v \u2212 p) and Sb [a \u2212 p)."}, {"heading": "6.2 Repeated Auction", "text": "It is easy to imagine a seller who sometimes accepts this incentive. = > Full proof of this is provided in the Annex (Section C.1).

(Point T = 1 at (Point \u2212 pt)] Notice if the value distribution D and the excess maximization of the buyer's algorithm B (A, D) is trivial. This would occur if the buyer accepts prices less and less than their value (Point).

We show that if the buyer appreciates inventories more in the present than in the distant future, there is no remorse (in terms of revenue generated from a truthful buyer). In addition, we offer lower limits that show that such an assumption is actually necessary. These are the first limits of this kind for the presented environment. Future studies include investigating buyer behavior under weaker polynomic discounting rates and understanding when existing bandit algorithms (UCB or EXP3) are able to perform well with strategic buyers, perhaps with minor changes."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Corinna Cortes, Gagan Goel, Yishay Mansour, Hamid Nazerzadeh and Noam Nisan for early comments on this work and references to new literature."}, {"heading": "C Lower Bound Proofs", "text": "C.1 Evidence of Lemma 3Evidence.
