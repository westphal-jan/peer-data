The assumption that an infinite sequence of data points is exchangeable is at the core of Bayesian statistics. However, finite exchangeability as a statistical property that renders probabilistic inference tractable is less well-understood. We develop a theory of finite exchangeability and its relation to tractable probabilistic inference. The theory is complementary to that of independence and conditional independence. We show that tractable inference in probabilistic models with high treewidth and millions of variables can be understood using the notion of finite (partial) exchangeability. We also show that existing lifted inference algorithms implicitly utilize a combination of conditional independence and partial exchangeability.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jan 2014 00:30:25 GMT  (27kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1247v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Apr 2014 22:21:16 GMT  (48kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1247v2", "In Proceedings of the 28th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mathias niepert", "guy van den broeck"], "accepted": true, "id": "1401.1247"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.1247.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Tractability through Exchangeability: A New Perspective on Efficient Probabilistic Inference", "authors": ["Mathias Niepert", "Guy Van den Broeck"], "emails": ["mniepert@cs.washington.edu", "guyvdb@cs.ucla.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "It is not only a matter of time, but also of time, when we have to deal with the question to what extent we base this structural property and its declarative nature, and how they can be based on the algorithms of the algorithms.

The foundations of a formula are obtained by instantiating variables with certain constants.

Surprisingly, even in the absence of conditional dependencies, they perform tractable inferences. For example, when interpreting the above-mentioned MLN as (undirected) probabilistic graphical model, all pairs of random variables in {Smokes (A), Smokes (B),.} are connected by an edge derived from the fundamentals of Formula 2. The model has no conditional or contextual dependencies between the Smokes variables.

We assume that certain forms of finite interchangeability allow for comprehensible conclusions. To establish links to statistical relationship models such as MLNs, we present the theory of finite sets of (capital letters) binary random variables X = {X1,..., Xn}. However, the theory applies to all distributions of finite weighted discrete random variables. Lowercase letters x denote an assignment to X.We begin with the most basic form of interchangeability.

Fortunately, interchangeability can be generalized to the concept of partial interchangeability by using the concept of sufficient statistics (Diaconis and Freedman 1980b; Lauritzen et al. 1984; Lauritzen 1988). Particular examples of interchangeability such as complete finite interchangeability correspond to certain statistics.

The inference tasks we are looking at are - MPE inference, i.e., determining the arg maxy Pr (y, e) for each given mapping e to the variables E X and - marginal inference, i.e. calculating Pr (e) for each given e. For a number of variables X, we say that P (x) can be efficiently iff calculated, in a time polynomial manner in | X |. We make the following complexity claims theorem 2.

The simple atoms in Q are no longer marginally interchangeable, because their arguments can appear asymmetrical in e. We can now simply answer the query by enumerating all the states q of Q and making separate conclusions in each Pr (Y, Z, q) when all variables Y have become marginally interchangeable again, and all variables Z have become independently decomposable in the face of Y. The construction of Y and Z is similar to the proof of Theorem 9, except that some additional binary atoms are now in Y instead of Z.
