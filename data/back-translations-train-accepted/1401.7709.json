RELATED LABEL TYPES. Property (P2) assumes that the reasons for forming friendships are mutually exclusive, but this need not be strictly true. For example, some high school friends could be a subset of hometown friends1. Let's look again at Figure 1, but with the current city being replaced by high school. Let's assume that the solid black nodes represent actual high school friends, and we are trying to close to the high school members. If the small cluster on the right did not exist, then Eq. 3 would be maximized by selecting the most common high school among friends (i.e. the solid black nodes), even if they are already declared by a common hometown; so EDGEEXPLAIN would choose the right high school."}, {"heading": "6.

Conclusions", "text": "We found that a certain error mode of existing methods in our problem definition is that edges are often created for a reason related to a particular label type (e.g., in a social network, two users can connect because they have attended the same high school but did not attend the same college). We identified three network properties that model this phenomenon: edges are created for a reason (P1), they are usually created for a reason only (P2), and sharing the same value for a label type is necessary, but not sufficient to have an edge between two nodes (P3). We introduced EDGEEXPLAIN, which carefully models these properties. It uses a gradient-based method for collective inferences that allows rapid iterative inference that is equivalent during the runtime of the basic label propagation. Our experiments with a billion-node subset of Facebook-type data can demonstrate the benefits of different label types in the first place."}], "references": [{"title": "Video suggestion and discovery for YouTube: Taking random walks through the view graph", "author": ["S.
