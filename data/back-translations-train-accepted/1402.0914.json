For event forecasting, we practiced the first 900 seconds and tested the last 100 seconds of data. We executed our Markov chain for 2500 iterations and calculated the subsequent probabilities of A and W. A simple alternative to the Hawkes model is to look at the cross-correlation between the event times. First, the event times are captured in an array of s-k of length M.

We group both positive and negative price changes into the same process to measure overall activity; another alternative would be to generate an \"up trend\" and a \"down trend\" process for each share; we ignore trades outside regular trading hours because they tend to be outliers with highly fluctuating prices; since we are interested in short-term interactions, we opted for \"tmax = 60s.\" This also limits the number of potential event parents. If we were interested in interactions over longer periods of time, we would have to undercut the price changes at a higher level. We ruled out a self-excitation for this dataset, as upward movements are often followed by downticks and vice versa. We strive to explain these short price jumps by the activity of other stocks.

We run our Markov chain for 700 iterations and use the last 200 iterations to calculate predictive probabilities and expectations.The rear sample shown in the main text is the last sample of the chain. As it is a spatiotemporal dataset, our intensities are functions of both spatial place and time.
