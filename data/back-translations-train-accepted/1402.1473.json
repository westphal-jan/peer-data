Essentially, the proposed algorithm is parameter-free and can be solved by achieving remarkable efficiency and accuracy through a greedy rounding strategy; the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal error correction capability because it is guaranteed to work even if much of the input is corrupted, underscoring the importance of common object matching: no matter how poor the quality of the input sources may be, perfect matching is achievable as long as we obtain enough instances. Although partial matching can cause much more serious input errors than full matching, the restoration capability of our algorithm in many situations is almost the same as restoring full similarity (to some factor)."}, {"heading": "A Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)", "text": "This section describes the procedure for the ADMM algorithm.

similar instances (e.g. images, graphs, shapes) to improve maps between pairs of them. Given multiple objects and matches computed between a few object pairs in isolation, the goal is to recover an entire collection of maps that are (1) globally consistent, and (2) close to the provided maps \u2014 and under certain conditions provably the ground-truth maps. Despite recent advances on this problem, the best-known recovery guarantees are limited to a small constant barrier \u2014 none of the existing methods find theoretical support when more than 50% of input correspondences are corrupted. Moreover, prior approaches focus mostly on fully similar objects, while it is practically more demanding to match instances that are only partially similar to each other (e.g., different views of a single physical object). In this paper, we propose an algorithm to jointly match multiple objects that exhibit only partial similarities, given a few (possibly highly incomplete) pairwise matches that are densely corrupted. By encoding a consistent partial map collection into a 0-1 semidefinite matrix, we propose to recover the ground-truth maps via a parameter-free convex program called MatchLift, following a spectral method that pre-estimates the total number of distinct elements to be matched. Numerically, this program can be efficiently solved via alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) along with a greedy rounding strategy. Theoretically, MatchLift exhibits near-optimal error-correction ability, i.e. in the asymptotic regime it is guaranteed to work even when a dominant fraction 1 \u2212 \u0398 ( log n \u221a n ) of the input maps behave like random outliers. Furthermore, MatchLift succeeds with minimal input complexity, namely, perfect matching can be achieved as soon as the provided maps form a connected map graph. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on various benchmark data sets including synthetic examples and real-world examples, all of which confirm the practical applicability and usefulness of MatchLift.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
