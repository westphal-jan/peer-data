The most important observation of the thesis is that the spectral gap of G (which generates such a gap) is the key property that regulates the restorability of M solely using P (M). For example, if G is a Ramanujan expander (i.e., \u03c32 (G) = O (\u221a d), then we have universal restoration guarantees for matrices with strong incoherence characteristics. For uniformly sampled matrices, our main result implies an exact restoration of constant rank matrices using O (n) entries, as opposed to the O (n log n) entries required in the existing analyses. One caveat is that we need stronger incoherence characteristics to obtain the sample complexity specified above, so that our results are sufficient to determine whether a given formula is sufficient to provide a granulate E."}, {"heading": "A Proof of second part of Theorem 4.1", "text": "Proof.
