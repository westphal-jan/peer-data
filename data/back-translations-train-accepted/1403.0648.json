This specific choice on modelling tools brings us mathematical convenience. The analysis shows that the whole market effectively approaches a global objective, despite that the market is designed such that each agent only cares about its own goal. Additionally, the market dynamics provides a sensible algorithm for optimising the global objective. An intimate connection between machine learning and our markets is thus established, such that we could 1) analyse a market by applying machine learning methods to the global objective, and 2) solve machine learning problems by setting up and running certain markets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Mar 2014 01:14:40 GMT  (109kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0648v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.LG q-fin.TR stat.ML", "authors": ["jinli hu", "amos j storkey"], "accepted": true, "id": "1403.0648"}, "pdf": {"name": "1403.0648.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Multi-period Trading Prediction Markets with Connections to Machine Learning", "authors": ["Jinli Hu"], "emails": ["A.STORKEY}@ED.AC.UK"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "After the mainstream interest in \"big data,\" a valuable direction for machine learning is to build distributed, scalable, and self-motivating systems that can be organized to solve large-scale problems. Recently, forecasting markets (Wolfers and Zitzewitz, 2004) have shown promise to be the abstract framework for machine learners to design these systems (Storkey, 2011). Since Pennock and Wellman (1996), researchers have spent decades making connections between machine learning and prediction markets, but this problem has not yet been solved well. One reason is that the framework of prediction markets is somehow too flexible, and to analyze the markets for machine learning, one must first specify a market model to describe the prediction markets."}, {"heading": "2 A General Prediction Market Setup", "text": "We say that a prediction market is built on securities that are linked to the future state.

There are many theories for selecting and analyzing a particular form of f. These include the expected benefit theory (EUT) (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 2007), the dual benefit theory (Yaari, 1987), risk measures (Artzner et al., 1999), and so on. EUT is perhaps the most popular theory in economics and game theory, while risk measures are often found in financial literature. We opt for risk measures to model the agent's behavior. In this section, we introduce risk measures while detailing the justification of the use of risk measures and their relationship to EUT section 6."}, {"heading": "3.1 Risk measures", "text": "As its name implies, risk measures assign higher values to assets that are \"riskier.\" They can also be understood as a measure of the potential loss of certain assets.

Thus, monotonicity indicates that an asset with a better return deserves lower risk."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Examples of risk measures", "text": "A famous non-convex risk measure is the Value at Risk (VaR) (Linsmeier and Pearson, 2000), which gives a threshold loss l, so that the probability that \u2212 X exceeds l is less than a predefined level VaR\u03b1 (X) \u2261 inf {l-R | P (\u2212 X > l) \u2264 1 \u2212 \u03b1}.

The behavior of the choice of {w, X} opt is called rational choice, and an agent is rational when he always chooses {w, X} opt as his trade target. As within our framework, a rational agent chooses only his own target (3,7), this property seems to prevent us from linking markets with machine learning methods, since the latter always aim to achieve certain global goals."}, {"heading": "4 Multi-period Trading Markets", "text": "In this section, we will build a market that defines the price of each security. However, all trading agents may only trade with one market maker whose trades are driven by a market maker. \"Multi-period\" is used to indicate that the prices of the securities may vary at different times and that agents may trade with the market maker in multiple times (Fo'llmer et al., 2004). The market maker is introduced to simplify the market mechanism and make the market run efficiently. Furthermore, it is difficult to characterize the trading process in markets with unspecified mechanisms, and these markets may not operate efficiently. For example, there may not be a consistent agreement between agents on how much should be paid to buy / sell a share of a security. Furthermore, an agent who cannot find a certain amount of shares (Chen and Pennock, 2007) may provide a way to simplify the trading process by introducing a market maker (Hanson, 2007, an agent who is a market maker for each security)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Appropriate choice on the pricing rule ct(\u00b7)", "text": "A popular class of mechanisms is Hanson's Market Scoring Rules (Hanson, 2007).

Many of the tasks of machine learning could be interpreted in the following general framework: Given a data set sampled from space and a hypotheses space P containing a class of accessible probabilities, we would like to find a probability of P that best describes the data. Usually, we use a functional F: P \u2192 R to characterize the \"best\" performance, so that the best probability is the one that minimizes F. Formally, it is an optimization problem min P-P-F (P) (5.1), for specific problems where the information comes from different parts of the data or models, F has a form of F = p-n-Fn, the sum of a number of functionalities that share the same domain P (see examples in Section 7 for a problem), where the information comes from different parts of the data or model has a form of F = two-level combination, F = a two-level combination."}, {"heading": "5.1 The global objective of a market", "text": "We show that a market traded over multiple time periods minimizes a global target.

We will discuss the work that is closely related to us. It is Chen and Vaughan (2010) who first show that what scoring rules market makers do is effective online learning without remorse. Their study focuses on market makers, while agents are not directly modeled, which motivates a framework for the entire market.Storkey (2011) defines and analyzes a type of forecasting markets based on definitions in the markets, securities and agents. Agents are modeled by EUT, that is, an agent is rational by maximizing its expected use.By analyzing the equilibrium state of the market, the author shows that the market aggregates beliefs of agents to produce a distribution of probability about future events. The author does not discuss precise market mechanisms or give the global goal of the market making it difficult to optimize ahead of these markets."}, {"heading": "6.1 Risk measures and EUT", "text": "First, the output value of a risk measure can be treated as a risk-free asset, and standard linear operations are well defined for this. In comparison, an expected benefit gives a figure that has only abstract meaning, i.e. measuring the degree of satisfaction of the agent. Furthermore, risk measures by definition force the invariance of the translation, but expected utility functions generally do not have this characteristic. Translation invariance can always separate wealth w from the risky asset X, which implies that the optimal portfolio does not depend on w. This saves us the difficulty of associating w with the aggregation weights, since the relationship between them is highly inconsistent and varies dramatically between different uses (Storkey et al., 2012). Finally, we could always derive risk taking from risk mitigation (Fillmer et al.)."}, {"heading": "7 Examples", "text": "In this section, we use three examples to illustrate the links between trading markets in several periods and machine learning."}, {"heading": "7.1 Opinion Pooling", "text": "The opinion pooling problem is a common setting for predictive market models (Barbu and Lay, 2012; Storkey et al., 2012). Garg et al. (2004) show that the goal of an opinion pool is to minimize a weighted sum of a series of divergences. Specifically, for logarithmic opinion pools, the goal is tomin P \u00b2 P \u00b2 n wnD [P | | Pn], (7.1) where D \u2212 | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 the KL divergence and {wn} weighting parameters are. Let's now consider a log opinion pool of a set of A probabilities on a finite discrete margin with K states. To establish a market that corresponds to the log opinion pool, we first define a market in the same space and introduce K Arrow Debreu securities. We introduce N agents and assign a unique probability pole to the agent as his personal belief."}, {"heading": "7.2 Bayesian Update", "text": "We give our second example by first establishing a market and then adapting a machine learning problem to the market.

On the basis of this result, we establish close links between machine learning and markets. A future work would be to carry out a detailed analysis of this framework using the tools of convex optimisation (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004). A particularly interesting topic is the search for the conditions under which the market will converge. As we have observed, stochasticity occurs when a large number of agents are involved, which is probably the nature of any real market (Penna et al., 2012)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This work was supported by Microsoft Research Cambridge as part of its PhD fellowship program."}], "references": [{"title": "Efficient market making via convex optimization, and a connection to online learning", "author": ["J.
