In this paper, we propose a new method that achieves this goal with only image-level labels of whether the objects are present or not. Our approach combines a discriminative submodular cover problem for automatically discovering a set of positive object windows with a smoothed latent SVM formulation. The latter allows us to leverage efficient Quasi-Newton optimization techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach provides approximately 70% relative improvement in average precision over the current state of the art on standard benchmark datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 07:21:20 GMT  (8077kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1024v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 14 Mar 2014 00:50:26 GMT  (8077kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1024v2", "10 pages"], ["v3", "Mon, 17 Mar 2014 21:04:49 GMT  (8077kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1024v3", "10 pages"], ["v4", "Thu, 15 May 2014 22:08:59 GMT  (3437kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1024v4", null]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["hyun oh song", "ross b girshick", "stefanie jegelka", "julien mairal", "za\u00efd harchaoui", "trevor darrell"], "accepted": true, "id": "1403.1024"}, "pdf": {"name": "1403.1024.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On learning to localize objects with minimal supervision", "authors": ["Hyun Oh Song", "Ross Girshick", "Stefanie Jegelka", "Julien Mairal", "Zaid Harchaoui", "Trevor Darrell"], "emails": ["SONG@EECS.BERKELEY.EDU", "RBG@EECS.BERKELEY.EDU", "STEFJE@EECS.BERKELEY.EDU", "JULIEN.MAIRAL@INRIA.FR", "ZAID.HARCHAOUI@INRIA.FR", "TREVOR@EECS.BERKELEY.EDU"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "The classic paradigm for learning object recognition begins with the annotation of each object instance, in all educational images, with a delimitation box. However, this exhaustive labeling approach is costly and error prone to large-scale datasets. The vast amount of textually annotated visual data available online inspires another, more difficult research problem. Can weakly labeled images without delimitation boxes be used to reliably train object detectors? In this alternative paradigm, the goal is to learn to locate objects with minimal surveillance (Weber et al., 2000a; b). We focus on the case where the student has access to binary image labels that encode whether an image contains the target object or not, without access to instance-level annotations (i.e., delimitation boxes). Our approach begins by reducing the number of possible detection processes at the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning, Beijing, 2014, China."}, {"heading": "2. Related work", "text": "Our work relates to three active areas of research: (1) weakly supervised learning, (2) unattended discovery of medium-level visual elements, and (3) co-segmentation, building on a number of earlier approaches to the formation of object detectors from poorly labeled data; in almost all cases, the task is formulated as a multiple instance (MIL) problem (Long & Tan, 1996), in which the learner has access to an image-level label indicating the presence or absence of the target class, but not its location (if it exists); the challenge facing the learner is to find the signal fragments present in the positive images, but not in the negative images; the implicit assumption is that this signal corresponds to the positive class; although there has been recent work on convex relations (Li et al., 2013; Joulin & Bach, 2012), most MIL algorithms are initiation algorithms."}, {"heading": "3. Problem formulation", "text": "Our goal is to learn a detector for a visual category from a set of images, each with a binary label. However, we model an image as a series of overlapping rectangular windows and follow a standard approach to detection: reduce the detection problem to the problem of binary classification of image windows. However, at training time, we only receive image captions at image level, which results in classic multiple instance learning (MIL). We can consider each image as a \"bag\" of instances (rectangular windows), and the binary image caption y = 1 specifies that the bag contains at least one instance of the target category. The caption y = \u2212 1 specifies that the image does not contain any instance labels of the category. During the training, no instance labels are available. MIL problems are typically solved (locally) by finding a local minimum of a non-constant 2003 target function, such as the optimization of the SVL."}, {"heading": "4.

Review of latent SVM", "text": "For a binary classification problem, the latent SVM formulation consists of learning a decision function that includes a maximization level over a discrete set of configurations. (1) Given a data point x in Rp, which we want to classify, and some learned model parameters w in Rd, we select a label y in {-1, + 1} as follows: y = characters (max z).Z (7), where z is selected as a \"latent variable\" under the set Z, Z is typically a set of bouncing boxes, and maximized over Z, it boils down to finding a bouncing box containing the object (Felzenszwalb et al.), the set Z contains all possible sub-configurations that each part is associated with a position in the image. The resulting set Z is exponential in size, but (7) can be related to dynamic programming techniques for certain decisions."}, {"heading": "5.2. Smooth formulation of LSVM", "text": "In the objective (8), the lingering loss in the maximizing (8) problem solving can easily be replaced by a smooth alternative, e.g. by a square arrangement (11) or a logistical loss.

Experiments", "text": "We conducted two experiments, one with a multiple learning dataset (Andrews et al., 2003) and the other with data from PASCAL VOC 2007 (Everingham et al.).
