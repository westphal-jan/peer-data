This is, of course, when these concepts are endowed with symmetrical differences, since the concepts of a node x x x x near another node x x x and x x near x are equal. In an asymmetrical network, these concepts are different and this difference motivates the definition of structures more generally than partitions. Given the fact that a partition P = {B1,., BJ} of X is induced in an equivalence relationship, we look for the equivalent of an asymmetrical partition by removing the symmetrical property in the definition of the equivalence relationship.

Conclusion", "text": "Therefore, we defined quasi-dendrograms, a generalization of dendrograms that permits asymmetric relationships, and developed a theory for quasi-cluster methods. We formalized the concept of admissibility by introducing two axioms. In this context, we demonstrated that DSL is the only permissible method. We pointed out that less stringent frameworks leading to new permissible methods can be explored by mitigating the Directed Axiom of Transformation. Furthermore, we demonstrated an equivalence between quasi-dendrograms and quasi-ultrametrics that generalizes the known equivalence between dendrograms and ultrametries and established the stability and inventory characteristics of the DSL method. Finally, we demonstrated the application of DSL to a migration network."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The work on this essay is supported by NSF CCF0952867, AFOSR MURI FA9550-10-1-0567, DARPA GRAPHS FA9550-12-1-0416, AFOSR FA9550-09-0-10531, AFOSR FA9550-09-1-0643, NSF DMS 0905823 and NSF DMS-0406992."}, {"heading": "A.

We prove that a modified version of single linkage is the only admissible quasi-clustering method.

Algorithms are further developed and the value of quasi-clustering analysis is illustrated with a study of internal migration within United States.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
