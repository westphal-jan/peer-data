This paper presents a Gaussian process localization (GP-Localize) algorithm that, in contrast to existing works, can exploit the spatially correlated field measurements taken during a robot's exploration (instead of relying on prior training data) for efficiently and scalably learning the GP observation model online through our proposed novel online sparse GP. As a result, GP-Localize is capable of achieving constant time and memory (i.e., independent of the size of the data) per filtering step, which demonstrates the practical feasibility of using GPs for persistent robot localization and autonomy. Empirical evaluation via simulated experiments with real-world datasets and a real robot experiment shows that GP-Localize outperforms existing GP localization algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Apr 2014 10:28:00 GMT  (345kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5165v1", "28th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2014), Extended version with proofs, 10 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Apr 2014 08:03:33 GMT  (345kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5165v2", "28th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2014), Extended version with proofs, 10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "28th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2014), Extended version with proofs, 10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["nuo xu", "kian hsiang low", "jie chen", "keng kiat lim", "etkin baris ozgul"], "accepted": true, "id": "1404.5165"}, "pdf": {"name": "1404.5165.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "GP-Localize: Persistent Mobile Robot Localization using Online Sparse Gaussian Process Observation Model", "authors": ["Nuo Xu", "Kian Hsiang Low", "Jie Chen", "Keng Kiat Lim", "Bari\u015f \u00d6zg\u00fcl"], "emails": ["ebozgul}@comp.nus.edu.sg,", "chenjie@smart.mit.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them are able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves, \"he said in an interview with the\" New York Times, \"in which he said the role of the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times, the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times, the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \""}, {"heading": "2.1 Modeling Environmental Field with GP", "text": "The Gauzian process (GP) can be used to model an environment field as a follow1: The environment field is defined as realization of a GP.

It can be observed that GP-Localize outperforms the other two methods in each individual field and in several fields (i.e. all 6): The observation model (i.e., represented by our sparse online GP) of GP-Localize can use the assimilated summary and recent observations to better predict the fields in explored and unexplored areas respectively. In contrast, SoD-Truncate performs poorly in explored areas because its prediction ability is limited by the use of recent observations. SoDEven's limited observations can only cover the entire area sparsely, resulting in an inaccurate observation model.It can also be observed from Table 1 that GP-Localize does not detect its largest (smallest) localization error in a highly explored (3) field with a robot."}, {"heading": "4.2 Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) Fields", "text": "Table 2 shows the localization errors (m) of the methods tested, averaged over all 336 time steps and 5 simulation runs. Similar to the observations for WSS fields (Section 4.1), GPLocalize outperforms the other two methods in each individual field and in multiple fields, as explained in the previous section. It can also be observed that GP-Localize achieves a smaller error in the light field than in the temperature field, because the measurements of the light field vary slightly more than those of the temperature field, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 2b shows the error of GP-Localize at each time step in each individual field and in multiple fields on average over 5 runs. It can be observed again that the error in multiple fields is not always the smallest at each time step, but often the lowest of all individual fields and not as high as in the individual temperature field. Our GP-Localize algorithm, which uses multiple fields, is therefore more robust in this experiment."}, {"heading": "4.3 Urban Traffic Speeds (UTS) Field", "text": "In the UTS field, the localization error is defined as the geodesic (i.e. shortest distance) distance between the estimated and the actual inhabited road segments with regard to the topology of the road network (Fig. 4).

We theoretically analyze the equivalence of our GP online selection to the online learning variant of the offline PITC. We demonstrate empirically that GPLocalize exceeds the existing GP localization algorithms in terms of localization performance and scalability and achieves robustness by exploiting multiple fields. In addition to using our GP online selection variant for persistent robot localization, we note that it can indeed be applied to a variety of applications and are particularly desirable (i.e. due to runtime and memory that are independent of the size of the data) for data flow tasks over time or in real-time low visual requirements (i.e., we do not include robotic acquisition, 2002ampling learning, and 2ampling learning)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology Subaward Agreement No. 41 R252-000-527-592."}, {"heading": "B Proof of Theorem 1", "text": "Since Dn = xc (n \u2212 1) and D \u2212 n (n \u2212 2) are equal (n \u2212 3), D \u2212 n (n \u2212 4) and D \u2212 n (n \u2212 4) are equal.

As a result, GP-Localize is capable of achieving constant time and memory (i.e., independent of the size of the data) per filtering step, which demonstrates the practical feasibility of using GPs for persistent robot localization and autonomy. Empirical evaluation via simulated experiments with real-world datasets and a real robot experiment shows that GP-Localize outperforms existing GP localization algorithms.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
