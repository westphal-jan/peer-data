He/she can spend hours trying to craft the message. Does it actually matter? While there has been extensive prior work looking into predicting popularity of social-media content, the effect of wording per se has rarely been studied since it is often confounded with the popularity of the author and the topic. To control for these confounding factors, we take advantage of the surprising fact that there are many pairs of tweets containing the same url and written by the same user but employing different wording. Given such pairs, we ask: which version attracts more retweets? This turns out to be a more difficult task than predicting popular topics. Still, humans can answer this question better than chance (but far from perfectly), and the computational methods we develop can do better than both an average human and a strong competing method trained on non-controlled data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 May 2014 20:04:44 GMT  (462kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1438v1", "11 pages, to appear in Proceedings of ACL 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, to appear in Proceedings of ACL 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL physics.soc-ph", "authors": ["chenhao tan", "lillian lee", "bo pang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1405.1438"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.1438.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The effect of wording on message propagation: Topic- and author-controlled natural experiments on Twitter", "authors": ["Chenhao Tan", "Lillian Lee", "Bo Pang"], "emails": ["chenhao@cs.cornell.edu", "llee@cs.cornell.edu", "bopang42@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "How to make a message \"successful\"? This question is of interest to many entities, including political parties that try to formulate a question (Chong and Druckman, 2007), and individuals who try to make a point in a group meeting. In the first case, an important type of success is achieved when the national conversation adopts the party's rhetoric; in the second case, when other group members repeat the starting point of the individual point, the massive availability of online messages, such as posts on social media, may now allow researchers to investigate on a large scale the factors that influence the propagation of messages, also known as adoption, dissemination, or virality. According to previous research, important features include the characteristics of the originator of the message (e.g. verified Twitter users or not, the author's success rate), the author's social network (e.g. the number of followers), news division, or the topic of the message (Artzi et al., 2012; Bakshy et al al, 2012; Guerini et al)."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "The idea of exploring effective communication strategies through carefully controlled experiments dates back at least to Hovland et al.

Simmons et al. (2011) investigated the variation of quotations from different sources to investigate how text memes mutate when people pass them on but do not control them for the author. Predicting the \"success\" of various texts such as novels and film quotes was the goal of additional earlier work not already mentioned in \u00a7 1 (Ashok et al., 2013; Louis and Nenkova, 2013; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012; and Pitler Lapenkore, 2008; and McIntyva, 2009)."}, {"heading": "3 Data", "text": "\"Our most important datasets were constructed by first providing 1.77M topic and author-controlled a-770 pairs as\" http: / / www.tc-tweetpaars5, which differ in more than just intervals.

Does it work to explicitly ask people to share the message? Is it better to be short and concise or long and informative? We define a set of features to capture this and other aspects of the message. We then examine (i) how effective each feature is in attracting more retweets; and (ii) whether authors prefer to apply a particular feature when issuing a second version of a tweet.

We group the tweets introduced in \u00a7 5.1 into 16 lexicon-based features (Table 3, 8, 9, 10), 9 information features (Table 4), 6 language model features (Table 5, 6), 6 rt score features (Table 11), and 2 readability features (Table 11). We point to all 39 of them together as custom features. We also consider tagged bag-ofwords (\"BOW\") features, which include all the unigram features (word: POS pair) and Bigram features that appear more than 10 times in the cross-validation data. This results in 3,568 unigram features and a total of 4,095-6,232 grams for the above-mentioned features."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we conducted the first large-scale, thematic and authorization-controlled experiment to examine the effects of formulations on the dissemination of information.The features we developed to choose the better of two alternative formulations performed better than all of our comparison algorithms, including access to authoring and timing characteristics, but trained on non-TAC data, and also exceeded our estimate of average human performance. According to our hypothesis tests, helpful formulation euristics include adding more information, adapting one's own language to community norms and previous news, and copying news headlines. Readers can try their own alternative formulations at http: / / chenhaot.com / retweetedmore / to see which simplified version of our classification predictions is available. In future work, it will be interesting to see how these characteristics can be applied to broader C. and the broader cultural arguments underlying the problem."}], "references": [{"title": "Predicting responses to microblog posts", "author": ["Yoav Artzi", "Patrick Pantel", "Michael Gamon."], "venue": "Proceedings of NAACL (short paper).", "citeRegEx": "Artzi et al\\.,? 2012", "shortCiteRegEx": "Artzi et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Success with style: Using writing style to predict the success of novels", "author": ["Vikas Ganjigunte Ashok", "Song Feng", "Yejin Choi."], "venue": "Proceedings of EMNLP.", "citeRegEx": "Ashok et al\\.,? 2013", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ashok et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Everyone\u2019s an influencer: Quantifying influence on twitter", "author": ["Eitan Bakshy", "Jake M.

He/she can spend hours trying to craft the message. Does it actually matter? While there has been extensive prior work looking into predicting popularity of socialmedia content, the effect of wording per se has rarely been studied since it is often confounded with the popularity of the author and the topic. To control for these confounding factors, we take advantage of the surprising fact that there are many pairs of tweets containing the same url and written by the same user but employing different wording. Given such pairs, we ask: which version attracts more retweets? This turns out to be a more difficult task than predicting popular topics. Still, humans can answer this question better than chance (but far from perfectly), and the computational methods we develop can do better than both an average human and a strong competing method trained on noncontrolled data.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
