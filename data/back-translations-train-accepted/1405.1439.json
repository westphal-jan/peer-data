We believe that this corpus of sentence revisions, along with the labels and comments of participants, can provide insights into better ways to address this issue and help us better understand the strength of statements. An interesting direction that makes this possible is a potentially new type of learning problem. Comments point to characteristics that people think stand out. Is it possible to automatically learn new characteristics from the comments? The ultimate goal of our study is to understand the impact of meaningfulness on the public, which can lead to different applications in public communication."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank J.
