In this paper, we present a novel approach for extracting - in a totally automated way - a high-coverage and high-precision lexicon of roughly 37 thousand terms annotated with emotion scores, called DepecheMood. Our approach exploits in an original way 'crowd-sourced' affective annotation implicitly provided by readers of news articles from rappler.com. By providing new state-of-the-art performances in unsupervised settings for regression and classification tasks, even using a na\\\"{\\i}ve approach, our experiments show the beneficial impact of harvesting social media data for affective lexicon building.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 May 2014 13:40:47 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1605v1", "To appear at ACL 2014. 7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear at ACL 2014. 7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["jacopo staiano", "marco guerini"], "accepted": true, "id": "1405.1605"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.1605.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["staiano@disi.unitn.it", "marco.guerini@trentorise.eu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 5.16 05v1 [cs.CL] 7 May 201 4"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is.

In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on the production of lexica with previous polarities used in sentiment analysis. In building such lists, atrade-off between reporting on the resource and its accuracy can be found. One of the best-known resources is SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Baccianella et al., 2010), in which each entry is associated with the numerical score (s)."}, {"heading": "3 Dataset Collection", "text": "To build our emotional lexicon, we harvested all the news articles from rappler.com, dated June 3, 2013: the final record consists of 13.5 million words over 25.3 million documents, with an average of 530 words per document. For each document, along with the text, we also harvested the information displayed by Rappler's Mood Meter, a small interface that allows readers to click on the emotions that a given Rappler story has made them feel. In fact, the idea behind the Mood Meter is to \"get people to crowd-source the mood for the day\" 1, and the percentage of votes for each emotion for a particular story. In this way, hundreds of thousands of voices have been collected since the service's launch. In our novel approach to \"crowdsourcing,\" compared to other NLP tasks that rely on tools like Amazon's Mechanical Turk (Snow et al., 2008), the subjects are \"aware of the implicit remark, but are not paid.\""}, {"heading": "4 Emotion Lexicon Creation", "text": "As a next step, we constructed a word-by-emotion matrix based on MDE with an approach based on compositional semantics. To do this, we first lemmatized all documents and tagged PoS (where PoS adj., nouns, verbs, adv.) and only maintained the # PoS problems that also exist in WordNet, similar to SWN-before and WordNetAffect resources that we want to align ourselves to. We then calculated the term-by-document matrices using raw frequencies, normalized frequencies, and tf-idf (MWD, f, MWD, nf, and MWD, respectively, tfidf) to test which of the three weights is better. Then, we applied the matrix multiplication between the document-by-emotion and the word-by-document-by-matrices (MDE \u00b7 MWD) first."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "To evaluate the performance we achieve with our lexicon, we use the public records we provided for the SemEval 2007 task on \"Affective Text\" (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007), which focused on emotionality in order to attract readers \"attention. An example of a headline from the dataset is the following:\" Iraq car bombings kill 22 people, wound more than 60. \"For the regression task that the values are provided are < anger (0.27), fear (0.84), joy (0.0), surprise (0.20) > during the classification task {FEAR, SADNESS}."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "Our experimental results indicate a high range and precision of the lexicon, and show significant improvements over state-of-the-art, unattended approaches, even when the resource is used with very na\u00efve classification and regression strategies. We believe that the wealth of information provided by social media can be used to build models and resources for recognizing emotions from text that go one step beyond sentiment analysis. Our future work includes testing singular value decomposition using word-by-document matrices that allow to propagate emotion values for a document with similar words that are not present in the document itself, and investigating perceived mood effects on viral indices and readers \"engagement through the use of tweets, likes, reshares, and comments.
