In this paper, we propose a novel semidefinite relaxation formulation (referred to as SDR) to estimate the MAP assignment. Algorithmically, we develop an accelerated variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (referred to as SDPAD-LR) that can effectively exploit the special structure of the new relaxation. Encouragingly, the proposed procedure allows solving SDR for large-scale problems, e.g., problems on a grid graph comprising hundreds of thousands of variables with multiple states per node. Compared with prior SDP solvers, SDPAD-LR is capable of attaining comparable accuracy while exhibiting remarkably improved scalability, in contrast to the commonly held belief that semidefinite relaxation can only been applied on small-scale MRF problems. We have evaluated the performance of SDR on various benchmark datasets including OPENGM2 and PIC in terms of both the quality of the solutions and computation time. Experimental results demonstrate that for a broad class of problems, SDPAD-LR outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in producing better MAP assignment in an efficient manner.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 May 2014 16:58:24 GMT  (59kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4807v1", "accepted to International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted to International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.IT math.IT math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["qi-xing huang", "yuxin chen", "leonidas j guibas"], "accepted": true, "id": "1405.4807"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.4807.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Scalable Semidefinite Relaxation for Maximum A Posterior Estimation", "authors": ["Qixing Huang", "Yuxin Chen"], "emails": ["HUANGQX@STANFORD.EDU", "YXCHEN@STANFORD.EDU", "GUIBAS@CS.STANFORD.EDU"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 5.48 07v1 [cs.LG] 1 9M ay"}, {"heading": "1.

Interesting readers refer to (Wainwright & Jordan, 2008) in order to get a thorough introduction to this topic. Below, we will focus on methods that include a relaxation policy that matters most. Wainwright et al., 2005, most relaxation techniques are derived from the original graphic structure underlying the MAP estimation problem, including linear relaxation methods (Chekuri et al., Wainwright et al, 2005) which are the most popular."}, {"heading": "1.2. Notation", "text": "Before proceeding, we present some notations used throughout the paper. For each linear operator A, we let A represent its conjugate operator.

Without loss of universality, we assume that each xi contains values in a discrete state set {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, m}. Let us consider a Markov random field (MRF) G parameterized in pairs by the potentials (or sufficient statistics) wi (xi) for all vertices and wij (xi, xj) for all edges (i, j) and G. The energy (or log probability) associated with this MRF is given by f (X) = n \u2211 i = 1wi (xi) + \u2211 (i, j) and Ewij (xi, xj).

Iterative Rounding", "text": "Similar to other ADMM methods (Boyd et al., 2011), the SDPAD-LR converges rapidly to moderate accuracy within the first 400 iterations and then slows down significantly thereafter. Thus, instead of continuing until the SDPAD-LR converges, it would be more efficient to reduce the problem size by fixing those variables whose optimal states are likely to be uncovered. Specifically, after each round of SDPAD-LR, we determine the optimal state of a variable xi if xi, j > tmax (tmax = 0.99 for all examples) or xi, j = max1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m xi, j. We then apply the iterative methods to the reduced problem. In practice, we find that due to the density of the reduced problems, the size is much smaller than the original problem, and an iterative rounding method is usually sufficient."}, {"heading": "4.

OPENGM2 includes 19 categories of mostly sparse MAP problems. We select four representative categories for evaluation: Geometric surface labeling (GM label), Chinese characters (GM-Char), MRF photomontage (GMMontage), and matching (GM matching).

Conclusions", "text": "We have extensively compared the proposed SDP solver with various state-of-the-art SDP solvers, and experimental results confirm that our SDP solver is much more scalable than previous approaches when applied to various MAP estimation problems, enabling us to apply SDRs to large-scale datasets. Due to the power of semi-defined relaxation, SDRs are superior to other powerful MAP inference algorithms on a variety of benchmark datasets. There are many opportunities for future research. First, we would like to extend SDRs to higher-level MAP problems. Furthermore, it would be interesting to integrate SDR and combinatorial optimization techniques, which have the potential to enhance the performance of both. Theoretically, this would be an exciting direction for the investigation. This would provide justification of the problems that are presented at hand, and other optimization techniques can be considered precise combinations."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partially supported by NSF grants FODAVA 808515 and CCF 1011228, AFOSR grants FA955012-1-0372, ONR MURI N00014-13-1-0341 and a Google research award."}], "references": [{"title": "The multiplicative weights update method: a meta-algorithm and applications", "author": ["Arora", "Sanjeev", "Hazan", "Elad", "Kale", "Satyen"], "venue": "Theory of Computing,", "citeRegEx": "Arora et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Arora et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Tighter relaxations for MAP-MRF inference: A local primal-dual gap based separation", "author": ["D.

In this paper, we propose a novel semidefinite relaxation formulation (referred to as SDR) to estimate the MAP assignment. Algorithmically, we develop an accelerated variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (referred to as SDPAD-LR) that can effectively exploit the special structure of the new relaxation. Encouragingly, the proposed procedure allows solving SDR for large-scale problems, e.g., problems on a grid graph comprising hundreds of thousands of variables with multiple states per node. Compared with prior SDP solvers, SDPAD-LR is capable of attaining comparable accuracy while exhibiting remarkably improved scalability, in contrast to the commonly held belief that semidefinite relaxation can only been applied on small-scale MRF problems. We have evaluated the performance of SDR on various benchmark datasets including OPENGM2 and PIC in terms of boththe quality of the solutions and computation time. Experimental results demonstrate that for a broad class of problems, SDPAD-LR outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in producing better MAP assignments in an efficient manner.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
