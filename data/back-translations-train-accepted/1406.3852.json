Such a test enables one to answer whether one source variable is significantly more dependent on the first target variable or the second. Dependence is measured via the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), resulting in a pair of empirical dependence measures (source-target 1, source-target 2). Modeling the covariance between these HSIC statistics leads to a provably more powerful test than the construction of independent HSIC statistics by sub sampling. The resulting test is consistent and unbiased, and (being based on U-statistics) has favorable convergence properties. The test can be computed in quadratic time, matching the computational complexity of standard empirical HSIC estimators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the test on a real-world linguistics problem of identifying language groups from a multilingual corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Jun 2014 19:23:11 GMT  (1079kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3852v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 11 Jul 2014 17:12:58 GMT  (313kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3852v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 27 May 2015 08:25:19 GMT  (978kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3852v3", "International Conference on Machine Learning, Jul 2015, Lille, France"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO", "authors": ["wacha bounliphone", "arthur gretton", "arthur tenenhaus", "matthew b blaschko"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.3852"}, "pdf": {"name": "1406.3852.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "A low variance consistent test of relative dependency", "authors": ["Wacha Bounliphone", "Arthur Gretton", "Arthur Tenenhaus", "Matthew B.

We will designate the remaining samples as Y \u2032 and Z \u2032 \u2032 \u2032.

The dependent test is more powerful", "text": "While half of the samples result in a consistent test, we might expect some loss of power over the approach in Section 3.1 due to the increase in variance with a smaller sample size.

We cite the simple and consistent approach in Section 3.2, the independent approach and the approach of lower variance in Section 3.1, the dependent approach. The following theorem compares these approaches. Theory 6. The asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) of the independent approach with respect to the independent approach is always greater than 1.Remark 1. Asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) is defined in e.g. Serfling (1981, Chapter 5, Section 1.15.4).

Multilingual data", "text": "In this section, we show dependency tests to predict the relative similarity of different languages. We use a real data set from the parallel corpus of the European Parliament (Koehn, 2005). We select 3000 random documents in common written in: Finnish (fi), Italian (it), French (fr), Spanish (es), Portuguese (pt), English (en), Dutch (nl), German (de), Danish (da) and Swedish (sv). However, these languages can generally be categorized into Romance, German or Uralic groups (Gray & Atkinson, 2003). In this data set, we consider each language as a random variable and each document as an observation.Our first goal is to test whether the statistical dependence between two languages in the same group is greater than the statistical dependence between the languages nearby."}, {"heading": "5.3. Pediatric glioma data", "text": "Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children and have the highest mortality rate of all pediatric cancers. Despite advances in multimodality therapy, children with pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG) without exception have an overall survival rate of approximately 20% at age 5. Depending on the location (e.g. brain stem, central nuclei or supratorial), pHGG have different traits in terms of radiological appearance, histology and prognostication. the hypothesis is that pHGG has different genetic origins and oncogenic signaling pathways depending on the location. The biological processes involved in the development of the tumor may differ from one gene to another. In order to evaluate such hypotheses, genes in frozen tumor samples of 53 children with newly diagnosed pHGG molecular variants of Malades (Paris, France) from Puget et al, (2012) Gene-Gene-12 are divided into three gene positions (Gene-12)."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "We have shown that our test is more rigorous than a test that does not exploit the covariance between HSIC statistics, and empirically achieves p values several orders of magnitude smaller. We have empirically demonstrated the test performance on synthetic data that could control the degree of dependence; the difficult problem of identifying language groups from a multilingual corpus; and to determine the most important determinant of glioma type. The calculation and memory requirements of the test are square in sample size and correspond to the performance of the HSIC and related tests for dependence between two random variables. Therefore, the test is scalable to the wide range of problem cases where non-parametric dependency tests are used. We have the test for generalized statistics within a framework where a more consistent HSIC and a more consistent algorithm are available."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Ioannis Antonoglou for the helpful discussions.

Such a test enables us to determine whether one source variable is significantly more dependent on a first target variable or a second. Dependence is measured via the HilbertSchmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), resulting in a pair of empirical dependence measures (source-target 1, source-target 2). We test whether the first dependence measure is significantly larger than the second. Modeling the covariance between these HSIC statistics leads to a provably more powerful test than the construction of independent HSIC statistics by subsampling. The resulting test is consistent and unbiased, and (being based on U-statistics) has favorable convergence properties. The test can be computed in quadratic time, matching the computational complexity of standard empirical HSIC estimators. The effectiveness of the test is demonstrated on several real-world problems: we identify language groups from a multilingual corpus, and we prove that tumor location is more dependent on gene expression than chromosomal imbalances.
