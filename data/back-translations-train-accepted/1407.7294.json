For an introduction to the Standard Model, see [5] and [6], and for an examination of recent work, see [8]. Most efforts to date have focused on the construction of utility functions that explain a finite sequence of prices / bundles of observations. Africa's theory is the groundbreaking result in this field, proving that a sequence of observations is rationalizable (i.e., it can be explained by a utility function) when the sequence is favored by a pietic linear, monotonous sequence of utility functions."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "We look at a series of n divisible goods, which a merchant wants to sell to a consumer. (We represent a bundle of goods x = X functions, which are defined by a vector, which indicates which fractions of each of the n goods is purchased.) The consumer has an unknown utility problem u: [0, 1] n indication of their use for each possible bundle. The merchant has the power to set prices (one for each good), which is also represented by a vector p. (So we normalize the price of each good i is pi \u2264 1). That is, he buys a bundle x is simply x \u00b7 p = 1 pi \u00b7 x. Finally, the consumer behaves as follows: before a price vector p, the consumer buys her most preferred bundle of services. (That is, she buys a bundle in arg maxx \u00b7 p)."}, {"heading": "3 Maximizing Profit in the Price-Setting Model", "text": "First, we look at the first model where the trader controls prices and seeks to maximize profit.

(Even then, it is not clear that there is an efficient algorithm for calculating a profit-maximizing price vector.) As already mentioned, the optimal prices for the merchant would be inefficient in a two-step, comprehensive form of game in which the merchant has exponentially many strategies. We show that this task can only be achieved (almost) in time if the key to the efficiency of the algorithm results from the observation that there is a limited family of price vectors.
