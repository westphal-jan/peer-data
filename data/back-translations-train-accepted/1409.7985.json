By taking out and plotting different case parameters, we can illustrate the different effects that each type of text has on a justice's vote-specific intellectual property. Figure 2, for example, shows the vote-specific IP estimates of judges in the case of Maples v. Thomas (132 pp. Ct. 912). Question-only IPs are calculated by zeros of the two amicus polarity parameters (cp and cr). On the other hand, intellectual property is calculated by zeros based on amicus pleadings that support Maples (Thomas). We note that the question-only IPs coincide with the (well-known) ideological stance of the judiciary on the death penalty."}, {"heading": "5.3 Counterfactual Analysis", "text": "In fact, the majority of people who are in favour of equality between men and women are in favour of equality between men and women, most of them are against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality and equality between women and women, against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality and equality between women and women, against equality between men and women and against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women, against equality between men and women and equality between men and women.

Despite these simplifications, the model is a useful tool for quantitative analysis and hypothesis generation in support of substantial research on the judiciary."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "Poole and Rosenthal (1985) introduced the IP model by using roll-call data to derive latent legislative positions. Since then, many types of IP models have been proposed for different voting scenarios: IP models for SCOTUS (Martin and Quinn 2002), multidimensional IP models for congressional voting (Heckman and Snyder 1996; Clinton, Jackman and Rivers 2004), grounding multidimensional IP models using topics learned from congressional submissions (Gerrish and Lead 2012), and SCOTUS opinions (Lauderdale and Clark 2014). Amici have been extensively studied, in particular their influence on SCOTUS (Caldeira and Wright 1988; Kearney and Merrill 2000; Collins 2008; Corley, Collins and Hamner 2013). Collins (2007) found that justices can be influenced by compelling arguments presented by organized interests. These studies focus on ideological metadata (liberal / conservative views, etc.)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced a random utility model for compelling text; it resembles a classical generative model and can be estimated using familiar algorithms; the main difference is that compelling text is modelled according to the addressee and the details of the matter it is convinced of; authors are agents who seek to maximise their expected benefit in a given scenario. In the SCOTUS area, this leads to improved election forecasting, as the model captures the structure of amicus fonts better than simpler treatments of the text. Second, and more importantly, our model is able to answer interesting counterfactual questions."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This research was supported in part by an A * STAR grant to Y.

A larger difference in judgment suggests that more of a justice's decision-making can be explained by the presence of amicus pleadings.
