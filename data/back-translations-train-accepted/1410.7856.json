In our framework, we are given a statistical ranking model, a decision space, and a loss function defined on (parameter, decision) pairs, and formulate social choice mechanisms as decision rules that minimize expected loss. This suggests a general framework for the design and analysis of new social choice mechanisms. We compare Bayesian estimators, which minimize Bayesian expected loss, for the Mallows model and the Condorcet model respectively, and the Kemeny rule. We consider various normative properties, in addition to computational complexity and asymptotic behavior. In particular, we show that the Bayesian estimator for the Condorcet model satisfies some desired properties such as anonymity, neutrality, and monotonicity, can be computed in polynomial time, and is asymptotically different from the other two rules when the data are generated from the Condorcet model for some ground truth parameter.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Oct 2014 01:46:50 GMT  (166kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7856v1", "Full version of a NIPS-14 paper under the same title"], ["v2", "Sat, 12 Mar 2016 05:11:50 GMT  (166kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7856v2", "Full version of a NIPS-14 paper under the same title, fixed a typo in Theorem 1"]], "COMMENTS": "Full version of a NIPS-14 paper under the same title", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["hossein azari soufiani", "david c parkes", "lirong xia"], "accepted": true, "id": "1410.7856"}, "pdf": {"name": "1410.7856.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Statistical Decision-Theoretic Framework for Social Choice", "authors": ["Hossein Azari Soufiani", "David C.

this paper, we take a statistical decision-theoretic viewpoint on social choice, putting a focus on the decision to be made on behalf of a system of agents. In our framework, we are given a statistical ranking model, a decision space, and a loss function defined on (parameter, decision) pairs, and formulate social choice mechanisms as decision rules that minimize expected loss. This suggests a general framework for the design and analysis of new social choice mechanisms. We compare Bayesian estimators, which minimize Bayesian expected loss, for the Mallows model and the Condorcet model respectively, and the Kemeny rule. We consider various normative properties, in addition to computational complexity and asymptotic behavior. In particular, we show that the Bayesian estimator for the Condorcet model satisfies some desired properties such as anonymity, neutrality, and monotonicity, can be computed in polynomial time, and is asymptotically different from the other two rules when the data are generated from the Condorcet model for some ground truth parameter.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
