Finally, the problem is tractable for acyclic CQs and $\\mathcal{ELH}$, and NP-complete for unrestricted CQs and $\\mathcal{ELHO}$ KBs. In this paper we complete the complexity landscape of CQ answering for several important cases. In particular, we present a practicable NP algorithm for answering CQs over $\\mathcal{ELHO}^s$ KBs---a logic containing all of OWL 2 EL, but with complex role inclusions restricted to role transitivity. Our preliminary evaluation suggests that the algorithm can be suitable for practical use. Moreover, we show that, even for a restricted class of so-called arborescent acyclic queries, CQ answering over $\\mathcal{EL}$ KBs becomes NP-hard in the presence of either transitive or reflexive roles.
