Such assessments typically take the form of a controlled clinical trial (or a series of them), and the framework is generally accepted as best suited for rigorous statistical analysis of the effects of interest (Meinert, 1986; Piantadosi, 1997; Friedman, Furberg, and DeMets, 1998) (for discussion and criticism on this subject see also (Penston, 2005)). Driven by both legislative bodies, the scientific community, and the public, the standards required to evaluate novel interventions will continue to rise. Generally, this requires studies that engage larger samples and conduct evaluation over longer periods of time."}, {"heading": "Auxiliary data collection", "text": "The type of auxiliary data collection we use in this paper was originally proposed for assessing blindness in clinical trials (James et al., 1996), and has since been adopted for the same purpose in a series of subsequent papers (Bang, Ni, and Davis, 2004; Hro \u0301 bjartsson et al., 2007; Kolahi, Bang, and Park, 2009; Arandjelovic, 2012a) (see also (Sackett, 2007) for related comments. The questionnaire allows study participants to express their belief in the type of intervention they were given (control or treatment) through a fixed number of choices. The most commonly used, coarse-grained questionnaire gives the following three choices: 1: Believe that the control intervention was administered, 2: Believe that the treatment intervention was administered, and 3: Indecisiveness about the nature of the intervention group."}, {"heading": "Sub-group selection", "text": "The primary objective of the statistical framework described in the study (Arandjelovic, 2012a) is to facilitate an analysis of the study data aimed at the presence of partial or complete blinding of patients, or also at the imagination of patients who may also influence the results measured. In this context, we propose to use and broaden this framework to guide the selection of patients after their onset, in a way that minimizes the loss of statistical significance of the final results. At the beginning of the study, the study should be randomized in accordance with current clinical practice; this issue is comprehensively covered in Berger's influential work (2005). If a reduction in the number of study participants has been attempted, statistically speaking, by defining a properly randomized study, there is no reason to prefer the removal of a particular substance (or indeed a number of subjectives) over another study."}, {"heading": "Application example", "text": "To illustrate how the described method could be applied in practice, let us look at a hypothetical example. Let the experimental observation data be divided into two matching subsets from the random variables Xc and Xt, which are appropriately modeled using normal distributions (Aitchison and Brown, 1957): Xt - 1 / 2 exp - (x - mt) 2 / (2\u03c32t) and Xc - 2 / 3 exp - (x \u2212 mc) 2 / (2\u03c32c). The next step is to select an appropriate removal function in (1). In practice, this choice would be governed by the objectives of the study. In, for illustrative purposes, we select the probability that a patient will perform better when the treatment intervention is administered: p (x; pt; t), pc (y; c))."}, {"heading": "Evaluation", "text": "The primary novelty presented in this paper is methodological. In the previous section, we explained in detail the mathematical process involved in applying the proposed methodology in practice. Relevant results were derived for a specific distance function used to quantify the difference in outcome between control and treatment groups in a study. Choosing the distance function - which in practice would be taken by physicians according to the objectives of a specific study - regulates the relative loss of information when participants are taken from a specific subgroup, and consequently dictates the choice of the optimal subgroup from which the collection should be performed when the overall sample size needs to be reduced. In this section, we apply the derived results to experimental data and evaluate and discuss the performance of the proposed methodology. We adopt the evaluation protocol standard in the field of adaptive study research and obtain data using a simulated experiment."}, {"heading": "Experimental setup", "text": "We simulated a study involving 180 people, half of whom were assigned to the control group and the other half to the treatment group. We maintain a variable for each individual that describes that person's belief in relation to his / her group assignment, so we have beliefs b (c) i (i = 1. nc) for the control group and similarly for the treatment group nt beliefs b (t) i (i = 1. nt). Faith is expressed by a real number, namely b (c) i, b (t) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s) i (\u2212 s). The absolute greater value of a belief variable is the condemnation of the person. We employ a three-tiered questioner."}, {"heading": "Results and discussion", "text": "Using the same data obtained from the simulation of the experiment in the previous section, we compared the proposed method with the current practice of random selection of participants who are removed from the study. In both cases, the data were analyzed using the Bayesian method proposed in (Arandjelovic, \"2012a). A typical result is presented in the figure. 2 (a) The figure shows the posterior distributions of the differential effect of the treatment obtained after the removal of 120 subjects using the proposed method (red line) and the random selection (blue line). The most notable differences between the two rear distributors are in the associated uncertainties - the proposed results in a much higher area."}, {"heading": "Summary and conclusions", "text": "Unlike all previous work in this area, we did not consider the problem of when to adjust the sample size, but which individual samples should be removed. Our approach is based on the stratification recently proposed for the analysis of study results in imperfect blindness. This stratification is based on the respondents \"responses to a generic auxiliary questionnaire that allows each participant to express their belief in their intervention task (treatment or control). Experiments on a simulated study were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over current random selection."}], "references": [{"title": "The Lognormal Distribution", "author": ["J.

Unlike previous work our approach focuses on trial adaptation by sample size adjustment. We adopt a recently proposed stratification framework based on collected auxiliary data and show that this information together with the primary measured variables can be used to make a probabilistically informed choice of the particular sub-group a sample should be removed from. Experiments on simulated data are used to illustrate the effectiveness of our method and its application in practice.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
