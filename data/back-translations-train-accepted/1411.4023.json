In this paper, we address the problem of generating targeted starting positions for such games. This can facilitate new approaches for bringing novice players to mastery, and also leads to discovery of interesting game variants. We present an approach that generates starting states of varying hardness levels for player~$1$ in a two-player board game, given rules of the board game, the desired number of steps required for player~$1$ to win, and the expertise levels of the two players. Our approach leverages symbolic methods and iterative simulation to efficiently search the extremely large state space. We present experimental results that include discovery of states of varying hardness levels for several simple grid-based board games. The presence of such states for standard game variants like $4 \\times 4$ Tic-Tac-Toe opens up new games to be played that have never been played as the default start state is heavily biased.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Nov 2014 19:43:12 GMT  (475kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4023v1", "A conference version of the paper will appear in AAAI 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "A conference version of the paper will appear in AAAI 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["umair z ahmed", "krishnendu chatterjee", "sumit gulwani"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.4023"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.4023.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Automatic Generation of Alternative Starting Positions for Simple Traditional Board Games", "authors": ["Umair Z.

The game changes in the sense that the edges of player-1 vertices go to player-2 vertices and vice versa. The game is played as follows: The game starts with an initial vertex v0, if the current vertex is a player-1 vertex, then player-1 vertices selects a new vertice and vice versa."}, {"heading": "2.2 Formalization of Problem Definition", "text": "The mathematical question ignores two aspects. (1) The concept of hardness is defined: it is about optimal strategies regardless of hardness; and (2) the problem of generating different starting points. We are interested in generating starting points of different hardness. The concept of hardness that we are looking at is the depth of the tree that a player can explore, which is the standard in artificial intelligence. (2) Consider a player-1 vertex u0. The search tree of depth 1 is as follows: We look at a tree that is so rooted at u0 that children of u0 are the vertices of player 2, so that (u0, u1) there is an edge from u0 to u1. Depth for each vertex u1 (that is a child of u0) the children of u1 are such that the vertices u2 are such (u1, u2), and they are the leaves of the tree."}, {"heading": "3 Search Strategy", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Overall methodology", "text": "iDe eeisrcnh-eaJnlhsrcnlhUeaeaitnlrcnlhsrc\u00fceaeaeFnlrh hacu ide eeisrrcnlhsrteeaeVnlrrrteeeeeaeVnlrrrrcnh ni rde eeisrcnh-eaJnlhsrcnlhsrteeaeVnlrrrrrrrteeaeSrteeoiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiui"}, {"heading": "3.2 Symbolic methods", "text": "We will discuss the symbolic methods for analyzing games with large state spaces. The key idea is to symbolically represent the games (not with explicit state spaces) using variables and to operate on symbolic representation.The key object used in symbolic representation is called BDDs (Boolean decision diagrams) (Bryant 1986), which can efficiently represent a set of indentations by using a Boolean formula that represents the set of indentations.The CUDD tool supports many symbolic representations of the state space using BDDs and supports many operations on symbolic representations on graphs using BDDs (Somenzi 1998).Symbolic representation of the indentations of the indentations is represented by a series of variables x1, x2, xn so that each of them takes values from a finite set (e.g., \u00d7, an empty symbol); and each vertex of the game an explicit evaluation that is assigned to the variable."}, {"heading": "3.3 Iterative simulation", "text": "We now describe a mathematically inexpensive method to support the sampling of vertices as candidates for starting positions of a certain degree of hardness. In view of a starting vertex v, a depth k1 strategy for player 1, and a depth k2 strategy for player 2, we must take into account the construction exploration of the depth max {k1, k2} to obtain the hardness of v. So, if one of the strategies is of high depth, then it is arithmetically expensive. Therefore, we need a preliminary metric that can be calculated relatively easily for small values of k1 and k2, as a guide for vertices to be explored in depth. We use a very simple metric for this purpose. Hard vertices are rarer than the simple vertices, and therefore we simply quickly exclude them by using the following approach: If k1 is large: in view of a strategy of depth k2, the amount of hard vertices for higher values of k1 is a subset of hard vertices."}, {"heading": "4 Framework for Board Games", "text": "We will consider the specific problem of board games.

Formally, a strategy \u03c31 for player 1 is a function \u03c31: V \u0445 \u00b7 V1 \u2192 D (V), where D (V) denotes the number of probability distributions above V. In a finite sequence of vertices (which represent the history of the game to date) ending in a player 1 vertice, D (V) selects a probability distribution for the next vertice. The strategy only has to choose available successors, i.e. for all W-V points and V-points, we have the following result: If \u03c31 (w \u00b7 v) (u) > 0, then (v, u). Strategies \u03c32 for player 2 are defined analogously. Summary and details of the duration.
