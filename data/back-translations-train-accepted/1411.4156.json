Nevertheless, Description Logic axioms can be interpreted in a closed-world setting and in this setting they can be used for both constraint checking and closed-world recognition against information sources. When the information sources are expressed in well-behaved RDF or RDFS (i.e., RDF graphs interpreted in the RDF or RDFS semantics) this constraint checking and closed-world recognition is simple to describe. Further this constraint checking can be implemented as SPARQL querying and thus effectively performed.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Nov 2014 15:33:38 GMT  (35kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4156v1", "Extended version of a paper of the same name that will appear in AAAI-2015"], ["v2", "Wed, 21 Jan 2015 21:09:56 GMT  (35kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4156v2", "Extended version of a paper of the same name that will appear in AAAI-2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version of a paper of the same name that will appear in AAAI-2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter f patel-schneider"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.4156"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.4156.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Using Description Logics for RDF Constraint Checking and Closed-World Recognition", "authors": ["Peter F.

Inference is the process of determining what follows from what is described. Inference ranges from simple (John is a student, students are people, so John is a person) to very complex (in terms of arguing cases, reductio ad absurdum, or even noteworthy that an infinite sequence of limitations does not produce useful information).Determining whether a limitation holds, is just determining whether the limitations follow from the given information. Again, connection verification is generally conducted with respect to complete information. So, to determine whether the limitation of limitations does not produce useful information."}, {"heading": "Example", "text": "Here is a small example of how description logic constructs can be used to check constraints. There are three different types of information in the example. The RDF triples in Figure 1 to provide the data for the example. The RDFS ontology in Figure 2 provides the organization of the data. The description logic axioms in Figure 3 provide the constraints that go against the data and the ontology and the classes vocabulary for Closed-World Recognition.The constraints are all met, except one, as follows: 1. Nothing can be derived to be both a person and an organization, and so persons and organizations are incompatible. Any object that can be derived to be a person (i.e., students and faculty) has provided a single name, and that name is a string so that each person has exactly one name in the closure. 3. All students (and students) are enrolled in universities - the area of the exo.Uni is enrolled."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "The next work in a technical sense is the work of PatelSchneider and Franconi (2012). In this work, some properties and classes were considered closed, making the description logic axioms that turn these properties and classes into constraints. RDF and RDFS are very similar to a situation where all properties and classes are closed. The current work adds the idea of recognition in the closed world, which was only implicit in the previous work, and maximum extensions that offer a much better treatment of recursive definitions, especially in the monotonous case. The work of Motik, Horrocks, and Sattler (2009) and of Tao et al. (2010) Both divide axioms into regular axioms and constraints. They also allow general description of logical axioms, not just RDF or RDFS graphics like here."}, {"heading": "The Details, but Not All the Details", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Description Logic Semantics", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to play by the rules we have set ourselves in order to fulfil them."}, {"heading": "Extending to New Classes", "text": "For recognition in the closed world it is useful to define new classes, such as inex: PurePerson \u0445 1 Exo: Friend u Exo: friend.ex: PurePersonThere are several ways for the meaning of new classes to be defined recursively. The new classes could be interpreted as broadly as possible, as narrowly as possible, or in any consistent manner.In ShEx it seems that such classes are interpreted as broadly as possible. For example, in the RDF Graphex: John Exo: Friend ex: John. The ShEx approach would be that both Ex: John and Ex: Bill belong to ex: PurePerson. We will take this approach here and interpret new classes as broadly as possible New classes are treated by defining extensions of interpretations as above. An extension of an interpretation is a new interpretation 1 / with the same domain as the original interpretation."}, {"heading": "RDF and RDFS Semantics", "text": "We move from an RDF diagram to a slightly modified interpretation of the description logic, and from there perform a constraint check to determine whether a set of description logic axioms are satisfied in the interpretation or in a series of maximum extensions of the interpretation. We can also perform a recognition of the closed world by specifying the interpretation of the newly defined classes in the axioms, and these classes can even be defined recurrently. However, there is a missing part of the story. If the RDF diagram contains triples that trigger RDF or RDF conclusions that are not already included in the RDF diagram, the interpretation will not look like an RDF interpretation (or RDFS) if the RDF diagram contains isex: John rdf: type exo: Student. exo: Student rdfs: subClassOf exo: subClassOf exo: Person infinite sketches of the claims later in the work here and are."}, {"heading": "Complexity", "text": "It is easy to see that checking axioms against an interpretation is a polynomial unless there is a new vocabulary in the axioms or recursive definitions; the formulas corresponding to the axioms are merely tested against the interpretation in a model way. If there are monotonous recursive definitions, constraints can be checked and closed world detection can be performed using techniques from the database, such as magic sets. For example, the extension of a recursively defined class can be calculated first without ignoring the recursive part. Violations of the recursive part can then be checked and objects can be iteratively removed from the class. These techniques cannot be used for non-monotonous recursive definitions, as the extension of one class or property could reduce another."}, {"heading": "Implementation", "text": "The work of Tao et al. (2010) shows that the standard constraints of the description logic can be partially implemented as SPARQL queries if no new vocabulary is used. Tao et al. (2010) worked in a general OWL environment where their approach is solid but not complete, but in an RDF environment the approach is both solid and complete, as there is only one model to take into account. This approach forms the basis of Stardog ICV (Clark & Parsia 2014). Indeed, Stardog ICV is an implementation of the approach described in this paper, which shows how the approach to constraints can be implemented here through a translation into SPARQL. The work here can also be thought of as a simpler definition of the underpinning of Stardog ICV."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In fact, logic can be used for both the syntax and the semantics of constraint testing and closed-world detection in RDF, using an analogy of model testing, and much of the constraint testing and closed-world detection can be effectively translated into SPARQL queries by a translation. The main difference between closed-world detection and constraint testing is that the former either has no axioms or uses only axioms that define names that do not appear in the RDF diagram, whereas constraint testing uses axioms that correlate concepts that appear in the RDF diagram with descriptions. By restricting our information to RDF or RDFS, i.e. working in situations where there is a unique minimum model, we get a simpler formulation, simple implementation and good performance compared to previous work in this area, the WL can easily be expanded to this other subset of WL."}, {"heading": "Appendix", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."},

Nevertheless, Description Logic axioms can be interpreted in a closed-world setting and in this setting they can be used for both constraint checking and closed-world recognition against information sources. When the information sources are expressed in well-behaved RDF or RDFS (i.e., RDF graphs interpreted in the RDF or RDFS semantics) this constraint checking and closed-world recognition is simple to describe. Further this constraint checking can be implemented as SPARQL querying and thus effectively per-", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
