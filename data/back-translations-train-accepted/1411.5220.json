In the past few years, a number of rule languages with finite chase have been studied. In this work, we propose a novel approach for classifying the rule languages with finite chase. Using this approach, a family of decidable rule languages, which extend the existing languages with the finite chase property, are naturally defined. We then study the complexity of these languages. Although all of them are tractable for data complexity, we show that their combined complexity can be arbitrarily high. Furthermore, we prove that all the rule languages with finite chase that extend the weakly acyclic language are of the same expressiveness as the weakly acyclic one, while rule languages with higher combined complexity are in general more succinct than those with lower combined complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Nov 2014 13:37:22 GMT  (27kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5220v1", "Extended version of a paper to appear on AAAI 2015"], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Nov 2014 05:36:49 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5220v2", "Extended version of a paper to appear on AAAI 2015"], ["v3", "Thu, 8 Jan 2015 22:53:11 GMT  (343kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5220v3", "Extended version of a paper to appear on AAAI 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version of a paper to appear on AAAI 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB cs.LO", "authors": ["heng zhang", "yan zhang", "jia-huai you"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.5220"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.5220.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Existential Rule Languages with Finite Chase: Complexity and Expressiveness", "authors": ["Heng Zhang", "Yan Zhang", "Jia-Huai You"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "It has been shown that existential rules, also known as datalogs, are inescapable: (It has been shown time and again in the past that it is a complete system, in which it is a complete system); (It is a question of whether it is a complete system, in which it is a system; (It is a question of whether it is a complete system, in which it is a complete system); (It is a question of whether it is a complete system, in which it is a system; it is a question of whether it is a system, in which it is a system;) It is a question of whether it is a system, in which it is a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system; a system."}, {"heading": "Preliminaries", "text": "It is not as if there are an infinite number of terms, each of which is endowed with a natural number, and the terms are either constants or variables.

Our study on this topic could be pursued in several directions. An interesting but challenging future work is the study of disjunctive existential rule languages. It is important to find out whether our approach can be expanded to identify decision-making disjunctive existential rule languages and to characterize relevant complexity and expression characteristics. Results on this aspect could significantly improve our current understanding of ontological reasoning with disjunctive existential rules (Alviano et al. 2012; Bourhis, Morak and Pieris 2013)."}, {"heading": "Appendix: Detailed Proofs", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Proof of Proposition 1", "text": "To show this, we use a technique developed by (Marnette 2009). Let O = (\u03a3, D, Q) be a rule ontology. Let C denote the set of constants that appears in A, and let O be a special constant without occurring in B. A database above D is denoted as critical for O if each relationship in it is a complete relationship on domain C. It is clear that the critical database is unique to O. Let D \u00b2 O denote the critical database of O.Proof of Proposition 1. In the face of arbitrarily bound functional sontology, it is clear that any rule ontology limited by B has a finite trace ontology. So, it is enough to show that there is a bound function, so that any rule ontology is finite tracked. To do this, we must first prove a claim as a trace ontology."}, {"heading": "Proof of Proposition 2", "text": "Proposition 2: There is no computable limited function \u03b4, so any limited rule ontology \u03b4-limited. Proof: In the direction of contradiction, we assume that such a computable limited function \u03b4 exists. Let's be any rule ontology. Then, to check by note 1 whether \u03a3 has a finite pursuit, it is tantamount to checking whether \u03a3 has a finite scolem hunt. Since \u03b4 is computable, there is an algorithm according to sentence 6 (the proof of which will be given shortly in this appendix) to check whether \u03a3 is limited. This means that the problem of checking whether a rule ontology has a finite scolem hunt is decideable, which contradicts with Theorem 4 in (Marnette 2009), which states that it is RE-complete to decide whether a tg schema mapping (i.e. rule ontology) has a finite scolem hunt.

In the past few years, a number of rule languages with finite chase have been studied. In this work, we propose a novel approach for classifying the rule languages with finite chase. Using this approach, a family of decidable rule languages, which extend the existing languages with the finite chase property, are naturally defined. We then study the complexity of these languages. Although all of them are tractable for data complexity, we show that their combined complexity can be arbitrarily high. Furthermore, we prove that all the rule languages with finite chase that extend the weakly acyclic language are of the same expressiveness as the weakly acyclic one, while rule languages with higher combined complexity are in general more succinct than those with lower combined complexity.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
