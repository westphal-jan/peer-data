Let us remember that the inference procedure minimizes the objective function L, and therefore the objective function should have a lower value if its arguments form a better fit to the observed data. While the axioms are generally given below, for an intuitive understanding one can imagine a maximum satisfaction of the approach with L (x, w; Y) as the negative log probability of the observed data Y on (x, w). Let us first consider the case if there is only one question and one worker. The vectors x and w can be represented by scalars x.

No function L satisfying axiom 1 and axiom 2 can be convex. Non-convex problems are often transformed into convex problems by transforming the variables involved.

While the two axioms of section 3 identify the exact cause of non-convexity, in this section we will propose three general properties that we will see as an objective function for crowdsourcing to the satisfaction of satisfaction. As before, while the properties are defined for generic human computation models, for a simpler understanding of the objective function L than the negative logarithm function.

L (x, w; 1) is not increasing in x.Property P1 says that the probability does not decrease when x is brought closer to the observed answer."}, {"heading": "6 If Not Modelling Spammers", "text": "We will now discuss the role of modeling a spammer, i.e., axiom 2.

Let us let Wmin = 0 and Wmax = 1.
