Typical limitations used in this case are Must-Link and Cannot-Link, which enforce that two data points must or may not be in the same cluster. For example, (Hossain et al. 2010) we present an integrated framework for clustering non-homogeneous data and show how to consider link-pattern and cannot-link limitations in cluster formation."}, {"heading": "Constrained Factorization Algorithm", "text": "Solving the general CombiFD optimization problem (2) is difficult for two reasons: First, objective function cannot be convex, so minimizing even in the presence of simple non-negative constraints (Berry et al. 2007) is difficult. Second, we allow a very expressive class of constraints that can indicate potentially very complex, complicated dependencies between variables. Unfortunately, most approaches are either application-specific or non-scalable. Even in the presence of simple constraints (as is the case for NMF), the problem is rarely solved and in practice heuristic approaches are used. However, simple heuristic approaches such as multiplicative update rules (Lee and Seung 1999) that are not applied to our problem are used."}, {"heading": "Spectral Unmixing for Materials Discovery", "text": "We imagine how complex boundaries to peak positions are built in, incorporating some of the most important physical laws affecting the process of datagerizing the phase labeling phase.

For isotropic X-ray patterns and signals measured against the scattering of the vector magnitude, we are proportional to the peak positions in the measured X-ray patterns."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "The ability to integrate complex prior knowledge into uncontrolled data analysis approaches is a rich and challenging research problem that is ubiquitous in a variety of areas such as scientific discovery. Specifically, the motivating application of this work is the discovery of new fuel cell and solar fuel materials, thereby solving pressing sustainability issues such as the need for renewable and clean energy. We have introduced CombiFD, a novel factor-based pattern separation framework that significantly generalizes and expands earlier approaches. Our framework allows for the specification of general (including combinatorial) constraints used to define a-primary domain knowledge of desired fragmentation, including traditional constraints such as non-negativity and more complicated dependencies, such as those derived from the known phase behavior of chemical systems. We introduced a generic factoring algorithm called AMIQO, which is based on the solution of a quadratic (sequence) of integrations."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF Expeditions in Computing award for Computational Sustainability, grant 0832782, NSF Inspire grant 1344201 and NSF Eager grant 1258330).
