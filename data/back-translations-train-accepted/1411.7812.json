Our results show that the parameterized complexity of candidate control (with the number of voters as the parameter) is much more varied than in the setting with many voters.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Nov 2014 11:09:04 GMT  (81kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7812v1", "52 pages. to appear in th\u007fe Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-15)"], ["v2", "Sat, 18 Mar 2017 11:32:11 GMT  (66kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7812v2", "56 pages, short version presented at AAAI-2015"]], "COMMENTS": "52 pages. to appear in th\u007fe Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-15)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.MA", "authors": ["jiehua chen", "piotr faliszewski", "rolf niedermeier", "nimrod talmon"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.7812"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.7812.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Elections with Few Voters: Candidate Control Can Be Easy", "authors": ["Jiehua Chen", "Piotr Faliszewski", "Rolf Niedermeier"], "emails": ["jiehua.chen@tu-berlin.de", "faliszew@agh.edu.pl", "rolf.niedermeier@tu-berlin.de", "nimrodtalmon77@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 141 1.78 12v1 [cs.A"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The question as to how such a constellation could occur not only in the USA, but also in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, United Kingdom, France, Great Britain, France, Great Britain, Great Britain, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy,"}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "The election E = (C, V) consists of a series of candidates C = (c1,.).

The idea is to give a reduction of MULTI-COLORED CLIQUE (MCC) parameterized by the clique order (a variant of the standard CLIQUE problem that is better suited to the parameterized complexity results, where each vertex has one of h colors, and we seek a clique of the order h with a different color)."}, {"heading": "4 Approval-Based Rules", "text": "In this section, we look at t-Approval and t-Veto rules differently. These are perhaps the simplest and most commonly used rules, so the results are of particular interest in relation to them. We start by looking at the plurality rule and the veto rule. However, in terms of standard complexity theory, control by adding / deleting candidates (constructive and destructive) is NP-complete for both candidates (Bartholdi et al. [1]; Hemaspaandra et al. [18]) However, when we parameterise the number of candidates, the results change quite drastically. On the one hand, the results for analog types of (non-combinatorial) control for these rules are different (for example, plurality CCDC is in FPT, but veto CCDC is W [1] -hard; this is quite unexpected given the similarity and simplicity of plurality and veto), and on the other hand, comatorial and non-control classes."}, {"heading": "5 Other Voting Rules", "text": "We focus on the electoral rules we know, and on Maximin 5.

One particularly interesting aspect is the consideration of game theory aspects of candidate control: the results of traceability motivate us to examine more involved settings (e.g. we consider a setting in which two actors try to exclude two different candidates from victory; their goals could involve both cooperation and competition); and finally, we believe that the case of a small number of voters has not received enough attention in the literature for calculating social choices, and many other problems related to this parameter can (and should) be investigated."}, {"heading": "A Overview", "text": "In the appendix we find all the proofs that are missing from the main text, but the appendix is organized differently from the essay.

Maximin-COMB-DCAC is a bundle of polynomial time solvable. Evidence. It has been shown by Faliszewski et al. [16] that Maximin-DCAC is a bundle of polynomial time solvable.

The algorithm is very simple and can be described as follows: We guess up to two bundles of candidates, add them to the election and check if the despised candidate d is no longer a winner, if so, we accept him otherwise. To see why this simple algorithm is correct, let us consider a solution. If the solution consists of no more than two bundles, then we are done. Otherwise, let us look more closely at the solution. It is clear that in the solution d there is no winner, therefore there must be at least one other candidate who gives a higher than d.
