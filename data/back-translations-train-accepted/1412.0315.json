Unfortunately, the majority of real-world graphical models is asymmetric. This is even the case for relational representations when evidence is given. Therefore, more recent work in the community moved to making the models symmetric and then applying existing lifted inference algorithms. However, this approach has two shortcomings. First, all existing over-symmetric approximations require a relational representation such as Markov logic networks. Second, the induced symmetries often change the distribution significantly, making the computed probabilities highly biased. We present a framework for probabilistic sampling-based inference that only uses the induced approximate symmetries to propose steps in a Metropolis-Hastings style Markov chain. The framework, therefore, leads to improved probability estimates while remaining unbiased. Experiments demonstrate that the approach outperforms existing MCMC algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Dec 2014 00:40:33 GMT  (997kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0315v1", "To appear in Proceedings of AAAI-2015"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Proceedings of AAAI-2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["guy van den broeck", "mathias niepert"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.0315"}, "pdf": {"name": "1412.0315.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Lifted Probabilistic Inference for Asymmetric Graphical Models", "authors": ["Guy Van den Broeck", "Mathias Niepert"], "emails": ["guy.vandenbroeck@cs.kuleuven.be", "mniepert@cs.washington.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "However, there are several probabilistic graphical models for which an approximate approach is possible due to (conditional) dependencies and the resulting low treewidth (Darwiche 2009; Koller and Friedman 2009).

More recently, the AI community has uncovered additional statistical properties based on symmetries of the graphical model that make inferences tractable (Niepert and Van den Broeck 2014). In the literature, approaches to exploiting these symmetries are often referred to as canceled or symmetry-conscious inference algorithms (Poole 2003; Kersting 2012).

Let's be a finite set and let G be a permutation group that acts on B. When we write B and G, we write B to denote the picture of A under G. A cycle (\u03b11 \u03b12... \u03b1n) represents the permutation that maps \u03b11 to B, 2 to B 3,... and B to B 1. Any permutation can be written as a product of disjunctive cycles.

Surprisingly, even in the absence of conditional independence, they perform tractable inferences.Our current understanding of exact upscale inferences is that syntactic properties of relational representations allow efficient upscale inferences (Van den Broeck 2011; Jaeger and Van den Broeck 2012; Van den Broeck 2013; Gribkoff, Van den Broeck and Suciu 2014).The appendix will review such representations, and in particular the Markov logic.

In addition, let MB be an aperiodic and irreducible Markov chain with stationary distribution p, and let MS be the orbital Metropolis chain for X and G.

Several techniques exist to calculate the exact symmetries of a graphical model and construct G; see (Niepert 2012b; Bui, Huynh and Riedel 2013). Color refinement algorithms are also studied in exact inferences (Kersting et al 2014). You can find (exact) orbits of random variables for a slightly weaker notion of symmetry called fractional automorphism. These techniques all require a form of exact symmetry to be present in modeling. Capturing similar symmetries is a problem that is largely open."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "The LMH algorithms are implemented in the GAP algebra system, which provides basic algorithms for automorphism groups such as the product replacement algorithm, which allows for evenly testing from the orbits of states (Niepert 2012b).

The data contains information about about 800 words that appear on 1000 pages, 7 pages and links between web pages. There are 4 folds, one for each university. We use the standard MLN structure for the WebKB domain, which has MLN forms of the form shown above, but for all combinations of labels and words that add up to around 5500 first-order MLN forms.

Fundamentals of a formula are obtained by instantiating variables with certain constants.

Unfortunately, the majority of realworld graphical models is asymmetric. This is even the case for relational representations when evidence is given. Therefore, more recent work in the community moved to making the models symmetric and then applying existing lifted inference algorithms. However, this approach has two shortcomings. First, all existing over-symmetric approximations require a relational representation such as Markov logic networks. Second, the induced symmetries often change the distribution significantly, making the computed probabilities highly biased. We present a framework for probabilistic sampling-based inference that only uses the induced approximate symmetries to propose steps in a MetropolisHastings style Markov chain. The framework, therefore, leads to improved probability estimates while remaining unbiased. Experiments demonstrate that the approach outperforms existing MCMC algorithms.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
