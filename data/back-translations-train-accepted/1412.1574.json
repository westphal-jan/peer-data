Similarly, I = {(vj, dj) N Ij = 1 shall denote the input frame with keypoints. Typically, traditional approaches construct the correspondences between the keypoints of the template and the keypoints of the intervention frame. Correspondences will be parameterized by calculating the distances between {qi} N O i = 1 and {dj} N Ij = 1. According to the modeling learning approaches (Hare, Saffari and Torr 2012; Stuckler and Behnke 2012), we will parameterise a model by a weight vector wi for the template keypoint ui to evaluate each correspondence.
