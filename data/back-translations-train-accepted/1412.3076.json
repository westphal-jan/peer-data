We start by formally defining the problem. (In the definitions, M stands for a causal model that is a context, ~ X is a subset of variables of M, and ~ x is the set of values of ~ LB (M, ~ u): Lcause = {< M, ~ u, 0, 2, 2, x) is a cause of (M, ~ u).One of our goals is to understand the cause of the complexity of computational causality. Towards this end, it is useful to define two related languages: LAC2 = {< M, ~ u, ~ x >: (~ X = ~ x) satisfies the cause of the causality of computational causality. We have the conditions AC1 and AC2 for causality (M, ~ u), LAC3 = {< M, ~ u, ~ x >."}, {"heading": "5 Responsibility and Blame", "text": "In this section, we review the definitions of responsibility and guilt and characterize their complexity.

(M, ~ u) It is 0 if the degree of responsibility of ~ X = x is not a cause of responsibility of ~ X = x; it is 1 / (k + 1) if ~ X = x is a cause of causality.

Guilt, introduced in (Chockler & Halpern 2004), assumes that the \"true situation\" is determined by context, and \"how the world works,\" is determined by structural equations; the uncertainty of an agent is modelled by a pair (K, Pr), where K is a set of pairs of the form (M, ~ u) in which M is a causal model and ~ u is a context, and Pr is a probability distribution over K. A pair (M, ~ u) is called a situation. We think of K as a description of the situations that the broker deems possible before ~ X is set to ~ x. The degree of guilt that the definition of ~ X has to ~ x for the context is then the expected degree of responsibility of ~ X = ~ x for the situation (M, ~ X, ~ u), for the binary models (M, ~ u, the M) situations are taken."}, {"heading": "A Proof of Theorem 4.1", "text": "As we have explained in the main part of the thesis, membership is straightforward, so here we focus on hardness = \"A\" = \"A\" = \"A\" = \"W\" = \"W\" = \"W\" = \"W\" = \"W\" = \"W\" = \"W\" = \"W\" = \"W\" (W \"W\" = 1 \"and X = 0\").
