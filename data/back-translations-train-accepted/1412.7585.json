This task can easily be accomplished if the individual possesses only concept assertions by simply breaking down the concepts involved into a single term using the concept conjunction.

In the latter, the improvement in LUBM1 and LUBM2 is not as significant as in others, which is due to the simplicity of these two ontologies, which allows a fine granularity of the ABox partitions [16]. When using the MSCT method in complex ontologies such as AT and CE, however, the great improvement in the argument efficiency is not as in others, which is due to the reduction of the search space for the reasoning of algorithms, x, which allows a fine granularity of the ABox partitions [16].

We test the scalability of this method for answering queries (executed sequentially) using the benchmark ontology LUBM, which models the organization of universities with each university from approximately 17,000 related persons, and the result is shown in Figure 8."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a revised MSC method for efficient instance verification, which allows ontological thinking to examine only a much smaller subset of ABox data relevant to a particular instance verification problem, thereby achieving great efficiency and solving the limitations of current memory-based verification techniques. It can be particularly useful for answering object queries via these large non-horn DL ontologies, where existing optimization techniques are too short and answering object queries may require thousands or even millions of instance verification tasks. Most importantly, due to the independence between the MSCTs, scalability for responding to queries via huge ontologies (e.g. when setting semantic networks) can also be achieved by parallelizing calculations. Our technique currently works for SHI logic, which is semi-expressive and requires for many practical ontologies to use more fully logic."}], "references": [{"title": "Ontologies and the semantic web", "author": ["I.

Description Logic (DL) ontologies is becoming a vital task in various data-intensive DL applications. Considered as a basic service for answering object queries over DL ontologies, instance checking can be realized by using the most specific concept (MSC) method, which converts instance checking into subsumption problems. This method, however, loses its simplicity and efficiency when applied to large and complex ontologies, as it tends to generate very large MSC\u2019s that could lead to intractable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a revision to this MSC method for DL SHI, allowing it to generate much simpler and smaller concepts that are specific-enough to answer a given query. With independence between computed MSC\u2019s, scalability for query answering can also be achieved by distributing and parallelizing the computations. An empirical evaluation shows the efficacy of our revised MSC method and the significant efficiency achieved when using it for answering", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
