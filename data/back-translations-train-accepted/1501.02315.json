This allows the imputation of long-term estimates of quantities of interest, and thus the estimation of long-term causal effects of interventions.

First, we present our notation for the rest of this work. Consider an assignment mechanism that first takes into account a vector Z (0, 1) n of n elements, with Zi = 1 indicating that agent i has been assigned to the game G1 and Zi = 0 indicating that agent i has been assigned to the game G0; therefore, Z is the initial assignment of agents to games that remain the same during the experiment. We assume that the games progress in discrete increments."}, {"heading": "3.1 Stability assumptions for valid causal inference", "text": "In the typical causal inference methods, extrapolation from one treatment assignment Z to another assignment Z = \u03b2\u03b2j behavior is achieved by various assumptions of stability. For example, the SUTVA assumption (Rubin, 1974) puts Yit (Z) = \u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2i (Zi) i.e., the potential result for unit i depends only on the treatment assignment of the unit itself. The great virtue of this assumption is that an observed result Yit (Z) immediately informs us of potential outcomes {Yit (Z): Z \u2032 i = Zi}; i.e., for a variety of treatment assignments that could be realized, allowing us to more accurately assess the desired treatment effects. In our problem, strategic interference and dynamic behavior cannot justify such an assumption. Therefore, we need stability assumptions that are defined on populations of agents. For this reason, we expand our parameter space by introducing a number of behavioral behaviors."}, {"heading": "4 Concrete Methodology", "text": "Building on the findings of Section 3, we are now developing a concrete methodology for estimating long-term causal effects defined in Equation (1). In Section 5, we are applying our method in the Rapoport and Boebel datasets (1992). However, for our behavioral model, we are adopting the quantum response (QLk) originally proposed by Stahl and Wilson (1994), and it has been shown that we can well predict observed human behavior in real-world behavioral experiments (Wright and Leyton-Brown, 2010). In QLk, agents possess an increasing degree of complexity. Following this earlier work, we will adopt k = 3 and thus consider a behavioral space with three different types of behavior: B = b0, b2}. Let's leave out the distribution theory of actions that an agent will perform after accepting behavior. In QLk, the distributions depend on an assumption of the quantum response that follows."}, {"heading": "4.1 Likelihood and posterior inference", "text": "We can now consider the probability of observations as in Table 2. Consider an initial mapping Z and observed frequencies of action for periods t = 1, 2,... T referred to as T \u00b7 | A | matrix \u03b1j, 1: T (Z), where the i-th line \u03b1j, i (Z) is. Our model parameters are the behavioral distribution \u03b2j, 1: T (Z), where the i-th line \u03b2j, i (Z) and the x-th line are the model parameters for the time evolution of \u03b2j, t (Z); in addition, we have the quantum best response parameters where the i-th line \u03b2j, i (Z) and x are the model parameters for the time evolution of \u03b2j, t (Z)."}, {"heading": "5 Application", "text": "Returning to the Rapoport and Boebel dataset (1992) presented in Table 2, we assume that diffuse priors exist for the parameters of the Quantum Best Response Model, in particular we consider \u03c0 (\u03bbi) \u0445 Expo, i.e. an exponential random variable with a rate of about 1 / 10 for the parameters of the Quantum Best Response Model, a diffuse beta for the parameters of the Quantum Best Response Model, and a flat variance before the parameters of the current model. This is efficient because we know beforehand that the values of our parameters are limited; since exact conditionals are difficult to obtain under this model, we apply a Metropolis Hastings scheme with a suggestion distribution that only slightly disturbs the current model parameters."}, {"heading": "5.1 Estimation of long-term causal effects", "text": "Using the MCMC strategy outlined above, we are able to obtain imputations of the causal effect (1) from the posterior predictive distribution of the model parameters. Figure 3 shows 1,000 posterior samples. The actual estimate, considered at t = 4, is equal to $0.054. Our estimates are able to capture the latent dynamic trend in the behavior of the agents. It should also be remembered that the predictions presented in Section 2.1 estimated a strongly significant negative effect of the introduction of Game Design G1 compared to G0 because they were misdirected by strong short-term effects in the opposite direction. Indeed, our estimates are distorted; the posterior summary of the long-term effect is 0.088 \u00b1 0.021, representing approximately 63% of the actual value. However, this is quite reasonable in our application for the following reasons. Firstly, the date is limited to 3 periods that we significantly indicate this linear function will trigger the second divisability of the decision; secondly, it is necessary for the prediction of the second phase."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we have examined the problem of estimating the long-term causal impact of interventions in multilateral systems within the framework of the Neyman-Rubin causal model. Two characteristics make this problem conceptually and technically challenging. First, strategic interference between competing actors leads to the exposure of a set of sufficient stability assumptions within the Neyman-Rubin model, i.e. that some kind of equilibrium is achieved."}], "references": [{"title": "Semiparametric difference-in-differences estimators", "author": ["A.

In this paper, we explore the intricacies of this problem through standard approaches, and demonstrate the need for more appropriate methods. Working under the Neyman-Rubin causal model, we proceed to develop a causal inference method and we explicate the stability assumptions that are necessary for valid causal inference. Our method consists of a temporal component that models the evolution of behaviors that agents adopt over time, and a behavioral component that models the distribution of agent actions conditional on adopted behaviors. This allows the imputation of long-term estimates of quantities of interest, and thus the estimation of long-term causal effects of interventions. We demonstrate our method on a dataset from behavioral game theory, and discuss open problems to stimulate future research.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
