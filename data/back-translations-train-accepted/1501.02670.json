A normal nearest neighbor search only returns a ranked list of neighbors, with no information about the structure or topology of the local neighborhood. This is a potentially serious shortcoming of the mode of querying a distributional semantic model, since a ranked list of neighbors may conflate several different senses. We argue that the topology of neighborhoods in semantic space provides important information about the different senses of terms, and that such topological structures can be used for word-sense induction. We also argue that the topology of the neighborhoods in semantic space can be used to determine the semantic horizon of a point, which we define as the set of neighbors that have a direct connection to the point. We introduce relative neighborhood graphs as method to uncover the topological properties of neighborhoods in semantic models. We also provide examples of relative neighborhood graphs for three well-known semantic models; the PMI model, the GloVe model, and the skipgram model.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jan 2015 14:48:54 GMT  (355kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02670v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["amaru cuba gyllensten", "magnus sahlgren"], "accepted": true, "id": "1501.02670"}, "pdf": {"name": "1501.02670.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Navigating the Semantic Horizon using Relative Neighborhood Graphs", "authors": ["Amaru Cuba Gyllensten"], "emails": ["amaru@gavagai.se", "mange@gavagai.se"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The next neighborhood search is a basic operation in data collection in which we are interested in finding the next points (to a specific reference point). Formally, however, if we have a reference point r and a number of other points in a metric space M with a certain distance function d (or similarity function s), the next neighborhood search task is to find the point p that minimizes the complexity of the task (p, r). In k-next neighborhood search (k-NN), we want to find the next points to a specific reference point.

Distribution semantic models are well suited to this task, and there have been a number of different approaches suggested in the literature that can be roughly subdivided into context cluster and word cluster approaches. Context cluster formation does not work on the lists of closest neighbors, but on clusters that contain representations of each term. (Schatz, 1998) is one of the earliest examples of a context cluster approach in which context cluster types (the centered characteristics of distributional vectors of terms occurring in context) are used for a given term, into a series of sense vectors that represent the induced feelings. Other examples of context cluster approaches include (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004), (Velldal, Stevens, 2010 and Reioney)."}, {"heading": "4 Neighborhood Graphs", "text": "Many of the previous approaches to word-sense induction mentioned in the previous section operate at the global level and use global structural properties of semantic spaces, e.g. through matrix factorization techniques. We believe that this is so illadvised as a setting of a global k or radius for the nearest neighborhood, because there are the local structures that are important for analyzing the closest neighbors. Other approaches to word-sense induction use various forms of clustering techniques. Previous studies of the intrinsic dimensionality of distributional semantic spaces with fractal dimensions suggest that neighborhoods in semantic space have a filamentary structure rather than a clustered structure (Karlgren et al.). We therefore propose the use of topological models that take into account the local structure of neighborhoods in semantic space. The method proposed here does not perform global clustering, does not take care of grammatical preprocessing, or parveering, and paration sectors are taken into account."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we discussed the question of how to question semantic models, leading to misunderstandings about how semantic models represent and treat vagueness and polysemy. We argued that the structure - or topology - of local neighborhoods in semantic models provides useful semantic information regarding the various uses - and that such topological properties can therefore be used to analyze polysemy and performative sensitization."}], "references": [{"title": "David Mart\u0301\u0131nez", "author": ["Eneko Agirre"], "venue": "Oier L\u00f3pez de Lacalle, and Aitor Soroa.", "citeRegEx": "Agirre et al.2006", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2006}, {"title": "and Angela Y", "author": ["Sunil Arya", "David M.
