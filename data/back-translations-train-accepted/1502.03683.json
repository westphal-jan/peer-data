Specifically, we have allowed players with limited foresight to think about their opponents by constructing beliefs about their limited computational and evaluation skills, which show that our novel games have a well-understood solution by generalizing existing ones in the literature. There are interesting modeling problems, as noted at the outset. Our game models find a balance between simple trees as used for BI, and more complex models as found in epistemic game theory (Perea, 2012). Here, we have the relationship between EGSSs and Extensive Games with Perception of (Halpern and R\u00eago, 2006). We expect the correspondence for GSSs of Theory 3 to be demonstrated in theory (Grossi and Turrini, 2012)."}], "references": [{"title": "Where do preferences come from", "author": ["Franz Dietrisch", "Christian List"], "venue": "International Journal of Game Theory,", "citeRegEx": "Dietrisch and List.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dietrisch and List.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Games with unawareness", "author": ["Yossi Feinberg"], "venue": "Stanford Graduate School of Busirness Paper No", "citeRegEx": "Feinberg.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Feinberg.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Short sight in extensive games", "author": ["Davide Grossi", "Paolo Turrini"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS", "citeRegEx": "Grossi and Turrini.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Grossi and Turrini.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Extensive games with possibly unaware players", "author": ["Joseph Y.
