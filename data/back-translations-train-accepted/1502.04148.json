Therefore, PEGI does not require the complicated quasi-orthogonization pre-processing step of GI-ICA, which can be inaccurately calculated in practice. We will sketch the algorithm of gradient iteration in Section 2.1 and then introduce PEGI in Section 2.2. For convenience, we will restrict this discussion to the case of the real evaluated signals. We will show how to construct PEGI for complex evaluated signals in Appendix A.
