The quality of crowdsourced labels is, however, adversely affected by three factors: (1) the workers are not experts; (2) the incentives of the workers are not aligned with those of the requesters; and (3) the interface does not allow workers to convey their knowledge accurately, by forcing them to make a single choice among a set of options. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing approval voting to utilize the expertise of workers who have partial knowledge of the true answer, and coupling it with a (\"strictly proper\") incentive-compatible compensation mechanism. We show rigorous theoretical guarantees of optimality of our mechanism together with a simple axiomatic characterization. We also conduct empirical studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk which validate our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Feb 2015 20:42:55 GMT  (1516kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05696v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 19 May 2015 09:12:50 GMT  (314kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05696v2", "International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2015"], ["v3", "Mon, 7 Sep 2015 05:21:06 GMT  (3874kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05696v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA", "authors": ["nihar b shah", "dengyong zhou", "yuval peres"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.05696"}, "pdf": {"name": "1502.05696.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Approval Voting and Incentives in Crowdsourcing", "authors": ["Nihar B.

Our proposed crowdsourcing interface triggers approval of the candidate options for each question. The focus of this paper is on designing incentive mechanisms with characteristics that are held independent of the nature of the environment. The framework of the evaluation rules (Brier, 1950; Savage, 1971; Gneiting and Raftery, 2007; Lambert and Shoham, 2009) is to design incentive mechanisms that are independent of the nature of the environment."}, {"heading": "2 Problem setup", "text": "(Consider N \u2265 1 questions, of which each B \u2265 2 has options from which we can choose.) For each option, exactly one of the B options is correct. We assume that these N questions G (1 \u2264 G \u2264 N) contain \"gold standard\" questions, that is, questions to which the mechanism designer apriori knows the answers. Thesegold standard questions are selected as equally among the N questions, and the worker is evaluated on the basis of their performance on these G questions. For each individual question, we assume that the worker has a distribution over the B options, which represent their beliefs about the probabilities of the respective options, which are correct. We assume that these beliefs of a worker are independent across questions (Gibbons et al., 1979). For each integerK, we will use the standard notation of [K] as an abbreviation for the sentence {1,., K}.Our goal is to choose for each question the support of the worker via the B options."}, {"heading": "3 An impossibility result and a coarse-beliefs assumption", "text": "Theorem 3.1.

To circumvent this impossibility result, we invoke a certain well-understood quality of human faith."}, {"heading": "Coarse beliefs assumption", "text": "s celebrated work (Miller, 1956), for example, establishes the information and storage capacity of humans that the average person can typically distinguish between a maximum of seven states.

(2008) assume that humans often group things into categories; this hypothesis is experimentally verified by Siddiqi (2011) in a particular environment. We integrate this established notion of coarseness of human processing into our model in terms of a simple assumption. Let us consider some (fixed and known) values as incompatible and assume that the probability of each option for each question is zero or greater than the impossibility, according to the worker's beliefs."}, {"heading": "4 Incentive mechanism", "text": "Mechanism 1 presents our proposed mechanism for the present problem under the rough assumption of belief.

Does the mechanism break? In this section, we generalize the results presented earlier in the paper to the environment in which workers may have arbitrary beliefs.

We say that the answer to a question is wrong if the right option is not in the set of selected options. Definition 4 (no-free lunch; adapted to Shah and Zhou (2015)).

In particular, our goal is to evaluate the primary hypotheses underlying the theory: (i) whether workers are able to use the authorization process reasonably, (ii) whether the existence of the mechanism makes any difference, and (iii) whether there is worker resistance to the interface or mechanism for any reason. It is important to remember that conclusive experiments for mechanism design are generally quite expensive (workers take months to understand a new mechanism) and the budget. They are different from typical machine-learning experiments that require only existing benchmark data sets. In addition, the formulations may have an impact or significant influence on the behavior of the interface."}, {"heading": "6.1 Methods", "text": "We conducted three separate series of experiments with over 200 workers in each experiment: \u2022 Identification of languages from displayed text (Figure 1) \u2022 Identification of animals in displayed images (Figure 2 (a)) \u2022 Identification of textures in displayed images (Figure 2 (b)).In each experiment, each worker was randomly assigned to one of four mechanisms. \u2022 The variable component of each mechanism was performed as a \"bonus payment,\" based on the worker's assessment of performance in the gold standard questions, in addition to a guaranteed payment of 10 cents (this was \u03b1min).The four mechanisms tested were: \u2022 Simple Selection Interface with additional payments: The worker must select a single option for each question. The bonus starts from zero and is additionally increased by a fixed amount for each correct answer. \u2022 Skipped single selection interface with multiplicative payments (Shah and Zhou, 2015): For each question, the worker can either select an option to skip the pre-selected question or decrease the total answer for each specific question by a detailed answer."}, {"heading": "6.2 Results", "text": "First, let's look at the raw data. Figure 3 presents combined results from the three experiments. Figure 3 (a) shows the breakdown of the evaluations of all the answers collected. The magnitude of the evaluation represents the number of options selected and their sign indicates whether the right option was selected (positive) or not (negative). Figure 3 (b) shows the proportion of responses to attempted questions that proved incorrect. Figure 3 (c) shows the proportion of responses that were correct when only one option was selected. Figure 3 (d) shows the average pay per worker. Using this data, we now examine the three questions that were asked at the beginning of the experiments: (i) Are the workers making reasonable use of the approval process? More than 40% of the responses that include a selection of two or three options can be observed from Figure 3 (a), indicating that the workers understood the concept of approval voting."}, {"heading": "7 General utility functions", "text": "In this section, we consider a setting in which, instead of maximizing her expected payment, the worker aims to maximize the expected value of any benefit function of her payment. Let's consider any function U: R \u2192 R. Let's assume that instead of maximizing the expected payment, the worker has some benefit U for each payment made to her and that she aims to maximize the expected benefit. In other words, for each payment made to the worker f (based on the evaluation of her answers to the gold standard questions), her benefit for that payment is U (f). The worker strives to maximize the expected value of U (f). We will demand that the function U be strictly increased and immutable. The results presented so far in the paper implicitly assume that the benefit is simply the identity function, namely U (x) = x. The function U is accepted as free."}, {"heading": "8 An alternative problem statement", "text": "In previous sections, we started from the rough assumption that there is some \u03c1 (0, 1B), so that an employee's belief in any option is either equal to 0 or more than \u03c1. Then, we developed a mechanism to win support for the employee's faith under that assumption. A natural question that arises is that instead of making a rough assumption of faith, we can set a parameter, say \u03c3 (0, 1), and encourage the employee to select all options for which his faith is strictly speaking greater. Although this is not the primary focus of this paper, we devote this section to examining this complementary presentation of intellectual curiosity and practical relevance. As we show below, the answer to this question is both yes and no."}, {"heading": "8.1 Problem setting", "text": "At a given value \u03c3 (0, 1), we call a mechanism compatible as an incentive when the expected pay of a worker is strictly maximized, when the worker chooses all options for which his faith is strictly greater than \u03c3.We retain most of the features of section 2, with a few exceptions as follows. We continue to let f designate the payment function; f: {\u2212 (B \u2212 1),..., B} G \u2192 [\u03b1min, \u03b1max]. Note that, unlike the setting previously considered in section 2, we have included 0 in the scope of the payment function here. This is because under the current setting, if \u03c3 1B, there is a possibility that the worker has no more than convictions for each option when the worker is completely clueless. Let's define two integers smin and smax as smin = 1 {\u043c < 1B} and smax = min {d = perceive E \u2212 1, B}."}, {"heading": "8.2 Mechanism", "text": "Mechanism 2 Incentive mechanism for alternative problem formulation \u2022 Input: Assessment of the employee's answers to the G-Gold standard questions (x1,.., xG) \u2022 Output: Definition of a function g: R \u2192 R asg (y) = (B \u2212 | y |) \u03c3 + 1 {y \u2265 1}.

In this paper, we are following the earlier approach. We are taking a licensing vote based on the collection of marked data from crowdsourcing. We are designing an incentive mechanism through a principled theoretical approach and demonstrating appealing properties of our proposed mechanisms. Preliminary experiments conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk substantiate the usefulness of this mechanism for practical scenarios. Our mechanism may also draw more experts to the crowdsourcing platform as their remuneration is significantly higher than that of the mediocre workers, unlike the remuneration mechanisms currently in use.

The result of Part A of Theorem 8.3 implies that if there is an incentive-compatible mechanism for this setting, the mechanism must be mechanism 2, up to a constant shift and positive scale. Let us consider a worker with the belief p1 = 1 \u2212 \u03c3, p2 = \u03c3 and p3 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 pB = 0. Since \u03c3 < 12, under an incentive-compatible mechanism, the expected payment must be strictly greater if the worker only chooses option 1 compared to the expected payment if the worker chooses options 1 and 2. However, it can be calculated that under mechanism 2 the expected payment is identical in the two cases. It follows that under any incentive-compatible mechanism, the expected payment must be identical in the following two cases, if the worker (a) chooses the only option 1, and (b) the choice of options 1 and 2.

Choosing the right interface. There are tradeoffs between various interfaces for crowdsourcing. For instance, the approval voting interface elicits the support of the belief whereas the single selection interface elicits the mode. Choosing among these two interfaces would depend on the application under consideration, and moreover, one may adaptively switch between the two depending on the data obtained. A natural question that one may further ask is, why not elicit the entire belief distribution itself? While the entire belief distribution seems to supercede the support and the mode, stating the distribution will also require much more time and effort from the workers, and often also suffer from a higher noise. These tradeoffs must be taken into account when choosing the interface for the application at hand. The coarse beliefs parameter. One may wish to evaluate the value of \u03c1 by explicitly asking workers on the crowdsourcing platform for this value. However, it is noted in the literature (e.g., see Shah et al. (2015) for experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk) that the cardinal representations that humans provide are not always consistent with their respective mental beliefs, and are far noisier.", "startOffset": 8, "endOffset": 1511}], "year": 2015, "abstractText": "The growing need for labeled training data has made crowdsourcing an important part of machine learning.

In this paper, we address these issues by introducing approval voting to utilize the expertise of workers who have partial knowledge of the true answer, and coupling it with a (\u201cstrictly proper\u201d) incentive-compatible compensation mechanism. We show rigorous theoretical guarantees of optimality of our mechanism together with a simple axiomatic characterization.
