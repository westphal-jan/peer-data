In this paper, we present a game-theoretic approach to non-cooperative planning that helps predict before execution what plan schedules agents will adopt so that the set of strategies of all agents constitute a Nash equilibrium.

Execution of a certain plan \u03c0 provides the owner-agent with a real value value, which is given by the function \u03b2: \u03b2 \u2192 R. The benefit that Agent i receives from the execution of the plan is indicated by \u03b2i (\u03c0); in this work, we make this value dependent on the number of objectives that are achieved by \u03c0, and the macespan of the function, however, could use different measures of reward and cost, such as the relevance of the achieved objectives for Agent i or the cost of executing the actions of the agent. Each agent i wishesto executes a plan in such a way that max (sp) and the macespan of the agent could, however, take into account different measures of reward and cost, such as the relevance of the objectives achieved and the cost used by the agent, the relevance of the cost of the objectives obtained, or the cost of the objectives obtained by the agent for the objectives or the objectives achieved."}, {"heading": "Subgame Perfect Equilibrium (SPE)", "text": "The solution approach we use in our internal game is the subgame Perfect Equilibrium (Shoham and Leyton-Brown 2009, Chapter 5), a concept that refines a NE in the perfecting of complex formal games by eliminating the unwanted Nash Equilibra. SPEs of a game are all strategies that are NE for each subgame. By definition, every SPE is also a NE, but not every NE is an SPE. The SPE eliminates the so-called \"non-credible threats,\" that is, in which an agent threatens the other agents that are harmful to all of them, with the intention of forcing the other players to change their decisions so that these kinds of threats are not credible, because an agent i threatens the other agents to choose the other agents that are harmful to all of them."}, {"heading": "Experimental results", "text": "In this section we present some experimental results to validate and discuss our approach. As several factors can affect the solutions of the general game, we show various examples of game situations. We have implemented a program to generate the extensiveform tree and apply the reverse induction algorithms. NE in the normal form game is calculated using the tool Gambit (McKelvey, McLennan and Turocy 2014). For the experiments we have used, we have problems of the well-known Zeno travel domain from the International Planning Competition (IPC-3) 4. However, for the sake of simplicity and clarity, we show generic actions in Figures.4http: / ipc.icaps-conference.org / The experiments were conducted for two agents, A and B. Both agents have a set of individual plans that solve one or more objectives. The other objectives that are achieved by a plan, the benefit of the plan."}, {"heading": "Conclusions and future work", "text": "In this paper, we have presented a complete game theory approach for non-cooperative agents. Agents \"strategies are determined by the various ways to solve mutex actions at a time and the loss of usefulness of the solutions in the plans. We also present some experiments that have been carried out in a specific planning area. Results show that the SPE solution of the extensive game, in combination with the NE of the general game, provides a stable solution that responds to the strategic behavior of all agents.Considering that this approach solves a subset of an agent's objectives, the exponential cost of this approach represents a major limitation on the use as a general MAP method for self-serving agents.Our combination of a general + internal game can be applied successively to subproblems of agents. Considering that this approach solves a subset of an agent's objectives, the agent could participate in a new game to solve the rest of his objectives, and the AP can also be considered as a more beneficial target for the rest of the strategy."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partially supported by the Spanish MICINN within the framework of the projects Consolider Ingenio 2010 CSD2007-00022 and TIN2011-27652-C03-01 as well as the Valencian project PROMETEOII / 2013 / 019."}], "references": [{"title": "M", "author": ["A.
