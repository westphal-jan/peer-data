Our two most important types of RE are closed domain and open domain RE. While closed domain RE systems (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Bunescu, 2007; Mintz et al., 2009; Yao and Van Durme, 2014; Berant and Liang, 2014) consider only a closed set of relationships between two arguments, open domain systems (Yates et al., 2007; Carlson et al., 2010; Fader et al., 2011; Mausam et al., 2012) use an arbitrary term to specify a relationship. In this paper, we focus on open domain RE systems for multiple languages. Although there are benefits to closed domain RE (Banko and Etzioni, 2008), it is expensive to construct a closed group of relationship types that would be significant across multiple languages."}, {"heading": "2 Multilingual Relation Extraction", "text": "Our method of RE for a sentence s = < s1, s2,.. sN > in a non-English language consists of three steps: (1) Translation of s into English containing a sentence t = < t1, t2,... tM > with word alignments relative to s, (2) Open RE on t and (3) relation projection from t to s. Figure 1 shows an example of RE in Spanish using our proposed pipeline.1 We use OLLIE2 (Mausam et al., 2012) for RE in English and GOOGLE TRANSLATE3 API for translation from the source language into English, although in principle we could use any translation system to translate the language into English."}, {"heading": "2.1 Relation Extraction in English", "text": "Suppose t = < t1, t2,., tM > is a symbolic English sentence. Open relation extraction calculates three times the number of non-overlapping phrases (arg1; rel; arg2) from the sentence. The two arguments arg1 and arg2 are derived from the relation sentences rel.We used OLLIE (Mausam et al., 2012) to extract the relation stupel for each English sentence. We chose OLLIE because it has been shown that there is a higher yield with comparable precision compared to other open RE systems such as REVERB and WOEparse (Mausam et al., 2012). OLLIE was trained by extracting dependency patterns from commented training data. These training data were extracted from a series of high-precision seed tuples (Cross RE System REVERB and WOEparse (Mausam et al., 2012)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Cross-lingual Relation Projection", "text": "Next, we describe an algorithm to project the extracted relation strands in English back to the sentence of the source language. However, when faced with a source sentence, the GOOGLE TRANSLATE API delivers its translation along with the word-to-word alignments relative to the source. However, when s = sN1 and t = tM1 denote the source and its English translation, the alignment returns a = {aij: 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N; 1 \u2264 j \u2264 M}, where 4 example is borrowed from Mausam et al. (2012) 5For sentences in which the correctness of a relationship depends on a clause, OLLIE also issues the clause. In early astronomers, we believed that the earth is the center of the universe (Earth; be the center of the universe) is supplemented by a (AttributedTo: believe; early astronomers) clause."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "We first describe the construction of our multilingual relationship between the data sets and then present the experiments. The current approach to evaluating open relationships (Fader et al., 2011; Mausam et al., 2012) is to extract relationships between a sentence and a manual note each relationship as valid (1) or invalid (0) for the sentence: \"Michelle Obama, wife of Barack Obama was born in Chicago.\" The following are possible notes: a) (Michelle Obama; born in; Chicago): 1, b) (Barack Obama; born in; Chicago): Such binary notes are not available for languages other than English. In addition, a binary 1 / 0 label is a crude comment that could represent an unfair relationship between languages that exhibits a correct relationship between the correct semantic relationships."}, {"heading": "4 Related Work", "text": "The translingual projection has been used for the transfer of syntactical (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Hwa et al., 2005) and semantic information (Riloff et al., 2002; Pado \u0301 and Lapata, 2009). Interest in RE for languages other than English is growing. Gamallo et al. (2012) present an open RE system for Spanish, Portuguese and Galician based on dependency sparers. RE systems for Korean have been developed for both open domain (Kim et al., 2011) and closed domain (Kim and Lee, 2012; Kim et al., 2014), using annotations. These approaches use a Korean-English parallel corpus to project relationships in English and Korean. Following the projection, a Korean POS tagger and a dependency sparser are used to learn an RE system for Korean. Tseng et al (2014) describe open language relationships between English and French."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We have presented a language-independent Open Domain Relations extraction pipeline and evaluated its performance against three typologically different languages: French, Hindi and Russian. Our linguistic projection method uses OLLIE and GOOGLE TRANSLATE to extract relationships in the language of interest. Our approach does not rely on the availability of linguistic resources such as POS taggers or dependency savers in the target language, and can therefore be extended to multiple languages supported by a machine translation system. We publish the manually annotated judgments for open relationships in the three languages and the open relationships extracted across the entire Wikipedia corpus in 61 languages.
