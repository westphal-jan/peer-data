For these problems, label embeddings have been shown to be a useful primitive that can improve computational and statistical efficiency. In this work we utilize a correspondence between rank constrained estimation and low dimensional label embeddings that uncovers a fast label embedding algorithm which works in both the multiclass and multilabel settings. The result is a randomized algorithm for partial least squares, whose running time is exponentially faster than naive algorithms. We demonstrate our techniques on two large-scale public datasets, from the Large Scale Hierarchical Text Challenge and the Open Directory Project, where we obtain state of the art results.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Mar 2015 23:29:46 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08873v1", "Accepted as a workshop contribution at ICLR 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as a workshop contribution at ICLR 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["paul mineiro", "nikos karampatziakis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.08873"}, "pdf": {"name": "1503.08873.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["pmineiro@microsoft.com", "nikosk@microsoft.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 150 3.08 873v 1 [cs.L G] 30 Mar 201 5"}, {"heading": "1 CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "We provide a statistical motivation for label embedding by showing that the optimal rank-limited estimator for the smallest squares can be constructed from an optimal unrestricted estimator for label embedding, in other words, embedding can result in a beneficial reduction in sample complexity, even if the arithmetic limitations are not binding.We identify a natural object to define label similarity: the expected external product of conditional label probabilities. Especially in conjunction with a low-grade limitation, this indicates that two label embedding are similar when their conditional probabilities are linearly dependent on the dataset. We apply random linear algebra techniques (Halko et al., 2011) to develop an efficient and scalable algorithm for the creation of multi-label labels (Tai & Lin, 2012)."}, {"heading": "2 DESCRIPTION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 NOTATION", "text": "We denote vectors by lowercase letters x, y, etc. and matrices by uppercase letters W, Z, etc. The input dimension is denoted by d, the output dimension by c, and the embedding dimension by k.
