Recently this approach was explored in Bento et al. 2013, which demonstrated its ease of parallelization and decentralization, the speed with which the algorithms generate good quality solutions, and its ability to incorporate different proximal operators, each ensuring that paths satisfy a desired property. Unfortunately, the operators derived only apply to paths in 2D and require that any intermediate waypoints we might want agents to follow be preassigned to specific agents, limiting their range of applicability. In this paper we resolve these limitations. We introduce new operators to deal with agents moving in arbitrary dimensions that are faster to compute than their 2D predecessors and we introduce landmarks, space-time positions that are automatically assigned to the set of agents under different optimality criteria. Finally, we report the performance of the new operators in several numerical experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Apr 2015 23:49:31 GMT  (257kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01783v1", "See movie atthis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "See movie atthis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI math.OC", "authors": ["jos\u00e9 bento", "nate derbinsky", "charles mathy", "jonathan s yedidia"], "accepted": true, "id": "1504.01783"}, "pdf": {"name": "1504.01783.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Proximal Operators for Multi-Agent Path Planning", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Bento", "Nate Derbinsky", "Charles Mathy", "Jonathan S.

We have p spherical agents in Rd of radius {ri} pi = 1. Our goal is to find collision-free paths {xi (t)} i [p] i [s] i [s] [s] for all agents between their specified starting positions {xiniti} p = 1 and specified end positions {xfinali} p = 1 in time T. In the simplest case, we divide the time in intervals of equal length and the path {xi (t)} Tt it is parameterized by a series of breakpoints {xi (s)."}, {"heading": "3 No-collision proximal operator", "text": "Here we examine the proximal operator in connection with the f-coll function, which ensures that there is no collision between two agents of radius r and r-1, which move between two consecutive breakpoints.

Points (i) to (ii) are essential if the tasks are to be seen as groups of points to visit (Michael et al.2008). Many works focus on only one of these points or deal with them in isolation. An application where points (i) to (iii) are considered, although separately the problem of using color-changing robots as pixels is considered."}, {"heading": "5 Numerical experiments", "text": "We gathered all the results with a Java implementation of ADMM and TWA, as described in Bento et al.

Growing interest in coordinating large swarms of quadcopters in formation illustrates, for example, the importance of both extensions. For agents in 2D, our collision operator is significantly faster than its predecessor. In particular, this leads to an implementation of the local planning method of speed-obstacle, which is faster than its implementation in both Alonso-Mora et al. (2013) and Bento et al. (2013). The effects of our work go beyond orbit planning. We are currently working on two more projects that use our results, one relating to the visual tracking of several non-colliding large objects and the other relating to the optimal layout design of layouts, e.g. electronic circuits et al. In the first case, the speed of the new collision-free operator is crucial to achieve a real-time colliximator performance we cannot use for ALximators and we cannot use for second ALximators in WA, although we do not use it for ADM very closely."}, {"heading": "Appendix for \u201cProximal Operators for Multi-Agent Path Planning\u201d", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A A comment on the impact of the assumption of piece-wise linear paths in practice", "text": "A direct application of the approach of Bento et al. (2013) can lead to very large accelerations at the breakpoints. However, it is not difficult to overcome this obvious limitation in practice. We now explain a way to do this. Firstly, by increasing the number of breakpoints, we can obtain trajectories that are arbitrarily close to smooth trajectories with finite acceleration everywhere. As it is not efficient in practice to work with a very large number of breakpoints, we can keep the number of breakpoints at a reasonable level and increase the effective radius of the robots. This would allow us to pass a polynomial through the breakpoints and obtain smooth trajectories that are never more than the difference between the real robot radii and their effective radii from the piece-wise linear ones. With this approach, we would obtain a series of non-colliding finite acceleration paths."}, {"heading": "B An illustration of the two kinds of blocks used by the ADMM/TWA", "text": "As explained in Section 2, the ADMM / TWA is an iterative scheme that alternates between (i) different estimates of the optimal value of the variables that each function in the target depends on and (ii) generates consensus values from the different estimates that affect the same variable; the blocks that produce the estimates that we call proximal operators and the blocks that generate consensus values that we call consensus operators can be interpreted as messages from the consensus blocks (and send estimates back to them); and the consensus blocks receive only estimates from the proximal operators (and send consensus messages back to the proximal operators); therefore, the ADMM iteration scheme can be interpreted as messages going back and forth along the edges of a split graph. Let's illustrate this. Let's imagine that we want to calculate non-conflicting operators for two agents and that trajectories are parametrized by three breakpoints."}, {"heading": "C A comment on our implementation of the TWA", "text": "The implementation of the TWA requires the calculation of proximal operators and the specification for each iteration of what Derbinsky et al. (2013) designates as outgoing weights, \u2212 \u2192 \u03c1, each proximal operator. In the TWA there are also incoming weights, \u2190 \u2212 \u03c1, which correspond to the weights that occur in the definition of all our proximal operators, but whose updating scheme is defined for each iteration (Derbinsky et al. 2013, Section 4.1). For the collision operator and interface operator presented in this paper, we calculate the outgoing weights according to the same principle as in (Bento et al. 2013). Namely, if an operator maps a set of input variables (n1, n2,..., nk) to a set of initial variables (x1, x2,..., xk), we otherwise set ni 6 = xi if ni = xi = 0. In other words, if a variable is linked by the outgoing weight, it should not be altered to the outgoing operator."}, {"heading": "D More details about Remark 2", "text": "The next three points outline why Remark 2 is applicable. Firstly, if the drops are all positive, the objective function of the problem (3) is strictly convex and we can quantitatively exclude the constraint (x, x, x, x, x,) \u2264 M, large enough for M without changing its minimum value. Secondly, problem (3) can be interpreted as a solution to the following conflict. \"Agent 1 wants to move from n to time 0 to n to time 1 and Agent 2 wants to move from n \u00b2 to time 0 to n \u00b2, but if both move in a straight line, they collide.

We compare the execution speed of OLD and NEW on this trace of inputs, after segmenting the n variables into trivial, easy, or expensive according to \u00a73. For global planning, the distribution of trivial, easy, expensive inputs is {0.814, 0.001, 0.185}. Although the expensive inputs are infrequent, the total wall-clock time that NEW takes to process them is 76 msec compared to 54 msec to process all trivial and easy inputs. By comparison, OLD takes a total time of 551 msec on the expensive inputs and so our new implementation yields an average speedup of 7.25\u00d7 on the inputs that are most expensive to process.

Recently this approach was explored in Bento et al. (2013), which demonstrated its ease of parallelization and decentralization, the speed with which the algorithms generate good quality solutions, and its ability to incorporate different proximal operators, each ensuring that paths satisfy a desired property. Unfortunately, the operators derived only apply to paths in 2D and require that any intermediate waypoints we might want agents to follow be preassigned to specific agents, limiting their range of applicability. In this paper we resolve these limitations. We introduce new operators to deal with agents moving in arbitrary dimensions that are faster to compute than their 2D predecessors and we introduce landmarks, spacetime positions that are automatically assigned to the set of agents under different optimality criteria. Finally, we report the performance of the new operators in several numerical experiments.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
