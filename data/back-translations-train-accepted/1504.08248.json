Therefore, we introduce the concept of frugal bribery and formulate two new relevant arithmetic problems, which we call frugal bribery and frugal bribery, in order to capture \"bribery without money\" in elections.

An electoral rule is a process that selects a candidate as the winner based on a collection of votes. A set of votes over a set of candidates along with an electoral rule is called an electoral rule. Activities that attempt to influence voter opinion in favor of particular candidates are very common during the time an election is in progress. An extreme illustration of this phenomenon is bribery - where candidates can conduct elaborate campaigns to promote themselves among a general or targeted audience. Likewise, it is not uncommon for people to protest against or rally for a national committee or court that is in the process of approving a particular policy. An extreme illustration of this phenomenon is bribery - where candidates can create financial incentives to influence voters. Of course, the process of influencing voters can be falsifying."}, {"heading": "1.1 Motivation and Contributions", "text": "We believe that this perspective of voter influence is somewhat more complicated than the existing models of the bribery problem. Also, most of the general cost models examined in the literature have absolute costs per election-candidate combination, with no specific consideration of voters \"views of the current winner. We present a model in which changing the results of the vote is relatively easy to do, if the winner of the election achieves a result that the winner of the election would claim for himself, then this is a change that the voter is likely to like to make, while the change does not cause their favorite candidate to win the election, to improve it from their point of view (namely, that their least favorite candidate wins the election)."}, {"heading": "1.2 Related Work", "text": "The pioneering work of Faliszewski et al. [Faliszewski et al., 2006] defined and examined the $bribery problem, where the input is a series of votes with the prizes for each vote, and the goal is to let an excellent candidate win the election subject to a budget constraint of the bribe. The $bribe problem is the $bribe problem, with the caveat that the price for each non-vulnerable vote is infinite. Also, the $bribe problem is a specialization of the $bribe problem. So, whenever the $bribe problem is mathematically simple in an environment, both the $bribe problem and the $bribe problem are mathematically simple (see Proposition 1 for more formal proof). However, the $bribe problem is mathematically insolvable in most settings, and this leaves the computational complexity of the Proposition problem of bribery and the electability problem to solve."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "Let's say V = {v1,., vn} the composition of all voters and C = {c1,., cm} the composition of all candidates. Each voter has a preference for the candidates who have a complete order over C. For example, for two candidates a and b means that the voter prefers a to b. On paper, if we do not specify an order between a number of candidates while describing a vote, the statement / evidence is how we determine the order between them. We denote the composition of all complete sequences over C of L (C). Hence, L (C) n denotes the composition of all n voter preference profiles (1, 2). We interpret the composition as {0, 2, 2,} of N {0} of N +, and {1} of N."}, {"heading": "2.1 Problem Definition", "text": "Considering an election and a particular candidate, we define the concept of vulnerable votes as a succession problem.

With the above definition of vulnerable votes, we next define the problem of Frugal bribery. Intuitively, the problem is to determine whether a particular candidate can be made the winner by taking only the vulnerable votes.Definition 2.

The problem of manipulation is in P for these voting rules [Xia et al., 2009]. Therefore, the result follows from Proposition 1. Lemma 2. The Frugal $bribery problems are in P for the voting rules [Faliszewski et al., 2006] and veto [Faliszewski, 2008] Voting rules follow from Proposition 1. Lemma 3. The Frugal $bribery problem is in NPC for Borda, maximin Copeland, and STV for rules.Proof. The manipulation problem is in NPC for the voting rules mentioned above.

It turns out that the problems examined in this paper have interesting links to two of the best-studied problems in the theory of computerized social choice, namely manipulation and $bribery. We believe that our work also has practical appeal, while it is interesting from a purely theoretical viewpoint. A potential and natural direction for future work is to examine these problems under various other conditions. An obvious attitude is to limit the campaigner's knowledge of the votes and / or the candidates who will actually appear. Uncertainty may also stem from the voting rule that will ultimately be used in a number of voting rules. Also, investigating these problems, if the price model for vulnerable votes resembles the swap bribery, would be another interesting future direction. However, it is not very clear whether a swap bribery model like the price model has any practical motivation for fixing money without bribery."}], "references": [{"title": "Voting schemes for which it can be difficult to tell who won the election", "author": ["Bartholdi III et al", "J. 1989] Bartholdi III", "C.A.
