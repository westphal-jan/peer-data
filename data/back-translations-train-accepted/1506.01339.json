A commonly used accuracy metric for binary classification tasks is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC), which is equivalent to the probability of correct response in a 2-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) task in which the classifier must distinguish one positively labeled example from one negatively labeled example. In this paper we illustrate how knowledge of the 2AFC score c of a set of guesses constrains the set of possible labelings that the dataset can have.

Leakage has traditionally been identified as one of the most important data leakage errors [MNEI09] and can be surprisingly insidious and difficult to identify and prevent [KBF + 00, KRPS12]. Leakage is traditionally defined in a \"static\" sense, e.g. as an artifact of the data preparation process that leads to certain characteristics revealing the target label with complete certainty. Exploitation of an AUC oracle can be considered a form of \"dynamic\" leakage: the reaction of the oracle during the competition to a series of assumptions submitted by a participant may reveal the identity of certain test labels or at least limit the set of possible labels. Our research also relates to data-containing labels and different data protection labels (e.g., MURLA13, [MURLA11] which may be used for certain purposes]."}, {"heading": "ROC, AUC, and 2AFC", "text": "One of the most common methods to quantify the performance of a binary classifier is the receiver q = q Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve.

Suppose a candidate estimates these conjectures through a machine learning process that the probability that these examples belong to the positive class is higher than the probability that these conjectures have an AUC of 0.75, then the candidate can almost certainly conclude that the true solution is y1 = 1, y2 = 0, y3 = 1, and y4 = 0, because this is the only basic truth test that is satisfactory."}, {"heading": "AUC for different labelings", "text": "Proof. Without loss of generality, let's assume that the indices are arranged in such a way that the y-i examples are sorted, i.e., y-1 <.. < y-n.

Xn from a m-dimensional normal distribution with covariance of zero mean and diagonal unit. In our simulations, the candidate does not know the value of \u03b8, but can estimate it on the basis of a training data set with k examples (with L2 regularization of 1). In each simulation, the candidate calculates Y-1: n from his estimation of the profile and the feature vectors X1: n.

To our knowledge, our work is the first to formally investigate this type of attack; the practical implications of our work are mixed: on the one hand, we have presented evidence for the concept that systematic exploitation of AUC oracles is possible, underscoring the importance of simple security measures, such as (a) adding sounds to the results of the Oracle, (the AUC) the number of times a candidate can play in the Oracle, and (the AUC) the number of times a candidate can be limited in the Oracle)."}], "references": [{"title": "In Journal of Machine Learning Research", "author": ["Shivani Agarwal", "Thore Graepel", "Ralf Herbrich", "Sariel Har-Peled", "Dan Roth.
