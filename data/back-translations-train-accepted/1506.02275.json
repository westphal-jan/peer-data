These studies rely on either GPS coordinates attached to individual messages, or on the user-supplied location field in each profile. In this paper, we compare these data acquisition techniques and quantify the biases that they introduce; we also measure their effects on linguistic analysis and text-based geolocation. GPS-tagging and self-reported locations yield measurably different corpora, and these linguistic differences are partially attributable to differences in dataset composition by age and gender. Using a latent variable model to induce age and gender, we show how these demographic variables interact with geography to affect language use. We also show that the accuracy of text-based geolocation varies with population demographics, giving the best results for men above the age of 40.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Jun 2015 15:29:26 GMT  (148kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02275v1", "in review at EMNLP 2015"], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Aug 2015 15:25:59 GMT  (1051kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02275v2", "final version for EMNLP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "in review at EMNLP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["umashanthi pavalanathan", "jacob eisenstein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.02275"}, "pdf": {"name": "1506.02275.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Confounds and Consequences in Geotagged Twitter Data", "authors": ["Umashanthi Pavalanathan"], "emails": ["jacobe}@gatech.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Social media data such as Twitter are often used to identify the unique characteristics of geographical regions, including issues of interest (Hong et al., 2012), linguistic styles and dialects (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Gonc tweets and Sa-chez, 2014), political opinions (Caldarelli et al., 2014), and public health (Broniatowski et al., 2013). Social media allow the aggregation of datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than could be compiled using traditional survey techniques, enabling analyses that are both finer and more global in scale. However, social media is not a representative sample of any \"real world population,\" apart from the social media itself. Usingsocial as a sample therefore risks the introduction of both geographical and demographic biases (Mislove al., 2011; Hecht and Stephens, 2014; Longley et al., 2015; Malik et al.)."}, {"heading": "2 Dataset", "text": "As a first filter step, we removed retweets, repetitions of previously posted messages that contain the metadata of \"retweeted status\" or \"RT\" tokens that are widely used among Twitter users to indicate a retweet. To eliminate spam and automated accounts (Yardi et al., 2009), we removed tweets containing URLs, user accounts with more than 1,000 followers or followers, accounts that tweeted more than 5,000 messages at the time of data collection, and the top 10% of accounts based on the number of messages in our data set. We also removed users who wrote more than 10% of their tweets in a language other than English, using Twitter's long-running metadata field. Exploring code-switching (Solorio and Liu, 2008) and the role of bilingual English speakers (Eleta and Golbeck, 2014) will be left to future work."}, {"heading": "3 Representativeness of geotagged Twitter data", "text": "First, we evaluate possible distortions in sampling methods for obtaining geotagged Twitter data. In particular, we compare two possible techniques for obtaining data: the location field in the user profile (Poblete et al., 2011; Dredze et al., 2013) and the GPS coordinates attached to each message (Cheng et al., 2010; Eisenstein et al., 2010)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Methods", "text": "To create a dataset of GPS-tagged messages, we extracted the GPS latitude and longitude coordinates specified in the tweet and used GIS TOOLS1 reverse geocoding to identify the corresponding counties. This set of geotagged messages is referred to as DG. Only 1.24% of messages contain geo-coordinates, and it is possible that the people willing to share their GPS comprise a distorted population. Therefore, we also looked at the location field specified by the user in the Twitter profile and focused on the two most commonly used patterns: (1) city name, (2) city name and two letter names (e.g. Chicago and Chicago, IL). Messages that matched one of the ten largest MSAs were grouped into a second group, the DL.While the inconsistencies of the writing style in the Twitter location field are well known (Hecht et al., 2011), cross-points of the data point between the DL and the two overwhelmingly determined time."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Subsampling", "text": "The first DG and DL samples were then re-sampled to create the following balanced datasets: GPS-MSA-BALANCED FromDG, we sampled 25,000 tweets per MSA as a message-balanced sample and all tweets from 2,500 users per MSA as a user-balanced sample. A balance between the MSAs ensures that the largest MSAs do not dominate the linguistic analyses.GPS-COUNTY-BALANCED We sampled DG based on the population at the district level (determined by the US Census Bureau) and again received message-balanced and user-balanced samples. These samples are geographically more representative of the general population distribution in each MSA.LOC-MSA-BALANCED We randomly sampled 25,000 tweets per MSA as a message-balanced sample and all tweets per sample of 2,500 users as an MSA."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Age and gender identification", "text": "In order to estimate the distribution of age and gender in each sample, we asked for statistics from the Social Security Administration, which records the number of people born each year with each given name. Using this information, we obtained the probability distribution of ages for each given name. We then matched the names with the first token in the name field of each user's profile file, allowing us to approximate distributions of age and gender. Unlike Facebook and Google +, Twitter does not have a \"real name\" policy, so users are free to specify names that are fake, humorous, etc. We delete user accounts whose names are not sufficiently common in the Social Security database (i.e. first names that are at least 100 times more common in Twitter than in the Social Security database), leaving out 33% of user accounts and 34% of tweets. While some people choose names that are not typically associated with their gender, we assume that this will happen more likely in both directions."}, {"heading": "3.2 Results", "text": "In recent years, the number of people receiving benefits has multiplied, both in the US and in Europe."}, {"heading": "4 Impact on linguistic generalizations", "text": "Many papers use Twitter data to draw conclusions about the relationship between language and geography. What role do the demographic differences identified in the previous section play in the resulting linguistic conclusions? We measure the differences between the language corpora achieved by each approach to data collection. As GPS-MSA-BALANCED and GPS-COUNTYBALANCED methods have nearly identical usage and demographic patterns, we focus on the difference between GPS-MSA-BALANCED and LOC-MSA-BALANCED. These data sets differ in age and gender, so we also directly measure the influence of these demographic factors on the use of geographically specific linguistic variables."}, {"heading": "4.1 Methods", "text": "We focus on lexical variables, which are therefore relatively easy to identify in text corpora. Monroe et al. (2008) Survey a number of alternative statistics for the search for lexical variables, showing that a regulated log-odds ratio holds a good balance between distinctiveness and robustness. A similar approach is implemented in SAGE (Eisenstein etal., 2011a) 2, which we use here. For each sample - GPS-MSA-BALANCED and LOC-MSABALANCED - we use SAGE to identify the twenty-five most important lexical terms for each metropolitan region. Keyword annotation Previous research has identified two main types of geographical lexical variables, the first being non-standardized words and spellings, such as hella and yinz, which are very common in social media (Eisenstein, 2015)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results", "text": "The keywords identified in GPS-MSABALANCED dataset include more geographically significant age-specific words, which are statistically significant at a rate of 3.9 x 10 \u2212 4 in GPS-MSA-BALANCED, versus 2.6 x 10 \u2212 4 in LOC-MSA-BALANCED, 2009; this difference is statistically significant (p <.05, t = 3.2).43Binning is commonly used in the work on text-based age predictions (Garera and Yarowsky, 2009); Rao et al, 2010; Rosenthal and McKeown, 2011); it allows word and name counting that is shared across multiple age groups, and avoids the complexity inherent in regressing textual predictors against a numerical variable.4We employ a paired t test, comparing the difference in frequency for each word."}, {"heading": "5 Impact on text-based geolocation", "text": "One important application of geotagged social media is predicting the geolocation of individuals based on their text (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Cheng et al., 2010; Wing and Baldridge, 2011; Hong et al., 2012; Han et al., 2014). Text-based geolocation has obvious commercial implications for location-based marketing and opinion analysis; it is also potentially useful for researchers who want to measure geographical phenomena in social media and access a larger number of individuals than those who explicitly state their locations. Previous research has achieved impressive accuracy for text-based geolocalization: For example, Hong et al. (2012) reported a median error of 120 km, roughly equivalent to the distance from Los Angeles to San Diego, in a prediction space across the entire continent of the United States. These accuracies are calculated using test sets acquired by the same methods as the training data, i.e. those that are the least likely to be geographically accurate or biographically optimistic for the results."}, {"heading": "5.1 Methods", "text": "Our data comes from the ten largest metropolitan areas of the United States, and we formulate text-based geolocation as a ten-way classification problem, similar to Han et al. (2014).6 Using our 6Many previous papers have attempted to identify the precise latitude and longitude coordinates of individual authors, but to achieve high accuracy in this task, much more user-balanced samples are required. We apply a tenfold cross-validation and match the regularization parameter to a developmental fold, using the vocabulary of the sample as characteristics."}, {"heading": "5.2 Results", "text": "Since GPS-MSABALANCED and LOC-MSA-BALANCED have very different usage rates (Figure 2), perceived differences in accuracy can only be due to the amount of data available per user, rather than users in a group that is inherently more difficult to classify than another. Therefore, we are users by the number of messages in our sample in their timeline and report separately for each recycle bin. All error bars represent 95% trust intervals. GPS versus location As shown in Figure 6a, there is little difference in the accuracy of the sample: the location-based sample is slightly easier to sonize in each recycle bin, but the difference is not statistically significant."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "Several researchers have investigated how the adoption of Internet technology varies with factors such as socioeconomic status, age, gender and living conditions (Zillien and Hargittai, 2009). Hargittai and Litt (2011) use a longitudinal survey methodology to compare the effects of gender, race and topics of interest to Twitter usage among young adults. Geographical differences in Twitter usage were considered both internationally (Kulshrestha et al., 2012) and within the United States, taking into account both the Twitter location field (Mislove et al., 2011) and GPS coordinates per message (Hecht and Stephens, 2014). Demographic statistics of users of geographic censuses were used by O'Connor et al. (2010) and Eisenstein et al. (2011b); Malik et al. (2015) use demographic data censuses spatial error models."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion", "text": "Geotagged Twitter data provide an invaluable resource for studying the interaction of language and geography and help usher in a new generation of location-based language technology, which makes a critical study of the nature of this data source particularly important. This paper uncovers demographic confusion in the linguistic analysis of geo-localized Twitter data, but is limited to demographic characteristics that can easily be derived from given names. Another critical task for future work is to quantify the representativity of geotagged Twitter data in terms of factors such as race and socio-economic status while maintaining geographical constants. Another critical task is to expand this research beyond the United States, as the different patterns of social media use in different countries (Pew Research Center, 2012) imply that results cannot be expected to be generalized here in any international context."}], "references": [{"title": "Gender identity and lexical variation in social media", "author": ["David Bamman", "Jacob Eisenstein", "Tyler Schnoebelen."], "venue": "Journal of Sociolinguistics, 18(2):135\u2013160.", "citeRegEx": "Bamman et al\\.,? 2014", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bamman et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "National and local influenza surveillance through twitter: An analysis of the 2012-2013 influenza epidemic", "author": ["David A Broniatowski", "Michael J Paul", "Mark Dredze."], "venue": "PloS one, 8(12):e83672.", "citeRegEx": "Broniatowski et al\\.,? 2013", "shortCiteRegEx": "Broniatowski et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Discriminating gender on twitter", "author": ["John D.
