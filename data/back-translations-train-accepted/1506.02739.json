Our goal in this essay is to focus on the general connotation of the predicate xi considered from the context."}, {"heading": "2.1 Data-driven Motivation", "text": "Since the meaning of language is ultimately contextual, the exact connotation will vary depending on the context of each utterance. Nevertheless, there are still frequent shifts or distortions in contextual polarities, as we have found out from two data-driven analyses.First, we looked at words from the Subjectivity Lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005) that are used in the reasoning positions of a small selection of predicates in Google syntactic N-grams (Goldberg and Orwant, 2013).For this analysis, we assumed that the agent is the word in the subjectivity position, while the subject is the word in the object position. We found that 64% of the words in the agent role of suffering are positive, and 94% of the words in the topic role are negative, which is consistent with the polarities of the writer's perspective vis-\u00e0-vis these arguments, as shown in Table 1."}, {"heading": "2.2 Dynamics between Typed Relations", "text": "These and other possible interdependencies are summarized in Table 3.

First, the aligned mood between the agent and the subject is likely to make the interaction and influence of the topic likely."}, {"heading": "3 Modeling Connotation Frames", "text": "Our task is essentially that of lexicon induction (Akkaya et al., 2009; Feng et al., 2013), inducing the connotation frames of hitherto invisible verbs. From each verb predicate, we conclude a connotation frame consisting of 9 relationship aspects, which stand for: perspective {P (w \u2192 t), P (w \u2192 a), P (a \u2192 t), effect {E (t), value {V (t), V (a)} and state of mind {S (t), S (a)} polarities, whereby w, a, t each denotes the writer, the agent and the topic. We propose two models: an aspect-level model, which makes the prediction of each typed relationship independent of the distribution representation of the context in which the predicate usually appears (\u00a7 3.1), and a frame-level model, which makes prediction of the connotation collectively taking into account 3.dynamic relations (\u00a7 3.2)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Aspect-Level", "text": "For input, we use the 300-dimensional dependency-based word embedding of Levy and Goldberg (2014).

Drawing inspiration from them, we present connotation frames as a unifying framework of representation to encode the rich dimensions of implied feelings, anticipate value components, and effect theory, and represent a factoring formulation that describes the interplay of different types and relationships."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we present a novel system of connotation frames that defines a set of implicit feelings and presupposed facts for a predicate. Our work also empirically investigates different methods of inducing and modelling these connotation frames, taking into account the interaction between relationships within frames.

We introduce connotation frames as a representation formalism to organize these rich dimensions of connotation using typed relations. First, we investigate the feasibility of obtaining connotative labels through crowdsourcing experiments. We then present models for predicting the connotation frames of verb predicates based on their distributional word representations and the interplay between different types of connotative relations. Empirical results confirm that connotation frames can be induced from various data sources that reflect how people use language and give rise to the connotative meanings. We conclude with analytical results that show the potential use of connotation frames for analyzing subtle biases in online news media.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
