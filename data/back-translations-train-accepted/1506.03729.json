This paper introduces efficient algorithms that do not require such knowledge and yet achieve the optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs identified in [AS15] for linear size communities. The results are three-fold: (i) in the constant degree regime, an algorithm is developed that requires only a lower-bound on the relative sizes of the communities and detects communities with an optimal accuracy scaling for large degrees; (ii) in the regime where degrees are scaled by $\\omega(1)$ (diverging degrees), this is enhanced into a fully agnostic algorithm that only takes the graph in question and simultaneously learns the model parameters (including the number of communities) and detects communities with accuracy $1-o(1)$, with an overall quasi-linear complexity; (iii) in the logarithmic degree regime, an agnostic algorithm is developed that learns the parameters and achieves the optimal CH-limit for exact recovery, in quasi-linear time. These provide the first algorithms affording efficiency, universality and information-theoretic optimality for strong and weak consistency in the general SBM with linear size communities.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 16:09:28 GMT  (100kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03729v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1503.00609"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1503.00609", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.PR cs.IT cs.LG cs.SI math.IT", "authors": ["emmanuel abbe", "colin sandon"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.03729"}, "pdf": {"name": "1506.03729.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Recovering communities in the general stochastic block model without knowing the parameters", "authors": ["Emmanuel Abbe", "Colin Sandon"], "emails": ["eabbe@princeton.edu.", "sandon@princeton.edu."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "* Applied and Computer Assisted Mathematics and EE Department, Princeton University, Princeton, USA, eabbe @ princeton.edu.

Unlike [AS15], this work does not require knowledge of the SBM parameters. In particular, the problem of learning model parameters will only be solved if the average degrees differ from each other. Next, we provide some motivations for the problem and wider background of the model, with the capture of communities (or clusters) in graphs being a fundamental problem in networks, computer science and machine learning, as well as a wide variety of complex networks (e.g. social and biological networks) and datasets designed as networks in which one often tries to get a first impression of the data by trying to identify groups with similar behavior. In particular, it allows to find communities to find like-minded people in social networks [GN02, NW07, HB14, to improve recommendation systems [SMLZ]."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related results on the general SBM with known parameters", "text": "Most of the previous work concerned SBMs with symmetric communities (mainly 2 or sometimes k), with the exception of [Vu14], which provide some accessibility results for the general SBM.2 \u2212 Recently, [AS15] examined the basic boundaries for the general SBM, with the results as follows (where SBM (n, p, W) is the SBM with the community before p and the connectivity matrix W. \u2212 The first result of [AS15] concerns the regime in which the connectivity matrix scales are used as Q / n for a positive symmetric matrix Q (i.e., the node mean is constant).The following idea of SNR is introduced3SNR = | 1 / 2 / 2 max.

For the constant degree regime, [MNS12] shows that the parameters above the threshold can be estimated by counting cycles (which are efficiently approximated by counting non-traceable paths), but this is true for a fixed number of communities, namely 2. Recently, we also noticed a parallel work [BCS15] that takes into account private graph estimates (including SBMs). In particular, for the logarithmic graph regime, [BCS15] receives a method for estimating graph parameters in a suitable version of the L2 standard, but this method is not efficient."}, {"heading": "2 Results", "text": "Agnostic algorithms are developed for the constant and divergent degrees of nodes, which allow optimal accuracy scaling for large degrees of nodes and reach the limit of node divergence for logarithmic degrees in quasi-linear time.

We also refer to the vector with i-th entry, which corresponds to the number of vertices in the community i (v). If there are several vertices with the shortest path to v the length re, we refer to the vector with i-th entry, which is equal to the number of vertices in the community i (v), as Nr (v). If there are several vertices that v could be considered as vertices, we will let Nr [G] (v) take the totality of all vertices with the shortest vertices in G to the length v.

First, instead of using no, r \"(v\" v \") as a basic tool for comparing vertices, it uses another metric, N\" r, r \"(v\" v \"), which is defined as a fraction of an edge that centered the ball of the radius r on v and an edge that is centered on v\" r \"but not the same edge.

This paper introduces efficient algorithms that do not require such knowledge and yet achieve the optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs identified in [AS15] for linear size communities. The results are three-fold: (i) in the constant degree regime, an algorithm is developed that requires only a lower-bound on the relative sizes of the communities and detects communities with an optimal accuracy scaling for large degrees; (ii) in the regime where degrees are scaled by \u03c9(1) (diverging degrees), this is enhanced into a fully agnostic algorithm that only takes the graph in question and simultaneously learns the model parameters (including the number of communities) and detects communities with accuracy 1\u2212 o(1), with an overall quasi-linear complexity; (iii) in the logarithmic degree regime, an agnostic algorithm is developed that learns the parameters and achieves the optimal CH-limit for exact recovery, in quasi-linear time. These provide the first algorithms affording efficiency, universality and information-theoretic optimality for strong and weak consistency in the general SBM with linear size communities. \u2217Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics, and EE department, Princeton University, Princeton, USA, eabbe@princeton.edu.
