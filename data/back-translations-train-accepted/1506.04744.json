The aim of the game (like other war games such as Risk or Axis & Allies) is to conquer all the territories on the board (Figure 1). The games are divided into years from 1901 and each year is divided into two seasons - Spring and Autumn. Each season consists of two alternating phases: Diplomacy - the players communicate to develop strategies - and Commands - the players submit their moves for the season. Seasons are therefore the most important unit of the season."}, {"heading": "2.1 Movement, Orders, and Battles", "text": "On the playing field, each player can operate one unit for each city he or she controls, and during each turn, these pieces have the ability to move to neighboring territory. What makes diplomacy unique is that all players submit their written (or electronic) commands; these commands are executed simultaneously; and there is no randomness (e.g. dice). Thus, the outcome of the game depends only on the communication, cooperation, and movement of the players. If two units are in the same territory, this implies a battle. Whoever wins the battle is decided purely on the basis of numerical superiority (ties go to defenders). Instead of moving, one unit can support another unit; large armies can be created through intricate support networks; the side with the largest army wins the battle.The process of supporting one unit is therefore crucial both for a successful attack and for a successful defense. Often, an individual player lacks the support to support his or her attacks sufficiently, and therefore needs the help of others."}, {"heading": "2.2 Communication", "text": "In the diplomatic phase of the game, players talk to each other. These conversations are either public or - more typically - one-to-one. Conversations include greetings, off-game discussions (e.g., \"Have you seen Game of Thrones?\"), low-level tactics (\"If you attack Armenia, I support you\"), and high-level strategies (\"We must control Central Europe\"). The content of these messages is the subject of our study. Due to the centrality of language to diplomacy, we can learn the rhetorical and social tools with which players build and break trust. As this language is embedded in each game, it has practical properties: similar situations are repeated, the goals are clear, and machine-readable commands confirm which players are enemies and which friends. In the next section, we examine the diplomatic data."}, {"heading": "2.3 Preprocessing", "text": "We use games from two popular online platforms to play Diplomacy.3 The average season of an online diplomacy game lasts nine days. We remove non-standard games caused by differences between the two platforms, as well as games that are still in progress. In addition, we filter setup messages, regulatory messages to and from the game administrator, as well as messages explaining the state of the game, and only keep messages between players. This leaves 249 games with a total of 145,000 messages. The record confirms that communication is an essential part of diplomacy: in half of the games, over 515 messages are exchanged between players, while the top quartile contains over 750 messages per game. Even non-trivial messages (with at least one sentence) tend to be complex: over half of them have at least five sentences, and the top quartile consists of messages with eight or more sentences."}, {"heading": "3 Relationships and Their Stability", "text": "This year, it is so far that it is only a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "4 Language Foretelling Betrayal", "text": "In this section, we examine whether the conversations between two allies of diplomacy contain linguistic clues that predict whether their friendship will endure or end in betrayal. We expect these clues to be subtle, since we consider messages exchanged between the two individuals to be superficially friendly only when at least one of them - the eventual victim - is unaware of the fate of the relationship."}, {"heading": "4.1 What Constitutes a Betrayal", "text": "To find betrayal, we must first find friendships. Building on the discussion in Section 3, we consider a friendship stable if it is persistent, established and reciprocal. Therefore, we focus on relationships that include at least two consecutive and reciprocal friendships that include at least three seasons in the season. We also verify that no more than five seasons pass between two friendships, because friendships can fade. Betrayal develops and reciprocal friendships that end with at least two hostile acts. The person who initiates the first of these hostile acts is the traitor, while the other person is the sacrifice.5For each instance of betrayal, we find the most similar stable friendship that has never been resolved by betrayal. Using a greedy heuristics, we select friendships that correspond to the betrayals on two statistics: the length of friendship and the number of seasons since the beginning of the game.5After this matching process, we find no significant difference in both variables (Manny Mode > 0.3) and whether the relationship of betrayal has an enduring durance in the game."}, {"heading": "4.2 Linguistic Harbingers of Betrayal", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "4.3 Predictive Power", "text": "To test whether these linguistic keywords have any predictive power and to explore how they interact, we automatically turn to a binary classification setting, in which we try to detect whether a player V is betrayed by a player B. (We will refer to player V as a potential victim and player B as a potential traitor.) Expert people - the actual victims - performed poorly in this task and could not say that they are betrayed: due to the way the dataset is constructed, the performance of human players is random. We use the same balanced dataset of matching betrayals and enduring friendships as before, and consider as classification instances all seasons coming from each of the two classes (663 treacherous years and 712 from enduring friendships). As characteristics, we use the keywords described above and summarized in Table 1, which are differentiated by sources: V or B. We use logistic regression according to radio unification."}, {"heading": "5 Sudden yet Inevitable Betrayal", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive themselves without being able to survive themselves. Most of them are able to survive themselves, and most of them are not able to survive themselves. Most of them are able to survive themselves, and most of them are not able to survive themselves. Most of them are able to survive themselves, and most of them are able to survive themselves. Most of them are able to survive themselves, and most of them are able to survive themselves."}, {"heading": "6 Relevance Beyond the Game", "text": "While the discovery of betrayal in an online game is a fun and novel task, our work combines with broader research in mathematical social science. In this section, we describe how our work addresses issues that have been addressed in previous research on alliances, negotiations and relationships. Cooperation and relationship building are an essential component of many activities: completing a group project, starting a business, or forging a new relationship. Each of these topics has been the subject of extensive research to understand what constitutes effective relationships. Jung et al. (2012) show that a balanced working relationship tends to perform better in tasks such as programming couples. Imai and Gelfand (2010) show that understanding cultural norms improves negotiation. While this data is decoded in the laboratory, our \"found\" data is inexpensive because diplomacy games are fun and inherently anonymized. Romance is a popular and more real phenomenon that helps us understand how relationships arise and dissolve."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "It is not a task that we expect can be solved with high accuracy, as it would provide a reliable \"recipe\" for avoiding betrayal in relationships; in this unrealistic scenario, it would be unlikely that betrayal would exist. Although the implications are subtle, they bring new insights into the relationship between linguistic balance and stability in relationships. Although we use a game to develop our methodology, the framework developed here can be extended to a wide range of social interaction. Social dynamics in a collaborative environment can bear striking similarities to those present in war games. For example, in Wikipedia, \"editing wars\" - where attacks coincide with editing - are common in matters of politics, religion, history and nationality (Kittur et al., 2007). As in diplomacy, Wikipedia editors form alliances, argue and negotiate possible compromises. A challenge for the future is to find reliable linguistic connections."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Mario Huys, Chris Babcock and Christopher Martin for providing the Diplomacy dataset.
