Social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook provide users with two primary means of indicating their location: (1) through text-based metadata fields in the user profile; and (2) through GPS-based geotagging of posts and checkins. However, text-based metadata is often lacking, misleading or inaccurate, and only a tiny percentage of users geotag their posts (Cheng et al., 2010). Given the low number of users with reliable location information, there is considerable interest in the task of automatic geolocation (predicting lat / long coordinates) of the users based on their location, the metadata available in their social media posts, and in their social networks."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Previous work on user geolocation can be broadly divided into two categories: text-based and network-based methods. Common to both methods is the way in which the problem of geolocation is formulated. Geographical coordinates have a real value and, accordingly, this is most naturally modelled as (multiple) regression. However, for convenience modelling, the problem is typically simplified to a classification by first dividing the regions into individual sub-regions, using either known city locations (Han et al., 2012; Rout et al., 2013) or k-d tree partitioning (Roller et al., 2012; Wing and Baldridge, 2014). In k-d tree methods, the resulting discrete regions are treated either as a flat list (as here) or as a nested hierarchy."}, {"heading": "2.1 Text-based Geolocation", "text": "Text-based approaches assume that the language in social media is geographically distorted, which is clearly recognizable for regions that speak different languages (Han et al., 2014), but is also reflected in regional dialects and the use of region-specific terminology. Text-based models mainly use terms to learn regional classifiers (Roller et al., 2012; Wing and Baldridge, 2014), including the selection of characteristics for location-specific terms (Han et al., 2012). Topic models have also been used for the use of geospatial texts (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Ahmed et al., 2013) by linking latent topics to places, which has the advantage that predictions can be made over continuous space, i.e. without the problem having to be presented as classification. On the other hand, these methods exhibit high algorithmic complexity and their generative formulation is unlikely to compete with the performance of discriminatory methods on large data sets."}, {"heading": "2.2 Network-based Geolocation", "text": "Although online social networking sites allow for global interaction, users tend to befriend and interact with many of the same people online as offline (Rout et al., 2013). Network-based methods use this feature to derive users \"location from their friends\" locations (Jurgens, 2013; Rout et al., 2013). A major caveat about the generality of these techniques is that friendship graphics are often inaccessible, for example by disseminating location information (Facebook) or hiding behind a highly frequency-restricted API (Twitter) (Jurgens, 2013; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009). A major caveat about the generality of these techniques is that friendship graphics are often not accessible, e.g. secured by the public (Facebook) or hidden behind a highly frequency-restricted API (Twitter)."}, {"heading": "3 Data", "text": "Each user is represented by the chain of his or her tweets and assumes that he or she comes from a single location.GEOTEXT: approximately 380K tweets from 9.5K users in the adjacent US, of which 1895 will be provided for development and testing (Eisenstein et al., 2010); the location of each user will be determined by the GPS coordinates of his or her first tweet.TWITTER-US: approximately 39M tweets from 450K users in the adjacent US. Each 10K user will be used for development and testing (Roller et al., 2012); again, the locations of the users will be taken from their first tweet. TWITTER-WORLD: approximately 12M English tweets from 1.4M users around the world, of whom 10K users will be used for each development and testing (Han et al., 2012); users will be connected to the nearest city (Eisenstein, @ 1km) and 161 km (Media."}, {"heading": "4 Methods", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Text-based Classification", "text": "Our basic method for text-based geolocation is based on Wing and Baldridge (2014), which formulate the geolocation problem as a classification using k-d trees. In summary, their approach initially discredits the continuous space of geographical coordinates using a k-d tree, so that each subregion (leaf) has similar user numbers. In many small regions for areas with high population density and less large regions for rural areas with low population density, this leads to a discreditation. Next, they use these regions as class labels to train a logistic regression model (\"LR\"). Our work is also subject to a sparse l1 regularization penalty (Tibshirani, 1996).In their work, Wing and Baldridge (2014) demonstrated that hierarchical logistic regression with a beam search yields higher results than a logistic regression over a flat label set (Tibshirani, 1996).Our work is also subject to a sparse l1 regularization penalty (Tibshirani, 1996).In their work, Wing and Baldridge (2014) demonstrated that hierarchical logistic regression using a beam search yields higher results than a logistic regression over a flat label set (LR) of a flat number of labels, but 600 of labels are used in each of WERs."}, {"heading": "4.2 Network-based Label Propagation", "text": "Next, consider the approach of Jurgens (2013), which used label dissemination (\"LP\"; Zhu and Ghahramani (2002)) to derive user locations through social networking. Jurgens (2013) defined an undirected network of interactions between Twitter users based on @ mentions in their tweets, a mechanism typically used for conversations between friends. Consequently, these links often correspond to offline friendships, and accordingly, the network will have a high level of localization when each user mentions the other. The network is constructed by defining all users in a data set (train and test) as nodes, as well as other external users mentioned in their tweets. Unlike Jurgens (2013), which only generated edges when both users mentioned the other, we created edges when both users mentioned the other. For the three sets of data we used to be direct, which were used in our experiments, and therefore to be less-direct."}, {"heading": "4.3 A Hybrid Method", "text": "Unfortunately, many test users are not transitively connected to any training node (see Table 1), which means that LP cannot assign a location to them. This can happen when users do not use @ mentions or when a group of nodes are a separate component of the chart. To alleviate this problem, we use the text for each test user to estimate their location, which will then be used as the first estimate during label propagation. 1Since our records do not have tweets for external users, these nodes do not help weighting their incident values.2Note that @ mentions have been removed from the published TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD records. To restore them, we have rebuilt the companies from the Twitter archive. Estimate the location for each test node using the LR classifier described above before propagating the labeling over mentions."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "The results are also linked to the state of the art."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We have a number of approaches to social media geolocation based on: (1) text-based analysis using logistic regression with regularization; (2) network-based analysis using label propagation; and (3) a hybrid method based on network-based label propagation and back-off to text-based analysis for unconnected users. We get state-of-the-art results from three existing Twitter records and find that the hybrid method is superior to the two component methods. The LP-LR method is a hybrid approach that uses the LR predictions as priors. It is not simply a backoff of network information to text-based information in the sense that it propagates the LR geolocation through the network. That's when a test node is separated from the training node but still has connections to other test nodes, the geolocation is adapted and propagated through the network."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and valuable suggestions.
