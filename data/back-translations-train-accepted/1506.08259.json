Social media platforms such as Twitter support users to explain their location manually in their text profile or automatically with GPS-based geotagging. However, text-based profile locations are noisy and only 1-3% of tweets are otagged (Cheng et al., 2010; Morstatter et al., 2013b), which means that geolocation must be derived from other information sources such as the tweet-text and network relationships. User geolocation is the task of inferencing the primary (or \"home art\") of users from information as text as text as text, text as text as text and text and the article, and art are the article that article."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "A recent increase in interest in user geolocation via social media data has led to the development of a number of approaches to automatic geolocation prediction, based on information sources such as the text of messages, social networks, user profile data and temporal data. Text-based methods model the geographical bias of language use in social media, and use them to locate non-geotagged users. However, gazetted expressions (Leidner and Lieberman, 2011) and geographical names (Quercini et al., 2010) were used as features in early work, but were shown to be sparse in reporting. Han et al. (2014) used information theory methods to automatically extract location-related words for location classification. Wing and Baldridge (2014) reported that discriminatory approaches (based on this Xiv: 150 6.08 259v 3 [cs.C L] 22 Searchical classification over Grid) are better adaptive than grids."}, {"heading": "3 Data", "text": "We evaluate our models based on three existing geotagged Twitter datasets: (1) GEOTEXT (Eisenstein et al., 2010), (2) TWITTER-US (Roller et al., 2012) and (3) TWITTER-WORLD (Han et al., 2012). In each dataset, users are represented by a single meta-document generated by concatenating their tweets. The datasets are pre-partitioned into training, development and test records and re-composed from the original version to include information.The first two datasets were constructed to contain mainly English messages.GEOTEXT consists of tweets from 9.5K users: 1895 users are retained for each development and test dataset, and the primary location of each user is specified on the coordinates of their first tweet. TWITTER-US consists of 449K users, with each user re-defining the first WITK for each developer dataset and the 10K for each developer location."}, {"heading": "4 Methods", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to go in search of a solution."}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation", "text": "According to Cheng et al. (2010) and Eisenstein et al. (2010), we evaluate the mean and median error (in km) across all test users (\"mean\" and \"median\") and accuracy within 161km of the actual location (\"Acc @ 161\"). Note that higher numbers are better for Acc @ 161, but lower numbers are better for mean and median error, with a lower limit of 0 and no (theoretical) upper limit. To generate a continuously estimated latitude / longitude coordinate for a given user from the k-d tree cell, we use the median coordinates of all training points in the predicted region."}, {"heading": "6 Results", "text": "Table 1 shows the performance of MAD-B, MADCEL-B, MADCEL-W, MADCEL-B-LR, and MADCEL-W-LR using the GEOTEXT, TWITTER-US, and TWITTER-WORLD datasets. Results are also compared with previous work on network-based geolocation (LP) (Rahimi et al., 2015), text-based classification models (Han et al., 2012; Wing and Valdridge, 2014; Wing and Valdridge, 2014; Rahimi et al.; Cha et al., 2015), text-based graphical models (Ahmed et al.), and network-text hybrid models (LP-LR) (Rahimi et al., 2015)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We proposed a label propagation method via adaptive networks based on collapsed @ mention networks using modified adsorption, and successfully added: (a) the elimination of \"celebrity nodes\" (improving results and simultaneous tractabilization of inference nuclei) and (b) the inclusion of text-based geolocation priorities in the model. As a future work, we plan to use temporal data and also strive to improve the text-based geolocation model using sparse coding (Cha et al., 2015). We also plan to explore more nuanced methods of distinguishing between global and local celebrity nodes in order to filter out global celebrity nodes but obtain local nodes with high geolocation benefits."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and valuable suggestions.
