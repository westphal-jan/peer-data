Researchers have looked at identifying a variety of factors about users, including age, gender, language, religious beliefs and political views. Most work uses multiple sources of information, such as search query history, Twitter feeds, Facebook likes, social network links and user profiles. However, in many situations little of this information is available. Conversely, usernames are almost always available.In this work, we deal specifically with the classification of gender and language based only on username. Primary work by sociologists has established a link between username and gender (Cornetto and Nowak, 2006), and studies have linked usernames with other attributes, such as individual beliefs (Crabill, 2007; Hassa, 2012) and demonstrated how usernames influence perceptions of gender and ethnicity of gender notions of nondescriptions by common terms (Pelletier, 2014)."}, {"heading": "2 General Classification Approach", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Unsupervised Morphology Learning", "text": "In linguistics, a morpheme is the \"minimal linguistic unit with lexical or grammatical meanings\" (Booij, 2012). Morphemes are combined in various ways to produce longer words. Similarly, usernames are often composed of a concatenated sequence of smaller units, which are highlighted as u-morphs to emphasize the fact that they play an analogous role for morphemes, but for the purpose of encrypting usernames rather than standard words in a language. u-morphs are subunits small enough to be shared across different usernames, but retain some meaning. Unattended morphology induction using Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2006) is based on a minimal description length (MDL) that balances two competing goals: maximizing both the probability of the data and the model."}, {"heading": "2.2 Classifier Design", "text": "In view of a breakdown of the username into a sequence of u-morphs (or character n-grams) that we have proposed specifically for classification, we represent the relationship between the observed characteristics and each class with a unique language model. If a username u actually has a decomposition m1,.., mn then it is assigned to the class for which the unique model gives the highest posterior probability, or equivalent: argmaxi pC (ci) n, where pC (ci) is the class before and p (mk | ci) is the class-dependent unigrammation capability. 1For some demographics, the class may be very skewed, as in the case of speech recognition, where English is the dominant language. Choosing the smoothing algorithm may be important in such cases, since minority classes have much less training data to evaluate the language model and benefit from having more probability mass that is unseen."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Gender Identification", "text": "The data was collected by dating site OkCupid by downloading up to 1,000 profiles from 27 cities in the United States, first for men looking for women, and then for women looking for men to get a balanced set of 44,000 usernames. Data is divided into three groups, with 80% assigned to training and 10% each assigned to validation and testing. We also use 3.5M usernames from the photo messaging app Snapchat (McCormick, 2014): 1.5M are used for u-morph learning and 2M for self-training. All names in this task are used to a lesser extent due to the nature of the available data. Top features, which are sorted by probability ratios, are given in Table 1. The u-morphs clearly carry semantic meaning, and the trigram features seem to be substrings of the top u-morph-morph systems. \"The top features, which are sorted by probability ratios, are given in Table 1."}, {"heading": "3.2 Language Identification on Twitter", "text": "This experiment takes usernames from the Twitter Streaming API. Each username is associated with a tweet for which the Twitter API identifies a language. Language names are loud, so we remove about 35% of tweets in which the Twitter API does not match the langid.py classifier (see Table 4). Over 110,000 usernames have been reserved for testing and 430,000 have been used to train both u-morphs and classifiers. Semi-monitored methods are not used for the abundantly labeled data. For each language, we train a one-vs.all classifiers. The mixed trap coding technique (see sec. 2.1) gives a small increase (0.5%) in the accuracy of the model and reduces the size of the trading model by 5%."}, {"heading": "4 Related Work", "text": "Of the many studies on the automatic classification of online user demographics 77, few have used names or usernames at all, and the few that mainly explore their use in combination with other functions.The work presented here differs in the use of usernames alone, but more importantly in the introduction of morphological analysis to handle a large number of usernames.Two studies on gender recognition are particularly relevant. Burger et al. (2011) use Twitter usernames (or screen names) in combination with other profile and text functions to predict gender, but they also look at the use of user functions alone. Results are not directly comparable to ours, as differences in the data sets used are used (150k Twitter users) and the classification frame (Winnow), but the character performance of n-grams is similar to ours (21-22% different from the majority basis).The study uses gender characteristics (screens alone) for n-grams (n-5)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In summary, this work has introduced the use of unattended morphological analysis of usernames to extract characteristics (u-morphs) to identify user demographics, particularly gender and language. Experimental results show that usernames contain useful personal information and that the u-morphs provide a more efficient and complementary representation than sign-n-grammary.2 The result for language identification-2To enable the replicability of the experiments, software and data to create and evaluate our classifiers using pre-trained morphologist models at http: / / github.com / ajaech / username _ analytics.cation are particularly noteworthy because it comes close to the performance achieved by using the full text of a tweet. The work complements other demographic studies by using the prediction of the username along with other characteristics, both for the user and for members of his / her social networks, which could be broadly outlined here."}], "references": [{"title": "Language identification for creating language-specific twitter collections", "author": ["Paul McNamee", "Mossaab Bagdouri", "Clayton Fink", "Theresa Wilson"], "venue": "In Proc. second workshop on language in social media,", "citeRegEx": "Bergsma et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bergsma et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "The Grammar of Words: An Introduction to Linguistic Morphology", "author": ["G.
