Discussion forums tend to specialize in different topics, and the people who participate in them form communities of interest. The response of people within a community to posted comments provides an indication of community support for opinions and the value of information. In most discussions, the vast majority of comments elicit little response. In this paper, we examine whether (and how) language use influences the response, compared to the relative importance of the author and the timing of the post. Early work on factors that seem to influence the assessment of comments on the Slashdot forum (Lampe and Resnick, 2004) suggests that timing, starting point, length of the comment, and poster anonymity / reputation seem to play a role (with anonymity having a negative effect)."}, {"heading": "2 Data", "text": "Reddit1 is the largest online public discussion forum with a variety of subreddits, making it a good source of data to investigate how textual content in a discussion affects the response of the crowd. On Reddit, people initiate a discussion thread with a post (a question, a link to a news article, etc.), and others respond with comments. Registered users vote on which posts and comments are important. On Reddit, the total number of up votes minus down votes (roughly) is called karma; there is also an indication of community support and the popularity of a comment as used in (Lakkaraju et al., 2013). Karma is rated because it influences the order in which posts or comments are displayed, with the high karma content going up. Karma points are also accumulated by members of the discussion forum as a function of karma associated with their comments.1http: / www.red.comXiv: 02 / 207.5c1 The comments are only half active in Reddit1, although 207.5cc is one half."}, {"heading": "3 Uptake Factors", "text": "Factors other than language usage influence whether a comment is received by the community, including the topic, the timing of the message and the messenger. These factors are all evident in the Reddit discussions. Some subreddits are more popular and therefore have higher karma comments than others, reflecting the influence of the topic. Comments posted early in the discussion are more likely to have high karma as they have more potential reports.Previous studies on Twitter show that the reputation of the author significantly increases the chances of retweeting (Suh et al., 2010; Cha et al., 2010), and the reputation is also raised as a factor in Slashdot (Lampe and Resnick, 2004). On Reddit, most users are anonymous, but it is possible that forum members become familiar with certain usernames associated with high karma comments.

The ranking has access to the comment history of these posts. This simulates the view of an early reader of these posts, i.e. without influencing the comments \"ratings, so that the linguistic content of the post is more likely to have an impact. Very long threads are sampled so that they do not dominate the list. Approximately 75% of the comment lists are intended for training and the rest are intended for testing, with discussion thread-level alters. Here, the function selection is based on the mean precision of the top-rated comment (P @ 1), so that learning the rare high karma events is underlined. (Note that the P is classified as equal to 1, but the problem can be counted as correct for each comment)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Classifier", "text": "We use the SVM ranking algorithm (Joachims, 2002) to predict a ranking for each list of comments; the SVM is trained to predict which of the two pairs of comments has higher karma; the error term penalty parameter is set to maximize P @ 1 on a reserved validation rate (20% of training samples); since much of the data contains low karma comments, there is a tendency to learn to highlight features that discriminate against comments at the lower end of the scale; to learn features that enhance P @ 1, and to understand the relative importance of different features, we use a greedy automatic selection process that gradually adds a feature whose resulting feature set reaches the highest P @ 1 on the validation set.

(2013) analyze the hierarchy of Reddit discussions, topic shifts and the popularity of the comment using, among other things, very simple language analyses. Lampos et al. (2014) investigate the problem of predicting Twitter user effect (determined by combining the number of followers, followers and listings) using text-based and non-textual features, showing that performance improves when user participation in specific topics is included. Most relevant for this work are studies on the effect of language in popularity projections based on messages and non-textual messages (as we examine Twitter's word choice in 2014)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We are collecting a new dataset of six subredit discussion forums. We are introducing a new task to evaluate comments based on karma in Reddit discussions, which is responsible for the topic and timing of comments. Our results show that the use of language functions improves the task of rating comments in most subreddits. Informativeness and relevance are the most common function categories; reputation questions for ASKSCIENCE and other categories may be either helpful or hurtful depending on the community.
