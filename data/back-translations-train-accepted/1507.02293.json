[3] examined the temporal and statistical characteristics of retweet-driven connections within the Twitter network and subsequently identified the number of retweets as a key factor in making such connections. [28] Finally, in [4] the authors showed that the Twitter network can be characterized by steady rates of change, punctuated by sudden outbreaks of new connections triggered by retweet cascades. They also developed a method to predict which retweets are more likely to trigger these outbreaks.

Let's leave the historical event (t) as a list of times from events {t1, t2,., tn} to, but without including time. Then, the number of events observed in a small time window dt between [t, t + dt) is dN (t) = respected ti H (t)."}, {"heading": "3 Generative Model of Information Diffusion and Network Co-evolution", "text": "In this section, we will use the above background on time processes to formulate our probabilistic generative model for the common dynamics of information diffusion and network evolution."}, {"heading": "3.1 Event Representation", "text": "We model the generation of two types of events: tweet / retweet events, er and linking events, el. instead of just the time t, we record each event as a tripleter or el: = (u \u2191 target, source \u2193 s, t \u2191 time). (6) For retweet event, the triplet means that the target node u retweets at a time when a tweet was originally posted from the source node s. Recording the source node s reflects the real scenario that information sources are explicitly acknowledged. Note that the occurrence of the event does not mean that u is retweeted directly by s or is associated with s. This event may occur when u retweets a message from another node in which the original source s is acknowledged. Node u passes the source confirmation to his followers (e.g.: \"I agree @ a @ b @ c @ s is directly linked to or is not allowed by this node\")."}, {"heading": "3.2 Joint Model with Two Interwoven Components", "text": "Given m user, we use two sets of counting processes to capture the generated events, one for information diffusion and the other for network evolution.

We have designed a sampling method that is particularly well suited to the structure of our model. The algorithm is based on the following key idea: If we consider each intensity function (t) as a separate Hawkes process and draw a sample from each sample, it is easy to show that the minimum among all these samples is a valid sample from the model [13]."}, {"heading": "5 Efficient Parameter Estimation from Coevolutionary Events", "text": "Considering a collection of retweet events E = \u00b2 and linking processes A = {eli} recorded within a timeframe, we can easily estimate the parameters required in our model using maximum probability estimation.

(1) The log term merely summarizes the events actually observed, but the integral term adds up to all possible combinations of destination and source pairs, even if there are essentially no specific pairs of events between the two events.

A network's degree distribution is a right of power if the expected number of nodes md is given with degree d of md-\u03b3, where \u03b3 > 0. Intuitively, the higher the values of the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, the closer the resulting degree distribution follows a right of power; the lower their values, the closer the distribution is to an Earth-Renyi random chart [32]. Figure 3 confirms this intuition by showing the degree distribution for different values of \u03b2 and \u03b1."}, {"heading": "6.4 Small (shrinking) Diameter", "text": "There is empirical evidence that the diameter of online social networks and microblogging sites is relatively small and shrinks (or flattens) as the network grows [33, 10, 24].

Here, the network develops uniformly. The bottom two lines correspond to \u03b2 = 0.8 and represent the other end, i.e. scale-free networks. Here, the network develops locally, and clusters arise naturally as a result of local growth. They are represented by a combination of forced directed and Fruchterman pure gold structure with Gephi1.

In our experiments, we focus on all events (and users) during a 5-day period in which users in the first group post 371,012 tweets, users in the second group retweet 130,275 tweets and users in the third group create 7,983,306 new links."}, {"heading": "8.2 Retweet and Link Coevolution", "text": "Figure 11 illustrates the retweet and linkage events, aggregated across different sources, and the corresponding intensities that our trained model dictates for four randomly selected nodes.

Figure 12 also compares the cross-covariables between the empirical retweet and link creation intensities and between the retweet and link creation intensities calculated by our tracted model for the same nodes. For all nodes, the similarity between the two cross-covariables is striking, and both have their culmination around zero, i.e. retweet and link creations correlate and develop over time. In order to simplify the exposure, we have, as in Section 6, the co-evolution of the variables by means of four nodes, verify the variables Quotes, but we should continue to coconsistently determine the results of all of the variable.To simplify the exposure, we have the co-evolution of the variables by means of four nodes."}, {"heading": "8.3 Link prediction", "text": "We use our model to predict the identity of the source for each test link event, given historical (link and retweet events) events prior to the time of the prediction, and compare its performance with two state-of-the-art methods known as TRF [3] and WENG [5].
