The problem with this strategy is that the campaign budget would be spent on users who already have high ARs, rather than on those who may have been heavily influenced by the ads (i.e., those with high AR lift due to the ads). The difference is best illustrated by the examples below. Example 1 (Value-based bidding). Suppose that a DSP bids on behalf of an advertiser to acquire impressions and the advertiser CPA = $100. Suppose that there are two ad requests from user a and b. User a's AR is 0.04 when he / she is shown the advertiser's ad, otherwise the AR has an AR of 0.02 when he / she is shown the ad that he / she is displaying the ad, otherwise the AR is 0.01. Based on the absolute practice of ARs, the prices should be shown in the ARs."}, {"heading": "1.2 Challenges and Our Contribution", "text": "In this paper, we advocate an industry-wide transition from value-based bidding to elevator-based bidding. That is, the offer price should be based on the AR elevator rather than the absolute AR elevator. However, it also presents several interesting challenges. First, existing AR prediction models estimate absolute ARs based on the assumption that the ads are shown to users. There is little effort in the literature to explicitly model the AR elevator. Since a user is either shown or no ad is shown, it is theoretically impossible to collect data covering both cases of an ad request. Therefore, learning from past ads is that the AR elevator is a challenging task. Second, although the motivational examples have shown that the prevailing value-based bidding is suboptimal in terms of the maximum number of actions for advertisers, we can prove that elevator-based bidding, when not optimal, is a better alternative to estimating the AR elevator."}, {"heading": "2. VALUE-BASED BIDDING VS.

However, it would be rejected by DSPs under the industry-standard last-touch attribution model. < b > Advertising request from a user and an advertiser A, we define AR w.r.t. (q, u, A) as the likelihood that a user will take the desired action if the desired action is not served by A, and AR-elevator as the difference between AR and background AR. We denounce the AR-elevator, and p the background AR-elevator if no further specifications are made in the industry."}, {"heading": "3. LIFT-BASED BIDDING IN ACTION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Predicting AR Lift", "text": "However, in order to implement the elevator-based offering strategy, it is more important to estimate the AR elevator. One can think about building a machine learning model to predict the AR elevator directly. However, since the real ad logs only include cases where an ad is either shown or not shown, it is theoretically impossible to have the true AR elevator data for modeling. To predict the AR elevator, we strive to estimate both the ARs where the ad is displayed or not shown. Formally, an ad (let an ad appear) is considered the state of a user at the time of the ad request, and s + (a) the state of a user when an ad is shown. Conceptually, s consists of the user's demographic status, time-stamped past events, including page views, searches, ad views / clicks, and everything you can think of to describe the user state when an ad is shown."}, {"heading": "3.2 Model Training", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to move to another world, in which we are able to move, and in which we are able to move."}, {"heading": "3.3 Fitting Lift-based Bidding in the Marketplace", "text": "Conventional value-based bidding typically calculates the offer price by multiplying the predicted absolute AR by the advertiser CPA. In elevator-based bidding, it does not seem appropriate to simply multiply the AR elevator by the same advertiser CPA. Otherwise, it is rare to win an auction if the majority of other competing DSPs are still practicing value-based bidding. Remember that in elevator-based bidding, the offer price is proportional to the AR elevator, i.e. \u03b2 \u00b7 \u2206 p. Our selection of \u03b2 results from this \u03b2 = p \u0445 p \u00b7 CPA (9), where p is the population average of the AR and \u2206 p is the population average of the AR elevator. The idea is simple: If the advertiser is willing to pay CPA for each action in a conventional way, then any incremental action should be paid at the price of p \u00b7 p \u00b7 CPA if only incremental measures need to be paid."}, {"heading": "4.

RELATED WORK", "text": "Most of the existing work towards this goal is actions and clicks within the same framework [7, 10, 8, 2]. In [3], the author points out that an action can take place days or weeks later after an imprint and that an additional predictive model has been developed in conjunction with the action model. However, it is common practice in the industry for researchers to explore alternatives to optimize some key performance indicators (KPIs)."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We have demonstrated both mathematically and empirically that the new lift-based bid strategy actually helps advertisers improve campaign performance. In addition, our current implementation can easily fit into an industry-leading DSP and handle up to one million ad requests per second, and we believe it can scale even more. We believe that it will be an industry trend that advertisers will only pay for those impressions that drive incremental market value. This is an exciting new area of research with many potential directions. As we discussed in this paper, for example, accurately predicting performance growth is a critical task that merits much research. Additionally, DSPs traditionally place the offer of AR \u00d7 CPA, where CPA is determined as a scale factor by advertisers with sufficient market knowledge. However, what value should the scale factor in lift-based bidding be? We have proposed a simple and empirical answer in section 3.3, which may be considered relevant to the industry when considering the lift as an interesting one."}, {"heading": "8.
