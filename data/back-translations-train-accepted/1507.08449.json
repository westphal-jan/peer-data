Data-driven analysis models (Nivre et al., 2006) can be trained for each language if enough annotated data is available. In languages where tree banks are not available, multilingual transfer can be used to train parsers for a target language with data from one or more source languages. Data transfer approaches (e.g. Yarowsky et al. (2001), Tiedemann (2014) map linguistic annotations between languages by parallel companies. Instead, model transfer approaches (e.g. Naseem et al. (2012)) rely on cross-linguistic syntactical regulations to learn aspects of the source language that help analyze an invisible language without parallel corporations."}, {"heading": "2 Bilingual training", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to"}, {"heading": "3 Evaluation", "text": "In order to ensure a fair comparison between monolingual and bilingual models, we decided to radically optimize the models with MaltOptimizer, assuming that the MaltOptimizer would choose the parsing algorithm and the feature model most likely to achieve good results. We observed that selecting a bilingual parsing algorithm was not necessarily related to the algorithms selected for the monolingual models.1http: / / grupolys.org / software / PARSERS / The system sometimes chose an algorithm for a bilingual model that was not selected for one of the corresponding monolingual models. For this reason, and since it is known that different parsing algorithms may be more or less competitive depending on the language (Nivre, 2008), we conducted a control experiment to evaluate the models that set the same parsing algorithm in all cases, with only phase 3 of the MaltOptizer running."}, {"heading": "3.1 Results on the Universal Treebanks", "text": "In fact, it is as if most people are able to surpass themselves by seeing themselves as being able to surpass themselves by following the rules that they follow.

We performed informal tests by running the Spanish-English bilingual parsers on some such sentences. We observed that they were able to analyze the English and Spanish portions of the sentences much better than monolingual models, which required the formation of a bilingual tagger, as we did with the free distribution of the Stanford tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000); the merging of the Spanish and English corporations to form a combined bilingual tagger. Under the sole configuration of universal tags, the multilingual tagger scored 98.00% and 95.88% over the monolingual test sentences; instead, using tree-based tags, it scored 97.19% and 93.88% over the monolingual tagger test sentences. Figure 1 shows an interesting example of how the use of bilingual parsers (and taggers) improves impeccable performance."}, {"heading": "3.3 Adding more languages", "text": "To show that our approach works when more languages are added, we have developed a four-language parser that uses the Romance languages and fine PoS tags, and the results (LAS / UAS) for the monolingual sentences were: 80.18 / 84.64 (es), 79.11 / 84.29 (fr), 82.16 / 86.15 (it) and 84.45 / 86.80 (pt). In all cases, the performance is almost equivalent to the monolingual parser. Noah's ARC group (Ammar et al., 2016) has shown that this idea can also be adapted to universal parsing. Our models are a collection of weights learned from mixing harmonized tree trunks, which precisely analyze sentences in each language learned and where it is possible to use linguistic universes, but they are still dependent on language-specific forms. Instead, Ammar et al. (2016) rely on multilingual clusters of words and multilingual word-specific structures (e.g. by supporting language-specific structures)."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions and future work", "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to train purely bilingual parsers to analyze sentences regardless of which of the two languages they are written in, since the existing work on training a parser in two languages (Smith and Smith, 2004) focused on the use of parallel corpora to transfer linguistic knowledge between languages. Our results reflect that bilingual parsers do not lose their accuracy in relation to monolingual parsers in their respective languages, and can even exceed it, especially when using fine-grained tags. This shows that the use of tree bank-dependent tag sets is not a disadvantage, thanks to universal dependencies and common syntactic structures in different languages. Applications include parsing sentences of different languages with a single model, improving the accuracy of monolingual parsing with training sets from other languages, and successfully parsing sentences with code-switched. As a future work, our approach could benefit from simple domain thumb-fit techniques (Target Inclusion III)."}, {"heading": "5 Acknowledgments", "text": "David Vilares is supported by the Ministerio de Educacio, Cultura y Deporte (FPU13 / 01180).
