However, in order for a machine to understand and make inferences on these health conditions, the ability to recognise when laymen's terms refer to a particular medical concept (i.e.\\ text normalisation) is required.

Indeed, understanding the language of machines requires the ability to recognize when a phrase refers to a particular concept. Considering a variable length phrase, an effective system should return with the most similar meaning. A Twitter phrase \"No way I'm gettin any sleep 2nite\" could refer to the medical concept \"insomnia\" (SNOMED: 193462001) if we use the SNOMED-CT dictionary."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Phrase-based MT models (e.g. (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney et al., 2004) have proven effective in translating between languages, learning local term dependencies such as collocations, reorders, insertions, and deletions. Koehn et al. (2003) have shown that a phrase-based MT technique outperforms traditional word-based MT techniques significantly better than various benchmarks. In this paper, we adapt the phrase-based MT technique from Koehn et al. (2003) to the task of medical text normalization. In particular, we use the phrase-based MT technique to translate phrases from the Twitter language into formal medical language before translating the translated phrases based on the ranked similarity of their word vector representations based on word vector representations. (Traditional approaches to generating word vector representations as atomic units (Mikolov et al., 2010; Turiet, 2013b)."}, {"heading": "3 Medical Term Normalisation", "text": "In Section 3.1 we discuss our adaptation of phrase-based MT to the normalization of medical texts. Section 3.2 presents our proposed approach to combining the similarity value of word vector representations with the adapted phrase-based MT technique."}, {"heading": "3.1 Adapting Phrase-based MT", "text": "We endeavor to learn a translation between a Twitter phrase (i.e. a phrase from a Twitter message) and a formal medical phrase (i.e. the description of a medical concept). For a given Twitter phrase phrt, we find a suitable medical phrase thresher based on a phrase thresher, as follows: translationscore (phrm | phrt) = p (phrm | phrt) (1), where p (phrm | phrt) can be calculated using any phrase thresher MT technique, e.g. (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004). We then rate translated phrases phrm based on this translation result. The top-k translated phrases are used to identify the corresponding medical concept. However, the translated phrase phrm cannot accurately match the description of any medical term Vhrm Vhrm will be matched with two techniques to address this problem."}, {"heading": "3.2 Combining Similarity Score with Phrase-based MT", "text": "As described in Section 2, word vector representations (e.g. created by CBOW or GloVe) can capture semantic similarities between words themselves. Therefore, we suggest mapping a Twitter phrase phrt to a medical concept c, represented by a description descc, by phrt the cosine similarity between vector representations of the Twitter phrase and the description descc linearly, calculating the similarity value with one of the adapted phrased MT techniques introduced in Section 3.1: simcombine (phrt, descc) = Vphrt \u00b7 Vdescc | | Vphrt | | | | Vdescc | (4) + MTa (phrt, descc), where MTa (phrt, descc) is calculated using one of the adapted phrase-based MT techniques described in Section 3.1."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Setup", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Test Collection", "text": "To evaluate our approach, we use a collection of 25 million tweets about drug side effects. These tweets specifically refer to cognitive enhancers (Hanson et al., 2013) and antidepressants (Schneeweiss et al., 2010) that may have side effects. We use 201 ADR phrases and the associated SNOMED-CT concepts, commented on by a doctoral computer linguist. These phrases have been anonymized by replacing numbers, user IDs, URIs, locations, email addresses, data and drug names with appropriate tokens, such as NUMBER."}, {"heading": "4.2 Evaluation Approach", "text": "We conduct 10-fold cross-validation experiments in which the Twitter phrases are randomly divided into 10 separate folds. We treat this task as a ranking task, where we aim to place the medical concept with the highest similarity value, e.g. calculated according to Equation (2), at the top. Therefore, we evaluate our approach using the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric (Craswell, 2009), which is based on the flip side of the ranking, which considers the first relevant concept in the ranking. Furthermore, we compare the significant difference between the performance achieved by our proposed approach and the baselines with the paired t test (p < 0.05)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Word Vector Representation", "text": "We use three different techniques, including onehot, CBOW and GloVe, to create word vector representations used in our approach (see section 3). Specifically, the vocabulary used to create the unified representation includes all the terms in the Twitter phrases and the descriptions of the SNOMED-CT target concepts. In the meantime, we create word vector representations based on CBOW and GloVe using the word2vec4 and GloVe5 implementations. We learn the vector representations from the collections of tweets and medical articles using a window size of 10 words. The tweet collection (referred to as Twitter) includes 419,702,147 English tweets referring to 11 drug names and 6 cities, while the medical article collection (referred to as BMC) includes all medical articles from the BioMed Central6. For both CBOW and GloVe, we create vector representations with vector sizes of 200 and 50 respectively."}, {"heading": "4.4 Learning Phrase-based Model", "text": "We use the phrase-based MT technique from Koehn et al. (2003), as implemented in the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) with default settings, to learn to translate from the Twitter language into the medical language.
