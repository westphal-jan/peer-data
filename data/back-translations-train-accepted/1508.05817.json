Results suggest a strong relationship between affect and virility, in this case measured by the number of people who sent each article by e-mail. As suggested by the authors, this metric represents a form of \"narrative casting,\" as opposed to other \"broadcasting\" actions such as sharing on Twitter. Another line of research examines the impact of different textual characteristics on audience reactions. Guerini et al (2011) correlates several viral phenomena with the formulation of a post, while Guerini et al al al al al al al al al al downloadable (2012) presents the impact of a particular person's readability to the abstract nature of a booklet, such as the number of abstract features."}, {"heading": "2.2 Studies on the effects of phonetics", "text": "Benczes (2013) notes that alliteration and rhyme can be considered attention-seeking aids because they reinforce emphasis. He also suggests that these aids are useful for the acceptance and long-term maintenance of original expressions, decipher their meanings, point to informality, and break the ice between audience and speaker. Therefore, these aids are often used in original metaphorical and metonymic compositions. According to Leech (1966), phonetic aids such as rhyme and alliteration are systematically used by advertisers to gain memory ability. Similarly, Wales (2001) emphasizes the effectiveness of alliteration and rhyming on the emphasis and remembrance ability of an expression. The relationship between the use of logical sentences (i.e. consonants in which the vowel tract is blocked so that all airstreams cease, such as \"p\" or \"k\") and memory ability."}, {"heading": "3 Phonetic Scorer", "text": "In designing the phonetic characteristics, we were largely inspired by the work of O \ufffd zbal et al. (2013), who built and used three phonetic scorers for creative sentence generation. Similarly, all the phonetic characteristics we used are based on the phonetic representation of English words pronounced by dictionaries at Carnegie Mellon University. We selected four classes of phonetic devices: 1The CMU pronunciation dictionary is freely available at http: / / www.voic.cs.cmu.edu / cgi-bin / cmudict. We used version 0.7a in our implementation: namely plosive, alphabetic, rhyme, and homogeneity, which can be easily modelled by observing the distribution of certain phonemes within the set. Plosive scoring is calculated as the ratio of the number of plosive sounds to the total number of phonemes."}, {"heading": "4 Dataset", "text": "In this section, we describe the four datasets we have used to carry out our analyses and experiments. As we have already mentioned, the definition of persuasion work is a topic under discussion and may involve different strategies or facets. Therefore, we have experimented with datasets in which at least one component is clearly included in the equation. In order to investigate the effects of formulations and euphonics on persuasion work, the datasets were constructed in a controlled environment (theme, author, sentence length), in order to avoid confusion factors such as author or subject popularity, we follow the procedure described in Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012 Tan et al., 2014 In addition, these datasets include short texts to focus on surface realization of persuasion work, where strategic planning - which could function as a constituent factor - plays a minor role."}, {"heading": "5 Data Analysis", "text": "In fact, it is in such a way that one will be able to go to another world, in which one can go to another world, in which one is able to go to another world, in which one is able to go to another world, in which one is able to see another world, in which one is able to create a new world, and in which one is able to create a new world, in which one is able to create a new world, in which one is able to create a new world, in which one is able to see oneself to create a new world, in which one is able to create a new world, in which one is able to create a new world, in which one is able to create a new world, in which one is able to create a new world, in which one is able to create a new world, a new world, in which one is able to create a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new world, a new"}, {"heading": "6 Prediction Experiments", "text": "In this section, we describe the prediction tasks (both within and across datasets) that we have performed in-4. Below, the ratios are calculated from real values, while Table 4 shows the rounded values. Understand the influence of phonetic characteristics on the recognition of various forms of persuasion. We compare three different sets of characteristics, namely phonetics, n-gram and their combination, to understand whether phonetic information can improve the performance of standard lexical approaches. Similar to Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012) and Tan et al. (2014), we formulate a pair-wise classification problem so that in a pair (s1, s2) consisting of sentences s1 and s2, our goal is to determine the more convincing label (i.e., the one on the left or right)."}, {"heading": "6.1 Dataset and preprocessing", "text": "For the prediction experiments, we used the four sets of data described in Section 4 (i.e. CORPS, Twitter, Slogan, and Movie), which all consist of a convincing sentence P and its unconvincing counterpart (\u00ac P), marked either as left or right. To make the positions of the sentences in a pair irrelevant (i.e. to establish symmetry), we added for each instance that occurs in the original records (e.g. (s1, s2) labeled left), another instance that contains the same sentence pair in reverse order (i.e. (s2, s1) labeled right). As a pre-processing step, all sentences were symbolized by Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014)."}, {"heading": "6.2 Classifier and features", "text": "We performed a 10-fold cross-validation on each set of data and experimented with three sets of characteristics using a classifier from the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). Due to its characteristic characteristic, we preferred SVM as a classifier to perform well, especially for high-dimensional data (Weichselbraun et al., 2011). The first set of characteristics consists of the phonetic characteristics (i.e. plosive, alphabetization, rhymes and homogeneity values as described in Section 3); the second set of characteristics consists of a standard bag of verbs, including unigrams, bigrams and trigrams; all non-ascertaining characters, punctuations and numbers were ignored; URLs and mentions in Twitter data were replaced by tags (i.e. URLs and MENTION or MENTION); and the ungrained characteristics were filtered out."}, {"heading": "6.3 Within-dataset experiments", "text": "In Table 5, for each data set listed in the first column, we report in the following columns on the performance of the respective best model, which has 10-fold cross-validation using i) phonetic characteristics only (phonetic), ii) n-gram only (N-gram), iii) both phonetic and ngrammatic characteristics (all). As already mentioned, for each pair (s1, s2) consisting of sentences s1 and s2, our data set becomes another pair with the same sentences in reverse order (i.e., s2, s1), resulting in a symmetrical and balanced dataset. Therefore, the classification performance is measured in terms of accuracy (i.e. the percentage of pairs whose labels were correctly predicted). For each accuracy, we also report the number of selected characteristics and the core degree of the corresponding model."}, {"heading": "6.4 Cross-dataset experiments", "text": "After observing that the combination of phonetic and n-gram features can be effective in the withindataset prediction experiments, we went a step further and examined the interaction of the three character sets between the data sets. More specifically, we classified each data set with the best models (one for each character set) trained on the other data sets. In this regard, the results of the cross-dataset experiments can also be interpreted as a measure of the degree of compatibility between these types of persuasion. In Table 7, we present the results of the crossdataset prediction experiments. For each training and test set, we report on the accuracy of the best models, one for each feature, based on cross-validation on the training set."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we focused on the effects of a number of phonetic features - namely rhymes, alliteration, homogeneity, and plosive - on various forms of persuasive power, including the memorability of slogans and film quotes, retweet counting of tweets, and the effectiveness of political speech. We conducted our analysis and experiments on four sets of data containing pairs of a persuasive sentence and an unconvincing counterpart. Our data analysis shows that convincing sentences are generally euphoric, and the key role that phonetic features play is confirmed by predictive experiments in which we observed that phonetic features consistently help to detect persuasive power. Combined with lexical features, they help to improve the classification performance of three of the four sets of data we considered. The key role that phonetic features play is further enhanced by the transboundary data experiments alone that we observed overlapping features in the phonetic ones."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partially supported by the Trento RISE PerTe project."}], "references": [{"title": "Analysis of topological characteristics of huge online social networking services", "author": ["Yong-Yeol Ahn", "Seungyeop Han", "Haewoon Kwak", "Sue Moon", "Hawoong Jeong."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web, pages 835\u2013844.
