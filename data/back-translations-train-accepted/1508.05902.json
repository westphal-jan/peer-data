In this paper, we present a general framework for making such comparisons to extract important findings. Indeed, many tasks in the real world can be formulated as a problem of comparing two or more groups of documents. Here, we offer two motivational examples. Program evaluations. To conduct better direct research efforts, funding organizations such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Ministry of Defense (DoD) are often able to review research programs by their artifacts (e.g., abstracts, published descriptions, and other research descriptions). Such evaluations may include overlaps between different programs that indicate duplication of efforts."}, {"heading": "2 Our Formal Model for Comparing Document Groups", "text": "As a starting point, several groups of documents are given, and our task is to compare them. We now formally present these document groups and the criteria used to compare them. Let's present each individual document (each document) as a collection of documents that encompasses the entirety of the documents under consideration, with DP being the size of DP. Let DP be a partition of D that represents the document groups. Any document group in DP that represents the document groups in DP could represent articles that are either associated with a particular organization (e.g., NSF or DARPA program), or a period of time (e.g., a fiscal year). Document groups are compared with comparison criteria, DC, a family of subgroups of D.Definition2 A comparison is a criterion."}, {"heading": "3 Basic Algorithms Using the Model", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will be able to retaliate, \"he said in an interview with the\" Welt am Sonntag. \""}, {"heading": "4 Example Analysis: NSF Grants", "text": "This year it has come to the point where it is able to retaliate, \"he said in an interview with the\" Welt am Sonntag. \""}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We have presented a two-part graph model for making comparisons between large groups of documents and demonstrated how basic algorithms that use the model can identify trends and anomalies between document groups. As an example analysis, we have shown how our model can be used to better characterize and evaluate NSF research programs. In future work, we plan to apply alternative comparison criteria in our model, such as those derived from so-called entity recognition and paraphrase recognition."}], "references": [{"title": "Simrank++: Query Rewriting Through Link Analysis of the Click Graph", "author": ["Hector G.
