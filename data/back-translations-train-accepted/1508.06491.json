These include: pragmatics How do we respond to errors in the premise and choose from possible interpretations of an instruction that is unique only by context? The mechanism provided by the sequence prediction architecture we have described provides a simple answer to this question, and our experimental results show that the learned pragmatics support the interpretation of instructions in a number of concrete ways: ambiguous references are solved by proximity in the map-reading task, missing steps are derived from an environmental model in the Maze navigation task, and vague hints are solved by knowledge of the rules in Crossblock."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank S.R.K.
