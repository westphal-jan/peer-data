We show that the discourse analyses produced by Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) parsers can improve document-level sentiment analysis, via composition of local information up the discourse tree. First, we show that reweighting discourse units according to their position in a dependency representation of the rhetorical structure can yield substantial improvements on lexicon-based sentiment analysis.

Discourse relationships can comprise a nucleus and a satellite, or they can be multinuclear. In the example in Figure 1, Unit 1C is the satellite of a relationship with its nucleus 1B; together they form a larger discourse unit involved in a multinuclear CONJUNCTION relationship. The nuclear structure of the RST trees suggests a natural approach to evaluating the meaning of text segments: satellites tend to be less important, and nuclei tend to be more important (Marcu, 1999). This idea has been extensively used in the summary of documents (Gerani et al., 2014; Uze da et al., 2010; Yoshida et al.)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Sentiment analysis", "text": "There is a large literature on sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012), with particular interest in determining the general sentiment polarity (positive or negative) of a document. Bagof word models are widely used for this task, as they provide accuracy that is often very competitive with more complex approaches. Given the marked data, supervised learning can be applied to obtain sentiment weights for each word. However, the effectiveness of supervised sentiment analysis depends on having training data in the same range as the target, and this is not always possible. Moreover, in social science applications, the desired labels cannot directly correspond to positive or negative mood, but can focus on other categories, such as courtesy (Danescu-NiculescuMizil et al., 2013), narrative frames (Jurafsky et al., 2014) or a multidimensional spectrum of emotions (Kim et al., 2012)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Datasets", "text": "The first data set consists of 2000 film reviews compiled by Pang and Lee (2004).

(2013), with a predefined 50 / 50 split into training and test kits. The documents are rated on a scale of 1-10 and we treat the values \u2264 4 as negative, \u2265 7 as positive and ignore the values of 5-6 as neutral - although in principle nothing prevents the expansion of our approaches to more than two sentiment classes."}, {"heading": "3 Discourse depth reweighting", "text": "Our first approach to incorporating discourse information into sentiment analysis is based on quantifying the meaning of each unit of text in terms of its depth of discourse, using the Dependency-based Discourse Tree (DEPDT) formulation from previous summary work (Hirao et al., 2013).DEP-DT formalism converts the constituent-like discourse tree into a directional graph of elementary discourse units (EDUs), in a process that provides a close analogy to the transformation of a syntactic constituent word into a syntactic dependency graph (Ku \u00bc bler et al., 2009).The DEP-DT representation of the discourse in Figure 1 is shown in Figure 2.
