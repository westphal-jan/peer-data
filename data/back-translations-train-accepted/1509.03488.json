Modality is \"the category of meaning used to talk about possibilities and necessities\" (Hacquard, 2011). Typically, different types of modality are distinguished: on the one hand, there are verbs that denote epistemic modality, i.e. possibilities and necessities in the face of what is known, based on what is available evidence. Epistemic modality is related to factual AOs (e.g. discover, recognize); on the other hand, there are verbs that denote different types of non-epistemic modality and thus reflect the non-factuality of AO. The following types of non-epistemic modality are relevant in our work: doxastic modality that expresses the beliefs of subjects (e.g. accept, fear); deontic modality that expresses permissions and obligations (e.g. allow, order); modality that expresses intentions (e.g.)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Syntactic reflections of verb meaning", "text": "Semantic verb classifications based on lexical-syntactic properties of verbs are particularly appealing because they can be automatically recovered in corpora on the basis of syntactic characteristics. Levin's classification (Levin, 1993) is the most well-known verb classification, which is based on the agreement between verb syntax and verb meaning. Verbs that share common syntactic argumentation patterns also have certain meaning components in common, so they can be grouped into a semantic verb class. Verbs that participate in dative alteration1, for example, can be grouped into an alternative class of verbs that share certain meaning components. Recent work on verb semantics provides additional evidence for this agreement of verb syntax and meaning: (Hartshorne et al., 2014) report that the syntactic behavior of some verbs can be predicted by their meaning. VerbNet is a far-reaching verb-organized lexicon style based on the verb synchronication in classes."}, {"heading": "2.3 Related work on modality in NLP", "text": "Previous work in the NLP on the automatic (and manual) annotation of modality has often tailored the concept of modality to specific applications. (Szarvas et al., 2012) introduce a taxonomy of different types of modality that express uncertainty, such as deontic, bouletic, skill-related modality, and use it to detect uncertainty in a context of information extraction. To determine the degree of factuality of a given text, they also use verbs. (Saur\u0131 \u0301 and Pustejovsky, 2012) use discrete values in a modality continuum that ranges from uncertain to absolute certainty to determine the factuality of the events mentioned in the text. To determine the degree of factuality of a given text, they use classes of implicity2, factive3, and perceptual verbs.

The research hypotheses underlying our method can be summarized as follows: \u2022 There are similarities between verb syntax and meaning: certain syntactical variations correspond to certain meaning components (Levin, 2015a). \u2022 The similarities between verb syntax and the meaning described for English also apply to a large extent to German, since English and German are related languages (Levin, 2015b)."}, {"heading": "3.1 German subcategorization lexicon", "text": "These verbs are a subset of a subcategory dictionary (i.e. pairs of lemmas and subcategories) automatically extracted from large newspaper corporas. There are 244 distinct subcategories; each verb lemmas has an average of 1.9 subcategories.

The key insight underlying the assignment between syntactic signatures and semantic properties (as dictated by linguistic insights) is to break down all syntactic signatures corresponding to any of the semantic properties considered into a single signature containing non-specific slots. For example, the signature \"1100\" for forward-looking verbs expresses (i) the ability of these verbs to take a fact clause or a to-infinitive in the present, and (ii) the inability to take a to-infinitive in the past and a Wh clause in the past; while for the whether / if clause and the dependent declaration clause, the signature in the present remains specified and may not indicate or indicate that it is typical of the argument."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation based on sense linking", "text": "Our intrinsic evaluation of the inferred classification examines its semantic properties by exploiting links between lexical-semantic resources at the literal level. Key intuition is that existing semantic classifications in lexical resources can be used for a fine-grained semantic characterization of a given classification, thereby illuminating its semantic properties from different angles. To evaluate the inferred verb classification, we use the UBY framework (Gurevych et al., 2012) 6, which provides tools for generating and accessing lexical resources that are linked at the literal level and comply with the ISO standard Lexical Markup Framework (LMF). Figure 1 provides an overview of the UBY resources and sensual links between them that we used for our evaluation. To gain insights into various semantic aspects, we associate a subcategorization of UBY resources with English-BY resources."}, {"heading": "4.1 Approach", "text": "Our linking approach is based on the following research hypothesis: Two reflections with equivalent lemmas are equivalent if they have similar subcategoriza-6http: / / www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de / uby / tion frames.

Our implementation uses the standardized format for subcategorization frames in UBY (Eckle-Kohler and Gurevych, 2012), which models subcategorization frames on a fine-grained level of individual syntactical arguments and presents them uniformly (as far as this is possible) in Germany and English."}, {"heading": "4.2 Cross-lingual sense linking", "text": "The cross-language linking of our verb classes with the English VerbNet consists of two steps: First, the manual translation of the AO-compatible verb senses into English seemed possible, and second, the automatic linking of the translated English verbs with the VerbNet. The first step, the translation into English, initially seemed possible on the basis of UBY: UBY offers a transitive linking of GermaNet and VerbNet via the Interlingual Index of EuroWordNet (ILI) and the WordNet - VerbNet mapping in VerbNet. However, many of the translations contained in ILI were not available in VerbNet. Therefore, the main author of this work, a German native speaker with a good knowledge of English, translated the AOcompatible verb senses manually with Linguee7 and dictionaries."}, {"heading": "4.3 Algorithm", "text": "Table 3 shows the algorithm used for sensual linkage.

VerbNet requires that the syntactic categories of arguments (for clauses) agree or be identical (for all other arguments).In order to connect to GermaNet, the complementator of clauses and the case of noun phrases arguments must additionally match. According to a manual evaluation, the automatic verb sense linking results in an accuracy of 89.95% for linking to GermaNet, and 87.54% for linking to Net phrase long."}, {"heading": "4.4 Semantic characterization", "text": "The connection with the semantic fields of GermaNet shows that most verbs in the classification are either cognitive or communicative verbs; fewer verbs belong to the semantic fields of social, emotion, change and perception. This reflects observations from literature that mental attitude and verbs of action are closely linked because language is essentially an expression of thinking (Vendler, 1972). Attitude verbs also point to many similarities with modals (Hacquard, 2011): they can have epistemic or non-epistemic interpretations (knowing, believing), also bouletics (e.g. wanting, wishing) or deontic (commands such as order) interpretations. The link with VerbNet and FrameNet is summarized in Table 5. The outstanding target classes of VerbNet and FrameNet reveal meaning components that are unique for individual classes on the one hand and for common action groups on the other."}, {"heading": "4.5 Discussion", "text": "The evaluation method we presented is based on linking the derived classes with existing lexical-semantic classifications at the level of the sense of words. We developed an approach to sensual linkage based on the subcategorization framework similarity. While this is a highly precise approach, this kind of linkage is rather loss-prone, only linking 46% of verbs to GermaNet, 42% to VerbNet and 20% to FrameNet. Since we are not interested in individual contexts of meaning, but in aggregating contexts of meaning from whole classes, this kind of precise linkage fits perfectly with the purpose of semantic characterization of derived verb classes, as long as the classes are considered large. The evaluation shows that in addition to the modal meanings expressed by the classes (which are derived from linguistic findings), there are other semantic aspects to consider, such as the prevalence of classes."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "From a large syntactical classification of the German AO, which selects verbs in a replicable manner, we have derived semantic classes by applying linguistic insights into correspondences between verbal syntax and meaning.
