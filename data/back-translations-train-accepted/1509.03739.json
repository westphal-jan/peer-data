Negative training data is often generated using a closed world assumption: pairs of units that are not listed in the Knowledge Base are assumed to be unrelated and sentences that they consider negative training examples. However, this assumption is violated if the Knowledge Base is incomplete, which can lead to sentences that contain cases of relationships being wrongly commented as negative examples. We propose a method to improve the quality of data that is remotely monitored by identifying possible wrongly commented negative cases.Our proposed procedure includes a version of the Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) (Lao and Cohen, 2010; Lao et al., 2011), which improves relationship paths by combining random walks through a Knowledge Base. We use this knowledge conclusion to automatically detect possible false negatives (or at least closely related pairs) that can improve their performance relationship."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Remote monitoring is often used to train relation extraction systems, with Freebase and Wikipedia often being used as knowledge bases, e.g. (Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2010; Krause et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013; Min et al., 2013; Ritter et al., 2013) The main advantage is the ability to automatically generate large amounts of training data. On the other hand, these automatically labeled data are noisy and generally produce lower performance than approaches trained on manually labeled data. To solve this problem, a number of filtering approaches have been applied, including multi-class SVM (Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011) and multi-instance learning methods (Riedel et al., 2010; Surdeanu et al., 2012). These approaches take into account the fact that entities can occur in different relationships at the same time and do not necessarily express the target relationship. Other approaches focus directly on the noise in the data."}, {"heading": "3 Data and Methods", "text": "As this has proven to be an important issue within these documents (Jensen et al., 2006; Hahn et al., 2012; Cohen and Hunter, 2013; Roller and Stevenson, 2014), we have decided to apply our approach to relationship extraction tasks in the biomedical field. Furthermore, the most widely used source of knowledge in this field, the UMLS Metathesaurus (Bodenreider, 2004), is an ideal resource for the application of inference learning due to its rich structure. We develop classifiers to identify correlations found in two subgroups of UMLS: the National Drug File-Reference Terminology (ND-FRT) and the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCI). A corpus of approximately 1,000,000 publications is used to compile the distantly monitored training data, containing abstracts published between 1990 and 2001 using UMLS concepts using Metason (Lang, Aronson, 2010)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Distantly labelled data", "text": "From this sentence, a set of negative instance pairs is then generated by creating new combinations that do not occur within the positive instance pairs. Sentences that contain a positive or negative instance pair are then extracted to generate positive and negative training examples for the relationship. These candidate sets are then contained (Porter, 1997) and tagged PoS (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).The sets of positive and negative training examples are then filtered to remove sentences that meet one of the following criteria: contain more than once the same positive pair; contain both a positive and a negative pair; contain more than 5 words between the two elements of the instance pair; contain very frequent instance pairs."}, {"heading": "3.2 PRA-Reduction", "text": "PRA (Lao and Cohen, 2010; Lao et al., 2011) is an algorithm that derives new relationship instances from knowledge bases. By viewing a knowledge base as a graph in which nodes are connected by typed relationships, it performs a random walksover and finds relationship paths of limited length that connect graph nodes. These paths are used as traits in a logistic regression model aimed at predicting new relationships in the graph. Although originally designed as an algorithm to detect new links in the knowledge base, PRA can also be used to learn relevant relationship paths for each given relationship. For example, if x and y are connected via sibling relationships, the PRA-trained model would learn that the parent relationship path (a, y) 1 is highly relevant, since siblings share the same parents who share the same relationship."}, {"heading": "3.3 Evaluation", "text": "In fact, the majority of people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to move, to fight, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move"}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Held-out data", "text": "Table 2 shows the results obtained with the help of the Heldout data. Overall results, averaged over all relationships with maximum recall, are shown in the upper part of the table and indicate that the application of the PRA improves performance. Although the highest precision is achieved with the unfiltered classifier, the PRA-reduced classifier leads to the best recall and F1. The performance of the randomized reduced classifier indicates that the improvement is not simply due to a change in bias in the data, but that the examples contained therein lead to an improved model. However, the lower part of Table 2 shows results for each relationship. The PRA-reduced classifier produces the best results for the majority of relationships and always increases the recall compared to unfiltered. It is perhaps surprising that the removal of false negatives from the training data leads to an increase in the recall rather than to precision. False negatives lead to the negative relationship being said to a more negative classifier generating the positive examples."}, {"heading": "4.2 Manually labelled", "text": "The best overall performance is again achieved using the PRA-reduced classifier. Random-reduced classifier performance is also better than that of the unfiltered classifier, with the overall improvement largely resulting from increased memory, but below PRA reduction. These results confirm that removing examples identified by PRA improves the quality of training data. Further analysis showed that the PRA-reduced classifier produces the fewest false negatives in its predictions of the manually annotated dataset. 82 entity pairs (45 May Treatment, 37 May Prevention) are incorrectly described as negative, while Unfiltered 120 (73, 47) and Random-reduced 114 (69, 45) predict."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "This paper proposes a novel approach to the identification of mislabeled cases generated by remote monitoring, using a method of inference to identify and discard possible false negatives from the training data. We show that our method improves performance for a number of relationships in the biomedical field by using information from UMLS. In the future, we would like to explore alternative methods of selecting PRA relation pathways to identify false negatives, we would also like to examine PRA-reduced data more closely, we would like to find out what kind of entity pairs are detected by our proposed method, and whether the reduced data can also be used to augment the positive training data. We would also like to apply the approach to other areas and alternative knowledge bases. Finally, it would be interesting to compare our approach with other state-of-the-art remote monitoring relationship extraction systems or biased SVM approaches such as Liu et al.
