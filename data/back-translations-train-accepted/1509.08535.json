This unsupervised data-analysis approach is desirable due to its interpretability, but hard to perform due its NP-hardness. A closely related problem is low-rank Boolean matrix completion from noisy observations. We treat these problems as maximum a posteriori inference problems, and present message passing solutions that scale linearly with the number of observations and factors. Our empirical study demonstrates that message passing is able to recover low-rank Boolean matrices, in the boundaries of theoretically possible recovery and outperform existing techniques in real-world applications, such as large-scale binary valued collaborative filtering tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Sep 2015 23:11:16 GMT  (2232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08535v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 9 Oct 2015 19:27:13 GMT  (2232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08535v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 4 Feb 2016 21:05:32 GMT  (7229kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08535v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.ST cs.AI cs.DM stat.ML stat.TH", "authors": ["siamak ravanbakhsh", "barnab\u00e1s p\u00f3czos", "russell greiner"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.08535"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.08535.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Boolean Matrix Factorization and Completion via Message Passing", "authors": ["Siamak Ravanbakhsh", "Russell Greiner"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, the number of ageing and ageing people has multiplied compared to previous years: the number of ageing people who are in a position to take revenge is many times higher than the number of ageing people who are in a position to take revenge."}, {"heading": "A.

This unsupervised data-analysis approach is desirable due to its interpretability, but hard to perform due its NP-hardness. A closely related problem is low-rank Boolean matrix completion from noisy observations. We treat these problems as maximum a posteriori inference problems, and present message passing solutions that scale linearly with the number of observations and factors. Our empirical study demonstrates that message passing is able to recover low-rank Boolean matrices, in the boundaries of theoretically possible recovery and outperform existing techniques in real-world applications, such as large-scale binary valued collaborative filtering tasks. A large body of problems in machine learning, communication theory and combinatorial optimization involve the product form Z = X Y where Z = {Zm,n},X = {Xm,k},Y = {Yk,n} where one or two components (out of three) are (partially) known and the task is to recover the unknown component(s). Here, operation corresponds to a type of matrix multiplication. A subset of these problems, which are most closely related to Boolean matrix factorization and matrix completion, can be expressed over the Boolean domain \u2013 i.e., Zm,n, Xm,k, Yk,n \u2208 {false, true} \u223c= {0, 1}.
