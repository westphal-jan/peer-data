Recently, it has been shown that pruning algorithms for these models cuts a large portion of the edges of the graphs, with minimal damage to the resulting parse trees. Therefore, solving the inference problem in runtime complexity, which is determined solely by the number of edges (m), is of obvious importance. We propose such an inference algorithm for first-order models, which encodes the problem as a minimal tree problem (MST) in an undirected graph. This allows us to use state-of-the-art undirected MST algorithms, whose runtime is expected and with a very high probability of O (m). A directed parse tree is then derived from the undirected MST problem and subsequently improved with respect to the directed parsing model, with both steps running in the first stage of the MST experiment."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most people in the world have no idea how to behave.

(These algorithms are based on substantially different approaches: one is deterministic and the other is randomized 6.6Both algorithms deal with a somewhat more general case in which the graph is not necessarily connected, in which case the minimal graph is calculated via forest (MSF). (In our case, in which the graph is connected, the MSF is reduced to an MST. The complexity of the first deterministic algorithm (Chazelle, 2000; Pettie and Ramachandran, 2002) isO (m \u00b7 \u03b1 (m, n)), in which the graph (m, n) is a natural inversion of the Ackermann function, whose value is lower than 5 for all practical values. Since this algorithm uses very complex data structures, we do not implement it in this paper."}, {"heading": "4 Undirected MST Inference for Dependency Parsing", "text": "There are several challenges in constructing an undirected tree, while dependence on a steered parser requires a steered parser that applies only to a steered parser that applies an unregulated MST algorithm. (We refer to a steered MST parser that applies a steered MST algorithm to a steered MST algorithm.) The first problem is that a steered MST parser requires non-steered encoding. Unlike steered MST parsers that explicitly convert the steered nature of the dependency into a directed input graph to which a steered MST algorithm is applied (McDonald et al, 2005b), an undirected MST parser must be incorporated into an undirected direction information. In this section, we will consider two solutions to this problem. The second problem is that the output of an undirected MST algorithm is an undirected algorithm."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments and Results", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "We present a first-order graph-based dependency analysis model that runs in linear edge time with very high probability. In extensive multilingual experiments, our model behaves very similar to a standard firstorder parser. Furthermore, our results show the complementary nature of the models, with our model outperforming its direct counterpart by an average of 22.2% of the test sets. Beyond its practical implications, our work provides a novel intellectual contribution to demonstrating the power of undirected graph-based methods in solving an NLP problem that is directed in nature. We believe that this contribution has the potential to influence future research on additional NLP problems. The potential embodied in this work extends to a number of promising research directions: \u2022 Our algorithm can be used for efficient MST calculations in k-best trees."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The second author was supported in part by a grant from the GIF Young Scientists' Program No. I-2388407.6 / 2015 - Syntactic Parsing in Context."}], "references": [{"title": "Conll-x shared task on multilingual dependency parsing", "author": ["Buchholz", "Marsi2006] Sabine Buchholz", "Erwin Marsi"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning,", "citeRegEx": "Buchholz et al\\.,? \\Q2006\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Buchholz et al\\.", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Experiments with a higher-order projective dependency parser", "author": ["Xavier Carreras"], "venue": "In Proc. of CoNLL", "citeRegEx": "Carreras.,? \\Q2007\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Carreras.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "A minimum spanning tree algorithm with inverse-ackermann type complexity", "author": ["Bernard Chazelle"], "venue": "J.
