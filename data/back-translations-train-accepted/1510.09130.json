A recent line of research in machine learning has explored the idea of incorporating constraints into Bayesian models that are difficult to cooperate in standard distributions. These methods, which include post distributions, tend to be very different from good models of individuals. As another example, in social network analysis, simple models such as the preferred access model [3] can replicate aggregated network statistics such as grade distributions, while predicting whether two individuals have a connection, a social networking site could well use a classifier with many traits of each person's prehistory. Of course, each model of an individual implies a model of the population, but models whose goal is to model model individuals tend to be necessarily more detailed. These two types of modeling represent different types of information, so naturally they want to combine it with each other."}, {"heading": "2 The Bayesian melding approach", "text": "We briefly describe the Bayesian merger approach to integrate earlier information into deterministic simulation models [21], which has been widely used (1, 6, 23]. In the Bayesian modeling context, we refer to Y as the observational data and assume that the model contains unknown variables S, which could include model parameters and latent variables. We are then interested in the posteriorptic simulation function f (\u00b7), which contains p (Y) \u2212 1p (Y) pS (S). (1) However, in some situations, the variables S can be related to a new random variable, which works by means of a deterministic simulation function f (\u00b7) so that p (S) is designated so that there are input and output variables. For example, in the energy distribution problem, the total energy consumption variable T = 1 S T = 1 S T t, where S is the state variables of a hidden state model Markov One-Encoding (each of the VS and the average energy consumption)."}, {"heading": "3 The latent Bayesian melding approach", "text": "It is customary for the variable distribution to be modelled by a latent variable, see the examples in Section 5.2. Thus, we could assume that we have a conditional distribution p (\u03c4) and a previous distribution p. This defines a marginal distribution p (\u03c4) (\u0432) (\u0432). This could be used to produce a previous (2) of the Bayesian distribution p (3). We could apply the Monte Carlo method to approximate it for a fixed distribution. However, we are also interested in the latent variable distribution, which is relevant for the example of energy distribution."}, {"heading": "4 Related methods", "text": "We are now discussing possible links between Bayesian merger (BM) and other related methods. Recently, machine learning has proposed methods that allow constant (or posterior) regulation (PR) [9], measurement learning [16] and the general expectation criterion [18]. These methods share the common idea that Bayesian models (or posterior distributions) are limited by some observations or measurements to obtain a least distorted distribution, the idea being that the system we model is too complex and unobservable, and that we therefore have limited prior information. To alleviate this problem, we assume that we can obtain some observations of the system in some way, e.g. through experiments, these observations could be the averages of the functions of the variables, and these observations could then guide the modeling of the system."}, {"heading": "5 The energy disaggregation problem", "text": "In the energy breakdown, we get a time series of energy consumption values from a sensor. We consider the energy measured in watt-hours to be read from a household's electricity meter, which is denoted by Y = (Y1, Y2, \u00b7 \u00b7, YT), with Yt-R +. The recorded energy signal Y is assumed to be the aggregation of the consumption of individual household appliances. Suppose there are I-appliances, and the energy consumption of each appliance is denoted by Xi = (Xi1, Xi2, \u00b7 \u00b7, XiT), with Xit-R +. The observed total signal is the sum of the component signals, so that Yt-I = 1Xit + t-N (0, \u03c32) is given. Given Y, the task is to extract the unknown component signals Xi. This is essentially the single-channel BSS problem, for which there is no clear solution. \u2212 It may also be useful to define an additional component U = (U1, U2 \u00b7) as a natural UT model."}, {"heading": "5.1 The additive factorial hidden Markov model", "text": "In AFHMM, each component signal Xi is represented by an HMM. We assume that there are Ki states for each Xit, and thus the state variable is marked by Zit states (k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7, Ki) in which p states (k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7, Ki) are marked, in which p states (i) \u2212 states (p) are marked, in which p states (i) are marked, and the mean values are \u00b5i = {1, \u00b52,,,, \u00b5Ki} in such a way that Xit states (i) are marked, and the transition probabilities are P (i) = (p (i) jk = P (Zit = j)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Population modelling of summary statistics", "text": "In the energy aggregation, it is useful to provide a summary of the energy consumption for users that can be captured by these consumption data. For example, it would be useful to show the total energy they have consumed for their appliances in a single day, the duration in which each appliance has been in use, and the number of times they have used these appliances. As there is already data on the typical use of different appliances, we assume that we have measured some time series from different houses for many days, because we can collect them from public data sets, such as the data verified in [4]. We can then empirically obtain the distributions of these statistics."}, {"heading": "6 The latent Bayesian melding approach to energy disaggregation", "text": "We have shown that the summarizing statistics \u03c4 as a deterministic function of the state variables of HMMs S = \"fix\" = \"fix\" (\"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \"\" fix \"(\" fix \"=\" fix \"=\" fix \") (\" fix \"=\" fix \"=\" fix \"=\" fix \"=\" fix \"=\" fix \"=\" \"fix\" = \"fix\" = \":\" \"\" \"\") p (\"): (\": \"),\" \": (\": \":\"), \": (\": \"),\": (\":\"), \": (\": \"),\": (\"): (\"), \": (\"): (\":\"), \": (\"): (\"),\": (\"): (\"): (\"): (\"): \":\": \":\": \")."}, {"heading": "7 Experimental results", "text": "In this section we apply the proposed model to the disaggregation problem.

A more realistic situation is to train the model in one dataset, and apply the model to another dataset, because it is unrealistic to get the application level data from every household on which the system is used. In this section, we use the HES data to train the model parameters of the AFHMM, and model the distribution of the summary statistics. We apply the models to the UK-DALE dataset, which was also collected by UK households to make the predictions. There are five houses in UK-DALE, and all of them have network measurements and the individual device measurements. All network measurements were all evaluated in the 6 seconds and some of them were provided at a higher rate."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions", "text": "We have proposed a latent Bayesian merger approach to integrate population information with latent variables into individual models and applied the approach to energy breakdown problems; the new approach was evaluated by applying it to two real electricity datasets; the latent Bayesian merger approach was compared to the posterior regulation approach (a case of the Bayesian merger approach) and AFHMM. Both the LBM and PR exhibit significantly lower errors than the baseline method; LBM improves over PR in predicting the duration and number of cycles; both methods were similar in NDE and the SAE errors."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK (grant numbers EP / K002732 / 1 and EP / M008223 / 1)."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2015, "abstractText": "In many statistical problems, a more coarse-grained model may be suitable for<lb>population-level behaviour, whereas a more detailed model is appropriate for ac-<lb>curate modelling of individual behaviour.
