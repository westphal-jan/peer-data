We support our analytical results through an exhaustive set of experiments on both synthetic and real data. Introduction Random sampling is an effective way for researchers to learn about a population of interest. Characteristics of the sample can be generalized to the population of interest using standard statistical theory. However, traditional random sampling may be impossible when the target population is hidden, e.g. drug users, men who have sex with men, sex workers and homeless people. Due to concerns like privacy, stigmatization, discrimination, and criminalization, members of hidden populations may be reluctant to participate in a survey. In addition to the hidden populations for which no sampling \u201cframe\u201d exists, there are rare populations of great research interest, marked by their tiny fractions in the entire population. It is unlikely that random sampling from the general population would accrue a reasonable sample from a very rare population. However, it is often the case that members of hidden or rare populations know each other socially. This suggests that social referral would be an effective method for accruing a large sample. To this end, researchers have developed a variety of social link-tracing survey designs. The most popular is respondent-driven sampling (RDS) (Heckathorn 1997). In RDS, a small set of initial subjects, known as \u201cseeds\u201d are selected, not necessarily simultaneously, from the target population. Subjects are given a few coupons, each tagged with a unique identifier, which they can use to recruit other eligible subjects. Participants are given a reward for being interviewed and for each eligible subject they recruit using their coupons. Each subject reports their degree, the number of others whom they know in the target population. No subject is permitted to enter the study twice and the date and time of each interview is recorded. While RDS can be an effective recruitment method, it reveals only incomplete social network data to researchers. Any ties between recruited subjects along which no recruitment took place remain unobserved. The social network of recruited subjects is of great interest to sociologists, epidemiologists and public health researchers since it may induce dependencies in the outcomes of sampled individuals. Fortunately, RDS reveals information about the underlying social network that can be used to (approximately) reconstruct it. By leveraging the time series of recruitments, the degrees of recruited subjects, coupon information, and who recruited whom, it is possible to interpret the induced subgraph of RDS respondents as a simple random graph model (Crawford 2016). In this paper, we introduce a flexible and expressive stochastic model of RDS recruitment on a partially observed network structure. We derive the likelihood of the observed time series; the model admits any edgewise inter-recruitment time distribution. We propose a stochastic optimization algorithm RENDER (REspoNdent-Driven nEtwork Reconstruction) to estimate unknown parameters and the underlying social network. We conduct extensive experiments, on synthetic and real data, to confirm the accuracy and the reconstruction performance of RENDER. In particular, we apply RENDER to reconstruct the network of injection drug users from an RDS study in St. Petersburg, Russia. Related Work RDS has been modeled as a random walk with replacement on a graph at its equilibrium distribution (Heckathorn 1997; Salganik and Heckathorn 2004; Volz and Heckathorn 2008; Goel and Salganik 2009; Gile and Handcock 2010), and under this argument the sampling probability is proportional to degree, which is the basis for an estimator of the populaar X iv :1 51 1. 04 13 7v 2 [ cs .S I] 2 D ec 2 01 5 tion mean (Heckathorn 2002; Salganik 2006). In this paper, we adopt an approach that focuses on the network structure estimable from the RDS sample using recruitment information (Crawford 2016). Crawford (2016) assumes that edgewise inter-recruitment times follow the exponential distribution, but this approach is relatively inflexible. In many other contexts, dynamic or random processes can reveal structural information of an underlying, partially observed, network (Kramer et al. 2009; Shandilya and Timme 2011; Linderman and Adams 2014). Network reconstruction and the edge prediction problem have been studied for diffusion processes where multiple realizations of the process on the same network are available (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg 2007; Gomez Rodriguez, Leskovec, and Krause 2010; Gomez Rodriguez et al. 2011). In the case of RDS, reconstruction is particularly challenging because only a single realization of the diffusion process is observed. Furthermore, we must account for the role of coupons in recruitment as they intricately introduce bias. However, in contrast to general diffusion processes over graphs, some important network topological information is revealed by RDS. In this study, we leverage all the available data routinely collected during real-world RDS studies.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
