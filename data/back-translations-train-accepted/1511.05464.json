Whereas distributed estimation of sample mean statistics has been the subject of a good deal of attention, computation of $U$-statistics, relying on more expensive averaging over pairs of observations, is a less investigated area. Yet, such data functionals are essential to describe global properties of a statistical population, with important examples including Area Under the Curve, empirical variance, Gini mean difference and within-cluster point scatter. This paper proposes new synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms which simultaneously propagate data across the network and maintain local estimates of the $U$-statistic of interest. We establish convergence rate bounds of $O(1/t)$ and $O(\\log t / t)$ for the synchronous and asynchronous cases respectively, where $t$ is the number of iterations, with explicit data and network dependent terms. Beyond favorable comparisons in terms of rate analysis, numerical experiments provide empirical evidence the proposed algorithms surpasses the previously introduced approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 16:49:52 GMT  (341kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05464v1", "to be presented at NIPS 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "to be presented at NIPS 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.DC cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["igor colin", "aur\u00e9lien bellet", "joseph salmon", "st\u00e9phan cl\u00e9men\u00e7on"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.05464"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.05464.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Extending Gossip Algorithms to Distributed Estimation of U -Statistics", "authors": ["Igor Colin", "Aur\u00e9lien Bellet"], "emails": ["first.last@telecom-paristech.fr", "aurelien.bellet@inria.fr", "first.last@telecom-paristech.fr", "first.last@telecom-paristech.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Decentralisation and isolation are two essential factors that are reflected in the current situation: firstly, that it is a global problem, and secondly, that it is a global problem, in which it is a global and global problem; secondly, that it is a global problem, and thirdly, that it is a global and global problem."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Definitions and Notations", "text": "For each integer p > 0 we denote with [p] the set {1,.., p} and with | F | the cardinality of each finite set F.

"abstractText": "Efficient and robust algorithms for decentralized estimation in networks are essential to many distributed systems. Whereas distributed estimation of sample mean statistics has been the subject of a good deal of attention, computation of U statistics, relying on more expensive averaging over pairs of observations, is a less investigated area. Yet, such data functionals are essential to describe global properties of a statistical population, with important examples including Area Under the Curve, empirical variance, Gini mean difference and within-cluster point scatter. This paper proposes new synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms which simultaneously propagate data across the network and maintain local estimates of the U -statistic of interest. We establish convergence rate bounds of O(1/t) and O(log t/t) for the synchronous and asynchronous cases respectively, where t is the number of iterations, with explicit data and network dependent terms. Beyond favorable comparisons in terms of rate analysis, numerical experiments provide empirical evidence the proposed algorithms surpasses the previously introduced approach.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
