Specifically, many of the best-known community recognition algorithms seek to maximize modularity that compares the density of edges within communities with the density of edges between communities (Newman, 2006)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Community Detection Algorithms", "text": "Fast-Greedy Fast-Greedy is a hierarchical approach that recognizes communities in a bottom-up way (Clauset et al., 2004). First, each node belongs to a separate community, and communities are merged iteratively so that each merge is locally optimal. Specifically, in each iteration, the algorithm scans over each edge that connects two separate communities in the current configuration, and calculates the increase in the current value of modularity by merging the two communities."}, {"heading": "2.2 Linguistic Modularity in Social Network Communities", "text": "After focusing on the recognition of communities as a summary of social network structures, we refine this hypothesis to linguistic modularity: the linguistic similarity should be higher for pairs of individuals in the same community than for pairs of individuals in different communities. To formalize linguistic modularity, we follow the traditional definition of modularity in social networks. Suppose we get a social network G on which we induce a communal structure C = {ci}. We now create an alternative network G (L) that represents linguistic similarity. InG (L) each node has an advantage over the K that is most linguistically similar, with linguistic similarity measured by TF-IDF weighted cosmic similarity."}, {"heading": "3 Testing Linguistic Modularity", "text": "We evaluate the linguistic modularity of FastGreedy and multi-level community detection algorithms in a social network constructed from the SemEval Twitter Sentiment Analysis Review. Specifically, we start with the users in the SemEval data sets and then use the Twitter API to search their friend links as undirected edges (in Twitter terminology, the \"friends\" of an individual are accounts that the individual follows).The statistics of this network are shown in the first row of Table 1. As shown, the average degree for each node is less than three, and more than 25% of the authors are isolated, meaning that they have no social network connections. For these users, the social network cannot provide any useful information.One approach to increase the density of the social network would be to crawl additional nodes through snowball sampling (Goodman, 1961): specifically, we would expand the group of nodes to include all friends of the original network in the eval."}, {"heading": "3.1 Quantifying linguistic modularity", "text": "We measure the linguistic modularity as described in subsection 2.2 on the SEMEVAL and SEMEVAL + networks, using the Fast-Greedy and Multi-Level Community Recognition algorithms. Linguistic information was calculated from each author's most recent 3,200 tweets, and the G (L) linguistic network was constructed by building edges to the five closest neighbors. We merge all communities with fewer than ten users into a single community, which consists largely of isolates, and the number of communities is automatically selected in all cases by the algorithm. Results are presented in Table 2. All results are significantly higher than zero using a bootstrap resampling test, p 0.001, suggesting that the hypothesis of linguistic modularity applies to this data and to both community recognition algorithms. Linguistic modularity is significantly higher than modularity for SEMEVAL +, which indicates that the quality of the user's additional point of a creep is valid."}, {"heading": "4 Community-specific Word Embeddings", "text": "In this section, we propose to use social network community structures to improve NLP tasks. We build on the successful non-linear Subspace Embedding (NLSE) model, which learns a task-specific projection matrix to apply to upstream word embedding (Astudillo et al., 2015), hj = sigmoid (Swj), (2) where wj-Rd is an upstream word embedding for word j, and S-Rk \u00d7 d is the task-specific projection structure, with d and k indicating the size of upstream and projected word embedding. The advantage of this approach is that the upstream word embedding can be learned from large amounts of unlabeled text, while supervised training is only necessary to learn the s-d-matrix-S and the final classification weights."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "We test the usefulness of community-specific projections based on 52 tweets that we learned with the help of simulation programs. We evaluate whether a given message is of positive, negative or neutral mood. Following Astudillo et al. (2015), we train and optimize our system only with the development data that contain the SemEval Twitter 2013 training data, and evaluate on the SemEval Twitter test sets. Statistics of these datasets are shown in Table 3. The datasets used in this work originate from (Astudillo et al., 2015), which consist of whole tweets of the original test sets, but only a subset of development tests tweets. In addition, we fail to identify the authors of approximately 11.4% of the tweets in the datasets, as the tweets were not available when we began to crawl social relations with crawl.

We simply calculate the Euclidean distance between the community-specific embedding hi, j and the embedding obtained from the common projection h0, j = sigmoid (S (0) wj). The ten words with the highest Euclidean distances corresponding to each community are shown in Table 5. We exclude the particular community, which was summarized from small communities and a community with only 62 tweets in the training data. Interestingly, the measurement helps to identify many community-specific sentiment words, which are mostly associated with positive sentiment for communities 1 and 3 and negative sentiment2We have obtained these divisions through communication with the authors."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "In fact, it is that it is a matter of a way in which people are able to determine for themselves how they have behaved.

By learning separate projections of word embeddings for each community, our approach is able to capture subtle shifts in meaning for individual words in social communities. We have formulated this model by building on preparatory work that learns task-specific projections of word embeddings; we go further by learning predictions that are both task-specific and community-specific. A key question for future work is whether the task and community dimensions can be decoupled: Can we learn a community-based projection that is useful for multiple tasks? To answer this question, basic truth annotations for multiple tasks for socially connected authors are needed. This could possibly be achieved by adding a layer of annotations on top of the eval form of Twitter data set, or by planning to include these social favorites in a very specific direction. \"This paper presents a new method of learning to overcome language variations by using the tendency of individuals with similar linguistic patterns to share social networking connections - the phenomenon of linguistic homophilia."}, {"heading": "8 Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Duen Horng \"Polo\" Chau for discussing community recognition and Ramon Astudillo for sharing data and helping to reproduce the NLSE results.
