The central idea of SMTApproxMC is to randomly partition the solution space of F into \"small\" cells of approximately the same size, using word-level hash functions of HSMT (n, C), where C is calculated step by step. The check for \"small\" -ness of cells is performed using a word-level SMT solver."}, {"heading": "6 Experimental Methodology and Results", "text": "To evaluate the performance and effectiveness of SMTApxMC, we have built a prototype implementation and conducted extensive experiments. Our set of benchmarks consisted of more than 150 problems arising from different areas such as circuit thinking, planning, program synthesis and the like. To save space, we only present the results for a subset of the benchmarks. For comparison, we refer to these algorithms such as the authors \"initials. Both models have a total time of 12 hours per benchmark, and a BoundedSMT timeout of 2400 seconds per call."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "Hashing-based model counting has emerged as a promising approach for probabilistic conclusions on graphical models. While real-world examples naturally have word-level constraints, modern approximate model counters effectively reduce the problem to propositional model counting due to the lack of non-bit-level hash functions. In this paper, we introduced HSMT, a word-level hash function, and used it to build SMTApproxMC, an approximate word-level model counter. Our experiments show that SMTApproxMC techniques are bit-level hashing. Our study also points to interesting directions for future work. For example, the adaptation of SMTApproxMC to SMT solution strategies and the augmentation of SMT solution strategies to efficiently establish hash functions used in counting are exciting clues for future work. Our work goes far beyond replacing other risk-based SMT counters with building blocks that may also be considered to be more efficient."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Daniel Kroening for sharing his valuable insights on SMT solvers during the early stages of this project and Amit Bhatia for comments on early drafts of the paper.
