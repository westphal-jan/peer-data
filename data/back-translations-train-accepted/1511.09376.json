Unlike previous work, which has focused on inferring character roles, we focus on the problem of modeling their relationships. Rather than assuming a fixed relationship for a character pair, we hypothesize that relationships are dynamic and temporally evolve with the progress of the narrative, and formulate the problem of relationship modeling as a structured prediction problem. We propose a semi-supervised framework to learn relationship sequences from fully as well as partially labeled data. We present a Markovian model capable of accumulating historical beliefs about the relationship and status changes. We use a set of rich linguistic and semantically motivated features that incorporate world knowledge to investigate the textual content of narrative. We empirically demonstrate that such a framework outperforms competitive baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 16:32:58 GMT  (232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09376v1", "9 pages, 1 figure.

Given the narrative text in the form of a sequence of sentences (in which the two interesting characters occur together), x = < x1, x2,.., xl >, we address the problem of segmentation into non-overlapping and semantically significant segments representing continuities in the relationship status. Each segment is labeled with a single relationship status rj {\u2212 1, + 1}, creating a relationship sequence r = < r1, r2,..., rk > k \u2264 l. Our approach uses a second-order latent variable model for segmentation embedded in a semi-monitored framework to utilize different levels of labeling in the data. We will now describe our segmentation model and the semi-monitored framework in detail."}, {"heading": "2.1 Segmentation Model", "text": "This model forms the core of our framework, assuming that each sentence in the sequence is associated with a latent Y pair representing its relationship status. As we perform this assignment, it analyzes the content of individual sentences using a rich set of characteristics, while simultaneously modelling the flow of information between states by treating the prediction task as a structured problem. We use a second-order Markov model that can recall a long history of the relationship between the two characters, and collectively maximizes the following linear values for individual sequences: Score = \u2211 i w\u03c6 (x, yi, yi \u2212 1, yi \u2212 2)] (1), where x is the input sequence and yi denotes the latent assignment of its ith sentence to a relationship segment. Individual yis collectively yields the relational sequence, r (by collapsing successive events of identical states)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Semi-supervised Framework", "text": "However, given the nature of the task, we acknowledge that obtaining a huge set of labeled sequences can be both time-consuming and expensive. On the other hand, it may be more convenient to obtain partially labeled data, especially in cases where only a subset of the sets of a sequence has an obvious kinship affiliation. Therefore, we propose a semi-supervised framework that can use partial monitoring for the formation of the segmentation model, which assumes that the training data set consists of two types of labeled sequences: fully labeled, in which the full state sequence is observed, yi."}, {"heading": "3 Feature Engineering", "text": "We first pre-processed the text of various novel summaries to obtain language building blocks and dependency savings, identify key characters, and group character names (\"Tom\", \"Tom Sawyer\", etc.) using the Book-nlp pipeline [3].

We extended its output with Korean conferences derived from the Stanford Core NLP system [20]. We also obtained a frame-semantic analysis of the text using Semafor [9].

We experimented with different models and report on the performance of logistical regression and the decision tree. We also compare our model with this baseline to test our hypothesis that the task of predicting the relationship sequence is a structured problem that benefits from the memory of the intra-novel history of the relationship between characters. We also compare our framework model, which uses a second-order Markovian segmentation model, with an3https: / / www.mturk.com / identical framework, which uses a similar segmentation model, albeit with the Markov assumption of the first order. This baseline is included to understand the importance of remembering a longer history of the relationship between characters. As a higher-order model can look back further, it will experience frequent changes within the relationship status."}, {"heading": "4.3 Evaluation on the primary dataset", "text": "Table 2 compares 10-fold cross-validation performance of our Semi-Supervised Framework (Order 2 Model) with its first-order counterpart (Order 1 Model) and two unstructured baselines: Decision Tree (J48) and Logistic Regression (LR). Since the performance of the semi-supervised framework depends on the random initialization of weights, the values given in the table are averages over 100 random restarts. The number of relationship states, | Y |, has been set to 2 to comply with the gold standard annotations, indicating that the framework performs marginally better with the first-order Markov model (higher average F measure and lower mean edit distance) than the unstructured models (LR and J48), indicating the need to model the flow of information between the sets of sequences. Further performance improvement with the second-order model, while demonstrating this longer history, also demonstrates the benefit of the hypothesis."}, {"heading": "4.4 Evaluation on the AMT dataset", "text": "Table 3 compares the performance of the different models on the AMT dataset with averaged precision, recall, and F measurements for the binary classification task of the change forecast. The problem, input sequence format, and training method for these models are the same as above. However, the models produce structured results (relationship sequences) that need to be converted into the binary output of the change forecast task. We do this simply by predicting the positive class (change occurred) if the resulting relationship sequence contained at least one change. We can see that the performance of the framework with the first order model is similar to that of the base model LR, but the second order model exhibits a significant improvement in performance. A closer look at the F measurements of the two classes (not reported due to space constraints) showed that performance on the positive class was similar for all models (with the exception of J48, which was lower), the performance on the negative class (no second change) was much higher for the structured models (however, for the 5th and 5th order models were much higher)."}, {"heading": "5 Literature Survey", "text": "The work presented in this paper is most closely related to character-centric methods in the field of computer-assisted narration. [2] presented two latent variable models for learning characters in film summaries, incorporating events affecting the characters. [3] In their subsequent work, they can automatically deduce character personalities in English novels. [27] Likewise, character roles extract from uncommented folklore figures based on their actions. Unlike our work, these approaches have not explicitly modelled the relationship between characters (although an end user can manually deduce the nature of the relationship between them based on the definitions of the types of people, if available). On the other hand, previous work also focused on the construction of social networks from text, although the interpretation of connections between people varies according to the objective. [12] Analyzed dialogue interactions between characters of British novels and series to construct their social networks and to test them through literary theories."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Discussion", "text": "In this work, we have addressed the problem of predicting dynamic relationships between character pairs in a narrative. We analyze summaries of novels to extract relationship histories that describe how the relationship has evolved. Our semi-supervised framework uses a structured segmentation model that Markov uses to recall the \"history\" of the characters, and analyzes the textual content of summaries using rich semantic characteristics that incorporate world knowledge. We demonstrate the utility of our model by comparing it to an unstructured model that treats individual sentences independently, and also to a lower-order model that remembers shorter history. Our experiments show that using a higher-order model helps make better predictions. In the future, we would like to experiment with models of higher order than 2 and also with semi-Markov models. Also, this work treats different character pairs from the same novel independently and does not attempt to understand the full text of the narrative (c)."}], "references": [{"title": "SINNET: social interaction network extractor from text", "author": ["A.

interpreting narratives. Unlike previous work, which has focused on inferring character roles, we focus on the problem of modeling their relationships. Rather than assuming a fixed relationship for a character pair, we hypothesize that relationships are dynamic and temporally evolve with the progress of the narrative, and formulate the problem of relationship modeling as a structured prediction problem. We propose a semisupervised framework to learn relationship sequences from fully as well as partially labeled data. We present a Markovian model capable of accumulating historical beliefs about the relationship and status changes. We use a set of rich linguistic and semantically motivated features that incorporate world knowledge to investigate the textual content of narrative. We empirically demonstrate that such a framework outperforms competitive baselines.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
