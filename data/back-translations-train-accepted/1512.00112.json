In this work we deal with the problem of deriving cooperative and contradictory relationships between people in the narratives. The identification of characteristics and conflicts is indispensable for a narrative understanding. They can guide the interpretation of narrative events and control the behavior of the readers."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "Existing research on the characterization of relationships between people has focused almost exclusively on dialogue or the data of social networks. Such methods have examined aspects of relationships such as power [5], formalities [19], and feelings [16] in conversations. Recently, [1] they examined the problem of analyzing film scripts for the extraction of social networks. However, the analysis of character relationships in narrative texts is largely limited to simplistic schemes based on the counting of sign coincidences in quoted conversations [12]. [2] We believe that this is the first attempt to derive relationship polarities in narrative texts. In terms of approach, our use of structural triads as characteristics is most closely related to [19] using an unsupervised common probabilistic model of text and structure to generate formality from address concepts in dialogue, and [20] analyzing signed triads in social networks from the perspective of structural theories empirically."}, {"heading": "3 Relation classification as Structured Prediction", "text": "We see the problem as a structured prediction in which we can collectively infer the collective mapping of relation labels for all pairs of characters in a document. We assume that we mark a narrative document for which we want to derive a relationship structure y. We could imagine a diagram with characters as nodes, and relationship predictions that correspond to edge labels. We assume a supervised learning environment in which we derive training sets T: = {x1, y1), (xm, ym)}. For each x we have a set of allowed mappings Y (x) (consisting of combinations of binatory mappings to each border label in x). We consider the following standard approaches in structured classifications as linear classifiers of the form: hw = argmax y (x) wTzip (1)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Accounting for narrative types", "text": "The framework described in the previous section provides a simple model for integrating text-based and structural features for the classification of terms. However, one shortcoming in the approach is that the model is agnostic to narrative types. Ideally, a model could allow differentiated weights to characteristics that depend on the narrative type. As speculative illustrations, we present a clustering-based model to our structured model that can have descriptive features of the narrative text to infer content-based predictions. Let's assume that the data consists of natural clusters of narrative types, with a specific structured model for each model (specified by weights wk). For each narrative text, we associate a vector f (x) that represents content and certain narrative types."}, {"heading": "4 Features", "text": "In this section, we outline the text-based and structural features used by our classification models, which draw on existing linguistic and semantic resources, while the structural features are based on the counting of specific signed social triads that can be enumerated for each task. We provide implementations for these features as well as the complete pipeline of relationship polarities for a new text document on our project page."}, {"heading": "4.1 Text-based cues (\u03c6text)", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them are able to survive themselves without there being a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is"}, {"heading": "4.2 Structural cues (\u03c6struct)", "text": "Our thesis is that a common reasoning model that incorporates both structure and text would work better than one that looks at pair relationships in isolation. In some areas, observed relationships between entities may imply directly unknown relationships among others due to natural orders. Temporal relationships between events, for example, lead to natural transitive constraints; such constraints do not apply to the current task. While structural regularities such as \"a friend of a friend is a friend\" may prevail, these configurations are not logically associated with them; and affinities to such structural regularities must be learned directly from the observed data. In Figure 2, we characterize the primary Triadic structural characteristics that we use in our models, along with our informal assessments for them. The values of the four structural characteristics for a narrative document x and the assignment of relation polarity are simply the number of such configurations in the mapping, which are then easily reflected in the data."}, {"heading": "5 Dataset", "text": "We edited the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, a collection of movie summaries from Wikipedia, along with matching metadata [3], and set up an online annotation task using BRAT. We used Stanford Core NLP annotations and basic post-editing to identify personal entities in each text. Annotators were able to select pairs of characters in the text and characterize a directed relationship between them on a neat five-point scale as \"Hostile,\" \"Adversarial,\" \"Neutral,\" \"Cooperative,\" or \"Friendly,\" resulting in a record of 153 movie summaries consisting of annotations of 1044 characters. [2] Most of the dataset2Most relationships were commented symmetrically. For relationships made publicly available for research on our project website, the annotations were labeled as \"Hostile\" and \"Hostile,\" and \"Friendly\" and \"Cooperative neutral, respectively, and 95% of these classes were classified as both."}, {"heading": "6 Evaluation and Analysis", "text": "In this section, we discuss quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our methods. First, we do an ablation study to assess the relative importance of families of text-based characteristics, then we do a comparative evaluation of our methods in restoring gold standard annotations on a held test set of movie summaries, and finally, we qualitatively analyze the performance of the model and briefly discuss common sources of error. This may be because these two families of characteristics were economical. Additionally, frame semantic parses were observed to have frequent errors in frame evocation, and asymmetric features and adverbial connotations of character actions were not significantly added to model performance."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We have presented a framework that automatically suggests interpersonal cooperation and conflict in narrative summaries. While our testbed was film summaries, the framework could potentially be applied to other areas of text with social narratives such as news stories. Our cluster framework provides a natural approach to such domain adaptation, and in the future the framework could be expanded to handle differentiated relationship categories and asymmetric relationships. Conceptually, a natural extension would be to use predictions of character relationships to derive subtle character traits such as agenda, intentions and goals."}], "references": [{"title": "Parsing screenplays for extracting social networks from movies", "author": ["A.
