These structures guide our action planning and execution, but when we observe others, the latent structure of their actions is typically unobservable, and must be inferred in order to learn new skills by demonstration, or to assist others in completing their tasks. For example, an assistant who has learned the subgoal structure of a colleague's task can more rapidly recognize and support their actions as they unfold. Here we model how humans infer subgoals from observations of complex action sequences using a nonparametric Bayesian model, which assumes that observed actions are generated by approximately rational planning over unknown subgoal sequences. We test this model with a behavioral experiment in which humans observed different series of goal-directed actions, and inferred both the number and composition of the subgoal sequences associated with each goal. The Bayesian model predicts human subgoal inferences with high accuracy, and significantly better than several alternative models and straightforward heuristics. Motivated by this result, we simulate how learning and inference of subgoals can improve performance in an artificial user assistance task. The Bayesian model learns the correct subgoals from fewer observations, and better assists users by more rapidly and accurately inferring the goal of their actions than alternative approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Dec 2015 06:44:35 GMT  (635kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00964v1", "Accepted at AAAI 16"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at AAAI 16", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ryo nakahashi", "chris l baker", "joshua b tenenbaum"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.00964"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.00964.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Modeling Human Understanding of Complex Intentional Action with a Bayesian Nonparametric Subgoal Model", "authors": ["Ryo Nakahashi", "Chris L.

Literature (Schank and Abelson 1977; Charniak and Allen 1986; Goldman 1993; Bui, Venkatesh, and West 2002) we seek to use this hierarchical structure by learning from prior knowledge of actions, tasks, and goals at other levels of high-level action structures that have demonstrated behavioral evidence of hierarchical behavior."}, {"heading": "Computational Model", "text": "Fig. 1 shows the structure of our model in the form of separate graphical models for the hierarchical MDP and non-parametric sub-target models. These graphical models determine the structure of the common distributions of actions, state sequences and sub-target sequences. Our model represents the situational context in relation to a finite state space S. The variable s denotes a state sequence of length T, so that st-S is the tenth state in the sequence. The variable g denotes a sequence of M sub-targets. We denote the mth sub-target of g as gm-S. For simplicity's sake, we assume that sT = gM = d is the target. We denote the series of actions as A and the action executed in st as to A (see Fig. 1 (a). The rest of this section first defines the MDP induced by a given target and sub-target sequence and derives the probability of a sub-target sequence representing a state-observed sequence."}, {"heading": "Subgoal sequence likelihood", "text": "\"It is,\" he says, \"as if we are able to sow ourselves to be angry.\" \"It is,\" he says, \"that we will be able to be angry.\""}, {"heading": "Nonparametric subgoal inference", "text": "We now consider the inference of the subtarget structure by observing multiple sequences for a given target. We refer to the set of N behavioral sequences as s1: N and the sequence as si. We refer to a set of K partial target sequences as g1: K, and the kth partial target sequences as gk. However, the problem with non-parametric partial target sequences is that we can consider an unlimited number of partial target sequences for each target. We use the Dirichlet Process (DP) to express the distribution by partial target sequences, the following (Buchsbaum et al. 2015). A graphical model of our DP model is shown in Fig. 1 (b) We use the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) to efficiently extract samples from the DP."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "Our two experiments presented a \"warehouse\" scenario involving the delivery of various workplaces that do not require additional steps to achieve the goal shown in Figure 2. The warehouse has three delivery destinations: A, B and C. There are nine potential items that can be delivered, marked by numbers 1-9. The items are arranged in three lines, and for each delivery, one item can be selected by each warehouse manager. In addition to the items from the current item list, workers are encouraged to include the items, but only if this does not increase the number of steps on their way to the destination. For example, if the item list for Fig. 2 (b), item 5 is a good add-on model for this delivery, because Article 5 is the only additional element that does not require additional jobs to achieve the goal."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "This model used rational hierarchical planning of sub-target structures generated by a non-parametric Bayesian model to capture people's intuitions about the structure of deliberate actions.
