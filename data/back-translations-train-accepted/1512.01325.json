This task has not received enough attention in computer vision. In this paper we study various types of atypicalities in images in a more comprehensive way than has been done before. We propose a new dataset of abnormal images showing a wide range of atypicalities. We design human subject experiments to discover a coarse taxonomy of the reasons for abnormality. Our experiments reveal three major categories of abnormality: object-centric, scene-centric, and contextual. Based on this taxonomy, we propose a comprehensive computational model that can predict all different types of abnormality in images and outperform prior arts in abnormality recognition.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 06:29:53 GMT  (5518kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01325v1", "To appear in the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.HC cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["babak saleh", "ahmed m elgammal", "jacob feldman", "ali farhadi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.01325"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.01325.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Toward a Taxonomy and Computational Models of Abnormalities in Images", "authors": ["Babak Saleh", "Ahmed Elgammal", "Jacob Feldman", "Ali Farhadi"], "emails": ["babaks@cs.rutgers.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The mechanisms underlying the formation of human categories are the subject of many competing accounts, including those based on prototypes (Minda and Smith 2001), examples (Nosofsky 1984), density estimation (Ashby and Alfonso-Reese 1995), and Bayesian Inference (Goodman et al. 2008). But all modern models agree that the representations of human categories involve subjective variations in the typicity or probability of objects within categories. For example, the bird category includes both highly typical examples and extremely atypical examples such as penguins and ostriches, which, while belonging to the category, are subjectively \"abnormal\" examples. Visual images can appear abnormal by having features that differ in some way from what is typical of the categories to which they belong. In this paper, we ask what makes visual images appear abnormal in relation to their obvious categories, something that human observers can judge, but it is difficult to grasp."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "The space does not allow for an encyclopedic review of the literature for detecting anomalies [See (Chandola, Banerjee and Kumar 2009)].

However, there are two problems that prevent us from using the maximum of raw surprise values. These surprise values described are based on the quantification of the information content, so these measurements are unlimited (since the probability is near zero, the surprise is approaching infinity); the other problem is that these surprise values are not comparable, since the information content is modulated differently in each of them. Consequently, it is difficult to compare the values of SurpriseO, SurpriseS and SurpriseC to determine which of these reasons leads to the abnormality in the image, if any. To address these problems, we propose to model the distribution of the surprise values for normal images. To achieve this goal, we compare the adaptation of different parametric models to the empirical distribution of three surprise values, which are calculated over the normal images."}, {"heading": "Experiments and Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Object-centric Typicality Modeling", "text": "We train our model for predicting abnormalities on six classes of objects: airplane, boat, car, chair, motorcycle and sofa.

We compiled the largest set of abnormal images and conducted a large-scale experiment with human subjects to investigate how people think about abnormal images. We proposed a varied list of abnormality reasons from human reactions and inferred a taxonomy of visual cues that make an image abnormal. Based on three main components of this taxonomy, we created computer vision models that can detect abnormal images and justified this decision with three surprise values. Delving deeper into the categories of derived taxonomy is an important work in the future.

Our experiments reveal three major categories of abnormality: object-centric, scene-centric, and contextual. Based on this taxonomy, we propose a comprehensive computational model that can predict all different types of abnormality in images and outperform prior arts in abnormality recognition.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
