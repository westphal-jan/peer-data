The introduced formalism leads to semantics of manipulation action and has applications to both observing and understanding human manipulation actions as well as executing them with a robotic mechanism (e.g. a humanoid robot). It is based on a Combinatory Categorial Grammar. The goal of the introduced framework is to: (1) represent manipulation actions with both syntax and semantic parts, where the semantic part employs $\\lambda$-calculus; (2) enable a probabilistic semantic parsing schema to learn the $\\lambda$-calculus representation of manipulation action from an annotated action corpus of videos; (3) use (1) and (2) to develop a system that visually observes manipulation actions and understands their meaning while it can reason beyond observations using propositional logic and axiom schemata. The experiments conducted on a public available large manipulation action dataset validate the theoretical framework and our implementation.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 20:00:08 GMT  (6612kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01525v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["yezhou yang", "yiannis aloimonos", "cornelia ferm\u00fcller", "eren erdal aksoy"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.01525"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.01525.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning the Semantics of Manipulation Action", "authors": ["Yezhou Yang", "Yiannis Aloimonos", "Cornelia Ferm\u00fcller", "Eren Erdal Aksoy"], "emails": ["fer}@umiacs.umd.edu", "eren.aksoy@kit.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a city, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a city, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a city, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a city, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a"}, {"heading": "2 Related Works", "text": "In fact, most of the people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance"}, {"heading": "3 A CCG Framework for Manipulation Actions", "text": "Before we delve into the semantic parsing of manipulation actions, a brief introduction to the framework of combinatorial category grammar in linguistics is necessary.

The formal system has two basic types: entities and functions. Entities in manipulation actions are objects or hands, and functions are the actions. Our lambda spreadsheet expressions are formed from the following elements: Constants: Constants can be either entities or functions. Messer, for example, is an entity (i.e., it is of type N) and Cucumber is also an entity (i.e., it is of type N). Cut is an action function that maps entities to entities. When the Knife Cut Cucumber event has happened, the expression cut (knife, cucumber) gives an entity of type AP, aka. Action phrase. Constants such as divided are status functions that mapping entities to truth values. The expression divides (cucumber) yields a true value according to the event (Knife) Cucumut."}, {"heading": "3.2 Combinatory Categorial Grammar", "text": "The semantic parsing formalism that underlies our framework for manipulation actions is combinatorial categorical grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000). A CCG specifies one or more logical forms for each element or a combination of elements for manipulation actions. In our formalism, an element of action is associated with a syntactic \"category\" that identifies it as functions and defines the type and direction of its arguments and the nature of its result. (1) Indeed, pure categorical grammar is a tactical expression that is a context-free grammar presented in acceptance, and in functions from the subject object phrase (NP) on the left into a subaction phrase (AP): Cut: (AP\\ NP) / NP / NP is a tactical expression that is a context-free grammar presented in acceptance, not in the productive form of \"the contextual expression (1) is\" the contextual expression of the grammar. \""}, {"heading": "3.3 Functional application", "text": "The functional rules of application of semantics can be expressed in the following form: A / B: f B: g = > A: f (g) (2) B: g A\\ B: f = > A: f (g) (3) rule. (2) states that a string of type A / B can be combined with a string of type B adjacent to the right to form a new string of type A. (3) is a symmetrical form of the rule. (2) In the field of manipulation actions, the following derivative is an example of CCG analysis. This analysis shows how the system can divide an observation (\"Knife Cut Cucumber\") into a semantic representation (cut (knife, cucumber) \u2192 divided (cucumber) based on the functional application ruber.Knife Cucumber Cuber Cut NAP \u2192 NP / PAP (knife, cucumber)."}, {"heading": "4 Learning Model and Semantic Parsing", "text": "After defining the formality and application rule, instead of manually writing down all possible CCG representations for each unit, we would like to apply a learning method to derive them from the paired training corpus.

As several possible syntactic and semantic representations can be assigned to an action, we use the probability model to assign weights to these representations."}, {"heading": "4.1 Learning Approach", "text": "First, we assume that complete syntactic parses of the observed action are available, and indeed one manipulation action can have several different parses. Parsing uses a probabilistic, combinatorial categorical grammatical framework similar to that of Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007. We assume a probabilistic categorical grammar (PCCG) based on a loglinear model. M stands for a manipulation task, L for the semantic representation of the task, and T for its parse tree. The probability of a particular syntactic and semantic parse is given as: P (L, T, M) = e f (L, T, M) \u00b7 p (L, T, M) \u00b7 e f (L, M) \u00b7 p (4), where f is a mapping of the triple (L, T, M) technique, where f is an mapping of the triple (L, T, M) technique to identify vectors."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Manipulation Action (MANIAC) Dataset", "text": "(Aksoy et al., 2014) provides a manipulation dataset with 8 different manipulation actions (cutting, cutting, stirring, placing, removing, hiding, revealing and pushing), each consisting of 15 different versions performed by 5 different human actors 1. A total of 30 different objects are manipulated in all demonstrations, all of which were recorded with the Microsoft Kinect sensor and serve as training data. The MANIAC dataset contains a further 20 long and complex concatenated manipulation sequences (e.g. \"making a sandwich\"), consisting of a total of 103 different versions of these 8 manipulation tasks performed in different sequences with novel objects under different circumstances. These serve as test data for our experiments. (Aksoy et al., 2014; Aksoy and Wo \ufffd rgo \ufffd tter, 2015) developed a semantic event chain approach based on the model of free decomposition. These are uncontrolled frequency relationships that measure the spatial changes, as well as the large number of probabilities."}, {"heading": "5.2 Training Corpus", "text": "We first created a training corpus by commenting on the 120 training clips from the MANIAC dataset, 1dataset available for download at https: / / fortknox.physik3.gwdg.de / cns / index. php? page = maniac-dataset.in the format of the observed triplets (subject action patients) and a corresponding semantic representation of the action and its consequences. The semantic representations in \u03bb spreadsheet format are given by human commentators after watching each action clip. A set of sample training pairs is given in Table1 (one from each action category in the training corpus).Since each training clip contains a single complete execution of each manipulation action considered, the training corpus thus has a total of 120 paired training samples. We also assume that the system knows that each \"object\" involved in the corpus represents a single complete execution of each manipulation action considered, so the training corpus has a total of 120 paired training samples."}, {"heading": "5.3 Learned Lexicon", "text": "We applied the learning technique mentioned in Sec. 4 and used the NL2KR implementation from (Baral et al., 2011).

Here we list the ones with the greatest weight for each action: Chop: = (AP\\ NP) / NP: \u03bbx.chop (x, y) \u2192 divided (y) Cut: = (AP\\ NP) / NP: rolled (x, y) \u2192 divided (y) Stick: = (AP\\ NP) / NP: rolled (x, y).stir (x, y).stir (x, y).stir (x, y).stir (x, y).stir (x, y).stick (x).stick (x), y (x).stick."}, {"heading": "5.4 Deducing Semantics", "text": "Using decomposition technology from (Aksoy et al., 2014; Aksoy and Wo \ufffd rgo \ufffd tter, 2015), the reported system is able to detect a sequence of action triplets in the form of (Subject Action Patient) from each of the test sequences in MANIAC datasets. In short, the representation of the event chain (Aksoy et al., 2011) of the observed long manipulation activity is initially scanned to estimate the main manipulator, i.e. the hand, and manipulated objects, e.g. knives, in the scene without the use of visual feature-based object recognition methods. Based solely on the interactions between the hand and manipulated objects in the scene, the event chain is divided into chunks. These chunks are further fragmented into subunits to detect parallel action streams. Each parsed semantic event chain (SEC) chunk is then compared with the SEC model in the library of models to decide whether the SEC sample belongs to the known or not."}, {"heading": "5.5 Reasoning Beyond Observations", "text": "In fact, it is as if we are able to put ourselves at the top of society.

(NP) An empirical study on a large action dataset confirms that our system is capable of thinking beyond mere observation and deriving \"hidden\" sequences of actions that improvise decent performance. (NP) Due to the limitations of current test scenarios, we have conducted experiments that take into account only a relatively small set of seed lexicon rules and logical expressions. Nevertheless, we would like to mention that the presented CCG framework can also be expanded to learn the formal logical representation of actions."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgements", "text": "This research was partly funded by the European Union under the Cognitive Systems Programme (POETICON + + project), the National Science Foundation under the INSPIRE grant SMA 1248056 and DARPA under the US Army grant W911NF-14-1-0384 under the Shared Perception, Cognition and Reasoning for Autonomy project."}], "references": [{"title": "Semantic decomposition and recognition of long and complex manipulation action sequences", "author": ["E E.
