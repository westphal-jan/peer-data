In our presentation, motivated by BioPAX [12], an interaction refers to either i) an entity that causes state changes to another entity; or ii) an entity that binds / dissociates with another entity to form / break a complex, while optionally also being influenced by a third entity. An entity can be of any kind that exists in a biopath, such as protein, complex, enzyme, etc., although we are referring here to an entity of all valid types simply as a protein."}, {"heading": "III.

Instead, we propose to use vector space to embed the node labels [10, 26], and then define a sparse RBF kernel on the node label vectors. Similar extensions of the convolution kernels have already been proposed [25, 33]. Consider two graphs Gi and Gj, which are the children of the corresponding root nodes on nodes Gi.r and Gj.r, respectively Gj.c.

On the other hand, one may wonder whether the common use of semantic (AMRs) and syntactic (SDGs) parses can improve the extraction accuracy of shallow parsers such as SDGs. There are some intuitive observations that justify the common approach: i) shallow syntactic parses may be sufficient for the correct extraction of a subset of interactions; ii) semantic parsers may make errors that are avoidable in syntactic domains."}, {"heading": "A.

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION", "text": "We evaluated the proposed algorithm on the basis of two data sets."}, {"heading": "A. Data Sets", "text": "1) PubMed45: This dataset contains 400 manual and 3k automatic analyses of AMRs (and 3.4k automatic analyses of SDGs) 7; AMRs automatic analyses are taken from 45 PubMed articles on cancer. From the 3.4k AMRs, we extract 25k subgraphs representing 20k interactions (valid / invalid); the same is true for SDGs. These are our primary data for evaluation. We found that for both AMR- and SGD-based methods, part of the extraction error is due to poor detection of designated entities. To minimize this effect and to isolate errors specific to the extraction methods themselves, we follow the footsteps of previous studies and take a filtered subset of interactions (approximately 10k of 20k). We refer to this dataset as \"PubMed45\" and the superset of 2000 datasets that are immediately available to us as \"PubERS\" (the pair of 2000)."}, {"heading": "B. Evaluation settings", "text": "In a typical assessment scenario, the validation by random subsamples of described interactions (at the record level) is performed for a test subset and the rest is used as a training set. This sentence-level validation approach is not always suitable for extracting protein interactions [35], because interactions from a single / multiple sentences in a document can be correlated. Such correlations can lead to information leaks between training and test sets (artificial match that does not occur in real settings). In [27], for example, the reported F1 score from random validation in the AIMed data is about 0.5. Our algorithm, even using SDGs, gives 0.66 F1 scores in these settings. However, performance decreases significantly when an independent test document is processed. Therefore, we divide the data sets at the document level into about 10 subgroups, so that there is a minimum test set selected between a classification subset and the rest of a subset of the education."}, {"heading": "C. Evaluation Results", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "VII. RELATED WORK", "text": "Pattern-matching-based systems (either manual or semi-automatic) generally provide high precision but little memory [20, 22, 19, 18]. Kernel-based methods based on different folding cores were also developed for the extraction task [35, 1, 27]. Some approaches work more on strings than on parses [27]. The aforementioned work relies on either text or its flat parses, none of which uses semantic parsing for the extraction task. In addition, most work only looks at protein-protein interactions ignoring interaction types. Some recent work used remote monitoring to obtain a large dataset of protein pairs for their experiments [23]. Document-level extraction has been researched in the past [32, 7]. This work classifies at the sentence level and then combines the sequences at the sentence level, while we propose to jointly conclude all sentences at the document level."}, {"heading": "VIII. CONCLUSION", "text": "In summary, we have developed and validated a method for extracting biomolecular interactions using deep semantic parses of biomedical texts (AMRs) for the first time. We have introduced a new algorithm based on Graph Distribution Kernel (GDK) to extract document-level interactions from a series of AMRs in a document. GDK can work with both AMR and SDG parses of sentences. The logic behind this hybrid approach is that while both parses are not perfect, their combination can provide superior results. In fact, our experimental results suggest that the proposed approach outperforms baselines, especially in the practically relevant scenario where there is a discrepancy between the training and the test sets. To facilitate the common approach, we have proposed a novel method for embedding edge vector space to assess similarities between different parent types."}, {"heading": "IX.
