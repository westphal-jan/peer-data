Under the generic RegBayes (regularized Bayesian inference) framework, we handily incorporate the prediction loss with probabilistic inference of a Bayesian model; set distinct regularization parameters for different types of links to handle the imbalance issue in real networks; and unify the analysis of both the smooth logistic log-loss and the piecewise linear hinge loss. For the nonconjugate posterior inference, we present a simple Gibbs sampler via data augmentation, without making restricting assumptions as done in variational methods. We further develop an approximate sampler using stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to handle large networks with hundreds of thousands of entities and millions of links, orders of magnitude larger than what existing LFRM models can process. Extensive studies on various real networks show promising performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 12:37:41 GMT  (301kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02016v1", "Accepted by AAAI 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by AAAI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["bei chen", "ning chen", "jun zhu", "jiaming song", "bo zhang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.02016"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.02016.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Discriminative Nonparametric Latent Feature Relational Models with Data Augmentation", "authors": ["Bei Chen", "Ning Chen", "Jun Zhu", "Jiaming Song", "Bo Zhang"], "emails": ["{chenbei12@mails.,", "ningchen@,", "dcszj@,", "sjm12@mails.,", "dcszb@}tsinghua.edu.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "For statistical networks, it is defined as predicting the missing links from a partially observed network topology (and some attributes, if any).Existing approaches include: 1) unmonitored methods that design good proximity / similarity between nodes based on network topology characteristics (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg 2003), e.g. common methods that classifiers develop on labeled data with a number of manually designed features (Lichtenwalter, Lussier and Chawla 2010); Hasan et al. 2006; Shi et al. 2009); 3) others (Backstrom and Leskovec 2011) that use random ways to combine network structure with node and marginal attributes."}, {"heading": "Nonparametric LFRM Models", "text": "We consider static networks with N (U) and Zij = vec (Z > i cell), in which we apply the assumptions of A > Vector A (U > Vector).

Previous inference methods for non-parametric LFRM use either Metropolis-Hastings (Miller, Griffiths, and Jordan 2009) or variation techniques (Zhu 2012), which can be either inefficient or too strict in practice. We investigate the ideas of data expansion to give the pseudo-probability a correct design so that we can obtain directly subordinate distributions and develop efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms. Specifically, our algorithm is based on the following uniform representation problem. Lemma 1. Appendix \u2212 appendix \u2212 2 can be presented as indicators (yij, Zj, U)."}, {"heading": "Sampling Algorithm", "text": "Lemma 1 suggests that the pseudo-probability of a complete or dropped distribution environment can be considered as the marginal of a higher dimensional distribution that includes the extended variables. (9) This is a mixture of Gaussian components of U (U), which indicates that we can effectively perform Gibbs sampling when a conjugated Gaussian is imposed before U. We also construct the full posterior distribution: q (Z, U | Y) if we aim for the full posterior distribution.
