Such lexicons are not available for all languages and even when available, their coverage can be limited. We present a graph-based semi-supervised learning method that uses the morphological, syntactic and semantic relations between words to automatically construct wide coverage lexicons from small seed sets. Our method is language-independent, and we show that we can expand a 1000 word seed lexicon to more than 100 times its size with high quality for 11 languages. In addition, the automatically created lexicons provide features that improve performance in two downstream tasks: morphological tagging and dependency parsing.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 02:27:14 GMT  (129kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05030v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 19:02:56 GMT  (132kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05030v2", "in Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL) 2016"], ["v3", "Sun, 24 Jan 2016 04:28:46 GMT  (132kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05030v3", "Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL) 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["manaal faruqui", "ryan mcdonald", "radu soricut"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.05030"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.05030.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Morpho-syntactic Lexicon Generation Using Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning", "authors": ["Manaal Faruqui", "Ryan McDonald", "Radu Soricut"], "emails": ["mfaruqui@cs.cmu.edu", "ryanmcd@google.com", "rsoricut@google.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "A typical lexicon contains all sorts of attributes that can be represented by a word.

In this step, we use only labeled nodes and the edge connections between labeled nodes. As such, it is strictly a supervised learning setup.

We stop after the square Euclidean distance between the attribute vectors in two consecutive iterations for a node below 0.1 (averaged over all unlabeled nodes). This is the second step in algorithm 1 (lines 6-9). After the convergence, we can get attributes for a word directly by specifying thresholds: A word w should have an attribute ai if ai, w > 0."}, {"heading": "3.3 Paradigm Projection", "text": "Since a word can be labeled with multiple lexical attributes, this is a multi-label classification problem, and several advanced methods have been proposed for such a task, taking into account the correlation between attributes (Ghamrawi and McCallum, 2005; Tsoumakas and Katakis, 2006; Fu rnkranz et al., 2008; Read et al., 2011). However, since the decision to have an attribute over a word is independent of all other attributes, the final set of attributes obtained for a word in \u00a7 3.2 may not be a valid paradigm (Godbole and Sarawagi, 2004; Zhang and Zhou, 2005).

However, the seed lexicographs used in Section 4.1 have been artificially constructed from the aggregation of attributes of word types above the tree bank. Therefore, it can be argued that these constructed lexicographs may not be complete, i.e. the lexicographical lexicographs may not have all possible attributes for a particular word. On the other hand, manually curated lexicographs are not available for many languages, which prevents proper evaluation. To test the usefulness of our approach to manually curated lexicographs, we examine publicly available lexicographs for Finnish (Pirinen, 2011), Czech (Hajic and Hladka, 1998b) and Hungarian (Tro, et al., 2006). We eliminate numbers and punctuation in all lexicographics. For each of these languages, we select 10,000 words for training and the rest of the word types for the evaluation criterion."}, {"heading": "5 Extrinsic Evaluation", "text": "We now show that the automatically generated dictionaries offer informative functions that are useful for two downstream NLP tasks: morphological marking (\u00a7 5.1) and syntactic dependency analysis (\u00a7 5.2)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Morphological Tagging", "text": "Morphological marking is the task of assigning a morphological reading to a character in context. Morphological reading consists of features such as part of speech, case, gender, person, tense, etc. (Oflazer and Kuruo \ufffd z, 1994; Hajic and Hladka, 1998a) The model we use is a standard atomic sequence classifier that classifies the morphological bundle for each word independently of the others (except for the features derived from these words). Specifically, we use a linear SVM model classifier with hand-controlled features, similar to commonly used analyzers such as SVMTagger (Ma, rquez and Gime, nez, 2004) and MateTagger (Bohnet and Nivre, 2012). Our taggers are trained in a language-independent manner (Hajic, 2000; Smith et al, 2005; Mu, et al, 2013)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Dependency Parsing", "text": "We train the dependency savers for the same 11 universal dependence tree banks that contain the morphological layer (Agic \u0301 et al., 2015). We re-use the supplied breakdown of the dependence tree bank into train, development and test to develop the models. Our analysis model is the transition-based analysis system of Zhang and Nivre (2011) with identical characteristics and a bar of size 8. We expand the characteristics of Zhang and Nivre (2011) in two ways: by using the context-independent morphological attributes present in the various lexicographs; and by using the corresponding morphological markers from \u00a7 5.1 to create context-dependent attributes. For each of the above two types of characteristics, we fire the attributes for the word on the top of the stack and the two words on the front of the buffer. Additionally, we take the cross-product of these characteristics between the word on the top of the map and the top of the table showing all the boundaries of LAS (opposite the top of the table for the 11%)."}, {"heading": "6 Further Analysis", "text": "In this section we will further examine our model and results in detail. Size of the seed lexicon. We will first test how the size of the seed lexicon affects the performance of the attribute prediction on the test sentence. We will use the manually constructed lexicon described in \u00a7 4.2 for experiments. Instead of using the full seed lexicon of 10,000 words for each language, we will construct subsets of this lexicon by taking 1000 and 5000 randomly selected words. We will then train models obtained in \u00a7 4.1 of this lexicon and plot the performance on the test sentence in Figure 3."}, {"heading": "S + C + MT 87.5 79.9 71.6", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "S + C 86.5 78.8 68.2", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "S + MT 85.7 77.0 68.7", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "C + MT 75.7 57.4 62.2", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "S + C + MT + P 86.7 66.0 61.3", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have given themselves, and they will be able to play by the rules they have given themselves."}, {"heading": "7 Related Work", "text": "We review the areas of related work. Lexicon generation. Natural language lexicons are often used by smaller seed lexicons that use different methods. Thelen and Riloff (2002) use patterns extracted from a large corpus to learn semantic lexicon from smaller seed lexicons, while our seed lexicon is evaluated by bootstrapping. Alfonseca et al. (2010) we use distribution similarities between different types of languages that contain semantic polarity labels for words and phrases created by random walks over a graph. Das and Smith (2012) learn potential semantic frames for unknown predictions by extending a lexicon framework. Sentiment lexicons contain semantic languages that contain semantic languages."}, {"heading": "8 Future Work", "text": "In the current model, we first learn the weights under supervision (\u00a7 3.1) and then propagate labels using these weights in a semi-supervised step with fixed property weights (\u00a7 3.2). These can also be done together: perform an iteration of weight learning, propagate labels using these weights, perform a further iteration of weight learning using empirical labels such as gold labels, and learn and propagate further to convergence. This joint learning would be slower than the current approach, as the propagation of labels over the graph is an expensive step.Multi-label classification is an expensive one. We currently use the binary relevance method that trains a binary classifier for each attribute independently (Godbole and Sarawagi, 2004; Zhang and Zhou, 2005)."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "We have presented a graph-based semi-supervised method for constructing large annotated morphosyntactic lexicographs from small seed lexicographs.
