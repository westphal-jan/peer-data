We focus on SNTV, Bloc, k-Borda, and Chamberlin-Courant, as well as on approximate variants of Chamberlin-Courant, since the original rule is NP-hard to compute. We show that SHIFT BRIBERY tends to be significantly harder in the multiwinner setting than in the single-winner one by showing settings where SHIFT BRIBERY is easy in the single-winner cases, but is hard (and hard to approximate) in the multiwinner ones. Moreover, we show that the non-monotonicity of those rules which are based on approximation algorithms for the Chamberlin-Courant rule sometimes affects the complexity of SHIFT BRIBERY.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 11:35:43 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01492v1", "27 Pages.

The goal is to ensure that p belongs to at least one winning committee (according to rule R), 3 and to achieve this goal, we may move p forward in the preferential orders of voters. However, each voter v has a pricing function \u03c0v: [m] N, and if we move p to i positions in the vote of v, then we must pay \u03c0v (i). We assume that the pricing functions will not decrease (i.e., it can not cost less to move our candidate further than they or move him closer) and that the cost of the non-displaced p position is zero (i.e., deputy v (0) = 0 for each v)."}, {"heading": "4 General Results", "text": "We begin our discussion by providing several results that either apply to entire classes of multiple-winner rules (including many of those we focus on) or are tested using generic, easily customizable techniques. (These results form the basis for our research on specific rules.) First, we note that for each of the rules we study, SHIFT is BRIBERY with unit pricing functions in FPT when parameterized by the number of candidates. (8) This result follows the application of the standard method of modeling the problem by an integral linear program and the use of Lenstra's theorem [24]. We believe that the use of the MILP technique by Bredereck et al. (8) is also possible to generalize this result to all or nothing. (The following theorem does not mention SNTV and Bloc, as we will see in the next section that the problem is even in P.Theorem 1."}, {"heading": "6 Chamberlin-Courant and Its Variants", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to put ourselves at the top, in the way that they are able to change the world, \"he said in an interview with\" Welt. \""}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We examined the complexity of SHIFT BRIBERY for two families of multiple-winner rules: SNTV, Bloc and k-Borda, which select the best candidates according to appropriate single-winner scoring rules, and the Chamberlin Courant family of rules that focus on providing good representatives. While we have shown the low complexity of SNTV and Bloc (as well as the single-winner rules on which they are based), we have shown that SHIFT BRIBERY is much more difficult to solve than its single-winner variant, Borda. The situation is even more dramatic for the Chamberlin Courant family of rules, in which in addition to W [1] and W [2] hardness results are achieved. We focus on the case where we want to ensure a candidate's membership."}, {"heading": "8 Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors were supported, among others, by the DFG project PAWS (NI 369 / 10), the NCN project DEC2012 / 06 / M / ST1 / 00358.

We show that SHIFT BRIBERY tends to be significantly harder in the multiwinner setting than in the single-winner one by showing settings where SHIFT BRIBERY is easy in the singlewinner cases, but is hard (and hard to approximate) in the multiwinner ones. Moreover, we show that the non-monotonicity of those rules which are based on approximation algorithms for the Chamberlin-Courant rule sometimes affects the complexity of SHIFT BRIBERY.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
