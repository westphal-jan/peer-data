Rank-breaking is a common practice to reduce the computational complexity of learning the global ranking. The individual preferences are broken into pairwise comparisons and applied to efficient algorithms tailored for independent paired comparisons. However, due to the ignored dependencies in the data, naive rank-breaking approaches can result in inconsistent estimates. The key idea to produce accurate and unbiased estimates is to treat the pairwise comparisons unequally, depending on the topology of the collected data. In this paper, we provide the optimal rank-breaking estimator, which not only achieves consistency but also achieves the best error bound. This allows us to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and complexity. Further, the analysis identifies how the accuracy depends on the spectral gap of a corresponding comparison graph.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Jan 2016 02:39:39 GMT  (182kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05495v1", "46 pages, 12 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 7 Oct 2016 14:28:42 GMT  (189kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05495v2", "46 pages, 12 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "46 pages, 12 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["ashish khetan", "sewoong oh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1601.05495"}, "pdf": {"name": "1601.05495.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Data-driven Rank Breaking for Efficient Rank Aggregation", "authors": ["Ashish Khetan", "Sewoong Oh"], "emails": ["khetan2@illinois.edu", "swoh@illinois.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "2 Comparisons Graph and the Graph Laplacian", "text": "In the analysis of the convex program (3) we show that with a high probability the objective function is strictly concave (2). < < < 0 (Lemma 11) for all subjects who are dependent on the topology of the data, and the gradient is limited by constants that depend only on b.

To illustrate how graph topology affects accuracy, we produce known spectral properties of canonical graphs and numerically compare the performance of data-driven ranking breaks for multiple graph topologies. We follow the examples and experimental graphs of [52] for a similar result with random comparisons. Spectral properties of graphs have been a topic of wide interest for decades. We consider a scenario in which we fix the size of the offers as \u03baj = O (1) and each agent provides a partial ranking with \"separators whose positions are chosen uniformly at random. The resulting spectral gap of the various choices of the Sj's are provided below.

In this case,\" 0 and the margin of error is large. \"This is not a weakness of the analysis. In fact, we observe large errors under this scenario. The reason is that many alternatives that have large weights are rarely compared with each other, which makes a reasonable estimate unfeasible. Figure 8 illustrates this scenario. We choose\" = 8, and d = 128, and d = 1024. The other settings are those of the first figure 2.

To validate our approach, we first take the estimated PL weights of the 10 types of sushi, using the implementation of the ML estimator, across the total input data of 5000 complete rankings.

In traditional data collection scenarios, several efficient algorithms find the maximum probability estimate while demonstrably achieving the minimum optimal performance. However, in some non-traditional scenarios, the computational complexity of determining the maximum probability estimate in the problem size can be scaled superexponentially. We provide the first finite sample analysis of computationally efficient estimators, the so-called rank-refracting estimators. This provides guidelines for selecting weights in the estimator to achieve optimal performance, and also explicitly shows how accuracy depends on the topology of the data. This paper provides the first analytical result in the sample complexity of rank-refracting estimators and quantifies the price we pay for the accuracy of the computational gain. In general, more complex cross-ranking breaks can also be taken into account, where instead of a partial sequence of rank comparisons is divided into higher order."}, {"heading": "8 Proofs", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "8.1 Proof of Theorem 2", "text": "We prove a general result for any choice of the parameter \u03bbj = a > 0 for all j [n] and a number ['j].

Rank-breaking is a common practice to reduce the computational complexity of learning the global ranking. The individual preferences are broken into pairwise comparisons and applied to efficient algorithms tailored for independent paired comparisons. However, due to the ignored dependencies in the data, naive rank-breaking approaches can result in inconsistent estimates. The key idea to produce accurate and consistent estimates is to treat the pairwise comparisons unequally, depending on the topology of the collected data. In this paper, we provide the optimal rank-breaking estimator, which not only achieves consistency but also achieves the best error bound. This allows us to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and complexity. Further, the analysis identifies how the accuracy depends on the spectral gap of a corresponding comparison graph.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
