It is easy to verify this rank (Z) = 1, where each Y (l) i, j is a loud measurement of Zi, j. Thus, our problem falls into the category of low-level matrix completion, a topic that has prompted frantic research (e.g. [41-45]). However, most previous work focused on samples taken using a Erd\u0151s-R\u00c3 \u00a9 nyi model without examining the sample schemes with local limitations. An exception is [46], which examined the effectiveness of SDP among general sample schemes. However, the sample complexity required therein increases significantly, as the spectral gap of the measurement chart decreases, which does not provide an optimal solution to the problems we believe developed here with the local matrix."}, {"heading": "4 Extension: Beyond Pairwise Measurements", "text": "The proposed algorithms are applicable to numerous scenarios that go beyond the basic setup in Section 2.1.

Instead of relying on a \"global\" method that attempts to restore all nodes at once, the proposed algorithms emphasize local subgraphs, whose nodes are well connected to each other, and propagate information about different parts of the diagram. In this way, we are able to use the locality structure in a mathematically feasible manner. This paper leaves numerous directions open for further investigation. First, the current work focuses on the simplest constellation in which only two communities exist. It would be of interest to extend the results to the case of M > 2 communities, which naturally occur in many applications, including haplotyphasing for polyploid species [50]. Moreover, what would be the information and calculation boundaries in the regime in which the number M of communities is scaled with n?
