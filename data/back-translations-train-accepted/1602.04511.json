In this paper, we propose an effective method, learning Granger causality, for a special but significant type of point processes --- Hawkes process. We reveal the relationship between Hawkes process's impact function and its Granger causality graph. Specifically, our model represents impact functions using a series of basis functions and recovers the Granger causality graph via group sparsity of the impact functions' coefficients. We propose an effective learning algorithm combining a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) with a sparse-group-lasso (SGL) regularizer. Additionally, the flexibility of our model allows to incorporate the clustering structure event types into learning framework. We analyze our learning algorithm and propose an adaptive procedure to select basis functions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that our method can learn the Granger causality graph and the triggering patterns of the Hawkes processes simultaneously.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Feb 2016 21:14:07 GMT  (715kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04511v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 11 Jun 2016 23:47:23 GMT  (720kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04511v2", "International Conference on Machine Learning, 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["hongteng xu", "mehrdad farajtabar", "hongyuan zha"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.04511"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.04511.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Learning Granger Causality for Hawkes Processes", "authors": ["Hongteng Xu", "Mehrdad Farajtabar", "Hongyuan Zha"], "emails": ["HXU42@GATECH.EDU", "MEHRDAD@GATECH.EDU", "ZHA@CC.GATECH.EDU"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

From the standpoint of the graphic model, it is about local independence over the dimensions of the point process - the occurrence of historical events in V affects the probability of occurrence of type u events in the present and future, while the occurrence of historical events in U-V. In order to proceed formally, we introduce some notations.

If the condition dNu \"(t \u2212 s) > 0 applies to 0 \u2264 s < t \u2264 T, then u\" u (t) = 0 for t [0, \u221e]. In practice, Theorem 4.1 can easily be specified in the time interval t [0, T]. It provides an explicit representation of the Granger causality of the multidimensional Hawkes process - learning whether the Granger event causes type u events, type u event or not is equivalent to determining whether the action function is all zero or not active along the Hawkes process. In other words, we can show the multidimensional function along the Hawkes process."}, {"heading": "4.2.

U (= 13) categories of television programs are predefined. Similar to (Luo et al., 2015), we model the viewing behavior of users through a Hawkes process in which the TV programs themselves and mutually triggering patterns exist. Thus, watching an episode of a drama would lead to watching the following episodes (self-triggering) and related messages from actors (mutual triggering).Therefore, causality among the categories depends not only on the predetermined schedules, but also on the viewing preferences of users. We capture the Granger causality of the program categories via learning functions."}, {"heading": "6.
