Experimental Results", "text": "The first problem we are examining is the following hierarchical model of Gaussian, for which we apply the complete ABC statistics. In this model, the parameter of interest is ABC, and our goal is to estimate the number of data observed. In our experiments, we compare our two methods, complete and conditional DR-ABC, against SA-ABC and K2-ABC. We specifically compare our framework against these methods, as they are examples of the illustration of regression and the RKHS approach to the construction of summary statistics. We calculate the mean square error (MSE) of the parameters of interest in synthetic data. Specifically, we present a series of 200 observations on these parameters as a y value; for each newly simulated dataset, we also draw 200 data points."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we developed a novel framework for constructing informative problem-specific summary statistics using the flexible and expressive environment for reproducing Hilbert core spaces. We introduced two different approaches based on the embedding of probability distributions and nuclear-based distribution regression. Our proposed framework has several advantages over previous generic and semi-automatic summary statistical construction methods. First, by using the flexible RKHS framework, we are able to regulate the type and amount of information extracted from the data and thus construct more informative problem-specific summary statistics, as opposed to an ad-hoc selection of a limited number of candidate statistics or the postulation of heuristic summary statistics, which inevitably result in a difficult-to-evaluate approximation distortion in the probability and subsequently in the subordinate sample."}], "references": [{"title": "On the equivalence between quadrature rules and random features", "author": ["F.
