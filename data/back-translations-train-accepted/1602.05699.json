The algorithms are all based on the search for the first width. Rule repairs w.r.t. use the basic process described in Alg. 1, and an exponential check is performed during the process. For rule repairs w.r.t. \u2264, it works better for the reason that there is no need to search the other levels as soon as it finds uniform sentences. As for rule repairs w.r.t. P., we design an algorithm that iterates over the rules from low to high prioritization. As soon as consistent results are found in the rules with lower prioritization, the search stops. It is known that \u2264 P can be translated into \u2264 w, but not vice versa. As for \u2264 w, we search by deleting rules from the lowest weight to the highest prioritization. Overall, the algorithms for situations with lower prioritization or weighting are much more efficient if the following rule conditions are met: The lower weighted in the rule is weighted in the rule (The lower weighted in the rule)."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "We developed a prototype system QAIER1 (Query Answering with Inconsistent Existential Rules) in C + +. QAIER can answer queries with inconsistent R-acyclic rule sets. When it comes to verifying the existence of stable models, QAIER calls an ASP solver that includes clingo-4.4.02.Benchmarks to estimate the performance of QAIER in terms of data complexity, we use the modified LUBM3 table as a benchmark. Since LUBM is not an R-acyclic, we modified LUBM by changing atoms and deleting rules to ensure that modified LUBM rules are R-acyclic. We use HermiT 4 to transform the modified LUBM ontology into DL clauses, and replace at least number constraints in head atoms with existential neglects, then we get 127 rules and we add standard weights or restrictions below."}, {"heading": "Related Work and Conclusions", "text": "With regard to the amendment of the rule set / Tbox for repair, Meyer et al.
