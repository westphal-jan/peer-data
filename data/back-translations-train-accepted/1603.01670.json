Related Work", "text": "A number of papers trying to mimic the teacher network with a student network have been developed, which usually need to be learned from scratch. For example, (Bucilu et al., 2006) the authors attempted to train a lighter network by mimicking an ensemble network. (Ba & Caruana, 2014) extended this idea and used a flatter but broader network to mimic a deep and wide network. In (Romero et al., 2014) the authors adopted a deeper but narrower network to mimic a deep and wide network. The proposed network morphism scheme differs from these algorithms in that it directly inherits the children's network (network function) from the parent network, enabling network morphynism to achieve the same performance."}, {"heading": "3.

These two practices are widely adopted in existing work, since random initialization is preferred to zero-fill for non-convex optimization problems (Bishop, 2006), and the scale of initializations is critical for convergence and good performance of deep neural networks (Glorot & Bengio, 2010; He et al., 2015b).

This algorithm reduces the zero convergence condition to the point that the number of parameters of Fl or Fl + 1 is not less than G, instead of G. Since we are focusing on network morphism in an expanding mode, we can assume that this condition justifies itself, namely either Fl expands G, or Fl + 1 expands G. Therefore, we can claim that this algorithm solves the network morphism equation (6). As described in algorithm 2, in the event that Fl G expands, starting from Kr2 = K2, we can call iteratively algorithm 1 and shrink the size of Kr2 until the loss converges to 0. This iteration is terminated because we are able to guarantee that Kr2 = 1, the loss is zero, for the other algorithm, that Fl + 1 expands."}, {"heading": "3.3.

In this section, instead of state-of-the-art DCNN solutions (LeCun et al., 1998; Chang & Chen, 2015), we use the simple Softmax regression model as a superordinate network to evaluate the effectiveness of network morphism in classical networks. 28 x 28-digit images were flattened as a 784-dimensional feature vector as input. The superordinate model achieved an accuracy of 92.29%, which is considered a baseline.

Furthermore, we double the number of channels (width) for the first layer in each subnet (cifar _ width).Fig.9 (b) shows the results of NetMorph and Net2Net. As you can see, NetMorph is slightly better. It improves performance to 83.09%, while Net2Net drops a little to 82.70%.
