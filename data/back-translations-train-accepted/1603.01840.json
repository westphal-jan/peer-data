To our knowledge, no work has been done to evaluate reliability in electricity grids."}, {"heading": "3. Problem Formulation", "text": "Here we present a formulation for the two sequential decision processes that take place the next day (DA) and in real time (RT) in the sense of a hierarchical model of two MDPs. DA decisions are made to maximize the reliability of the system the next day. However, reliability the next day can only be assessed in RT and depends on the decision of the system operator in RT. This results in a complex dependence between DA and RT actions and system reliability. Therefore, we formulate the problem using two layers of intertwined MDPs: an RT-MDP that describes the state of the system, reliability and decisions on an hourly basis, and a DA-MDP that describes the DA action to select a daily subset of active generators based on predictions for the coming day. In our terminology, the former serves as a substitute for judgement of decisions made in the latter, see Figure 2."}, {"heading": "3.1. Day-Ahead MDP", "text": "The DA-MDP is a tuple (SDA, ADA, PDA, RDA). The time index is td, i.e. the days. The day-ahead state sDAtd-SDA consists of a prediction of the hourly demand of each bus and the wind generation of each wind generator. Therefore, we consider the SDA = RTD \u00b7 (nb + ng), where TD is the number of intraday time steps (in our case 24), and nb, ng the number of buses and wind generators. For the day ahead, we consider ac-1In this work, only the wind generation as a renewable source for simplification. This sentence aDAtd-A DA uses a simplified model that indicates a binary vector which generators participate in the next day generation process. The sets of generators included in ADA represent common settings from which an SO can choose. This sentence can be constructed by experts or derived from the data."}, {"heading": "3.2. Real-Time MDP", "text": "The RT-MDP is a tuple (SRT, GTR, PRT, RRT). It represents the process of checking the real-time reliability. The time index is t and denotes the intrinsic time steps (e.g. hours). In the operation of the RT power grid, the operator can take preventive measures at each time step by trying to immunize the system against potential disturbances by trying to avoid unreliable states. We model this decision process using post-states (Powell, 2007), whereby the actor observes the current state sRTt-SRT at the beginning of each time interval, i.e. selects the realized demand and wind values for this interval and an action aRTt-ART. After the action of the actor, the system is now in a post-decision state sRT, at which is the new state, after the execution of action aRTt-SRT. Next, random exogenous continentations of the RTT are received (WRT 1), while the WRT equipment is an inform (WRT 1), whereas the WRT equipment is an inform (WRT 1)."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. REAL-TIME STATE SPACE", "text": "We define an RT state sRTt as a tuple (d, w, g, e), where: d is a vector of stochastic node winding. w is a vector of stochastic node winding. g is a vector of controllable generation values. DAaction aDAtd determines which generators have positive values and which are set to 0 during the day. e is the topology of the mesh. Contains information about the current state of each edge (transmission line). e: 0, 1,..., E}, where 0 is in operation and the rest is a countdown process until the line is repaired."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. REAL-TIME ACTION SPACE", "text": "The RT action aRTt is a preventive measure, which tries to achieve a better reliability of the system by immunization against possible contingency.The action includes a redispatch \u0445 g, i.e. a change of the generation values of the working controllable generators (selected in DA): sRTt aRTt \u2212 \u2192 sRT, at = (d, w, g + \u2206 g, e).Any action is allowed as long as it is within the minimum and maximum generator limits. Note that \u0445 gi 6 = 0 only for working generators (aDAtd, i = 1)."}, {"heading": "3.2.3. REAL-TIME TRANSITION KERNEL", "text": "The RT transition core can be factored into exogenous transitions of demand, wind energy and contingencies. It depends on the last RT state and on the last DA decision taken to determine participating generators: sRTt + 1 = f (s RT, a t, Wt, a DA td). The dependence between RT and DA states is expressed in two groups of equations: The first is RT demand process based on DA demand forecast: dRTt = d DA t + \u03b4t (1) \u03b4t + 1 = \u03b4t + t, (2), where dRTt is the RT demand vector in due time and d DA t is the DA forecast vector for the time t of the day. The dynamics in Eqs. (1) - (2) also applies to the wind generation process."}, {"heading": "3.2.4. REAL-TIME REWARD", "text": "In order to calculate the reliability of the system, we use the industry standard criterion N \u2212 1, which evaluates the system's ability to withstand all contingencies of a single device. To calculate the reliability of the system, it is examined on the basis of a test sequence (contingency list), each test being an attempt to extract a single line (contingency) and check whether the system maintains safe operation. Therefore, reliability is calculated for a particular state of the network and depends on the current topology (et) and the changes in topology due to possible new contingencies (WRT). In practice, maintaining the system means for a given state of the network, and depends on the current topology (et) and the changes in topology due to possible new contingencies (WRT)."}, {"heading": "4. Interleaved Approximate Policy Improvement", "text": "In this section, we present our algorithms, called Interleaved Approximate Policy Improvement (IAPI), presented in Alg. 1, for collectively learning the RT reliability function while searching for an optimal DA policy. We use the term interleaved since the policy improvement in an MDP, 2006) to improve DA policy. Our method scales to large systems, using simple models with carefully designed functions and designs to run on distributed computing methods. As the algorithm is massively parallelizable, the faster convergence will be available. Our goal is to find an optimal DA policy."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "In this section we show the results of the IAPI algorithm on the IEEE RTS-96 test system, which is considered the standard test case in the system literature (Wong et al., 1999); see Figure 4. This test case is an example of a power grid in a medium-sized country that normally includes 73 buses, 99 generators and 120 transmission lines. We are updating the test case to include 9 additional wind generators to better represent current power grids. We use daily demand and wind profiles as published in (Pandzic et al., 2015). As stated in Sec. 1, this is a complicated, high-dimensional system that cannot be solved by bruteforce methods. The state space of this system may have O (2120) line configurations, with O (D73 \u00b7 G9r) demand values (D) and wind generation values (Gr) at any time, which are of stochastic nature."}, {"heading": "6. Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we present a networked two-MDP model, inspired by the hierarchical decision problem of managing the reliability of the power grid. The presented IAPI algorithm alternates between improving the DA policy and learning the RT reliability value. The IEEE RTS-96 network in our experiments is a sufficiently large network to capture the computing complexities that arise in real networks. In this work, we focus on the power grid, but our model can be adapted to other important applications with a hierarchical decision structure at different time levels, where a high degree of reliability and sustainability is required. Examples of such applications are sewer systems, smart cities and traffic control. The rough model presented in this paper was jointly developed as a first step with several SOs. This work is the tip of the iceberg and many improvements can be considered."}], "references": [{"title": "An efficient mixed-integer linear formulation for long-term overhead lines maintenance scheduling in power distribution systems.
