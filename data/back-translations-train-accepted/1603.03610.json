A string is in the language if and only if the number a, the number b, and the number c are equal. Another way of defining the MIX language is as a permutation closure of the regular language (abc) \u043a, as noted by Bach (1981); see also Pullum (1983).If a, b, and c represent, say, a transitive verb and its subject and its object, then a string in MIX represents a sentence with any number of triples of these components, in a hypothetical language with an extreme free order of words. Admittedly, this is quite different from any actual natural language. Joshi (1985) argued that grammatical formalisms describing natural languages should not be able to generalize the MIX generalization.

If x (0) the path is closed, then the path is closed, that is, the starting point and the end point are the same. If we have two strings x and y, which are so x."}, {"heading": "4 Continuous view", "text": "The advantages are that we are able to make changes to the paths that can satisfy the four constraints, which are a convenient normal form for A and B. If we can prove a contradiction in the normal form, we will have shown that there can be no A and B that can satisfy the four constraints. We will define for each integer k that is a convenient normal form for A and B. If we can prove a contradiction in the normal form, we will show that between P [k] and P [k] there can be exactly one way that meets the four constraints. We will write Q [k] to indicate that Q is a point on the line. We will consistently draw points., P [0], P [1], P [1], P [1], P [1], P [1]."}, {"heading": "5 Normal form", "text": "The regions of C between Q1 and Q2 must be introduced if we assume that we have all unfulfilled areas of Q1, Q2 and (sub-segments of) seg (Q1, Q2) as shown in Figure 8 (a). The area of the excursion is the surface of all regions combined. We say that an excursion is filled if one of the regions contains at least one point P [k \"], some integers k,\" otherwise it is said that it is unfiltered. We say that A and B are in normal form if no excursion can be carried out without violating the four limitations or the introduction of a self-section. Suppose A and B are in normal form while one or more excursions remain. First, let us consider the unfilled excursions. Among them, we choose one of the smallest areas."}, {"heading": "6 The final contradiction", "text": "This means that A [0] crosses exactly once [0] [0] and B [0] exactly once [0]. Furthermore, LA may be the only point at which A [\u2212 1] and B [0] are similarly crossed, and the region of the plane between [\u2212 1] and [0] can now be divided into an \"upper\" region, where A [\u2212 1] and B are the only points at which B [1] is crossed. The \"upper\" region consists of those points that can be reached from any point. [\u2212 1] and 0 \"lower\" regions, a \"lower\" region \"and zero or more enclosed regions.\" The \"upper\" region \"consists of those points that lie between and 0\" lower. \""}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and outlook", "text": "It has at least superficial elements in common with the evidence of Salvati (2015). Both proofs use essentially the same MCFG, both are geometric in nature and both involve a continuous view of the paths alongside a discrete view. The main difference lies in the approach to the myriad ways in which the paths can circumnavigate each other and themselves. In the case of Salvati (2015), the key concept is the complex exponential function that seems to limit the evidential technique to two-dimensional geometry. In our case, the key concepts are excursions and shortcuts of the same. At this point no evidence is within reach that generalizes the result to O3. This requires at least an appropriate definition of \"deflection\" in three dimensions that are probably more involved than in the two-dimensional case."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work arose from an exchange of letters with Giorgio Satta.
