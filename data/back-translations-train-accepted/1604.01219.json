Each panel should not only have a reasonable size to contain appropriate textual and graphic content, but should also be in an appropriate shape (aspect ratio) to maximize aesthetic appeal. However, our approach is conditional on a probable graphical model to derive the initial values for the size and aspect ratio of each panel. As each panel consists of both textual descriptions and graphic elements, we assume that panel size (sp) and aspect ratio (rp) are conditionally dependent on text ratios tp and graphic element ratios gp. Therefore, the probability of a set of panels p can be defined as follows: Pr (sp, rp), gp) = p."}, {"heading": "Experimental Results", "text": "This year, we are in a position to find a solution in the first phase of the process, which extends to the second phase of the process, and in the third phase of decision-making, in the second phase of decision-making, in the third phase of decision-making, in the third phase of decision-making, in the first phase of decision-making, in the second phase of decision-making, in the third phase of decision-making, in the third phase of decision-making, in the third phase of decision-making, in the second phase of decision-making."}, {"heading": "Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "Automatic tools for creating scientific posters are important for poster designers. Designers can save a lot of time with such tools. Design is hard work, especially for scientific posters, which require careful consideration of both utility and aesthetics. Abstract principles of scientific poster design cannot directly help designers. In contrast, we suggest an approach to learning design patterns from existing examples, and this approach will hopefully lead to an automatic tool for creating scientific posters to help designers. With the exception of scientific poster design, our approach also provides a framework for learning other types of design patterns, such as website design, one-sided graphic design, etc. And by providing different training data, our approach could generate different layout styles. Our work has several limitations. In our current implementation, we do not consider fonts and use only a simple but effective aesthetic metric. We plan to address these problems in the future."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful suggestions to improve this work."}], "references": [{"title": "Method for automatic e-comic scene frame extraction for reading comic on mobile devices", "author": ["Arai", "K.

Introduction The emergence of large number of scientific papers in various academic fields and venues (conferences and journals) is noteworthy. For example, IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) accepted over 600 papers in 2016 alone. It is time-consuming to read all of these papers for the researchers, particularly those interested to holistically assess state-of-the-art or emerge with understanding of core scientific ideas explored in the last year. Converting a conference paper into a poster provides important means to efficiently and coherently convey core ideas and findings of the original paper. To achieve this goal, it is therefore essential to keep the posters readable, informative and visually aesthetic. It is challenging, however, to design a high-quality scientific poster which meets all of the above design constraints, particularly for those researchers who may not be proficient at design tasks or familiar with design packages (e.g., Adobe Illustrator). \u2217This work is supported by NSFC (61333014, 61373059, and 61321491) and JiangsuSF (BK20150016). \u2020Corresponding author Copyright c \u00a9 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. In general, poster design is a complicated and timeconsuming task; both understanding of the paper content and experience in design are required. Automatic tools for scientific poster generation would help researchers by providing them with an easier way to effectively share their research. Further, given avid amount of scientific papers on ArXiv and other on-line repositories, such tools may also provide a way for other researchers to consume the content more easily. Rather than browsing raw papers, they may be able to browse automatically generated poster previews (potentially constructed with their specific preferences in mind). However, in order to generate a scientific poster in accordance with, and representative of, the original paper, many problems need to be solved: 1) Content extraction. Both important textual and graphical content needs to be extracted from the original paper; 2) Panel layout. Content should fit each panel, and the shape and position of panels should be optimized for readability and design appeal; 3) Graphical element (figures and tables) arrangement. Within each panel, textual content can typically be sequentially itemized, but for graphical elements, their size and placement should be carefully considered. Due to these challenges, there are few automatic tools for scientific poster generation. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method for automatic scientific poster generation (given a corresponding paper).", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
