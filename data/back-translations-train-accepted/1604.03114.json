Unlike monologues, in which speakers confine themselves to expressing their own beliefs, debates allow participants to interactively attack their opponents \"points while defending their own. The resulting flow of ideas is a key feature of this discussion genre. In this work, we introduce a mathematical framework for characterizing debates with respect to the flow of conversation, which encompasses two main discussion strategies - promoting one's own points and attacking opponents\" arguments - and tracks their relative use throughout the debate. By applying this methodology to an environment in which debate winners are known, we show that discussion-oriented flow patterns are predictable, which the debater is more likely to convince an audience. Case study: Oxford-style debates provide a framework that is particularly convenient for studying the impact of the flow of conversation. In this competitive debate format, two teams argue for or against an audience to take a stand."}, {"heading": "2 Debate Dataset: Intelligence Squared", "text": "In this study, we use transcripts and results from the public debate series \"Intelligence Squared Debates\" (IQ2).2 These debates are recorded live and contain motions covering a variety of topics mitigated by for-1Other potential sources of confusion.

At the participant level, several studies present approaches to identifying ideological attitudes (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Rosenthal and McKeown, 2015) based on traits based on participants \"interactions (Thomas et al., 2006; Sridhar et al., 2015) or the elaboration of words and reasons that characterize an attitude (Monroe et al., 2008; Nguyen et al., 2014; and Hasan.)."}, {"heading": "6 Limitations and Future Work", "text": "This study opens several avenues for future research. It would be interesting to explore more complex representations of discussion points and discussion points, for example, using topic models or word embedding. Furthermore, it would be interesting to investigate the interplay between our conversation flow functions and relatively monological characteristics, which take into account the argumentative and rhetorical characteristics of each side separately. A clearer comparison and contrast of monological and interactive dynamics could lead to better conversation models. Such approaches could also help clarify some of the intuitions about conversations examined in this work, in particular that participation in dialogue has different strategic implications for self-promotion. Our focus in this paper is on capturing and understanding conversation flows. We therefore make some simplistic assumptions that can be refined in future conversations."}], "references": [{"title": "Detecting disagreement in conversations using pseudo-monologic rhetorical structure", "author": ["Kelsey Allen", "Giuseppe Carenini", "Raymond T Ng."], "venue": "Proceedings of EMNLP.", "citeRegEx": "Allen et al\\.,? 2014", "shortCiteRegEx": "Allen et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Disentangling chat", "author": ["Micha Elsner", "Eugene Charniak."], "venue": "Computational Linguistics, 36(3):389\u2013 409.", "citeRegEx": "Elsner and Charniak.,? 2010", "shortCiteRegEx": "Elsner and Charniak.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Disentangling chat with local coherence models", "author": ["Micha Elsner", "Eugene Charniak."], "venue": "Proceedings of ACL.", "citeRegEx": "Elsner and Charniak.,? 2011", "shortCiteRegEx": "Elsner and Charniak.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Classifying arguments by scheme", "author": ["Vanessa Wei Feng", "Graeme Hirst."], "venue": "Proceedings of ACL.", "citeRegEx": "Feng and Hirst.,? 2011", "shortCiteRegEx": "Feng and Hirst.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Behind the article: Recognizing dialog acts in Wikipedia talk pages", "author": ["Oliver Ferschke", "Iryna Gurevych", "Yevgen Chebotar."], "venue": "Proceedings of EACL.", "citeRegEx": "Ferschke et al\\.,? 2012", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ferschke et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Why are you taking this stance?
