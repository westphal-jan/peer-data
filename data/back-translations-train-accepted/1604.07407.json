However, this assumption is not irrefutable: there is abundant anecdotal evidence of wasteful discussions, and in our own experiments we find that over 30% of discussions are unproductive. We propose a framework for analyzing the dynamics of conversations to determine whether a particular task-oriented discussion is worthwhile or not. We use conversation patterns that reflect the flow of ideas and balance between participants, as well as their linguistic choices. We apply this framework to conversations that naturally take place in an online collaborative world-exploration game that is developed and used to support this research."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Working in teams is a common decision-making and problem-solving strategy, as it can build on effective social interaction and each member's ability to outdo individuals. Evidence shows that teams often outperform individuals (Williams and Sternberg, 1988) and even have a high chance of achieving correct responses when all team members have been wrong before (Laughlin and Adamopoulos, 1980). Moreover, team performance is not always a factor of individual intelligence, but collective intelligence (Woolley et al., 2010), with interpersonal interactions and emotional intelligence playing an important role (Jordan et al., 2002). However, as most people can attest from experience, team interaction is not always smooth, and poor coordination can lead to unproductive meetings and wasted time. In fact, Romano Jr and Nunamaker Jr. (2001) report that a third of work-related meetings in the U.S. are considered unproductive, while a Microsoft employee survey reports that 69% of meetings are ineffective."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Coetzee et al. (2015) assessed and examined the impact of a chat-based team interaction platform in massive open online courses and found that teams achieve more correct answers than individuals and that the experience is more enjoyable. A commonly studied experimental setting is the HCRC Map Task Corpus (Anderson et al., 1991), consisting of 128 conversations between pairs of people, in which one gives a guide to the other. This simplified setting avoids problems such as role-finding and leadership. Reitter and Moore (2007) note that successful dialogues are characterized by long-term adaptation and alignment of linguistic structures at the syntactical, lexical, and character levels. A notable feature of this work is the success prediction task, which is attempted only with the first 5 minutes of the conversation. Other experiments use authority-level functions inspired by negotiation theory, experimental metamorphic features, task-specific characteristics."}, {"heading": "3 Constructive Discussions", "text": "The first step in the right direction is to take the first step in the right direction in the right direction."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental setting", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 StreetCrowd", "text": "In order to study the constructiveness of taskoriented group discussion, we need an attitude that is conducive to decision-making discussions, in which all steps of the process (individual answers, average guesses, group discussions and decisions) are observable.

The StreetCrowd tutorial encourages players to avoid external resources in order to find clues and gain an unfair advantage.

Ideally, such an automatic system could prompt unproductive teams to rethink their approach or instead aggregate their individual responses. Early detection could stop non-constructive discussions or put them on the right track. To assess the feasibility of such a challenging task and compare the predictive power of our characteristics, we consider three classification goals: (+): The team outperforms its best member (cbest > 0)? (+): The team is constructive (cavg > 0)? (-): The team outperforms its worst member (cworst < 0)? To investigate early detection, we evaluate the classification performance when we measure data only from the first 20 seconds of interaction.11 Measured from the first message or message."}, {"heading": "7.2 Discussion of the results (Table 1)", "text": "We compare a baseline, which consists of team size, average number of messages per player, and conversation duration. For comparison, we refer to features of the flow of ideas and interaction dynamics (Section 6.2) as interaction, and linguistic and lexical features (Section 6.3) as linguistics. The combination model, which includes fundamentals, interaction, linguistic and linguistic n-gram features, is consistently the best and significantly exceeds random guessing (AUC.50) in almost all settings. Although the overall results are modest, the results confirm that our framework of conversation analysis has predictive power and that the challenging task of early prediction is feasible. The language used in the introduction and adoption of ideas, together with equilibrium and linguistic match features, is selected in almost all settings to determine who has the least represented class (-), indicates the highest variance in the prediction, which indicates that the problem is more complex, requiring the OS to successfully capture the data 4."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We have developed a framework based on conversation dynamics to distinguish between productive and unproductive task-oriented discussions. By applying it to an online community game we designed for this study, we reveal new interactions with conversation patterns. Constructive teams tend to be well-balanced in several ways, with team members equally involved in ideas and guesses and showing little asymmetry in language matching. Also, the flow of ideas between team mates features predictive linguistic cues, with the most constructive teams using fewer hedges when introducing and adopting ideas. We show that such cues have predictive power even when they are extracted from the first 20 seconds of conversations. In future work, improved classifiers could lead to a system that can intervene early in non-constructive discussions, track them down and avoid wasted time. Further improvement in classification performance on such a difficult task will depend on better conversation processing tools, which are robust for the game and, in particular, for the domain design of ideas."}], "references": [{"title": "The HCRC map task corpus", "author": ["Anne H Anderson", "Miles Bader", "Ellen Gurman Bard", "Elizabeth Boyle", "Gwyneth Doherty", "Simon Garrod", "Stephen Isard", "Jacqueline Kowtko", "Jan McAllister", "Jim Miller."], "venue": "Language and speech, 34(4):351\u2013366.", "citeRegEx": "Anderson et al\\.,? 1991", "shortCiteRegEx": "Anderson et al\\.", "year": 1991}, {"title": "Communication patterns in taskoriented groups", "author": ["Alex Bavelas."], "venue": "Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.", "citeRegEx": "Bavelas.,? 1950", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bavelas.", "year": 1950}, {"title": "Concreteness ratings for 40 thousand generally known English word lemmas", "author": ["Marc Brysbaert", "Amy Beth Warriner", "Victor Kuperman."], "venue": "Behavior Research Methods, 46(3):904\u2013911.", "citeRegEx": "Brysbaert et al\\.,? 2014", "shortCiteRegEx": "Brysbaert et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Structuring interactions for large-scale synchronous peer learning", "author": ["Derrick Coetzee", "Seongtaek Lim", "Armando Fox", "Bjorn Hartmann", "Marti A Hearst."], "venue": "Proceedings of CSCW.", "citeRegEx": "Coetzee et al\\.,? 2015", "shortCiteRegEx": "Coetzee et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Structural properties of work groups and their consequences for performance", "author": ["Jonathon N Cummings", "Rob Cross."], "venue": "Social Networks, 25(3):197\u2013210.", "citeRegEx": "Cummings and Cross.,? 2003", "shortCiteRegEx": "Cummings and Cross.", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Mark my words!

However, this assumption is not irrefutable: anecdotal evidence of wasteful discussions abounds, and in our own experiments we find that over 30% of discussions are unproductive. We propose a framework for analyzing conversational dynamics in order to determine whether a given task-oriented discussion is worth having or not. We exploit conversational patterns reflecting the flow of ideas and the balance between the participants, as well as their linguistic choices. We apply this framework to conversations naturally occurring in an online collaborative world exploration game developed and deployed to support this research. Using this setting, we show that linguistic cues and conversational patterns extracted from the first 20 seconds of a team discussion are predictive of whether it will be a wasteful or a productive one.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
