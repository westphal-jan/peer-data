In this thesis we present a framework for an integrated temporal and causal relation extraction system. We first develop a robust extraction component for each type of relations, i.e. temporal order and causality. We then combine the two extraction components into an integrated relation extraction system, CATENA---CAusal and Temporal relation Extraction from NAtural language texts---, by utilizing the presumption about event precedence in causality, that causing events must happened BEFORE resulting events. Several resources and techniques to improve our relation extraction systems are also discussed, including word embeddings and training data expansion. Finally, we report our adaptation efforts of temporal information processing for languages other than English, namely Italian and Indonesian.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Apr 2016 15:52:18 GMT  (1106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08120v1", "PhD Thesis"]], "COMMENTS": "PhD Thesis", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["paramita mirza"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.08120"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.08120.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Extracting Temporal and Causal Relations between Events", "authors": ["Paramita Mirza", "Sara Tonelli"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "PhD Dissertation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "International Doctorate School in Information and Communication Technologies", "text": "DISI - University of TrentoExtracting Temporal and Causal Relations between EventsParamita MirzaAdvisor: Dr. Sara TonelliUniversit\u00e0 degli Studi di TrentoApril 2016ar Xiv: 160 4 / 08 / 120v 1 [cs.C L] 27 Apr 201 6Paramita Mirza: Extracting Temporal and Causal Relations between Events \u00a9 April 2016Post hoc ergo propter hoc.

We first develop a robust extraction component for each type of relations, i.e. temporal order and causality. We then combine the two extraction components into an integrated relation extraction system, CATENA\u2014CAusal and Temporal relation Extraction from NAtural language texts\u2014, by utilizing the presumption about event precedence in causality, that causing events must happened BEFORE resulting events. Several resources and techniques to improve our relation extraction systems are also discussed, including word embeddings and training data expansion.
