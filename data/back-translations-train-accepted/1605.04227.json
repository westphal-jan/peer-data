We refer to this problem as Relation Schema Induction (RSI). While Open Information Extraction (OIE) techniques aim at extracting surface level triples of the form (John, underwent, Angioplasty), they don't induce the yet unknown schema of relations themselves. Tensors provide a natural representation for such triples, and factorization of such tensors provide a plausible solution for the RSI problem. To the best of our knowledge, tensor factorization methods have not been used for the RSI problem. We fill this gap and propose Coupled Non-negative Tensor Factorization (CNTF), a tensor factorization method which is able to incorporate additional side information in a principled way for more effective Relation Schema Induction. We report our findings on multiple real-world datasets and demonstrate CNTF's effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines both in terms of accuracy and speed.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 May 2016 19:44:04 GMT  (323kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04227v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 17 May 2016 04:57:09 GMT  (323kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04227v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 04:53:42 GMT  (286kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04227v3", "Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, November 2016.

To further evaluate this thesis, we compare the performance of SICTF with its repositioned versions: (1) SICTF (\u03bbrel = 0), which corresponds to the setting when no relational information is used, (2) SICTF (\u03bbnp = 0), which corresponds to the setting when no ancillary information of any kind is used. Hyperparameters are adjusted separately for the variants of SICTF. Results are presented in the first four lines of Table 6. Therefore, we find that additional coupling through the page information significantly improves the performance of SICTF."}, {"heading": "4.3.3 Importance of Non-Negativity on Relation Schema Induction", "text": "In the last row of Table 6, we also present a stripped-down version of SICTF, if no ancillary information is used, no non-negativity limitations. Comparing the last two rows of this table, we find that non-negativity limitations over the A matrix and the core tensor R result in a significant performance improvement. We note that the last row in Table 6 corresponds to RESCAL (Nickel et al., 2011) and the fourth row Non-Negative RESCAL (Krompass et al., 2013), two tensor factoring techniques. We also note that none of these tensor factoring techniques has previously been used for the relationship schema induction problem. The reason for this improved performance can be explained by the fact that the lack of a non-negativity limitation leads to an insufficient factoring problem, where the model often overgenerates wrong triples and then compensates them with a more compensated factor."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "Relation Schema Induction (RSI) is an important first step in building a Knowledge Graph (KG) from text corpus of a particular domain. While human domain experts have traditionally prepared a listing of relationships and their schemas, this expert-mediated model presents significant challenges in terms of scalability and coverage. To address these challenges, in this paper we present SICTF, a novel non-negative coupled tensor matrix factorization method for relation schema induction. SICTF is flexible enough to include various types of ancillary information during factorization. By conducting extensive experiments with real-world data sets, we find that SICTF is not only more precise, but also significantly faster (approximately 11.8-fold acceleration) than modern baseline models. As part of future work, we hope to further analyze CNTF credits, apply labels to induced categories, and apply the model to other domains."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "Thanks to the members of MALL Lab, IISc, who read our designs and gave valuable feedback, and we also thank the reviewers for their constructive reviews.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of tensor factorization for the RSI problem.
