While counseling and psychotherapy can be effective treatments, our knowledge about how to conduct successful counseling conversations has been limited due to lack of large-scale data with labeled outcomes of the conversations. In this paper, we present a large-scale, quantitative study on the discourse of text-message-based counseling conversations. We develop a set of novel computational discourse analysis methods to measure how various linguistic aspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes. Applying techniques such as sequence-based conversation models, language model comparisons, message clustering, and psycholinguistics-inspired word frequency analyses, we discover actionable conversation strategies that are associated with better conversation outcomes.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 14 May 2016 20:02:05 GMT  (14102kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04462v1", "preprint of paper accepted to TACL, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 22 Jul 2016 16:55:12 GMT  (14102kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04462v2", "preprint of paper accepted to TACL, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016"], ["v3", "Sun, 14 Aug 2016 20:45:55 GMT  (14102kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04462v3", "preprint of paper accepted to TACL, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "preprint of paper accepted to TACL, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["tim althoff", "kevin clark", "jure leskovec"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.04462"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.04462.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Large-scale Analysis of Counseling Conversations: An Application of Natural Language Processing to Mental Health", "authors": ["Tim Althoff", "Kevin Clark", "Jure Leskovec"], "emails": ["jure}@cs.stanford.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is such that we are able to put ourselves in another world, in which we go to another world, in which we go to another world, in which we go to another world, in which we live in another world, in which we live in another world, in which we live in another world, in which we live in another world, in which we live in a world, in which we live in another world, in which we live in another world, in which we live in which we live in another world, in which we live in which we live in another world, in which we live in which we live in another world, in which we live in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, we live, in which we live, we live in which we live, we live in which we live, in which we live, we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live,"}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "The field of conversation analysis was born in the 1960s from a suicide prevention center (Sacks and Jefferson, 1995; Van Dijk, 1997).Since then, conversation analysis has been applied to various clinical contexts, including psychotherapy (Labov and Fanshel, 1977).Work in psycholinguistics has shown that the words people use reveal important aspects of their social and psychological worlds (Pennebaker et al., 2003).Previous work also has linguistic cubes associated with depression (Ramirez-Esparza et al)."}, {"heading": "3 Dataset Description", "text": "In this paper, we examine anonymous counseling calls from a non-profit organization that provides free crisis intervention via SMS messages. Text-based counseling calls are particularly useful for conversation analysis because all interactions between the two dialogue partners are fully monitored (i.e., there are no non-textual or non-verbal cues); in addition, the conversations are important because they are limited to the dialogue between two people; and the results can be clearly defined (i.e., we follow the interlocutor to see if he or she feels better afterwards), linking the study of conversation characteristics to the actual outcomes; the counseling process can provide the organization's public number to any person in difficulty; incoming requests are queued and an available counselor chooses the request from the queue and engages in the in-depth conversation; we refer to the crisis counselor as a counselor and the person in distress."}, {"heading": "4 Defining Counseling Quality", "text": "The primary objective of this strategy is to conduct the discussions with positive results."}, {"heading": "5 Counselor Adaptability", "text": "In the rest of the paper, we focus on factors that convey the outcome of a conversation. First, we examine whether successful consultants are more aware that their current conversation is going well or badly, and how the consultant adapts to the situation. We examine this question by looking for language differences between positive and negative conversations. In particular, we calculate a distance measure between the language consultants used in positive conversations and the language consultants used in negative conversations, and observe how this distance changes over time.We capture the time dimension by splitting each conversation into five equal parts of messages. Then, for each group of consultants (more successful or less successful), conversation outcomes (positive or negative), and chunks (first 20%, second 20%, etc.), we calculate a TF-IDF vector of word events to represent the language of the consultants within that subset."}, {"heading": "6 Reacting to Ambiguity", "text": "In the observation that successful consultants adapt better to the conversation, we next examine how consultants differ and what factors determine the differences. In particular, domain experts have suggested that more successful consultants should better deal with ambiguities in conversation (Levitt and Jacques, 2005). In this context, we use ambiguity to point out the uncertainty of the situation and the real core problem of the copywriter resulting from insufficiently short or uncertain descriptions. Does initial ambiguity of the situation negatively affect the conversation? How do more successful consultants deal with ambiguous situations? Ambiguity. In this section, we measure ambiguity in conversation as the brevity of the copywriter's answers in the number of words. While ambiguity could also be measured by concrete evaluations of the words in each message (e.g. by using concrete reviews by Brysbaert et al. (2014)), we find that the results are very similar and that length and concreteness are strongly interrelated and difficult to distinguish."}, {"heading": "6.1 Initial Ambiguity and Situation Setter", "text": "It is difficult to measure ambiguity and responses to ambiguity at arbitrary points throughout the conversation, as they depend heavily on the context of the entire conversation (i.e. all previous messages and questions), but we can examine almost identical beginnings of conversations, where we can directly compare how successful and less successful consultants react in the face of almost identical situations (the copywriter first informs the reason for inserting text messages).We identify the situation setter within each conversation as the first long message from the copywriter (typically a response to a \"Can you tell me more about what is going on?\" question from the consultant).Results Results. We find that ambiguity plays an important role in counseling. Figure 3 shows that more ambiguous situations (shorter settings of the situation) are less likely to lead to successful conversations (we get similar results when measuring concreteness (Brysbaert et al., 2014)."}, {"heading": "6.2 How to Respond to Ambiguity", "text": "Having observed that ambiguity plays an important role in consultations, we are now examining in more detail how consultants respond to almost identical situations.1 We compare situation setters by representing them with TF-IDF vectors on bigrams and find similar situation setters as nearest neighbours within a certain cosinal distance in the induced space.1 We are looking at situation setters that are part of a dense cluster with at least 10 neighbours so that we can compare consultants \"follow-up pulses (4829 / 12770 situation setters were part of one of 589 such clusters).We also use distributed word embedding (e.g. Mikolov et al., 2013) rather than comparing TF-IDF vectors, but found that the latter produce better clues. Based on counsellor training materials, we hypothesize that more successful counsellors address ambiguity by writing more themselves, \u2022 using more check questions (statements that the interlocutor chooses manually, which they understand according to Thitl1)."}, {"heading": "6.3 Response Templates and Creativity", "text": "In Section 6.2, we observed that more successful consultants use certain templates (including check questions, suicidal thoughts, affirmation, and the use of hedges), which might suggest that consultants should stick to such predefined templates, but we note that more successful consultants do indeed respond more creatively. We define a measure of how \"tempted\" consultants \"responses are by counting the number of similar responses in the TF-IDF space for the consultant's response (see Section 6.2; also using a manually defined and validated cosinal distance threshold). Figure 5 shows that more successful consultants use less frequent / tempted questions, indicating that more successful consultants follow certain patterns but are more creative in their response to each situation. Adapting these responses requires more effort by the consultant, which is consistent with the results in Figure 1, which shows that more successful consultants also make more effort to write longer messages."}, {"heading": "7 Ensuring Conversation Progress", "text": "Having identified differences in content between consultants, we are now examining temporal differences in the way consultants progress through conversations. By using an unsupervised conversation model, we are able to identify different stages of conversation and find differences between consultants in how they move through these stages. We are also providing evidence that these differences may be related to power and authority by measuring the linguistic coordination between consultants and copywriters."}, {"heading": "7.1 Unsupervised Conversation Model", "text": "Typically, consultants introduce themselves first, get to know the copywriter and his situation, and then engage in constructive problem solving. We use uncontrolled conversation modeling techniques to capture this tiered structure within conversations. Our conversation model is a hidden Markov model (HMM) at the embassy level. Figure 6 illustrates the basic model in which hidden states of HMM represent conversation stages. Unlike previous conversation modeling work, we impose a fixed sequence on the stages and only allow transitions from the current level to the next (Figure 7), which results in learning a fixed dialogue structure common to all consultation sessions, as opposed to conversation topics. In addition, we model counselors and text messages separately, treating their turns in conversation as different states."}, {"heading": "7.2 Analyzing Counselor Progression", "text": "To find out how the consultants go through each phase, we use the Viterbi algorithm to assign the most likely sequence of phases to each conversation according to our conversation model. We then calculate the average duration of messages for each phase for more or less successful consultants. We control the differential distribution of positive and negative conversations between more successful and less successful consultants by assigning equal weight and control over different conversation lengths to the two classes by including only conversations between 40 and 60 message lengths. Results: Successful consultants move faster through the earlier phases, particularly phase 2, and spend more time in later phases, especially phase 4 (Figure 8), indicating that they are able to get to know the copywriter faster and then spend more time in the problem-solving phase of the conversation, which may be one of the reasons they are more successful."}, {"heading": "7.3 Coordination and Power Differences", "text": "One possible explanation for the more successful councils is that they have more \"power\" to talk and thus have more control over the course of the talks."}, {"heading": "8 Facilitating Perspective Change", "text": "Thus, we have examined the dynamics of conversation and its relationship to conversation success from the perspective of the consultant. In this section, we show that a change in perspective in copywriters over time is associated with a higher likelihood of conversation success. Prior to the work, it was shown that daily changes in writing style are associated with positive health outcomes (Campbell and Pennebaker, 2003), and existing theories combine with a negative view of the future (Pyszczynski et al., 1987) and with a selective style (Pyszczynski and Greenberg, 1987). We propose quantifying three orthogonal aspects of perspective change in a single conversation: time, self, and sensation, which we show that Counselective style can actively bring about perspective changes. We are beginning to explain their problem largely in relation to the past and present (see Figure 9A)."}, {"heading": "9 Predicting Counseling Success", "text": "In this section, we combine our quantitative insights into a predictive task. We show that the linguistic aspects of crisis counseling in the previous sections have a predictable power at the level of individual conversations by evaluating their effectiveness as characteristics in classifying the results of conversations. In particular, we create a balanced dataset of more than 30 messages and train a logistic regression model to predict the outcome given the first x% of messages in conversation. There are 3619 such negative conversations and we subsume the larger set of positive conversations. We train the model with a parentage degree of L1 regression when the n-gram characteristics are present and the L2 regularization is different. We evaluate our model with 10-fold cross-validation and compare models using the ROC curve."}, {"heading": "10 Conclusion & Future Work", "text": "Knowledge of how to conduct a successful counseling conversation has been limited by the fact that studies have largely remained qualitative and small-scale. In this work, we presented a large-scale quantative study of the discourse of counseling conversations. We developed a set of novel computational discourse analysis methods that are suitable for large-scale datasets, and used them to find actionable conversation strategies that are associated with better conversation outcomes. We hope that this work will inspire future generations of tools that are available to both people in crisis and their counselors. For example, our findings could help improve counseling training and lead to high-quality real-time monitoring and response support tools.

While counseling and psychotherapy can be effective treatments, our knowledge about how to conduct successful counseling conversations has been limited due to lack of large-scale data with labeled outcomes of the conversations. In this paper, we present a large-scale, quantitative study on the discourse of text-message-based counseling conversations. We develop a set of novel computational discourse analysis methods to measure how various linguistic aspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes. Applying techniques such as sequence-based conversation models, language model comparisons, message clustering, and psycholinguistics-inspired word frequency analyses, we discover actionable conversation strategies that are associated with better conversation outcomes.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
