(In addition to potential cadaveric transplantation via the deceased donor waiting list, a recent innovation - kidney swapping (Rapaport 1986; Roth, So \ufffd nmez, and U \ufffd nver 2004) - allows patients with willing living donors to participate in cyclical donor swaps or altruistic donor chains to obtain a life-saving organ. Kidney swapping now accounts for more than 10% of living donors in the U.S., with that percentage increasing annually. In reality, participating patients and donors are endowed with a number of attributes: blood type, tissue type, age, insurance, home transplant center, travel readiness, and myriad other metrics of health, personal preferences, and logistical constraints that can change at cost temporarily or permanently."}, {"heading": "2 A New Model for Kidney Exchange", "text": "In this section, we formalize our model of renal exchange. We demonstrate that within the framework of this model, certain known NPhard problems in general renal exchange can be solved in polynomic time. We also show that determining the best attributes for change (at a certain cost) in polynomic time can be solved by creating a compatibility graph."}, {"heading": "2.1 Notation & Preliminaries", "text": "A kidney exchange can be represented by a directed compatibility curve G = (V, E). Each patient-donor pair, or unpaired altruistic donors, forms a vertex V, and a directed edge exists from one vertex to the other if the donor can give to the patient with the former, i.e., are compatible (Roth, So \ufffd nmez, and U \ufffd nver 2004; Roth, So \ufffd nmez, and U \ufffd nver 2005).ar Xiv: 160 5.07 728v 2 [cs.A I] 1 6D ec2 016In kidney exchange, patients and donors participate in cycles or chains. In a cycle, each participating vertex receives the kidney of the previous vertex. All transplants in a cycle must be performed simultaneously to ensure participation, and are thus limited to a small length in practice. This ensures that no donor withdraws a kidney before donor has donated one."}, {"heading": "2.2 The Clearing Problem is Easy (in Theory)", "text": "It is not as if this is a \"cycle\" that solves the L-CYCLE-COVER problem in practice - that is, the search for the largest disjoint packing of cycles of length per se is solvable. For the simplicity of exposure in this section, we use \"cycles\" to refer to both cycles and chains; in fact, it is easy to see that altruistic donors are equivalent to standard patients-2To see why this is the case when a donor withdraws from a chain of patients, but before his or her own donation."}, {"heading": "2.3 Flipping Attributes is Also Easy (in Theory)", "text": "While patients and donors in a kidney exchange are endowed with an initial set of characteristics, in practice it may be possible to change a number of these attributes to effect the final adjustment. For example, the human body naturally tries to reject a transplanted organ to varying degrees - but at a certain cost to the overall health of the patient. With this in mind, we expand the model of Section 2.2 as follows: Associate a cost type with each pair of types."}, {"heading": "3 A Concrete Instantiation: Thresholding", "text": "In this section, we associate with each patient and donor a bit vector of length k, counting incompatibilities based on any split activated bits between a patient and a potential donor. As a concrete example, we consider human blood types. At a high level, human blood contains A antigens, B antigens, both (type AB) or both (type O). McD patients can receive a bit from any donor, A type and potential donor (B type), B antigens, B antigens, both (type O), or none (type O). McD type patients can receive a bit from any donor, A type and A type (B type) donor, and O type patients can receive only one bit. In our bit model, this is represented by k = 2. The first bit represents compatibility with A antigens, and the second bit compatibility with B type."}, {"heading": "3.1 Existence of Small Representations", "text": "It is natural to ask for what values of t and k, we can create wells with bit vectors di and pi of length k = 1, how f tthresh each individual graph of a certain size? Formally, we say that G (k, t) -representable (by feasibility function f tthresh), if, for all i, pj2) s, pj2) s, Po \"s, and Po\" sa 1966), each graph can be represented as an intersection chapter with k, n2 / 4. Nevertheless, we show next that, in our model, k \"n, any graph is represented. It is akin a result on the term rank of the adjacency matrix of G (Orlin, Thm 6)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Computational Issues", "text": "Considering a real compatibility graph with n vertices, we know through Theorem 3 that we can represent this graph for k = n (k, 0), but in practice, how big a k must actually be? Various problems related to intersection graphs are NPcomplete for general graphs (Kou, Stockmeyer, and Wong 1978; Orlin 1977), but we work in an environment with additional structure. And while we do not show that finding a (k, t) representation is isNP-hard, we show that a slightly harder problem, which we call (k, t) -REPRESENTATIONWITH-IGNORED-EDGES, is NP-hard. Given an input of a directed graph G = (V, E), a subset F of (V 2), and integer k, 1 and t-0, affects this problem."}, {"heading": "4 Computing Small Representations of Real Kidney Exchange Compatibility Graphs", "text": "In this section, we test our hypothesis that real compatibility graphs can be represented by a much smaller number of attributes than the theoretical worst-case results of Section 3. We begin by introducing general mathematical programming techniques to determine whether a given graph G = (V, E) can be represented, and then use real and generated compatibility graphs from UNOS-wide kidney exchange to show that a small k is sufficient for (k, 0) representations, and conclude by researching the approval of larger thresholds t to match size. Even small thresholds t > 0 lead to considerable societal gains.5"}, {"heading": "4.1 Mathematical Programming Formulations", "text": "The implementation of f tthresh can be limited to the smallest graphics.

We are now examining this line of reasoning - namely, increasing the t in f tthresh instead of k, which is now endogenous to the underlying model - on realistically generated UNOS diagrams of various sizes.Figure 4 shows the impact on the percentage of patient pairs that match by 2- and 3-cycles, as a global threshold t progressively goes from t = 0 (the current status quo) to t = 5. Intuitively, larger compatibility diagrams result in a larger fraction of pairs matching; however, a complementary approach - which densifies the graph - leads to enormous efficiency gains of t = 4x (depending on the problem found), that a larger fraction of the pairs that most quickly matches to an optimal line is increased from 5x to 5x."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions & Future Research", "text": "Motivated by the increasing size of real kidney exchange, we presented a compact approach to modelling kidney exchange compatibility diagrams. Our approach is closely related to the classical theory of crossing diagrams and can be considered as the first research and practical application of p-section diagrams. We provided necessary and sufficient conditions for lossless reduction of the representation of an arbitrary compatibility diagram in this model. However, real compatibility diagrams are not arbitrary and are created based on the characteristics of patients and donors. Using real data from the US-wide kidney exchange of UNOS, we demonstrated that the use of only a small number of attributes is sufficient to represent real diagrams. This observation is of potential practical importance; if real diagrams can be represented by a constant number of attributes, then central hard NP problems in general kidney exchange are resolved (in general kidney exchange)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grants CCF-1215883, CCF-1525932, IIS-1350598, IIS-1617590, IIS-1320620 and IIS-1546752, the Army Research Office (ARO) under grants W911NF-16-1-0061, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) under grants N00014-16-1-3075, a Sloan Research Fellowship, a Facebook Fellowship and a Siebel Scholarship.
