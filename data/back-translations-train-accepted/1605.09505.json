The system supports different scenario configurations based on historical data. The responses presented by the Virtual-Suspect are selected based on the psychological state of the suspect, which can be configured as well. Furthermore, each interrogator's statement affects the Virtual-Suspect's current psychological state, which may lead the interrogation in different directions. In addition, the model takes into account the context in which the statements are made.

The main role of police interrogations is to encourage the suspect to incriminate himself and gather more information about the case. Often, the physical evidence available in a particular investigation is scarce, which makes the interrogation practice much more critical. Therefore, police cadets undergo strict interrogation practice. One of the leading training techniques is a one-to-one simulation. In these face-to-face sessions, a trained instructor conducts an interrogation practice that does the job of the investigators."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "The effectiveness of virtual humans in educational systems has been extensively studied in computer science [1,2,3]. Anderson et al. [4] introduced the TARDIS, an interview coaching system for training scenario-based interactions. The framework includes a sub-module Non-Verbal Behavior Analyzer (NovA) that can detect several lower-level social cues, such as hands-to-face, forward-leaning or backward-leaning postures, among others. Luciew et al. [5] presented an immersive interrogation simulation designed specifically for training law enforcement personnel who have been victims of sexual abuse and question suspects on the subject. The study places a strong emphasis on the interpretation of nonverbal behavior by police officers during an interview or interrogation. Other researchers have focused their attention on the virtual Suspect Suspect psychological model. Roque and Dream Adjants [6] contradicted contradictory levels, three and three."}, {"heading": "3 Methodology", "text": "The Virtual-Suspect simulation system proposed in this paper enables the simultaneous simulation of multiple interrogation cases and supports different Virtual-Suspect personality configurations. In addition, a simulated interrogation can be deployed in many different directions depending on the trainee's behavior. In order to provide this flexibility, the system consists of two main components: the first component is the simulation configuration and the second component is the Virtual-Suspect Response model. In the following, a detailed description and a formal presentation of these two components and their subcomponents are presented."}, {"heading": "3.1 Simulation Configuration", "text": "In fact, the situation in the USA is similar to that in other countries of the world, in which people are able to survive themselves.

The first two components are the long-term and short-term memory responses. The third component, and probably most important, is access to the Internet-based database of the Virtual-Suspect to retrieve personal information and past events. Equally important is the way in which a researcher's testimony affects the internal state of the Virtual-Suspect. Finally, all of the above components are combined to produce the Virtual-Suspect response (see Section 3.2.3). As in Figure 2, once a statement q is selected, the response model is combined with the following steps to produce the Virtual-Suspect response."}, {"heading": "4 Experiment", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Methodology", "text": "Participants were asked to read transcripts of three interrogation simulations and answer a series of questions. As described in Section 3.1.1, the interrogation scenario selected for the experiment is based on an actual intrusion case from early 2013 (see Example 1). In addition, the personality profile of the virtual suspect was chosen to represent a moderately calm individual. Specifically, the initial internal state vector was set to s0 = (0, 0, \u2212 3) for the personality traits of psychotism, extraversion and neuroticism. Furthermore, the volatility parameter was set to \u03c3 = (0.5, 0.5). In the following subsections, a detailed description of the methodology of the experiment was presented."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results", "text": "As described in Section 4.1, participants were asked to read the three simulation transcripts carefully and to answer a series of questions. However, since the hypothesis of the experiment was that people find it difficult to distinguish between a human and the RMVS, participants were confronted with the following question: \"However, the answers of the suspect in the transcripts were selected from an existing response database.\" In some of the transcriptions, the answers were selected by a human participant, and in the others by a computer. Would you say that in this current transcription, the answers were selected by the human participant or computer? \"Participants were asked to state their belief in a likert-type test ranging from one to five, with the answers of the suspect selected by one to five people, with the answers of the suspect selected by a computer."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this thesis, the Virtual Suspect System, which consists of a configurable simulation and the Virtual Suspect Response Model (RMVS), was presented; the Scenario Configuration and Interrogative Interviewing databases allow the simulation of multiple interrogations; in addition, the personality profile of the Virtual Suspect, which is based on Eysenck's PEN model, can be configured; and the Virtual Suspect Response Model (RMVS) was presented; for each interrogator's testimony, the RMVS updates the internal state vector and converts it into the mental integrity vector, which determines the likelihood of a truthful, deceptive or neutral response; and finally, a perception experiment was conducted comparing the RMVS, human and random responses."}], "references": [{"title": "Interactive training applications using responsive virtual human technology", "author": ["R.C.
