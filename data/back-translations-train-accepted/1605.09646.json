It is of high interest in compressed sensing and statistical learning. This property is particularly important for computationally efficient recovery methods. As a consequence, even though it is in general NP-hard to check that RIP holds, there have been substantial efforts to find tractable proxies for it. These would allow the construction of RIP matrices and the polynomial-time verification of RIP given an arbitrary matrix. We consider the framework of average-case certifiers, that never wrongly declare that a matrix is RIP, while being often correct for random instances. While there are such functions which are tractable in a suboptimal parameter regime, we show that this is a computationally hard task in any better regime. Our results are based on a new, weaker assumption on the problem of detecting dense subgraphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 May 2016 14:38:03 GMT  (52kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09646v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CC math.ST stat.ML stat.TH", "authors": ["tengyao wang", "quentin berthet", "yaniv plan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.09646"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.09646.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Average-case hardness of RIP certification", "authors": ["Tengyao Wang", "Quentin Berthet", "Yaniv Plan"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is of great interest to use this structure to improve our ability to describe the characteristics of the signal and to make future predictions.

However, there is no known way to generate them deterministically in general, and it is even difficult to verify whether a given matrix X belongs to RIPn, p (k, \u03b8) (see, e.g. Bandeira et al., 2012). Several deterministic constructions of RIP matrices exist for a random distribution k (see, Bandeira et al., 2012).

It would still be of great use to have an algorithm that identifies an average definition of the RIP condition for an average definition of a definition of a definition of a definition of a definition of RIP matrices that are generated by a random definition and do not make false positive assertions.
