Coordination is a common syntactic phenomenon and work has been done to improve the prediction of coordination structures in general cases (Hogan, 2007; Hara et al., 2009; Shimbo and Hara, 2007; Okuma et al., 2009). In this paper, we focus on a specific coordination structure: Argument Cluster Coordination (ACC). While ACC is not common in Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993), it usually appears in other companies.

Since the test and developer sets of the PTB contain only 12 ACC structures that are from and or, we evaluate the parser on Regents, a dataset in which ACC structures predominate (details see below). Since regents do not contain syntactic structures, we focus on the ACC phenomena and evaluate the ability of the parsers to correctly identify the spans of the clusters and the arguments in them. To ensure that the new representation does not affect overall parsing performance, we also evaluate the parer with respect to the traditional development and test sets (sections 22 and 23).As shown in Table 2, the parser results are slightly better when trained with the modified trees.2"}, {"heading": "4.1 Regents data-set", "text": "Regents - a dataset of questions from the Regents 4th grade science exam (the Aristo Challenge), 3 includes 281 sentences with coordination phrases, where 54 of them include argument cluster coordination. We commented on the sentences manually by marking the conjunction spans for the constituent coordination sentences, e.g.: Wendy (ran 19 miles) and (ran 9 miles), as well as the spans of each component of the argumentation cluster coordination, including the inner span of each argument: Mary paid ([$11.08] [for berries]), ([$14.33] [for apples], and ([$9.31] [for peaches]). The bracket in this sentence follows our proposed ACC bracket, and we refer to it as ACCOUR.We also created a version in which the bracket follows the PTB scheme, with the verb included in the span of the first cluster, e.g.: Mary (paid] [11.08] [for berries, [12] for berries, [33] for trees]."}, {"heading": "A restaurant served (9 pizzas during lunch) and (6 during dinner) today", "text": "A prediction of (\"9 pizzas at lunch,\" \"6 at dinner\") is considered incorrect because the second conjunction boundaries do not match the gold annotation. We compare the recall value that the parser achieves when trained on the modified trees with the result that the parser succeeds on the original PTB trees, compared to only 47% when trained on the original PTB trees. We will now focus on the specific ACC cases (Table 3). When evaluating the PTB-trained parsers, the recovery of 54.3% of the span was used, compared to only 47% when trained on the original PTB pedals."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "By focusing on the details of a single and relatively rare syntactic construction, the coordination of argumentation clusters, we have been able to significantly improve the analysis results for this construction, while at the same time slightly improving the overall analysis results. More generally, while most current research efforts in natural language processing and syntactic parsing focus on the conception of universal data agnostic techniques, such methods work on common phenomena, often neglecting the very long tail of important constructions. This work shows that there are also benefits to focusing on the details of certain linguistic phenomena and altering the data in such a way that a \"data agnostic\" system is easier to learn."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the German Research Foundation via the German-Israeli Project Cooperation (DIP, funding DA 1600 / 1-1)."}], "references": [{"title": "Bracketing guidelines for treebank ii style penn treebank project", "author": ["Bies et al.1995] Ann Bies", "Mark Ferguson", "Karen Katz", "Robert MacIntyre", "Victoria Tredinnick", "Grace Kim", "Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz", "Britta Schasberger"], "venue": "Pennsyl-", "citeRegEx": "Bies et al\\.,? \\Q1995\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bies et al\\.", "year": 1995}, {"title": "Type raising, functional composition, and non-constituent conjuncThis measurement is relevant only when parsing", "author": ["David Dowty"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Dowty.,? \\Q1988\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dowty.", "year": 1988}, {"title": "Coordinate structure analysis with global structural constraints and alignment-based local features", "author": ["Hara et al.2009] Kazuo Hara", "Masashi Shimbo", "Hideharu Okuma", "Yuji Matsumoto"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Joint Conference of the 47th Annual", "citeRegEx": "Hara et al\\.,? \\Q2009\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Hara et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Coordinate noun phrase disambiguation in a generative parsing model.
