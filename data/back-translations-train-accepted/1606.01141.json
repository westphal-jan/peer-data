Assignment kernels, in contrast, are obtained from an optimal bijection between parts, which can provide a more valid notion of similarity. In general however, optimal assignments yield indefinite functions, which complicates their use in kernel methods. We characterize a class of base kernels used to compare parts that guarantees positive semidefinite optimal assignment kernels. These base kernels give rise to hierarchies from which the optimal assignment kernels are computed in linear time by histogram intersection.

We call \u03c6 a feature card, and H a feature space.

The extent of improvement compared to the other data sets varies, but is particularly noteworthy for ENZYMES and REDDIT. This suggests that optimal assignment cores for these classification tasks offer a more valid idea of similarity than folding cores. The most successful kernel is WL-OA, which almost consistently improves over WL and performs best in seven of the nine data sets. WL-OA provides the second-best accuracy in D & D and ranks in the middle for MUTAG. For these two data, the accuracy difference between the cores is small and even the best performance for seven of the nine data sets. The time to compute the square kernel matrix was less than one minute for all cores, with the time between the cores D and DLAB (the optimal time for the lead time of DLAS 29 and DLAS) being the fastest."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and future work", "text": "We have characterized the class of strong cores that leads to valid, optimal assignment cores and have derived novel, effective cores for graphs from them.

kernel methods has initiated the design of novel positive semidefinite functions, in particular for structured data. A leading design paradigm for this is the convolution kernel, which decomposes structured objects into their parts and sums over all pairs of parts. Assignment kernels, in contrast, are obtained from an optimal bijection between parts, which can provide a more valid notion of similarity. In general however, optimal assignments yield indefinite functions, which complicates their use in kernel methods. We characterize a class of base kernels used to compare parts that guarantees positive semidefinite optimal assignment kernels. These base kernels give rise to hierarchies from which the optimal assignment kernels are computed in linear time by histogram intersection. We apply these results by developing the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel for graphs. It provides high classification accuracy on widely-used benchmark data sets improving over the original Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
