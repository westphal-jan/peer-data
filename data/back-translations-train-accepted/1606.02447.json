It is inspired by Wittgenstein's language games: a human wishes to accomplish some task (e.g., achieving a certain configuration of blocks), but can only communicate with a computer, who performs the actual actions (e.g., removing all red blocks). The computer initially knows nothing about language and therefore must learn it from scratch through interaction, while the human adapts to the computer's capabilities. We created a game in a blocks world and collected interactions from 100 people playing it. First, we analyze the humans' strategies, showing that using compositionality and avoiding synonyms correlates positively with task performance. Second, we compare computer strategies, showing how to quickly learn a semantic parsing model from scratch, and that modeling pragmatics further accelerates learning for successful players.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 08:27:09 GMT  (304kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02447v1", "11 pages, ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, ACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["sida i wang", "percy liang", "christopher d manning"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.02447"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.02447.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning Language Games through Interaction", "authors": ["Sida I.

With Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), we paid 100 workers $3 per person to play SHRDLURN. In total, we have 10,223 utterances along with their initial states. Of these, 8,874 utterances are labeled y; the rest are unlabeled as the player can try every utterance without accepting an action. 100 players have the entire game under identical settings.5 Technically, we also have to label random utterances with their terms y. We have consciously chosen to start from scratch for each worker so we can study the variety of strategies different people use in a controlled environment.Each game consists of 50 blocks of tasks, divided into 5 levels of 10 tasks each, with increasing complexity. Each level aims to achieve an end goal by giving an initial state. Each game took an average of 89 utterances to complete."}, {"heading": "5.2 Human strategies", "text": "Most players have invented their own language, which is more precise than general English. One player has used Polish, and another has used Polish notation (below in Table 3). This number is not 50, because some block tasks require several steps and players are allowed to explore even without reaching the goal. Overall, we find that many players adapt to ILLG by becoming more consistent, and more accurate even when using standard English at the beginning. For example, some players have become more consistent over time (e.g. by \"removing\" and \"discarding\" both, just by \"removing holes.\" In terms of expressiveness, removing functional words such as determiners as the game progresses. \"In each of the following examples of different players, we compare a statement that appeared early in the game with a similar statement that appeared later."}, {"heading": "5.3 Computer strategies", "text": "We now present quantitative results on how fast the computer can learn, with our goal being to achieve high accuracy in new utterances as we only make a single pass over the data. The number of scrolls used to evaluate the player is sensitive to outliers and not as intuitive as accuracy. Instead, we look at online accuracy, which is described as follows. Formally, when a player produces T utterances x (j) and labels them y (j), the online accuracy is def = 1T x x = 1 I [y (j) = Jz (j) Ks (j)]], where z (j) = argmaxz shapes (j \u2212 1) (z | x (j))))) the model prediction based on the previous parameter. (j \u2212 1) Note that online accuracy is defined in terms of the labels reported by the player, which is only true accuracy if the player is accurate and honest."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work and Discussion", "text": "Our work combines with a wide range of work on grounded language, in which language is used in some environments as a means of achieving a specific goal. Examples include playing games (Branavan et al., 2009, 2010; Reckman et al., 2010) that interact with robotics (Tellex et al., 2011, 2014), and following instructions (Vogel et al., 2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013) Semantic analysis of utterances about logical forms we use play an important role in these settings (Kollar et al., 2010; Matuszek et al., 2012; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013). What makes this work unique is our new interactive learning of language games (ILLG), in which a model must learn a language from scratch through interaction. While online gradient descent is commonly used, for example in semantic parsing."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "DARPA Communicating with Computers (CwC) program under ARO Prime contract number W911NF15-1-0462.

It is inspired by Wittgenstein\u2019s language games: a human wishes to accomplish some task (e.g., achieving a certain configuration of blocks), but can only communicate with a computer, who performs the actual actions (e.g., removing all red blocks). The computer initially knows nothing about language and therefore must learn it from scratch through interaction, while the human adapts to the computer\u2019s capabilities. We created a game called SHRDLURN in a blocks world and collected interactions from 100 people playing it. First, we analyze the humans\u2019 strategies, showing that using compositionality and avoiding synonyms correlates positively with task performance. Second, we compare computer strategies, showing that modeling pragmatics on a semantic parsing model accelerates learning for more strategic players.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
