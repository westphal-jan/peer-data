We show how two computational metrics can be used to distinguish between semantic changes caused by cultural shifts (e.g. technological advances) and those caused by more regular processes of semantic change (e.g. gramaticalization or subjectivation)."}, {"heading": "2 Methods", "text": "We use the diachronic word 2vec embeddings constructed by Hamilton et al. (2016) to measure how word meanings change between consecutive decades.1 In these illustrations, each word wi at any given time has a vector representation w (t) (Turney et al., 2010) that captures its coexistence statistics for that period of time.1 The vectors are constructed using the Skip gram with negative sampling algorithm (SGNS) (Mikolov et al., 2013) and reworked to align the semantic spaces between the years. Measuring the distance between word vectors over successive decades allows us to calculate the rate at which the different words change in their meanings (Gulordava and Baroni, 2011; Hamilton et al., 2016). We analyzed the decades from 1800 to 1990 using vectors derived from the Google N-gram datasets (Let al, 2012, the English, the English, and the French)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Measuring semantic change", "text": "The first measurement analyzes global shifts in the vector semantics of a word (Hamilton et al., 2016). We simply take the vectors of a word for two different decades and measure the cosmic distance between them, i.e.dG (w (t) i, w (t) i, w (t) i) = cos-dist (w (t) i). (1) Local neighborhood measurement The second measurement is new and is based on the intuition that only the closest semantic neighbors of a word are relevant. For this measurement, we first find the quantity of the word wi (w (t) i-dist (according to Cosine similarity), which we measure within each decade by the ordered quantity Nk (t) i-dist (t) and the quantity of the word i-dist (t)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Statistical methodology", "text": "To test whether nouns or verbs change more strongly according to our two change scales, we follow Hamilton et al. (2016) and use a linear hybrid model approach. This approach essentially amounts to a linear regression, but the model also takes into account \"random\" effects to account the fact that measurements for individual words are correlated over time (McCulloch and Neuhaus, 2001). We performed two regressions per data set: one with the global dG values as dependent variables (DVs) and one with the local dL values of the neighborhood. In both cases, we investigated the change between all consecutive decades and normalized the DVs to zero mean and unit variance. We examined nouns / verbs within the top 10,000 words by frequency rank and removed all words that occurred in the smaller COHA dataset < 500 times. The independent variables are word frequency variable, the decade is represented by a word (and the change is a Hamilton is a)."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "Our results show that the two seemingly interconnected measures actually lead to drastically different notions of semantic change."}, {"heading": "3.1 Nouns vs. verbs", "text": "Local neighbourhood measurement assigns a much higher rate of semantic change to nouns in all languages and datasets, while the opposite is true for global distance measurement, which tends to assign a higher rate of change to verbs (Figure 2). We focused on verbs vs. nouns because they are the two main parts of the speech, and previous research has shown that verbs are more semantically variable than nouns and therefore more subject to linguistic drift (Gentner and France, 1988), while nouns are much more likely to change due to cultural changes (e.g. new technologies) (Traugott and Dasher, 2001). The differences shown in Figure 2 also apply when adverbs are included with verbs, which fits with previous research showing that adverbs are often the target of regular linguistic changes such as subjectivation (ibid.)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Case studies", "text": "These case studies show that three examples of well-attested regular linguistic shifts (sentence A) changed more strongly depending on the global scale, while three well-known examples of cultural shifts (sentence B) occurred more frequently on the local neighborhood scale. Table 1 lists these words in some representative historical contexts (Davies, 2010).ence the distributional scales (Hamilton et al., 2016).Sentence A contains three words that were demonstrably subjected to regular linguistic shifts in Traugott and Dasher (2001): in fact, must and promise. These three words represent three different types of regular linguistic shifts: in fact, this is a classic case of subjectivation (detailed in Figure 1); must go from a deontic / obligatory use (\"you must do X\") to an epistemic shift (\"X must be the case\") that exemplifies a regular pattern of change common in many modal verbs; and the promise that the class of cultural shifts and linguistic shifts were \"singled out\" in 2001."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "Our results show that our novel local neighbourhood measure of semantic change is more sensitive to changes in nouns, while the global measure is more sensitive to changes in verbs. This mapping is consistent with the traditional distinction between irregular cultural shifts in nomenclatures and more regular cases of linguistic drift (Traugott and Dasher, 2001) and is further supported by our six case studies. This finding stresses that researchers need to develop and apply yardsticks of semantic change adapted to specific tasks. Thus, for example, a framework for identifying cultural change would be more successful if we applied our local neighbourhood measurement, while an empirical study of grammar would be more consistent with the traditional global distance approach. By comparing the measurements of these two approaches, researchers can also assess the extent to which semantic changes are linguistic or cultural in nature."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors thank C.
