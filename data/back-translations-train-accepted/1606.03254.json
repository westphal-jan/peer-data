We present a comparison of different information presentations for uncertain data and, for the first time, measure their effects on human decision-making. We show that the use of Natural Language Generation (NLG) improves decision-making under uncertainty, compared to state-of-the-art graphical-based representation methods. In a task-based study with 442 adults, we found that presentations using NLG lead to 24% better decision-making on average than the graphical presentations, and to 44% better decision-making when NLG is combined with graphics. We also show that women achieve significantly better results when presented with NLG output (an 87% increase on average compared to graphical presentations).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 10:12:13 GMT  (432kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03254v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 15 Aug 2016 10:11:49 GMT  (432kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03254v2", "54th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), Berlin 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["dimitra gkatzia", "oliver lemon", "verena rieser"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.03254"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.03254.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Natural Language Generation enhances human decision-making with uncertain information", "authors": ["Dimitra Gkatzia", "Oliver Lemon", "Verena Rieser"], "emails": ["d.gkatzia@napier.ac.uk", "o.lemon@hw.ac.uk", "v.t.rieser@hw.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In this paper, we examine whether the technology can also be used to support decision-making when the underlying data is uncertain."}, {"heading": "2 The Extended Weather Game", "text": "In this section, we present our enhanced version of the MetOffice weather game (Stephens et al., 2011), where the player must choose where to send an ice cream seller to maximize sales given the weather forecast for four weeks and two locations. These forecasts describe (1) predicted precipitation (Figure 2) and (2) temperature levels along with their probabilities in three ways: (a) by graphs (which is the version of the original game), (b) by textual predictions and (c) by combined graphical and textual predictions. We created the text format using two rules-based NLG approaches as described in the next section. Users are asked to first select the best target for the ice cream seller and then specify how confident they are with their choice. Based on their choices and their confidence level, participants are eventually presented with their \"monetary gain.\" For example, the higher the probability of sunshine is, the higher the monetary gain if the player declares at the end that the game is not actually raining and the probability that it is."}, {"heading": "3 Natural Language Generation from", "text": "Uncertain information We developed two NLG systems, WMO-based and NATURAL, using SimpleNLG (Gatt and Reiter, 2009), which both generate textual descriptions of precipitation and temperature data that address the uncertain nature of forecasts. WMO-based: This is a rules-based system that uses the guidelines recommended by the WMO (Kootval, 2008) to report uncertainties, as in Table 1. For example, consider a forecast of sunny intervals with a 30% chance of rain. This WMO-based system generates the following forecast: \"Sunny intervals with possible rain - less likely than not.\" NATURAL: This system mimics predictions and their natural nature of weather reporting. The rules applied in this system were derived from observing the way experts (e.g. BBC weather reporters) make predictions. For the previous example, all of this system will be sunny with a 30% probability of rain."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": "In order to investigate what helps people better understand and respond to uncertainties in information presentations, we use five conditions in the context of the Extended Weather Game: 1. Graphic only: This representation only shows users the graphical representation of weather forecasts. For this condition, we used the graphs that performed best in terms of human understanding (Stephens et al., 2011). 2. Multimodal representation: \u2212 Graphic and NATURAL: This is a multimodal representation consisting of graphics (as described in the previous state) and text produced by the NATURAL system. \u2212 Graphic and WMO-based: This is also a multimodal representation consisting of graphics and text produced by the WMObased system. 3. Only NLG: \u2212 Only NATURAL: This is a purely text-based representation as described above. \u2212 Only WMO-based system: This is also a purely text-based representation."}, {"heading": "5 Data", "text": "We recruited 442 unique players (197 females1, 241 male, 4 undisclosed) via social media.

As we described in Section 2, the game calculates a financial gain based on both the decisions and the player's confidence, i.e. the player's ability to make decisions. In terms of confidence, we asked users to declare their confidence on a 10-point scale. Therefore, in our analysis, we focus on both confidence and score in the game.1 Women accounted for 44.5% of the subjects."}, {"heading": "6.1 Results for all adults", "text": "Multimodal vs. pure graphics: We found that the use of multimodal graphics resulted in a significantly higher score (i.e. better decision-making) than pure graphics (p = 0.03, effect = + 36.36), which is an average 44% increase in score. Multimodal vs. pure NLG: However, there is no significant difference between pure graphics and pure graphics in terms of score. NLG vs. pure graphics: We found that the NLG graphics resulted in an increase in average task result (i.e. better decision-making) of 24.8% compared to pure graphics, see Table 2: an average score increase of over 20 points. There was no significant difference between WMO and NATURAL NLG conditions. Confidence: For confidence: Multimodal graphics are significantly more effective than pure graphics (&lt01; effect = 17.7%)."}, {"heading": "6.2 Results for Females", "text": "We found that women performed significantly better on the decision task when exposed to one of the NLG output presentations compared to the pure graphics presentation (p < 0.05, effect = + 53.03), an increase of 87%, see also Table 3. In addition, the same user group achieved significantly higher scores when presented with only the multimodal output compared to the pure graphics (p = 0.05, effect = 60.74%). Interestingly, for this group, the multimodal presentation contributes little more to decision-making effectiveness than the pure NLG condition, but the multimodal presentations increase their confidence (+ 15%). Furthermore, we found that educated (i.e., with a BSc or higher degree) women who also correctly answered the risk literacy test felt significantly more confident with the multimodal presentation than with the NLG alone (p = 0.01, effect = 16.7%)."}, {"heading": "6.3 Results for Males", "text": "We found that men scored similar scores for all types of representation, suggesting that the improved scores shown above (for all adults) are largely due to the beneficial effects of NLG for women. In terms of confidence, men are more likely to be more confident when presented with graphs (81% of the time) or multimodal representation (85% of the time) (p = 0.01)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We present the results of a game-based study on the generation of descriptions of uncertain data - a problem that has not been studied by data-to-text systems to date. We note that there is a significant gender gap between multimodal, NLG and graphical versions of the task, with the use of NLG in women resulting in an 87% increase in task success over graphics. Multimodal presentations result in a 44% increase in all adults compared to graphics. People are also more confident when using multimodal representations, as reported in (Foster and Oberlander, 2006; Rieser and Lemon, 2008; Wei\u00df et al., 2012). The results are also related to educational research showing that women perform better in verbal-gender tasks than visual-spatial ones (Zhu, 2007; Zhu, a study of future behavior)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was supported by the EPSRC projects GUI (EP / L026775 / 1), DILiGENt (EP / M005429 / 1) and MaDrI-gAL (EP / N017536 / 1)."}], "references": [{"title": "A simple domain-independent probabilistic approach to generation", "author": ["Angeli et al.2010] Gabor Angeli", "Percy Liang", "Dan Klein"], "venue": "In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)", "citeRegEx": "Angeli et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Angeli et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Extracting parallel fragments from comparable corpora for data-to-text generation", "author": ["Belz", "Kow2010] Anja Belz", "Eric Kow"], "venue": "In 6th International Natural Language Generation Conference (INLG)", "citeRegEx": "Belz et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Belz et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Measuring risk literacy: The berlin numeracy test", "author": ["Mirta Galesic", "Eric Schulz", "Saima Ghazal", "Rocio GarciaRetamero"], "venue": "Judgment and Decision Making,", "citeRegEx": "Cokely et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Cokely et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Data-driven generation of emphatic facial displays", "author": ["Foster", "Jon Oberlander"], "venue": "In Proc. of the 11th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL)", "citeRegEx": "Foster et al\\.,? \\Q2006\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Foster et al\\.", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Statistical numeracy for health: A cross-cultural comparison with probabilistic national samples", "author": ["Galesic", "Rocio Garcia-Retamero"], "venue": "Archives of Internal Medicine,", "citeRegEx": "Galesic et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Galesic et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "SimpleNLG: A realisation engine for practical applications", "author": ["Gatt", "Reiter2009] Albert Gatt", "Ehud Reiter"], "venue": "ENLG", "citeRegEx": "Gatt et al\\.,? \\Q2009\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Gatt et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "From Data to Text in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: Using NLG Technology for Decision Support and Infor", "author": ["Gatt et al.2009] Albert Gatt", "Francois Portet", "Ehud Reiter", "James Hunter", "Saad Mahamood", "Wendy Moncur", "Somayajulu Sripada"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Gatt et al\\.,? \\Q2009\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Gatt et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "A game-based setup for data collection and taskbased evaluation of uncertain information presentation", "author": ["Amanda Cercas Curry", "Verena Rieser", "Oliver Lemon"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 15th European Workshop", "citeRegEx": "Gkatzia et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Gkatzia et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Unsupervised concept-to-text generation with hypergraphs.
