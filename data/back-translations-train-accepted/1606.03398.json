We consider a common case in which most information is found in a relatively unstructured free text, but some smaller corpora exist that are well structured. DIEJOB therefore assumes that at least two corpora exist for the area of interest: a large target corpus and a smaller structured corpus that we use. Moreover, he assumes that each document in these two corpora is associated with a specific entity designated as title entity or subject. Many widely used corpora have this structure, including Wikipedia and the authoritative websites we use."}, {"heading": "2.2 Relations and Corpora", "text": "Even large curated CBs are often incomplete, and the situation is even worse in the medical field, where coverage of large CBs such as Freebase is quite limited. We focus on extracting examples of eight relationships defined in Freebase, on drugs and diseases. The disease relationships are ToTreat, conditionsThisMayPrevent, and sideEffect, and the concept types of their second arguments are DiseaseOrMedicalCondition, DiseaseOrMedicalCondition, and Symptom. The disease relationships are hasTreatment, hasSymptom, RisCause, andpreventionFactor, with corresponding concept types such as MedicalTreatment, Symptom, RiskFactor, DiseaseCause, and ConditionPreventionFactor.We are primarily concerned with extraction from large, authoritative sources."}, {"heading": "2.3 Mention Preparation", "text": "Relation Mention sets, i.e. Rs and Rt, are prepared with remote monitoring.

To improve the quality of the Rs, we also require that the section from which the mention was taken is relevant to the relationship. For example, a mention with the sideEffect relationship must appear in a section with the title Side."}, {"heading": "2.4 Relation Label Propagation", "text": "In fact, the number of persons mentioned is greater, but they are louder than ever before. Generally, the degree to which the persons mentioned prove useful is to be considered in the domain and as corpus-specific. Cs and Ct are generated in relation to the type of men, but not in relation to the persons who turn out to be an entity. For example, a mention in the Ct that is \"dizzy\" to the NP would not be associated with the triple sideeffect. And, indeed, dizziness is a condition that is not caused by the title itself."}, {"heading": "2.5 Classifier Learning", "text": "Given the ranking of the mention lists of these relation names from the above LP, we select the uppermost N to educate binary classifiers, which can then be used to classify the mentions of these entities (singleton lists) and coordinate the lists in a new document. We use the same feature generator for mentions and lists. Shallow characteristics include: tokens in the NPs and character prefixes / suffixes of these tokens; BOW from the sentence containing the NP; and tokens and bigrams from a window around the NP. When parsing the dependency, we find the verb closest to the head of the current NP, all modifiers of that verb and the path to that verb. In lists, the dependency characteristics are calculated relative to the head of the list.We use SVMs (Chang and Lin, 2001) and discard singleton characteristics as the most common characteristics (stop-word variant)."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Evaluation Dataset", "text": "Our evaluation dataset contains 20 manually labeled pages, 10 pages each from the disease corpus WikiDisease and the drug corpus DailyMed.

The evaluation data contain 436 triples for the disease domain and 320 triples for the drug domains.

In the drug range, we get 3112, 315 and 265 triples for the use of ToTreat, ConditionThisMayPrevent and sideEffect. We have two strategies to select the top N-lists for learning the classification, one strategy selects the top N directly, without distinguishing whether they come from the structured corpus or the target corpus. It is called DIEJOB Both. The other strategy selects the top N examples only from the target corpus and is called DIEJP, without distinguishing whether they come from the structured corpus or the target corpus."}, {"heading": "3.4 Results on Labeled Pages", "text": "The results for the precision, recall and F1 measurement are listed in Table 1. The results for the DIEBOLDS are from (Bing et al., 2016). The systems with \"*\" are directly aligned with the evaluation data and should be considered as ceilings for real drug performance. DIEJOB Target and DIEJOB Both are aligned with a tuning data set (details in Section 3.5). (Note that for the disease domain, DIEJOB Both and DIEJOB Both * achieve the same results because they use the same parameters even though they are aligned with other data.) DIEJOB Both outperform all other systems. Compared with MultiR, Mintz + +, and MIML-RE, the relative improvements under the F1 measurement are 22% to 30% in the disease domain, and 72% to 110% in the drug domain. The precision values of the DIEJOB Both are much higher than previous work."}, {"heading": "3.5 Tuning and Variant Comparison", "text": "Combined with the strategies for selecting Top-N (i.e. DIEJOB Target and DIEJOB Both), there are 13 variants: shown in Figures 5a and 5b for disease; Figures 5c and 5d for medication. Note that DIEJOB Target does not have the variant RsCs, as RsCs do not contain examples from the target body. For the disease domain, the same variant is similar under DIEJOB Both and DIEJOB Target, and on average DIEJOB Target Both are slightly better than DIEJOB Target. For the drug domain, RsCs do not contain examples from the target body. For the disease domain, the same variant is similar under DIEJOB Both and DIEJOB Target, and on average DIEJOB Target Both are better than DIEJOB Target."}, {"heading": "4 Related Work", "text": "In order to overcome the noise in remotely designated examples (Riedel et al., 2010) introduced a \"at least one\" heuristic section in which instead of all mentions of a couple as correct examples, only at least one of them is taken to express this relationship. MultiR (Hoffmann et al., 2011) and MIML-RE (Surdeanu et al., 2012) expand this approach to support multiple relationships expressed by different sentences in a bag. In contrast to these approaches, DIEJOB improves the quality of training data with a boot strapping step before feeding the loud examples into a learner by using the self-confident examples from a structured corpus as seed. The benefit of this step is twofold. First, it distils the distantly designated examples by propagating labels from good seed examples, and the loud examples are weighted. Second, the propagation is distanced to further examples of relationships in the terminology that cannot be used in the reference to the words."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "We proposed the DIEJOB framework to generate good examples of remotely monitored IE. It uses the document structure of a small, well-structured corpus to collect examples of seed relationships, and it also collects concept mentions that could be the second argumentation value of relationships. DIEJOB then performs label multiplication to find mentions that can confidently be used as training examples to train classifiers for labeling new entity mentions. Experimental results show that this approach is consistent and significantly better than most modern approaches."}], "references": [{"title": "Snowball: Extracting relations from large plain-text collections", "author": ["Agichtein", "Gravano2000] Eugene Agichtein", "Luis Gravano"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Fifth ACM International Conference on Digital Libraries", "citeRegEx": "Agichtein et al\\.,? \\Q2000\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Agichtein et al\\.", "year": 2000}, {"title": "Improving distant supervision for information extraction using label propagation through lists", "author": ["Bing et al.2015] Lidong Bing", "Sneha Chaudhari", "Richard C Wang", "William W.
