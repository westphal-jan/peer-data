This distinguished polynomial is a sum-of-squares (SOS) derived in a simple manner from the inverse of the empirical moment matrix. In fact, this SOS polynomial is directly related to orthogonal polynomials and the Christoffel function. This allows to generalize and interpret extremality properties of orthogonal polynomials and to provide a mathematical rationale for the observed phenomenon.

To ensure clarity and simplicity, we offer a figure in the plane. Consider the following experiment in R2 for a fixed d-N number: on the same graph, we present the point cloud {xi} i = 1... n and the subsets of the SOS polynomial Q\u00b5, d in R2 (corresponding to the supersets of the Christoffel function), as illustrated in the left figure 3. The point collection consists of 500 simulations of two different Gaussians and the value of d is 4. What is striking about this figure is that the level theorems capture the global shape of the point cloud fairly accurately. In particular, the level set {x: Q\u00b5, d (x) \u2264 (p + d)} captures most of the points. We were able to make very similar observations at different shapes with different numbers of points in R2 and Appendix (see A dix)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Measuring outlyingness", "text": "Another remark in a similar line is that Q\u00b5, d tends to take higher values at points isolated from other points. In fact, the value of the polynomial in the left line of Figure 3 tends to be smaller at the cloud boundary. This extends to situations where the collection of points corresponds to a form with a high density of points with some additional outliers. We repeat a similar experiment on the right line of Figure 3. In this example, 1000 points are scanned near a ring shape and 40 additional points are scanned uniformly across a larger square. We are not showing the subsets of Q\u00b5, d here. Instead, the color and shape of the points become proportional to the value of Q\u00b5, d, with d = 8.First, the results confirm the observation of the previous paragraph that points falling near the ring shape tend to be smaller and points at the boundary of the ring shape are larger. Second, there is a marked increase in the points that are relatively far from the ring shape."}, {"heading": "3.3 Relation to maximum likelihood estimation", "text": "If we fix d = 1, we get back the maximum probability estimate for Gauss, up to a constant additive factor. To see this, we set the following block representation of the moment matrix: Md (\u00b5) = (1 \u00b5T\u00b5 S) Md (\u00b5) \u2212 1 = (1 + \u00b5TV \u2212 1\u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5TV \u2212 1 \u2212 V \u2212 1\u00b5 V \u2212 1), where V = S \u2212 \u00b5T is the empirical covariance matrix and the expression for the reverse is given by shear completion. In this case, we have Q\u00b5, 1 (x) = 1 + (x \u2212 \u00b5) TV \u2212 1 (x \u2212 \u00b5) for all x-Rp. We recognize the square shape that appears in the density function of the multivariate Gauss, with parameters that are estimated with maximum probability."}, {"heading": "3.4 Computational aspects", "text": "Remember that s (d) = (p + d) is the number of p-variable monomials of degree to d. Calculation of Q\u00b5, d requires O (ns (d) 2) operations to calculate the moment matrix and O (s (d) 3) operations for matrix inversion. Evaluation of Q\u00b5, d requires O (s (d) 2) operations. Estimating the coefficients of Q\u00b5, d has computational costs that are only linear from the number of points n. The costs of evaluating Q\u00b5, d are constant in terms of the number of points n. This is an important contrast to nuclear or distance-based methods (such as nearest neighbors and a class SVM) for density estimation or outlier detection, as they normally require at least O (n2) operations to evaluate the model [1]. Furthermore, this is well suited for online settings where the inverse moment matrix can be calculated."}, {"heading": "4 Invariances and interpretation through orthogonal polynomials", "text": "The purpose of this section is to provide a mathematical rationale to explain the empirical observations in Section 3. All the evidence is moved to Appendix B. We set a Borel probability measure \u00b5 to Rp that meets assumption 1. Note that Md (\u00b5) is always positive when \u00b5 is not supported on the null of a degree polynomial. Assuming 1, Md (\u00b5) induces an internal product to Rs (d) and by extension to Rd [X] (see Section 2), this internal product is referred to as < \u00b7, \u00b7 > \u00b5 and satisfies for all polynomials P, Q, Rd [X] with the coefficients p, q, Rs (d), < P, Q > \u00b5: = < p, Md (\u00b5) q > Rs (d) = < Rp (x) d\u00b5 (x).We will also use the internal product for this product that we subscribe to."}, {"heading": "4.1 Affine invariance", "text": "It should be noted that the assignment x 7 \u2192 Q\u00b5, d (x) does not depend on the choice vd (X) as the basis of Rd [X], any other basis would lead to the same assignment. This leads to the result that Q\u00b5, d affine invariant properties of \u00b5.Lemma 1 Let \u00b5 satisfy Assumption 1 and A \u0435Rp \u00b7 p, b \u0451Rp defines an inverted affine assignment to Rp, A: x \u2192 Ax + b. Then the shock foward measurement, defined by \u00b5 (S) = \u00b5 (A \u2212 1 (S)), for all Borel sets S-Rp, fulfills assumption 1 (with the same d as \u00b5) and for all x-Rp, Q\u00b5, d (x) = Q\u00b5, d (Ax + b).Lemma 1 is probably better understood if \u00b5 = 1 / n \u00b2 n \u00b2 n i as in Section 3. In this case we have \u00b5, Q\u00b5, d (x) \u00b5, d = Axi and Axi \u00b2 and transformations."}, {"heading": "4.2 Connection with orthogonal polynomials", "text": "We define a classical [13, 3] family of orthonormal polynomials, {P\u03b1} \u03b1-Npd ordered by \u2264 gl, which for all \u03b1-Npd < P\u03b1, X\u03b2 > = 0 if \u03b1 < gl \u03b2, < P\u03b1, P\u03b1 > \u00b5 = 1, < P\u03b1, X\u03b2 > \u00b5 = 0 if \u03b2 < gl \u03b1, < P\u03b1, X\u03b1 > \u00b5 > 0. (3) From (3) it follows that < P\u03b1, P\u03b2 > \u00b5 = 0 if \u03b1 6 = \u03b2. The existence and uniqueness of such a family is guaranteed by the Gram-Schmidt orthonalization process according to the \u2264 gl order on the monomials and by the positivity of the moment matrix, see for example [3, theorem 3,1.11]. Let Dd (\u00b5) be the lower triangular matrix forming rows."}, {"heading": "4.3 A variational formulation for the inverse moment matrix SOS polynomial", "text": "In this section we show that the family of polynomials in the function of the problem (4) is the only solution (up to a multiplicative constant) of a convex optimization problem about polynomials.

However, in this section we will focus on another potential application in anomalous metrics.

of data points using polynomials. We start with the previously unnoticed empirical observation that, given a collection (a cloud) of data points, the sublevel sets of a certain distinguished polynomial capture the shape of the cloud very accurately. This distinguished polynomial is a sum-of-squares (SOS) derived in a simple manner from the inverse of the empirical moment matrix. In fact, this SOS polynomial is directly related to orthogonal polynomials and the Christoffel function. This allows to generalize and interpret extremality properties of orthogonal polynomials and to provide a mathematical rationale for the observed phenomenon. Among diverse potential applications, we illustrate the relevance of our results on a network intrusion detection task for which we obtain performances similar to existing dedicated methods reported in the literature.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
