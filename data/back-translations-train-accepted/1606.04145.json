In the traditional economic models, it is assumed that the bidders' valuations are drawn from an underlying distribution and that the auction designer has perfect knowledge of this distribution. Despite this strong and oftentimes unrealistic assumption, it is remarkable that the revenue-maximizing combinatorial auction remains unknown. In recent years, automated mechanism design has emerged as one of the most practical and promising approaches to designing high-revenue combinatorial auctions. The most scalable automated mechanism design algorithms take as input samples from the bidders' valuation distribution and then search for a high-revenue auction in a rich auction class. In this work, we provide the first sample complexity analysis for the standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes used in automated mechanism design. In particular, we provide tight sample complexity bounds on the number of samples needed to guarantee that the empirical revenue of the designed mechanism on the samples is close to its expected revenue on the underlying, unknown distribution over bidder valuations, for each of the auction classes in the hierarchy. In addition to helping set automated mechanism design on firm foundations, our results also push the boundaries of learning theory. In particular, the hypothesis functions used in our contexts are defined through multi-stage combinatorial optimization procedures, rather than simple decision boundaries, as are common in machine learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 21:25:22 GMT  (379kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04145v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["maria-florina balcan", "tuomas sandholm", "ellen vitercik"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.04145"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.04145.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Maria-Florina Balcan", "Tuomas Sandholm", "Ellen Vitercik"], "emails": ["ninamf@cs.cmu.edu.", "sandholm@cs.cmu.edu.", "vitercik@cs.cmu.edu."], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most people who are in a position to put themselves in the world, to put themselves in the world in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which, in fact, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, in fact, live, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, in the world, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in the world, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, live, in which, in which they, live, in"}, {"heading": "1.1 The Hierarchy of Deterministic Combinatorial Auctions", "text": "Early work in automated mechanism design approached the mechanism design problem as a holistic program or linear program [Conitzer and Sandholm, 2002, Sandholm, 2003, Conitzer and Sandholm, 2004, Conitzer and Sandholm, 2003]. Then a more scalable approach emerged in which the design focuses on a parameterized family of CA mechanisms. In this approach, the design of a high-income CA is performed via an algorithmic search for a good parameter vector within the family [Likhodedow and Sandholm, 2004, Likhodedow and Sandholm, 2005, Sandholm and Likhodedov, 2015]. From this point of view, there is a hierarchy of CA families that we will now describe, and which is presented in Figure 1.

In learning theory terms, these are referred to as uniform auction proceeds, and they have the nice feature that they are applied to any method that could be used to optimize the sample, such as an algorithm that returns the optimal convergence of the auction across the sample or near-optimal approximation. Note that one of them is a subset of the other, the uniform convergence of the sample for the smaller family is always a upper limit for the uniform auction or an almost optimal approximation of the larger one. Hence the sample complexity we obtain for the AMAs that are immediately applied to their subfamilies.

Specifically, we determine the sample complexity required for a specified auction class to ensure that for each auction in that class, the average revenue from the sample is likely to be close to the expected revenue from the underlying, unknown distribution across the bidders \"valuations. Our limits apply to any algorithm that finds an optimal or near-optimal auction via an input sample, and therefore to any automated mechanism design algorithm.

In the traditional economic models, it is assumed that the bidders\u2019 valuations are drawn from an underlying distribution and that the auction designer has perfect knowledge of this distribution. Despite this strong and oftentimes unrealistic assumption, it is remarkable that the revenue-maximizing combinatorial auction remains unknown. In recent years, automated mechanism design has emerged as one of the most practical and promising approaches to designing high-revenue combinatorial auctions. The most scalable automated mechanism design algorithms take as input samples from the bidders\u2019 valuation distribution and then search for a high-revenue auction in a rich auction class. In this work, we provide the first sample complexity analysis for the standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes used in automated mechanism design. In particular, we provide tight sample complexity bounds on the number of samples needed to guarantee that the empirical revenue of the designed mechanism on the samples is close to its expected revenue on the underlying, unknown distribution over bidder valuations, for each of the auction classes in the hierarchy. In addition to helping set automated mechanism design on firm foundations, our results also push the boundaries of learning theory. In particular, the hypothesis functions used in our contexts are defined through multi-stage combinatorial optimization procedures, rather than simple decision boundaries, as are common in machine learning.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
