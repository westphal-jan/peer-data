We extract comments on NYT articles via the NYT Community API and comments on CNN articles about DisqusAPI. 1 NYT comment contains information about whether a comment is an editorial selection. Statistics on the four sets of data are shown in Table 1.2.

Let conn (s, c) measure the substantive similarity between a sentence s, S and a comment c, C. Connectivity between article summary S and comment summary C is calculated as follows: We create a split graph G between S and C with edge weight as conn (s, c). We then consider an edge setM, the best match of G. X (S, C) as the sum of edge weights in M, i.e. X (S, C) = \u2211 e-M weight (e).

Note that Squal (S; T) is a submodular function, so the greedy solution is a 1 \u2212 1 / e approach to the optimal solution of Squal (S; T). Fixing S0, we model the problem of finding C0 that maximizes Cqual (C) + Q4 (S0, C) as a bipar-tite graph matching problem. This problem can be reduced to a maximum network flow problem and then solved by Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (Ford-Fulkerson algorithm) (details will be discussed in (Kleinberg and Tardos, 2005)."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Results", "text": "5.1 Evaluation of SENTENCE and COMMENT Importance ScorersWe test importance scorers (Section 3) on single document sentence ranking and comment ranking.For both tasks, we compare with two previous systems on joint ranking and summarization of news articles and tweets. Yang et al. (2011) employ supervised learning based on factor charts to model the content similarity between the two data types. We use the same characteristics for this model. Gao et al. (2012) summarize by including the supplementary information between articles and tweets estimated by an unattended topic model.3 We also consider two state-of-the-art rankers: RankBoost (Freund et al., 2003) and LambdaMART (Burges, 2010).

We also add a loud comment summary (i.e. irrelevant to the question) to avoid spam. We display two comments per day for each system. 6Turks are asked to classify the comment summary variations by informativeness and insightfulness. For informativeness, we ask Turks to judge only by knowledge displayed in the timeline, and each comment summary is based on how much relevant information they learn from it."}, {"heading": "5.4 Human Evaluation of Event Threading", "text": "Here we assess the usefulness of event themes for high-level information access policies: Can event themes allow users to easily locate and absorb information if they have a particular interest in it? We randomly assigned a 10-day time frame for each set of data from the data generated by the THREAD + OPTWordVecvariation of our system. We designed a question for each timeline. Example questions are: \"describe the activities in the search for missing flight MH370\" and \"describe the attitude and actions of the Russian government in eastern Ukraine.\" We assigned 10 students who speak English. Each student first read a question and the corresponding time frame for 5 minutes. The timeline was then removed and the student wrote an answer to the question. We asked each student to answer the question for each of four timelines (one for each event dataset). Two timelines are displayed with threads, and two without threads."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "Existing work focuses on learning users \"interests from comments and integrates the information learned into a news article summary system (Hu et al., 2008). Zhao et al. (2013) instead estimate word distributions from tweets and distort a page rank algorithm to restart sentences with a similar probability of distribution. Zhao et al. (2013) instead analyzed the generation of tweet + article summaries recently in Yang etal. (2011), proposing a factor graph that allows sentences and tweets to mutually reinforce each other. Gao et al. (2012) use a co-ranking model to identify sentence-tweet pairs with supplementary information estimated from a theme model. These efforts cover a small number of documents and tweets as we target a larger scale of data. In terms of time summaries, the Chieu and Lee (2004) system seek sentences by\" dullness \"and\" interest \"that are\" calculated based on a probability rate."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We introduced a socially informed timeline generation system that constructs timelines from article summaries and comment summaries. An alternating optimization algorithm is designed to maximize connectivity between the two summaries, as well as their importance and coverage of information. Automatic and human evaluations showed that our system produced more informative timelines than modern systems. Our comment summaries were also rated highly informative."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank John Hessel, Lillian Lee, Moontae Lee, David Lutz, Karthik Raman, Vikram Rao, Yiye Ruan, Xanda Schofield, Adith Swaminathan, Chenhao Tan, Bishan Yang, other members of the Cornell NLP Group and NAACL critics for valuable suggestions and advice on various aspects of this work.
