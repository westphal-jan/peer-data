Step 1: Get Talk Pages of Disputed Articles. Wikipedia articles are edited by different editors. If an article is observed to have disputes on its discussion page, editors can assign dispute tags to the article to mark it for attention. In this research, we are interested in talk pages whose corresponding articles are labeled with the following keywords: Dispute (POV). We use the 2013-03-04 Wikipedia data to dump and extract conversation pages for articles containing Dispute-SECTION, POV. The keywords indicate that an article is controversial, or the neutrality of the article is controversial (POV)."}, {"heading": "3 Sentence-level Sentiment Prediction", "text": "This section describes our sentence-level sentiment tagger, from which we construct characteristics for detecting disputes > Sentiment (Section 4). Consider a discussion consisting of sequential phrases; each turn consists of a sequence of phrases. Our model takes the sentences x = {x1, \u00b7, xn} from a single turn as input and returns the corresponding sequence of sentiment markers y = {y1, \u00b7, yn}, in which the sentences x = {NN, N, O, P, PP} are wrong. The terms in O represent very negative (NN), negative (N), positive (O), positive (P), and very positive (PP), or very positive characteristics. Given the fact that traditional conditional fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) ignore the ordinal relations between sentential markers, we choose isotonic Fs CRs (Maxi analysis, 2007 and Sententiality-level)."}, {"heading": "4 Online Dispute Detection", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Training A Sentiment Classifier", "text": "We train the mood classifier using the authority and alignment PP in Wikipedia Discussions (AAWD) corpus (Bender et al., 2011) on a 5-point scale (i.e. NN, N, O, P, PP). AAWD consists of 221 English Wikipedia discussions with positive and negative alignment annotations. Annotators mark each sentence as either positive, negative or neutral, or label the complete turn. If a sentence has only one turn-level label, we assume that all sentences have the same label as the turn. We further transform the labels into the five sentiment labels. Annotations are treated as positive alignment by at least two annotators (PP). If a sentence is selected as positive only by an annotator, or the label as negative annotator, or the label as negative annotation system, it is positive (P). Very negative (NN) and negative (polotator) are predicted as positive in other ways (O)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Dispute Detection", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far as it has this year."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "A sentiment prediction model based on isotonic CRFs is proposed to issue sentiment labels at the sentence level.
