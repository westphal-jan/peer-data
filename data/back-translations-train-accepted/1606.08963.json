It has been defined as \"the ability to proactively tailor products and product experiences to the tastes of individual consumers based on their personal and preference information\" (Chellappa and Sin 2005), which can lead to improved user experience and translate directly into financial gains for online companies (Riecken 2000). In addition, personalization promotes stronger ties between users and businesses and can help increase user loyalty and retention (Alba et al. 1997). For these reasons, it has been recognized as an important strategic goal of major Internet companies (Manber, Patel and Robison 2000; Das et al. 2007), and is a focus of significant research efforts. Personalized content has already become an integral part of many popular online services, a trend that is likely to continue in the future (Tuzhilin 2009).We look at content personalization from the viewpoint of targeted advertising (Essex 2009), an increasingly important aspect of online business."}, {"heading": "Background", "text": "In this section, we present work and ideas that led to the proposed algorithm. We first discuss the discontinuation of label ranking and then describe Adaptive Multi-Hyperplane Machine (AMM), a non-linear, multi-class model that is used to develop a novel, large-scale label ranking approach that is presented in this paper."}, {"heading": "Label ranking", "text": "Unlike standard learning problems such as multiclass or multi-label classification, label ranking is a relatively novel topic that involves a complex task of label preference (2003). Specifically, instead of predicting one or more class labels for a newly observed example, we strive to find a strict ranking of classes according to their importance or relevance to the given example. For example, if we look at a targeted advertising domain and assume that the examples are Internet users and class labels are user preferences from the Y = {\"sport,\" \"finance\"} set. Rather than simply concluding that the user is a \"sport\" person who would only display sports-related ads, it is more informative to know that the user prefers sports over the financial world, which leads to more diverse and effective advertising targeting. Note: The label ranking problem is not different from the learning order to the cao (where to classify a problem), where to classify a problem may also exist."}, {"heading": "Adaptive Multi-hyperplane Machine", "text": "The AMM method is a method suitable for major problems (Wang et al. 2011; Djuric et al. 2014). It is an SVM-like algorithm that formulates a non-linear model by assigning a number of linear hyperplanes to each class in order to capture data that is not linear. In view of a d-dimensional example x and a set Y of possible classes, AMM has the following form, f (x) = argmax i, (1) where the scoring function g (i, x) for the ith class, g (i, x) = max jw T i, (2) the following class is parameterized. asW = [w1,1.. w1, b1, b2, b2 |."}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "Existing label ranking methods have been shown to perform well in many tasks, but may not be as effective in the large-scale environment considered in this paper. In the face of nonlinear problems involving millions of examples and characteristics, the proposed methods are either too costly to train and apply, or not meaningful enough to learn complex problems. To solve this problem, in this section we present a novel ranking algorithm called AMM rank that extends the idea of adaptability and online learning from AMM to label ranking setting and allows comprehensive training of precise ranking models."}, {"heading": "AMM-rank algorithm", "text": "Before taking a closer look at the training method of AMM rank one and the modification of weight class one, we first look at its prospective ranking model. (As already mentioned, we assume that the tth training example xt will be found with (possibly) an incomplete ranking of length Lt \u2264 L (3) and a test example x, a score for each class with equation (2), and the predicted ranking will be achieved by sorting the results in descending order. (G, 2, x),. (G, x)))), (9) where the sorting function returns indices of the sorted ranking. (Formation of the AMM rank is similar to the training of the AMM class model of the previous section. Learning is initialized with a zero matrix that includes an infinite number of zero vectors for each class, followed by iteratively observed examples of one and modifying weight matrix."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "In this section, we describe the problem and present a comprehensive data set from the real world used for the evaluation, followed by the description and analysis of empirical results."}, {"heading": "Dataset", "text": "We are addressing an ad domain issue that consists of several key stakeholders: 1) advertisers, companies that want to promote their products; 2) publishers, websites that host advertising (such as Yahoo or Google); and 3) online users. The web environment provides publishers with the means to track users \"behavior in much greater detail than in offline settings, including the collection of registered user information (e.g. demographics, location) and activity logs that include searches, page views, email activity and purchases, bringing the ability to track users based on their past behavior, which is typically referred to as ad usage (Ahmed et al. 2011; Tyler et al. 2011; Agarwal, Pandey and Josifovski 2012; Aly et al. 2012) Having this in mind, the main motivation for the following experimental setup was the task of assessing users\" interests in their past activities."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "We compared AMM rank with the following approaches: a) multiclass AMM (Wang et al. 2011), where the top ranking of the cat-egory as a true class and the output scores for all categories were used to obtain a ranking that is used as a basis; b) Central time, which always predicts a central ranking of the training amount calculated using the mallows model (Mallows 1957); c) AG time, which calculates approaches for all users grouped in different age groups (\"13-17,\" \"18-24,\" \"25-29,\" \"30-34,\" \"35-44,\" \"45-54,\" \"55-64,\" \"65 +\") and gender (male / female) buckets; d) IBMal, which compiled the central time via the nearest neighbors (Cheng, Hu-hn, and Hu-Llermeier 2009); e) logistic regression (LR), where we were trained to get their L models."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "To address the challenges posed by the scale of online advertising tasks that render many state-of-the-art methods inefficient, we have introduced AMM Ranking, a novel, non-linear algorithm for large-scale label ranking. We evaluated its performance against a real ad target audience of more than 3 million users, the largest label ranking data ever included in literature. The results show that the method significantly outperformed competing approaches both in terms of ranking losses and retrieval measures, suggesting that the AMM Ranking Algorithm is a very suitable method to solve large-scale label ranking problems."}, {"heading": "1814.
