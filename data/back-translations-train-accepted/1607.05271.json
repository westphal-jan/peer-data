The motivation for this problem is an unobtrusive biometric setting in which a user is observed during access to a document, but no specific challenge protocol requiring the user's time and attention is carried out. Existing models of individual differences in gaze control during reading are either based on simple aggregate features of eye movements, or rely on parametric density models to describe, for instance, saccade amplitudes or word fixation durations. We develop flexible semiparametric models of eye movements during reading in which densities are inferred under a Gaussian process prior centered at a parametric distribution family that is expected to approximate the true distribution well. An empirical study on reading data from 251 individuals shows significant improvements over the state of the art.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jul 2016 14:46:05 GMT  (132kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05271v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ahmed abdelwahab", "reinhold kliegl", "niels landwehr"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.05271"}, "pdf": {"name": "1607.05271.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Semiparametric Model for Bayesian Reader Identification", "authors": ["Ahmed Abdelwahab", "Reinhold Kliegl", "Niels Landwehr"], "emails": ["niels.landwehr}@uni-potsdam.de", "kliegl@uni-potsdam.de"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "2 Problem Setting", "text": "Suppose that R (reader) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers)) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) (readers) ("}, {"heading": "3 Probabilistic Model", "text": "The probabilistic model follows the general structure proposed by Landwehr et al.

The motivation for this problem is an unobtrusive biometric setting in which a user is observed during access to a document, but no specific challenge protocol requiring the user\u2019s time and attention is carried out. Existing models of individual differences in gaze control during reading are either based on simple aggregate features of eye movements, or rely on parametric density models to describe, for instance, saccade amplitudes or word fixation durations. We develop flexible semiparametric models of eye movements during reading in which densities are inferred under a Gaussian process prior centered at a parametric distribution family that is expected to approximate the true distribution well. An empirical study on reading data from 251 individuals shows significant improvements over the state of the art.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
