This matrix not only encodes the mutual influences of each nodes of the process, but also disentangles the causality relationships between them. Our approach is the first that leads to an estimation of this matrix without any parametric modeling and estimation of the kernels themselves. A consequence is that it can give an estimation of causality relationships between nodes (or users), based on their activity timestamps (on a social network for instance), without knowing or estimating the shape of the activities lifetime. For that purpose, we introduce a moment matching method that fits the third-order integrated cumulants of the process. We show on numerical experiments that our approach is indeed very robust to the shape of the kernels, and gives appealing results on the MemeTracker database.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Jul 2016 14:19:23 GMT  (412kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06333v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 13 Oct 2016 22:46:27 GMT  (288kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06333v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 30 May 2017 00:06:14 GMT  (2023kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06333v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["massil achab", "emmanuel bacry", "st\u00e9phane ga\u00efffas", "iacopo mastromatteo", "jean-fran\u00e7ois muzy"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.06333"}, "pdf": {"name": "1607.06333.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Uncovering Causality from Multivariate Hawkes Integrated Cumulants", "authors": ["Massil Achab", "Emmanuel Bacry", "St\u00e9phane Gaiffas", "Iacopo Mastromatteo", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Muzy"], "emails": ["massil.achab@m4x.org"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Hawkes Process, Causality Conclusion, Cumulants, Generalized Method of Moments"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In many cases, one has to deal with data containing a very large number of irregular timestamped events that are recorded in continuous time.

The sequence of precise timestamps carries a large amount of information about the dynamics of the underlying systems. In this context, multidimensional counting processes play a paramount role. Within this framework, it is an important task to restore the reciprocal influence of nodes (i.e.) by making the different components of the counting process use of their time-sensitive patterns."}, {"heading": "2 NPHC: The Non Parametric Hawkes Cumulant method", "text": "In this section we give the background to the integrals of Hawkes nuclei and integrals of Hawkes cumulants.

This method is based on matching the integrated order 2 and order 3 empirical cumulants, which represent the simplest global observational values that contain enough information to restore the matrixG. Since this matrix fully takes into account the self- and cross-influences of the process nodes (which agents or users can represent in applications), our approach can of course be used to quantify the degree of endogeneity of a system and to detect the causality structure of a network. By conducting numerical experiments with very different core forms, we show that the baselines, which include either parametric or non-parametric approaches, are very useful in order to model miscellaneous specifications, these NHC results and to ensure that the results are classical and NHC-reliable."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work benefited from the support of the Chair \"Changing markets,\" the CMAP \u00c9cole Polytechnique and the \u00c9cole Polytechnique Fund Raising - Data Science Initiative.The authors thank Marcello Rambaldi for fruitful discussions on the experiments with order book data."}], "references": [{"title": "Tensorflow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous distributed systems", "author": ["M.
