Otherwise, we will not be able to link the trait patterns discovered in a cluster with aspect preferences. To facilitate this analysis, we first classified the aspect of the order obtained in Task 3 into discrete categories.

For example, people will highlight the aspect of fuel efficiency when a car is very fuel efficient, while de-marking the same aspect when a car is not fuel efficient. Thus, during content selection, the values of all aspects are taken into account to take into account the value of an aspect, we will use a cascade aspect of the NLG model that includes aspects of value-oriented content selection: (1) the values of all aspects whose trait scores of a given recipient are taken into account; (3) the eight linear regression models that we have learned in section 5.2, one for each aspect; (4) the rules of interaction that we have learned in section 5.3; (5) the number of values that is determined by the values that are needed in the output; (6) the number of aspects that are determined by the values that vary."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion: Domain Generalization", "text": "In general, there are two major challenges in adapting a domain-trained personalized content selection model to another domain: (1) adapting the data model from one domain (e.g., restaurant data) to another domain (e.g., movie data); (2) adapting a domain-specific user model (e.g., the preferences of a user of restaurant functions such as \"cooking\") to another domain (e.g., the preferences of a user of movie functions such as \"movie genre\"). Although our current model is trained in the automotive field, we have introduced a domain-independent user model motivated by psychological theories (e.g., personality and basic human values) rather than using domain-based user preference models (e.g., the preferences of a user of \"fuel economy\"), which has made our work much more generalizable than systems that can apply domain-based user characteristics (e.g., basic personality and general human outcomes) to adeira."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions", "text": "In this study, we analyzed the relationship between an individual's characteristics and his / her perceived aspect meaning.

its appeal to different individuals. With this framework, we directly model content selection decisions based on a set of psychologically-motivated domainindependent personal traits including personality (e.g., extraversion and conscientiousness) and basic human values (e.g., selftranscendence and hedonism). We also demonstrate how the analysis results can be used in automated personalized content selection for persuasive message generation.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
