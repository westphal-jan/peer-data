Previous work in this area has used rules-based systems (Mani and Wilson, 2000; Bethard, 2013b; Chambers, 2013) or supervised machine learning on small collections of annotated news documents (Angeli et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2014), we will provide our code and data with the publication of this paper. In particular, social media contain time-sensitive information and requires precise time analysis, for example to capture real events."}, {"heading": "2 System Overview", "text": "Our TweeTIME system consists of two main components, as illustrated in Figure 3: 1. A temporal recognition mechanism that identifies time expressions (e.g. Monday) in English text and outputs 5 different time types (described in Table 1) that specify the timeline direction, month of the year, date of the month, day of the week or no temporal information (NA). It is realized as a multiple learning model and in an extended version as a missing data model.2. A Temporal Normalizer that takes a tweet with its creation time and time expressions marked as input in the step above and outputs its normalized forms (e.g. Monday \u2192 5 / 9 / 2016). It is a log-linear model that includes both lexical characteristics and temporal days.In order to train these two models without manually commenting on their creation time and time expressions, we use a large database of known events as a remote view for The Time Event Database, which is called the Next Work automatic localized version of Twitter."}, {"heading": "3 Distant Supervision for Recognizing Time Expressions", "text": "The goal of the detector is to predict the temporal day of each word, specifying a sentence (or tweet) w = w1,.., wn. We propose a multiple instant learning model and a missing data model that is able to learn word markers that are marked only at sentence level. Our detection module is based on a database of known events as remote monitoring. We assume that tweets that are published around the time of a known event and mention a central unit are likely to include time expressions that relate to the date of the event. For each event, such as [Mercury, 09 / 05 / 2016], we collect all tweets that contain the central unit Mercury and are posted within 7 days of 09 / 05 / 2016. We then label each tweet at event level in addition to the date of creation of the tweet. The temporal tags at sentence level for the tweet in Figure 1 read: TL Future, DOW = DOMY = 9."}, {"heading": "3.1 Multiple-Instance Learning Temporal Tagging Model (MultiT)", "text": "Unlike superordinate learning, where the learner is provided with instances in which multiple instance learning scenarios (Dietterich et al., 1997), the learner is provided with pockets of instances that are either positive (where at least one instance is positive) or quite negative. This is a close match with our problem definition, in which sentences are labeled with tags that should be associated with one or more words. We represent sentences and their labels with a graphical model divided into word and sentence level variables (as shown in Figure 4). Unlike the standard checked tagging prob-lem, we never directly observe the keywords (z = z1,., zn) during learning. Instead, they are latent and we only observe the date of an event mentioned in the text from which we derive sentcelevel binary variables."}, {"heading": "3.2 Missing Data Temporal Tagging Model (MiDaT)", "text": "While the assumption of multiple instance learning works well most of the time, it can easily be violated - there are many tweets mentioning entities involved in an event but never explicitly mentioning its date. The lack of data modeling approach for weakly monitored learning proposed by Ritter et. al. (2013) addresses this problem by loosening the hard constraints of deterministic OR factors, such as the ones described above, as soft constraints. Our weakly monitored tagging data model splits the variables into two parts at the sentence level: m, which represents whether a time day is mentioned by at least one word of the tweet, and t \u00b2, which represents whether a time day can be derived from the event date. A set of paired potentials (mj, t \u00b2 j) is introduced that promote (but not necessarily require) a global match between mj and t \u00b2 j, i.e., a time day can be derived from the event date of the event of the event (i.e., if the penalty date here is mj = 6)."}, {"heading": "4 A Log-Linear Model for Normalizing Time Expressions", "text": "The Temporal Normalizer is constructed using a log-linear model that takes the tags t produced by the Temporal Recognizer as the input and output of one or more data mentioned in a tweet. We formulate the date normalization as a binary classification problem: In view of a tweet w published on the date dpub, we consider 22 candidate target data (w, dcandl) such that d cand l = dpub + l, where l = \u2212 10,.., \u2212 1, 0, + 1,.. + 10, the limitation of the possible date references considered within 10 days of the tweet creation date, in addition to dcandl = zero (the tweet does not mention a date). 4 While our basic approach has the limitation that it is only able to predict data within \u00b1 10 days of the target date, we found that in practice the majority of date references on social media within this window are covered by our approach to evaluate data generated outside of the provision of this set of data as well."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "In the following subsections, we present experimental results on learning to resolve time expressions in Twitter with minimal monitoring. We begin by describing our data set and present our results, including a large-scale evaluation of heuristically marked data and an evaluation against human judgments."}, {"heading": "5.1 Data Collection", "text": "We collected approximately 120 million tweets posted over a one-year window from April 2011 to May 2012, and these tweets were automatically annotated with named entities, POS tags, and TempEx data (Ritter et al., 2011). From this automatically annotated corpus, we extract the 10,000 most important events and associated data using the G2 test, which measures the strength of association between an entity and a date based on the log probability ratio between a model in which the entity is tied to the date and a model of independence (Ritter et al., 2012). Events extracted with this approach simply consist of the best-rated entity-date pairs, for example [Mercury, 5 / 9 / 2016]. Next, after automatically extracting the event database, we collect all tweets that mention an entity from the list, which is also written within \u00b1 7 days of the event. These tweets and the data that mention the known events are likely to serve as examples of the events."}, {"heading": "5.2 Large-Scale Heuristic Evaluation", "text": "We first evaluate our tagging model by testing how well it can predict heuristically generated labels. As mentioned in previous work on remote monitoring (Mintz et al., 2009a), this type of rating usually underestimates accuracy, but provides us with a useful intrinsic measure of performance. To ensure consistent coverage over months in the training and testing set, we divide the Twitter corpus into 3 subsets based on the mod 5 week of the date of each tweet. To train the system, we use tweets created in week 1, 2, or 3. To fine-tune the parameters of the MiDaT model, we used tweets from week 5 and to evaluate the performance of the trained model, we used tweets from week 4. The performance of the MiDaT model varies with the penalty and reward parameters. To find a (near) optimal setting of values, we performed a grid search on the set of 500 and determined that a penalty \u2212 25 worked."}, {"heading": "5.3 Evaluation Against Human Judgements", "text": "In addition to automatically evaluating our tagger on a large corpus of heuristically marked tweets, we also evaluate the performance of our tagging models and date resolution models using a random sample of tweets from a much later period that were commented manually by the authors."}, {"heading": "5.3.1 Word-Level Tags", "text": "To evaluate the performance of the MiDaT tagger, we randomly selected 50 tweets and labeled each word with the corresponding tag. Against the background of this hand-annotated test set, MiDaT achieves precision = 0.54, recall = 0.45, and F-value = 0.49. Some examples of word-level tags predicted by MiDaT are presented in Table 4. We found that because the tags are learned as latent variables derived from our model, they sometimes do not exactly match our intuitions, but still provide useful predictions, for example, in Table 4, Christmas is labeled with the tag MOY = dec."}, {"heading": "5.3.2 End-to-end Date Resolution", "text": "To evaluate the final performance of our system and compare it with existing state-of-the-art time resolvers, we sampled 250 tweets from 2014-2016 and commented on them manually with normalized data; note that this is a separate date range from our poorly labeled training data from 2011-2012. We used 50 tweets as a development set and the remaining 200 as a final test set. We experimented with different functionality levels of the development data. Feature ablation experiments are presented in Table 5. The final performance of our system compared to a range of state-of-the-art time resolvers is presented in Table 6. We see that TweeTIME exceeds SUTime, Tempex, HeidelTime (with its SMS-designed COLLOQUIAL mode) and UWTime. Brief descriptions of each system can be found in Section 6."}, {"heading": "5.3.3 System Combination with SUTime", "text": "Because our basic TweeTIME system is designed to predict data within + / -10 days of the date of creation, it fails if a tweet refers to a date outside this range. To overcome this limitation, we add the date predicted by SUTime to the list of candidate days. Subsequently, we rearrange SUTime's predictions using our loglinear model and insert their output as the predicted date when our normalizer's confidence is sufficiently high."}, {"heading": "5.3.4 Error Analysis", "text": "Tweets in which TweeTIME extracts the correct date but other systems fail often consist of examples containing colloquial expressions or spelling variants, such as the following tweet of 1 January 2016: JUST IN Delhi High Court requests the state government to provide data on changes in pollutant levels since the # OddEven rule came into force on 1 January 2016, while HeidelTime, SUTime, TempEX and UWTime could not extract data."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "Temporal resolvers primarily use rule-based or probabilistic approaches. Remarkable rule-based systems such as TempEx (Mani and Wilson, 2000), SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012) and HeidelTime (Stro \ufffd tgen and Gertz, 2013) offer particularly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Probabilistic approaches use monitored classifiers trained in-domain annotated data (Kolomiyets and Moens, 2010; Bethard, 2013a; Filannino et al., 2013) or hybrid with hand-generated rules (UzZaman and Allen, 2010; Lee et al., 2014). UWTime et al and Moens, 2014) is one of the most recent and competitive systems and uses combinatorial categorical gramar (CCG).Although recent research results present a challenge for TempEval (UzZaman et al., 2013; Bethard and Savova, 2016)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we demonstrated how to learn time triggers from large amounts of unlabeled text, using a database of known events as remote monitoring; we introduced a method for learning a word-level time marker model from tweets that are heuristically labeled only with punctuation markers; this approach was further expanded to account for missing tags or time-related properties that are not explicitly mentioned in the text of a tweet; and these time markers were then combined with a variety of other features in a novel date resolver that predicts normalized data referenced in a tweet; and by learning from large amounts of domain data, we were able to score 0.68 F1 points on the end-time normalization task for social media data, far surpassing SUTime, TempEx, HeidelTime, and UWTime in this challenging dataset for time normalization."}], "references": [{"title": "On the value of temporal", "author": ["cardo Baeza-Yates"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Baeza.Yates.,? \\Q2007\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baeza.Yates.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Combining distant and partial supervision for relation extraction", "author": ["Angeli et al.2014] Gabor Angeli", "Julie Tibshirani", "Jean Wu", "Christopher D Manning"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)", "citeRegEx": "Angeli et al\\.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Angeli et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "SemEval-2016 Task 12: Clinical TempEval", "author": ["Bethard", "Savova2016] Steven Bethard", "Guergana Savova"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval)", "citeRegEx": "Bethard et al\\.,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bethard et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "ClearTKTimeML: A minimalist approach to TempEval", "author": ["Steven Bethard"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval)", "citeRegEx": "Bethard.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bethard.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "A synchronous context free grammar for time normalization", "author": ["Steven Bethard"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)", "citeRegEx": "Bethard.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bethard.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Learning to extract relations from the Web using minimal supervision", "author": ["Bunescu", "Mooney2007] Razvan C.
