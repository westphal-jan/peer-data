Our algorithms dynamically group users based on the items under consideration and, possibly, group items based on the similarity of the clusterings induced over the users. The resulting algorithm thus takes advantage of preference patterns in the data in a way akin to collaborative filtering methods. We provide an empirical analysis on extensive real-world datasets, showing scalability and increased prediction performance over state-of-the-art methods for clustering bandits. For one of the two algorithms we also give a regret analysis within a standard linear stochastic noise setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 Aug 2016 14:13:28 GMT  (1733kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03544v1", "This is a copy ofarXiv:1502.03473v3.

(...) We will assume that the similarity of user behavior (...) is represented by a number of users. (...) An element represented by its feature vector x (...) can be considered as a (potentially different) partition of the user. (...) Users belonging to the same cluster share a similar behavior. (...) They both like or reject the element represented by x, while users in other clusters have significantly different behaviors. This is a much more flexible model that allows users to agree on their opinion of certain elements and contradict others frequently represented by x."}, {"heading": "3.

Under additional assumptions about the way data is generated, we delivered a crisp regret analysis depending on the expected number of clusters across users, a natural context-dependent idea of the (statistical) difficulty of the learning task. These theoretical results are further reinforced in the sparse user model scenario, which shows improved boundaries. We conducted an extensive experimental comparison across a number of production and real data sets, further highlighting the (statistical) difficulty of the learning task."}, {"heading": "A.
