Which user is more dogmatic in the above examples? This question is simple for humans.

Subreddits are sub-communities on Reddit that are oriented toward specific interests or topics, such as technology or politics. Sampling Reddit as a whole would distort the model in terms of the most frequently discussed content. However, by sampling posts from individual subreddits we can control the types of posts we use to train our model. To collect a variety of training data, we randomly analyzed 1,000 posts from the fields of politics, business, science, and AskReddit, and 1,000 additional posts from the Reddit front page.

A predictive model further validates our characteristics and allows us to analyze dogmatism in millions of other Reddit comments in a scalable manner, with multiple uses in ongoing, downstream analyses. Our goal is to (1) understand how well we can use the strategies in Section 3 to predict dogmatism, and (2) test the domain independence of these strategies. First, we will test the performance of our model under cross-validation within the Reddit comment set. We will then evaluate the Reddit-based model based on a held corpus of New York Times comments that is commented on with the technique in Section 2. We will not refer to these second sets of data during feature construction. To classify, we will consider two classes of comments: non-dogmatic and non-dogmatic."}, {"heading": "5 Dogmatism in the Reddit Community", "text": "We now apply our dogmatism classifier to a larger set of posts and examine how dogmatic language shapes the Reddit community.

To answer this question, we sampled 1.6 million posts from the entire Reddit community between 2007 and 2015. We then comment on each of these posts with dogmatism using our classifier and calculate the average dogmatism level for each subreddit in the sample of at least 100 posts. We present the results of this analysis in Table 3. The subreddits with the highest dogmatism levels tend to be oriented toward politics and religion (DebateAChristian or ukpolitics), while those with the lowest levels tend to focus on hobbies (photography or homebrawing). The subreddit model with the highest dogmatism level, cringepics, is a place where you can have fun that someone in the social community is often unpleasantly romantic. \""}, {"heading": "5.2 How do dogmatic beliefs cluster?

To find out, we calculate using the data sample of 1000 users and 10 million posts described in Section 5.2. Specifically, we calculate (1) activity: the total number of posts a user makes, (2) breadth: the number of posts a user posts in a discussion, (3) focus: the percentage of a user's posts appearing in the subreddit in which he is most active, and (4) engagement: the average number of posts a user contributes to each discussion in which he is engaged. We then adapt these behavioral features to a linear regression model in which we predict the average dogmatism level of each user.

To answer this question, sample 600,000 conversations from Reddit. These conversations consist of two people (A and B) talking to each other, with the structure: A1 \u2192 B \u2192 A2. This allows us to measure the influence of B's dogmatism on the response of A while simultaneously predicting the dogmatism response of A2. If B's dogmatism has no effect on the response of A, we model the influence of dogmatism on these conversations through linear regression. This model incorporates two features, the dogmatism levels of A1 and B, and predicts the dogmatism response of A2. If B's dogmatism has no effect on the response of A, the coefficient corresponding to B will have no significance in the model."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "Contrary to the mathematical models we have presented, dogmatism in psychology is usually measured by survey measures in which study participants answer questions that reveal underlying personality traits (Rokeach, 1954).
