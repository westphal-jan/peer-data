Using a collection of computational methods we establish three main results: (1) the three types of texts are easily distinguishable; (2) non-native language and translations are closer to each other than each of them is to native language; and (3) some of these characteristics depend on the source or native language, while others do not, reflecting, perhaps, unified principles that similarly affect translations and non-native language.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 11 Sep 2016 19:51:46 GMT  (56kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03204v1", "ACL2016, 12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL2016, 12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ella rabinovich", "sergiu nisioi", "noam ordan", "shuly wintner"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.03204"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.03204.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the Similarities Between Native, Non-native and Translated Texts", "authors": ["Ella RabinovichM", "Sergiu Nisioi", "Noam Ordan", "Shuly Wintner"], "emails": ["ellarabi@gmail.com,", "sergiu.nisioi@gmail.com,", "noam.ordan@gmail.com,", "shuly@cs.haifa.ac.il"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This paper addresses two linguistic phenomena: translation and non-native language. Our main goal is to examine the similarities and differences between these two phenomena and to relate them to the native language. In particular, we are interested in the reasons for the differences between translations and originals, on the one hand, and native and non-native languages, on the other. Do they reflect \"universal\" principles, or do they depend on the source / native language? Many studies in translation studies suggest that translated texts have unique characteristics (in each language) constitute a sublanguage of the target language, sometimes referred to as the translation language (Gellerstam, 1986). The unique features of the translation language are traditionally classified into two categories: characteristics derived from source language interferences (Toury, 1979), and universal traits resulting from the translation process itself."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "Corpus-based investigation of translation has been a fruitful field of recent research, providing an empirical basis for theoretically motivated hypotheses about the characteristics of translation. More specifically, the identification of translated texts by means of automatic classification illuminated the manifestation of translation techniques and cross-linguistic influences as markers of translated texts (Baroni and Bernardini, 2006; van Halteren, 2008; Gaspari and Bernardini, 2008; Kurokawa et al., 2009; Koppel and Ordan, 2011; Ilisei and Inkpen, 2011; Volansky et al., 2015; Rabinovich and Wintner, 2015; Nisioi and Bernardini, 2015b), while Gaspari and Bernardini (2008) introduced a dataset to investigate potential common features between translations and non-native texts."}, {"heading": "3 Methodology and experimental setup", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Dataset", "text": "Our datasheets 3 are based on the very homogeneous corpus of the Proceedings of the European Parliament (Koehn, 2005). Note that the proceedings are produced as follows: (1) the pronouncements of the speakers are transcribed; (2) the transcriptions are sent to the speaker, who can propose minimal editing without changing the content; (3) the edited version is then translated by native speakers. Note in particular that the texts are not the product of simultaneous translation. In this work, we use a subset of Europarl, in which each sentence is manually provided with reference information, including the represented EU state and the original language in which the sentence was pronounced (Nisioi et al., 2016). The texts in the corpus are stylistically consistent and respect the formal standards of the European Parliament. Translations are selected by native speakers and any non-native utterances of members who do not represent Great Britain or Ireland."}, {"heading": "3.2 Preprocessing", "text": "All data sets were split by records, cleaned (lower case text, punctuation and blank lines removed) and using the Stanford Tools3The data set is available at http: / / nlp.unibuc. ro / resources.html4Appendix A. (Manning et al., 2014) For the classification experiments, we randomly shuffled the sentences within each language variant to prevent interference from other artifacts (e.g. authorship, theme) in the classification process. We divided the data into blocks of about 2,000 tokens, respecting record boundaries, and normalized the values of lexical characteristics by the number of tokens in each piece. For the classification, we used plate sequential minimal optimization algorithm (Keerthi et al., 2001; Hall et al., 2009) to maximize the number of vector machines classified by the standard line we used for each classification."}, {"heading": "3.3 Features", "text": "The first feature we used for the classification tasks included function words (FW), probably the most popular choice since Mosteller and Wallace (1963) successfully used them for the Federalist Papers. Function words proved to be suitable features for a number of reasons: (1) they abstract from the content and are therefore less biased by subject; (2) their frequency is so high that it is generally assumed that they are chosen unconsciously by the authors; (3) although they are not easy to interpret, they are assumed to reflect grammar, and thus facilitate the study of how structures are transferred from one language to another. We used the list of approximately 400 function words provided in Coupling and Ordan (2011).One informatized way to capture parts of the language (admittedly flat) is to distribute triplexes such as PP (personal pronoun) + VHZ (have 3g) + BExplicit."}, {"heading": "4 The status of constrained language", "text": "In fact, it is that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able, that we are able to achieve our goals, and that we are able to achieve our goals."}, {"heading": "5 L1-independent similarities", "text": "In this section, we address L1-independent similarities between NN and T, which distinguishes them from N. We focus on characteristics that are theoretically motivated by translation studies and which are considered L1-independent, i.e., we have identified various linguistic phenomena as properties that can be easily calculated from N, NN and T texts. We refer to the calculated characteristics as metrics. Our hypothesis is that NN will be metric values similar to T and that both will be different from N. We used equallysized texts of 780K tokens for N, NN and T; the exact compilation is specified for each metric."}, {"heading": "5.1 Analysis", "text": "Obviously (see Figure 2), translational and nonnative productions in both sets of data show a consistent pattern compared to native texts: NN and T systematically exhibit lower metric values for all characteristics than N (with the exception of transitions where both NN and T are expected to show higher values); all metrics except the mean exhibit significant (sometimes dramatic) differences between N on the one hand and NN and T on the other, confirming our hypothesis; the mean shows more moderate variability in the three linguistic varieties and yields nearly identical values in NN and T; nevertheless, it shows overuse in N.The differences between metric values are statistically significant for all metrics (Section 5.2).7Normalized frequencies of nouns and intrinsic concepts are 0.323, 0.331 and 0.345 for N, implicit."}, {"heading": "5.2 Statistical significance", "text": "The results of the study show that the number of people who are able to move, are able to move, see themselves able to move in the world.

Even more dramatic are our results: native speakers and translators, as opposed to non-native speakers, use their mother tongue and the source language of the translator, with the main contribution of this work highlighting the unified L1-related traces of L1 in both scenarios. Our results are fascinating: native speakers and translators use their mother tongue as opposed to non-native speakers, but the translation seems to lean towards non-native use. The most important contribution of this work is empirical, establishing the link between these types of language production. While we believe that these common thinking is not coincidental, we establish more empirical results in order to be present."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We are extremely grateful to Yuval Nov for much advice and helpful suggestions, to Roy Bar-Haim, Anca Bucur, Liviu P.
