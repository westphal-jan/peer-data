Specifically, we use function words (FW), or more precisely, the same list used in previous work on classifying translation words (Koppel and Ordan, 2011; Volansky et al., 2015). Function values are raw counts (hereinafter referred to by term frequency, tf), normalized by the number of tokens in the chunk; the chunk size can vary slightly as the chunks respect sentence boundaries. For cluster experiments, we scale the normalized tf by the inverse document frequency (idf), which balances the meaning of a term by a factor proportional to its frequency in the corpus."}, {"heading": "4 Supervised Classification", "text": "We begin with the supervised classification by restoring the high accuracy of the in-domain (supervised) classification of translators, but highlight the deterioration in accuracy when cross-domain classification is taken into account. We first reproduce the results of the Europarl classification with the best performance characteristics, as provided by Volansky et al. (2015), and present the results for three other subcorporations: Hansard, Literature and TED. Table 2 lists the ten-fold cross-validation with different characteristics. All characteristics (except perhaps coherent markers) lead to excellent accuracy. Some previous work suggested that cross-domain classification of translation results occurs with low accuracy (Koppel and Ordan, Forthcoming). Our experiments correlate with this observation."}, {"heading": "5 Clustering", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Initial results", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "5.2 Cluster labeling", "text": "As always, the construction method of prototype LMs is driven by (i) abstraction of content that is used only for those purposes but cannot be used for those purposes. \"A cluster labeling algorithm examines the content of each cluster to find labels that best summarize its members and distinguish the clusters from each other.\" In the context of translational identification, the task of cluster labeling is to determine which of the clusters produced represents O and which T. We address this challenge by examining similarities between the language models of the obtained clusters and language models of the (presumably) prototype O and T samples. A simple unigram language model assigns a probability to each word that is proportional to its frequency in the underlying text; we use smoothed term frequencies that are scaled by the total inverse frequency of the language models. We then compare language models to reveal similarities between the prototype T samples and the prototype T samples."}, {"heading": "5.3 Clustering consensus among feature sets", "text": "Since different characteristics have different predictions about our data, we assume that consensus votes can improve the accuracy of clustering. We treat each cluster result (based on a particular set of characteristics) as a judge and vote on whether a single part of the text belongs to O or T. We use the cluster identification method of Section 5.2 to determine labels. The final assignment of a label to a cluster is determined by the majority vote of the various judges.Table 6 presents the results of these experiments. We compare the consensus results with the accuracy achieved by function words, the most powerful single feature set (on average), see Table 5. Both three and five judges consistently increase the accuracy. Five judges systematically (and significantly for Europarl and Hansard) exceed the result of cluster formation only with function words. This indicates that different characteristics tend to capture different aspects of the translational activity, ultimately resulting from a single, \"high-quality cluster result.\""}, {"heading": "5.4 Sensitivity analysis", "text": "In supervised classification, the amount of marked data has a decisive influence on the accuracy of the classification. This does not seem to be the case in clustering: accuracy remains stable when the number of chunks used for classification decreases (Figure 1a). Obviously, only 300 chunks are sufficient for an excellent classification. 9 We attribute the (slight) fluctuations in the diagram to the random selection of the 9The results on the literature corpus are limited by the amount of available data in this dataset. Subset of chunks that are the subject of clustering. Of course, the cluster accuracy stabilizes when the number of chunks increases as the effect of random noise decreases with more data. This result is of clear practical significance, as only a limited amount of data can be available in real situations. The accuracy of the supervised classification deteriorates when the size of the underlying logical units (here chunks) decreases (Kurokaal)."}, {"heading": "6 Mixed-domain classification", "text": "Poor cross-domain classification results, as described in Section 4, show that the discriminatory domain-specific properties of translated texts cannot simply be generalized to other, even related domains in the unattended scenario. In this section, we examine the tension between the discriminatory power of domain and translation-reserved properties. Our underlying hypothesis is that domain-specific characteristics overshadow the characteristics of translation. The next series of experiments includes (a balanced) combination of different data sets; we have excluded the small TED corpus from these experiments to prevent downsampling of other sub-corpora."}, {"heading": "6.1 Domain-related vs. translationese-based characteristics", "text": "We begin by examining the mutual effect of domain and translation effects on the accuracy of clustering. We first merged the same number of O and T chunks from two corpora: 800 chunks each from Europarl and Hansard, which yielded 1,600 chunks, half of which were O and T. We applied the cluster algorithm from Section 5 to this data set; the result was a perfect domain-driven separation of all Europarl and Hansard chunks, which yielded poor (chance) translational accuracy. In other words, we obtained two clusters, one consisting of Europarl chunks and the other of Hansard chunks, regardless of their O-v.-T status."}, {"heading": "6.2 Clustering in a mixed-domain setup", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it will happen, until it does."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion", "text": "The distinction between original and translated texts has proven useful for SMT, as awareness of translation can improve the quality of SMT systems. So far, the classification of texts has been carried out almost exclusively through supervised methods. In this work, we advocate the use of unattended classifications as an effective way to tackle this task. We show that simple features, paired with standard cluster algorithms, a novel cluster labelling technology and coordination among multiple characteristics, can provide very high accuracy, over 90% in several cases. Using various data sets, we strongly demonstrate that the approach we advocate is effective for identifying translation algorithms even when only a small amount of data is available and text drops are small. We also highlight the dominance of domain-based characteristics of texts over their translation-related characteristics and propose a similitary reduction."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which we are extensively exploring the robustness of our approach, with more data sets in different language pairs. We will first try to identify translation languages in French, using the current data set (in the reverse direction). We will also experiment with English-German, both ways, and hopefully also with English-Hebrew, a more difficult setup.The potential value of unattended identification of translation languages leaves a lot of room for further research. Our future plans include the use of different data sets and reduced data sets for LMs put together for cluster identification; in particular, we plan to explore the correlation between these two parameters and the scaling factor used for associating a label with a cluster result. To highlight the contribution of these results to SMT, we plan to replicate the results of systems in which we believe we will achieve an extremely high quality of SMT (we predict that SMT will improve in 2012T)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We are grateful to Cyril Goutte, George Foster and Pierre Isabelle for providing us with an annotated version of the Hansard corpus, and Andra's Farkas12 and Franc ois Yvon for providing us with the literary corpus.
