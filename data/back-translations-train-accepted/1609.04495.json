There are three main motivations for generalization, the first two have already been discussed: Trott allows to maintain the characteristics of sinkhorn distances, and fields such as ecological consequences bring natural applications to the general trot family. Application to ecological consequences is also interesting because the main unknown is the optimal transport plan and not necessarily the obtained transport distance. The third and final motivation is important for applications in large and ecological consequences in particular. Trott includes a subset of -divergences, and f -divergences satisfy the information monotony property, the coarse grain does not increase the divergence [1, \u00a7 3,2]. In addition, f -divergences are invariant among diffeomorphic transformations, and f -divergences."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank Seth Flaxman and Wendy K.

Both problems are equivalent, since both problems are the same: dM, q (r, M) plays the role of the lagrange multiplier for entropy constraint in eq. (20) [8, Section 3], and so there is an equivalent value for both problems: dM, q (r, c), c) = d, q M (r), c) = d, qM (r), c), (21)."}, {"heading": "11 Proof of Theorem 7", "text": "In this proof we make two simplistic assumptions: (i) we consider matrices either as matrices or as vectorized matrices without ambiguity, and (ii) we accept that the domain of matrices 4n2 (non-negative matrices with row- and columned matrices in simplicity P (r, c).
