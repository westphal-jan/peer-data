Motivated by such systems, we consider a setting where each worker is asked to rank a fixed (small) number of alternatives and, then, a positional scoring rule is used to compute the aggregate ranking. Among the apparently infinite such rules, what is the best one to use? To answer this question, we assume that we have partial access to an underlying true ranking. Then, the important optimization problem to be solved is to compute the positional scoring rule whose outcome, when applied to the profile of individual rankings, is as close as possible to the part of the underlying true ranking we know. We study this fundamental problem from a theoretical viewpoint and present positive and negative complexity results and, furthermore, complement our theoretical findings with experiments on real-world and synthetic data.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 18 Sep 2016 17:18:55 GMT  (142kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07460v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["ioannis caragiannis", "xenophon chatzigeorgiou", "george a krimpas", "alexandros a voudouris"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.07460"}, "pdf": {"name": "1609.07460.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Optimizing positional scoring rules for rank aggregation\u2217", "authors": ["Ioannis Caragiannis", "Xenophon Chatzigeorgiou", "George A.

First, we want to determine the approximation accuracy of OptPSR. Is there a polynomic time algorithm with constant approximation ratio? Second, we want to design an exact algorithm that is practicable. Our ambitious goal is to solve OptPSR instances as we have used them in our experiments. Third, we want to theoretically analyze scoring rules in random profiles created by Plackett-Luce or Bradley-Terry agents. Also, the consideration of agents following other noise models that are close to the agents of the real world definitely merits investigation.
