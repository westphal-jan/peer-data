From a practical point of view, market participants want efficient price models to set and question prices in derivative markets. Indeed, the earliest and simplest price models proposed by economists usually start from a set of economic assumptions and end with a dissuasive formula that takes some market signals as input (e.g., monetary policy, time to maturity). By contrast, machine learning studies solve option prices in a data-driven way: as a regression problem, with similar inputs to economic models, and real market prices as outputs."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "The oldest and most famous method of option pricing is Black-Scholes (Black and Scholes 1973).The biggest criticism of this model is its incompatibility with the volatility-smile behavior in real markets due to its constant volatility assumption. However, the volatility smiley exists due to the fact that real distribution methods are often bold-tailed and asymmetrical. Stochastic volatility models, e.g. (Heston 1993), aim to model the above behavior by allowing volatility, compensated by introducing a random volatility process (Heston 1993).Another stream of research suggests that jumps that represent rare events in the underlying process in order to alleviate the Smile problem are referred to as Levy models (Merton 1976; Kou 2002; Madan, Carr, and Choles 1998; are capable of generating volatility)."}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Background", "text": "We focus on EU call options. A call option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to acquire the underlying asset (e.g. the share) at a certain price (exercise price) at a certain future date (due date). For example, the share of a company is worth t = 0 (today) 100 dollars at a time, and a trader pays a certain amount (exercise cost) to exercise a call option with an exercise price of $110 and due date T = 5 (five days later). After five days, if the share price is $120, he can exercise the option by paying the exercise price of ST $110. If he sells the share immediately at $120, he benefits $10 (ignoring the option cost). If the share price of the company is below $110, the trader will not exercise the option and he has only the money he paid to buy the option contract. The option price problem is: What should be the price for this option at a time?"}, {"heading": "Requirements for Rational Predictions", "text": "Next, we list six conditions (Fillers and Shied 2004) C1C6 that a meaningful option pricing model should be fulfilled (Fillers and Stemmers 2004) C1C6 that a meaningful option pricing model should exist.

(ST | St ST) is a probability density function, so its value cannot be less than zero. (Fillers and Shied 2004), the higher the probability is that the underlying asset price will ultimately be higher than the base price.

The corresponding risk-free interest rates and index dividend yields are also provided by OptionMetrics and Bloomberg. Risk-free interest rates are interpolated by the Cuban spline to adjust the maturity of the options. Multiple data filters should be performed prior to model calibration. Bid asset is calculated as a proxy for the closing price. We discard the in-the-money option prices because trading for these options is very inactive. In addition, we strive to hold as many contracts as possible. We exclude contracts with maturity less than 2 days. Following these procedures, we have 3029327 option quotes on the left. As our model focuses on the pricing options, we transfer prices through put-call parity rather than through discredit of the put prices."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced a neural network for option pricing that surpasses existing learning-based and some econometric alternatives and provides guarantees for the economic rationality of its results. In future work, we will apply this option pricing model to radio frequency data and exploit similar constraints for other financial problems such as implicit volatility surfaces."}], "references": [{"title": "Y", "author": ["Abu-Mostafa"], "venue": "S.", "citeRegEx": "Abu.Mostafa 1993", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 1993}, {"title": "O", "author": ["Barndorff-Nielsen"], "venue": "E.", "citeRegEx": "Barndorff.Nielsen 1997", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 1997}, {"title": "and Sutcliffe", "author": ["J.
