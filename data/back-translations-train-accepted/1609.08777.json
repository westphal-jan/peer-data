Although perceptual color representations require only a few dimensions (\u00a7 2), linguistic expressions of color are often based on association and visual language. For example, there are 34,000 examples of \"blue\" in our data. The varieties of the blue range can be emotional, descriptive, metaphorical, literal, and whimsical. Consider these examples (best viewed in color): marbled blue, blueberry muffin, green blue.This rich variety of descriptive names of colors provides an ideal way to examine linguistic creativity, its variation, and an important aspect of visual understanding."}, {"heading": "2 Color Spaces", "text": "In electronic screens and other products, colors are usually displayed in RGB space, where each color is embedded in {0,.., 255} 3, with coordinates corresponding to the red, green and blue levels. Although practical for digital processing, the distances in this space are perceptually unequal. Instead, we use another three-dimensional representation, Lab, which was originally designed to correlate Euclidean distances with the differences perceived by man1http: / / www.colourlovers.com (Hunter, 1958)."}, {"heading": "3 Task and Dataset", "text": "Our dataset consists of 776,364 pairs with 581,483 unique names.

We looked at two cherished datasets from other sources; these do not overlap with the training datas. ggplot2: the 141 officially named colors used in ggplot2, a common plotting package for the R programming language (e.g. MidnightBlue. MediumSeaGreen), 2 Color: The color manufacturer Sherwin Williams has 7,750 named colors (e.g. Pompeii Red, Butter Up).3"}, {"heading": "4 Names to Colors", "text": "Our word-to-color model is used to predict a color in the laboratory based on the order of characters in the name of a color, c = < c1, c2,.., c | c | >, with each ci being a character in a finite alphabet. Each ci character is represented by learned vectors embedded in R 300. To create a color from the order, we use an LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) with 300 hidden units. The associated color value in the laboratory room is then defined as a2http: / / sape.inf.usi.ch / quick- _ reference / ggplot2 / color 3http: / / bit.ly / PaintColorNamesvector representation h-R300 of the order. The associated color value in the laboratory room is then defined as y = circle diameter (Wh + b), with W-R3 \u00d7 300 and b-R3 sparing the order of bet.This model forms the reference scale (from the 2015 onwards) for the reference scale (the reference scale proposed by Let)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Evaluation", "text": "The basic models are linear regression models that predict a color from a bag of character unigrams and bigrams. We compare an RNN and LSTMs with one and two layers. Table 2 shows that the two-layer LSTM achieves a lower error than the unigram and bigram baselines and an RNN. We see the same pattern of results on the out-of-domain test sets. The Color Turing Test. Our second evaluation attempt tries to assess whether the associations of our model are human-like. For this evaluation, we asked human judges to select the color that is better described by a name from one of our test sets: the predicted color of our model or the color in the data. For each set, we randomly selected 20 examples. 111 judges considered each instance as beta version. 4 judges were presented in random order and forced to make a choice between two preferred colors."}, {"heading": "4.2 Visualization and Exploration", "text": "To better understand our model, we offer illustrations of its predictions on different types of inputs.Character by character prediction. We look at how our model reads color name character by character. Fig. 1 shows some examples, e.g. blue, modified differently. The word deep begins dark brown, but ultimately changes blue to dark blue.Our model also behaves sensibly with colors named after things (mint, cream, sand).Genre and color. We can use our model to examine how colors are evoked in text by predicting the colors of each word in a text.Fig. 3 shows a colored recipe. Considering the fact that many words are reproduced in neutral shades of gray and brown, we examined how our model colors words in three corpora: 3,300 English poems (1800-present), 256 recipes from the CURD data in one text."}, {"heading": "5 Generating Names from Colors", "text": "The first of our two color naming models generates character sequences conditioned on color representation in the laboratory, following other sequenceto sequence approaches (Sutskever et al., 2014; Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2014).

The model is trained to maximize the conditional probability of each character being given its story. We used 300 dimensions for character bedding and recurence weights."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work and Discussion", "text": "Color is one of the lowest visual signals that plays an important role in cognition (Wurm et al., 1993) and behavior (Maier et al., 2008; Lichtenfeld et al., 2009). It plays a role in the recognition of human objects: In order to name an object, we must first encode visual information such as shape and surface information, including color and texture. By using visual encoding, we search our memory for a structural, semantic and phonological description (Humphreys et al., 1999). Adding color information improves the precision of naming and significantly speeds up correct response times (Rossion et al., 2004). Colors and their names have a certain association in our cognition. The Stroop Effect (1935) is a well-known example of color and color term interference: When we see a color term printed in a different color - blue - it takes longer to name the word in 2003, and we are more prone to naming errors (De)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we introduced a mathematical model for predicting a point in the color space based on the order of the characters in the name of the color. Using a large number of color-name pairs obtained from a color design forum, we evaluated our model based on a \"Turing test\" and found that the colors predicted by our model are favored by annotators over human-created color names. We also examined reverse mapping, from color to name. We compared a conditional LSTM language model with a new latent-variable model, resulting in a 10% reduction in perplexity."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Lucas Beyer for very helpful comments and discussions and appreciate all participants in our color testing."}], "references": [{"title": "Grounding language with points and paths in continuous spaces", "author": ["Andreas", "Klein2014] Jacob Andreas", "Dan Klein"], "venue": "In CoNLL,", "citeRegEx": "Andreas et al\\.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Andreas et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "A critical review of the development of the CIE1931 RGB colormatching functions", "author": ["Arthur D.
