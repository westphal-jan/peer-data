We briefly describe procedures for orthographic syllable formation of Indian scripts and non-Indian alphabetic scripts. Orthographic syllable formation cannot be performed for languages with logographic and Abjadian scripts, as these scripts have no vowels. Indian scripts: Indian scripts are abugida scripts consisting of consonant vowel sequences, with a consonant core (C +) and a dependent vowel (matra). If no vowel follows a consonant, an implicit wa vowel is assumed."}, {"heading": "3 Translation Models", "text": "We have compared the orthographic syllable model (O) with models based on other translation units reported in previous work: word (W), morphem (M), unicram (C), and trigram characters. Table 1 shows examples of these representations. The first step in building these translation systems is to transform sentences into the correct representation. Each word is segmented as a unit of representation, punctuations are retained, and a special word-delimiter sign (_) is introduced to indicate word boundaries, as shown here: W: Word Limit Values (PBSMT) systems. Since related languages have a similar word sequence, we use distance-based distortion models and monotonic decoding. For all units of representation, we have used phrase-based SMT systems (PBSMT) phrase systems (PSM) boundaries at the level."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Setup", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are able to live and live, as in the world in which they live.

This aspect of MT research is important in providing translation technologies to language pairs with limited parallel corpus but enormous potential translation requirements. We propose the use of the orthographic syllable, a variable, linguistically motivated approximate syllable, as a basic unit for translation between related languages. We show that it significantly exceeds other units of representation across multiple language pairs, with varying degrees of lexical similarity, and is also resilient to domain changes, opening up the possibility of further exploration of translation units at the subject level, such as segments learned through byte-pair coding (Sennrich et al., 2016)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Arjun Atreya for his contributions to orthographic syllables and the Technology Development for Indian Languages (TDIL) program and the Department of Electronics & Information Technology, Govt. of India for their support."}, {"heading": "A.
