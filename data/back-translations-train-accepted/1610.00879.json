In this essay, we introduce automatic \"drunk-texting prediction\" as a arithmetic task. In the face of a tweet, the goal is to automatically detect whether it was written by a drunk user. We refer to tweets written under the influence of alcohol as \"drunk tweets\" and the opposite as \"sober tweets.\" A key challenge is to obtain a annotated record. We use hashtag-based monitoring so that the authors of tweets mention whether they were drunk at the time of posting a tweet. We create three sets of data by applying different strategies related to the use of hashtags. We then present SVM-based classifiers that include N-gram features and stylistic features such as capitalization, spelling errors, etc. Through our experiments, we make subtle points about (which are best related to drunkards detection, which are unique features of our work) http."}, {"heading": "2 Motivation", "text": "Previous studies show the association between alcohol abuse and anti-social behavior such as aggression (Bushman and Cooper, 1990), crime (Carpenter, 2007), suicide attempts (Merrill et al., 1992), drunk driving (Loomis and West, 1958), and risky sexual behavior (Bryan et al., 2005). Merrill et al. (1992) state that \"those responsible for assessing cases of attempted suicide should also be able to detect alcohol abuse.\" Therefore, a drunken text message prediction system can be used to identify people who are susceptible to these behaviors or for investigative purposes after an incident."}, {"heading": "3 Definition and Challenges", "text": "Predicting drunken texts is the task of classifying a text as drunk or sober. For example, a tweet \"Feeling drunk. Can't remember how the evening ended\" has to be predicted as \"drunk,\" while \"Back from work late today, traffic was bad\" as \"sober\" has to be predicted. Challenges are: 1. More than topic categorization: Predicting drunken texts is similar to topic categorization (i.e. categorizing documents into categories like \"news,\" \"sports,\" etc.) However, Borrill et al. (1987) show that alcohol users have more pronounced emotions, especially anger. In this respect, predicting drunken texts is due to the confluence of topic categorization and emotion classification. 2. Identification of cited examples: It is difficult to obtain a set of sober tweets. The ideal designation may only be given by the author."}, {"heading": "4 Dataset Creation", "text": "Tweets are downloaded using the Twitter API (https: / / dev.twitter.com /). We remove non-Unicode characters and eliminate tweets that contain hyperlinks4, as well as tweets shorter than 6 words. Finally, hashtags that are used to display drunk or sober tweets are removed so that they contain descriptions but do not function as features. The record is available on request. As a result, we create three sets of data, each of which uses a different strategy for sober tweets, as follows: 1. Record 1 (2435 drunk, 762 sober): We collect tweets that are marked as drunk and sober using hashtags. Tweets that contain hashtags # drunk, # drank, and # imdrunk are considered drunk, tweets, while those with # imnotdrunk and # sober are considered sober."}, {"heading": "5 Feature Design", "text": "The complete set of attributes is presented in Table 1. There are two sets of attributes: (a) N-gram attributes and (b) stylistic attributes. We use uniques and bigrams as N-gram attributes - taking into account both the presence and the counting impulses. Table 1 shows the complete set of stylistic attributes of our prediction system. POS ratios are a set of attributes that record the proportion of each POS tag in the data set (e.g. the ratio of nouns / adjectives, etc.) The POS tags and the mentions of named entities originate from NLTK (Bird, 2006). Discourse connectors are identified on the basis of a manually created list. Spelling errors are identified by a spelling check by Aby (2014). The repeated characters capture a situation where a word contains a letter repeated three or more times as an assigned element, as in the case of a text 5th, we refer to both the Sby Sapple.com and Sapple.com as an emotional expression."}, {"heading": "6 Evaluation", "text": "Using the two feature groups, we train SVM classifiers (Chang and Lin, 2011) 6. We show the five-fold cross-validation performance of our features on data sets 1 and 2 in Section 6.1 and on data set H in Section 6.2. Section 6.3 presents an error analysis. Accuracy, positive / negative precision, and positive / negative memory are represented as A, PP / NP, and PR / NR, respectively. \"Drunk\" constitutes the positive class, while \"Sober\" constitutes the negative class."}, {"heading": "6.1 Performance for Datasets 1 and 2", "text": "Table 2 shows the performance for five-fold cross-validation of datasets 1 and 2. In the case of dataset 1, we find that N-gram characteristics achieve an accuracy of 85.5%. We see that our stylistic characteristics alone have a reduced performance, with an accuracy of 75.6%, in the case of dataset 1. Table 3 shows first-class stylistic characteristics when trained on the two datasets. Spelling errors, POS ratios for nouns (POS NOUN) 7, length and sentiment ratios appear in both lists, in addition to LDAbased unigrams. However, the negative memory is reduced to a mere 3.2%. This deterioration implies that our characteristics capture a subset of drunken tweets and that there are characteristics of drunken tweets that can be more subtle. If both N-gram and stylistic characteristics are used, there are negligible improvements. Accuracy for dataset increases for all six of us."}, {"heading": "6.2 Performance for Held-out Dataset H", "text": "Three commentators, A1-A3, mark each tweet in record H as drunk or sober. Table 4 shows a moderate agreement between our commentators (for example, 0.42 for A1 and A2). Table 5 compares our classifier with human. Our commentators perform the task with an average accuracy of 68.8%, while our classifier (with all characteristics) trained on record 2 reaches 64%. The classifier trained on record 2 is better than the one trained on record 1."}, {"heading": "6.3 Error Analysis", "text": "Some categories of errors that occur are: 1. Wrong hashtag monitoring: The tweet \"Can't believe I lost my bag last night, literally had it all in it! Thank God the barman found it\" was labeled \"# Drunk.\" However, this tweet is probably not a drunken tweet, but retrospectively describes a drunken episode. Our rating predicts it to be sobering. 2. Seemingly sober tweets: both human commenters and our rating failed to detect whether \"Will you take her on a date? But really like her\" was drunk, even though the author of the tweet had marked it so. This example also underscores the difficulty of predicting drunkenness when texting. 3. Pragmatic difficulty: The tweet \"Ireland's national dress is a single vomit... my family is beautiful\" was correctly identified as a drunken tweet by our human commenters. This tweet contains an element of humor."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion & Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we introduce the automatic prediction of drunks as a task for predicting a tweet as drunk or sober. First, we explain the need for predicting drunks as a means of identifying risky social behavior due to alcohol abuse and the need to develop tools to prevent data leaks due to drunks texting. Then, we highlight the challenges of predicting drunks by text message: One of the challenges is selecting negative examples (sober tweets). Using hashtag-based monitoring, we create three sets of data that are commented on with drunks or sober labels. Then, we present SVM-based classifiers that use two types of traits: N-gram and stylistic traits. Our system of drunks achieves the best accuracy of 78.1%. We observe that our stylistic characteristics add a negligible value to N-gram traits. We use our helpless data sets to compare our system with human data sets, like snowballing."}], "references": [{"title": "Nltk: the natural language toolkit", "author": ["Steven Bird"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the COLING/ACL on Interactive presentation sessions,", "citeRegEx": "Bird.,? \\Q2006\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bird.", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Latent dirichlet allocation", "author": ["Blei et al.2003] David M Blei", "Andrew Y Ng", "Michael I Jordan"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Blei et al\\.,? \\Q2003\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Blei et al\\.", "year": 2003}, {"title": "The influence of alcohol on judgement of facial expressions of emotion", "author": ["Bernard K Rosen", "Angela B Summerfield"], "venue": "British Journal of Medical Psychology", "citeRegEx": "Borrill et al\\.,? \\Q1987\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Borrill et al\\.", "year": 1987}, {"title": "Condom use among high-risk adolescents: testing the influence of alcohol use on the relationship of cognitive correlates", "author": ["Bryan et al.2005] Angela Bryan", "Courtney A Rocheleau", "Reuben N Robbins", "Kent E Hutchinson"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Bryan et al\\.,? \\Q2005\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bryan et al\\.", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Effects of alcohol on human aggression: An intergrative research review", "author": ["Bushman", "Cooper1990] Brad J Bushman", "Harris M Cooper"], "venue": "Psychological bulletin,", "citeRegEx": "Bushman et al\\.,? \\Q1990\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bushman et al\\.", "year": 1990}, {"title": "Heavy alcohol use and crime: Evidence from underage drunk-driving laws", "author": ["Christopher Carpenter"], "venue": "Journal of Law and Economics,", "citeRegEx": "Carpenter.,? \\Q2007\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Carpenter.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Libsvm: a library for support vector machines", "author": ["Chang", "Lin2011] Chih-Chung Chang", "Chih-Jen Lin"], "venue": "ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),", "citeRegEx": "Chang et al\\.,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chang et al\\.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "The influence of alcohol on automobile driving ability: An experimental study for the evaluation of certain medicological aspects", "author": ["Loomis", "West1958] Ted A Loomis", "TC West"], "venue": "Quarterly journal of studies on alcohol,", "citeRegEx": "Loomis et al\\.,? \\Q1958\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Loomis et al\\.", "year": 1958}, {"title": "Alcohol and attempted suicide", "author": ["Merrill et al.1992] John Merrill", "GABRIELLE MILKER", "John Owens", "Allister Vale"], "venue": "British journal of addiction,", "citeRegEx": "Merrill et al\\.,? \\Q1992\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Merrill et al\\.", "year": 1992}, {"title": "Putting stress into words: Health, linguistic, and therapeutic implications", "author": ["James W Pennebaker"], "venue": "Behaviour research and therapy,", "citeRegEx": "Pennebaker.,? \\Q1993\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Pennebaker.", "year": 1993}, {"title": "Writing about emotional experiences as a therapeutic process", "author": ["James W Pennebaker"], "venue": "Psychological science,", "citeRegEx": "Pennebaker.,? \\Q1997\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Pennebaker.", "year": 1997}, {"title": "Experimenting with distant supervision for emotion classification", "author": ["Purver", "Battersby2012] Matthew Purver", "Stuart Battersby"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 13th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,", "citeRegEx": "Purver et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Purver et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Using topic modeling to improve prediction of neuroticism and depression", "author": ["Resnik et al.2013] Philip Resnik", "Anderson Garron", "Rebecca Resnik"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural,", "citeRegEx": "Resnik et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Resnik et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Recognizing contextual polarity in phrase-level sentiment analysis.
