Model-based methods where the real-world target domain is approximated using a simulated source domain provide an avenue to tackle the above challenges by augmenting real data with simulated data. However, discrepancies between the simulated source domain and the target domain pose a challenge for simulated training. We introduce the EPOpt algorithm, which uses an ensemble of simulated source domains and a form of adversarial training to learn policies that are robust and generalize to a broad range of possible target domains, including to unmodeled effects. Further, the probability distribution over source domains in the ensemble can be adapted using data from target domain and approximate Bayesian methods, to progressively make it a better approximation. Thus, learning on a model ensemble, along with source domain adaptation, provides the benefit of both robustness and learning/adaptation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 06:51:58 GMT  (346kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01283v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 07:18:36 GMT  (346kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01283v2", "Supplementary video:this https URL; added additional explanation for equation (2)"], ["v3", "Fri, 16 Dec 2016 16:48:17 GMT  (543kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01283v3", "Supplementary video:this https URL"], ["v4", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 19:58:56 GMT  (397kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01283v4", "Accepted for publication at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2017.

Therefore, we look at a series of MDPs with the same state and action space, each MDP defined by a parameter vector p. Each MDP in this group could potentially have different transition functions, rewards, and initial state distributions.

We also describe how our approach can be combined with Bayesian model fitting to match the source domain ensemble to a target domain, using our algorithm to train robust and generalizable strategies in an overall set of simulated domains, and our experimental results show that the ensemble approach provides strategies that are robust to some unmodelled effects. Our experiments also show that Bayesian source semblee fitting distributions across models that produce better strategies on the target domain than standard maximum probability algorithms we currently use to support higher probability algorithms in particular the present."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank Emo Todorov and Sham Kakade for their insightful comments about the work and Emo Todorov for the MuJoCo simulator.
