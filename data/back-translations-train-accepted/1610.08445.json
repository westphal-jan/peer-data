The goal of lifted inference is to carry out probabilistic inference without needing to reason about each individual separately, by instead treating exchangeable, undistinguished objects as a whole. In this paper, we study the domain recursion inference rule, which, despite its central role in early theoretical results on domain-lifted inference, has later been believed redundant. We show that this rule is more powerful than expected, and in fact significantly extends the range of models for which lifted inference runs in time polynomial in the number of individuals in the domain. This includes an open problem called S4, the symmetric transitivity model, and a first-order logic encoding of the birthday paradox. We further identify new classes S2FO2 and S2RU of domain-liftable theories, which respectively subsume FO2 and recursively unary theories, the largest classes of domain-liftable theories known so far, and show that using domain recursion can achieve exponential speedup even in theories that cannot fully be lifted with the existing set of inference rules.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 18:13:42 GMT  (186kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08445v1", "Accepted at NIPS-2016. 22 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at NIPS-2016. 22 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["seyed mehran kazemi", "angelika kimmig", "guy van den broeck", "david poole"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.08445"}, "pdf": {"name": "1610.08445.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "New Liftable Classes for First-Order Probabilistic Inference", "authors": ["Seyed Mehran Kazemi", "Angelika Kimmig"], "emails": ["smkazemi@cs.ubc.ca", "angelika.kimmig@cs.kuleuven.be", "guyvdb@cs.ucla.edu", "poole@cs.ubc.ca"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it is at an all-time high in the history of the European Union."}, {"heading": "2 Background and Notation", "text": "A logical variable (LV) is typed with a population.

We also demonstrated how useful this rule is for theories outside of these classes. Our work opens up a future research direction for identifying and characterizing larger theory classes that can be domain-liftable using domain recursion. It also helps us come closer to a dichotomy between theories that are domain-liftable and those that are not, similar to the Dalvi and Suciu dichotomy result [6] for answering queries in probability databases. It has been shown [15, 16] that summarizing the WFOMC rules to low-level programs (e.g. C + + programs) provides 175-fold acceleration compared to other approaches. While putting together the previously known rules to low-level programs was easy, the summary of the domain-recurrence programs (e.g. C + to low-level recurrence programs) offered 175fold acceleration results."}, {"heading": "9 Proofs of the Theorems, Propositions, and Lemmas", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "9.1 Proof of Proposition 1", "text": "The proof that \"we\" (\"we\"), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we (we),\" we \"(we),\" we \"(we),\" we \"(we),\" we \"(we),\" we \"(we),\" we \"(we),\" we \"(we),\" we \"(we),\" we \"(we),\" we (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" we \"(we),\" we \"we\" (we), \"we\" we (we), \"we (we),\" we \"we\" we \"(we),\" we \"we (we\" (we), \"we\" we \"we\" we \"(we),\" we \"we\" we \"(we\" (we), \"we\" we \"we\" we \"(we\" (we), \"we\" we \"we\" we \"we\" (we \"(we),\" we \"we\" (we \"(we),\" we \"we\" we \"we\" (we), \"we\" we \"(we\" we \"(we),\" we \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we \"(we),\" we \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we), \"we\" (we \"(we),\" we \"(we),\" we \"(we),\" we \"(we\" (we), \"we\" (we \"(we),\" we \"(we),\" we \"we\" we \"(we\" (we), \"(we),\" we \"we\" we \"(we\" (we), \"we\" (we"}, {"heading": "9.2 Proof of Proposition 2", "text": "The proof of symmetrical transitivity has the following two sentences: Q x, Y, Y, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z,"}, {"heading": "9.3 Proof of Proposition 3", "text": "Proof: After scolemization [30] to eliminate the existential quantifier, the Birthday Paradox Theory contains the following theories: p, p, d, p, p, d1, d2, d1, d1, d2, d2, d2, Born (p, d2), and p, p1, p2, p, d, d: \u00ac Born (p1, d), Born (p2, d), where S is the Skolem predicate.

The goal of lifted inference is to carry out probabilistic inference without needing to reason about each individual separately, by instead treating exchangeable, undistinguished objects as a whole. In this paper, we study the domain recursion inference rule, which, despite its central role in early theoretical results on domain-lifted inference, has later been believed redundant. We show that this rule is more powerful than expected, and in fact significantly extends the range of models for which lifted inference runs in time polynomial in the number of individuals in the domain. This includes an open problem called S4, the symmetric transitivity model, and a first-order logic encoding of the birthday paradox. We further identify new classes S 2FO and S RU of domain-liftable theories, which respectively subsume FO and recursively unary theories, the largest classes of domain-liftable theories known so far, and show that using domain recursion can achieve exponential speedup even in theories that cannot fully be lifted with the existing set of inference rules.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
