We categorize errors in a prediction model as: known unknowns and unknown unknowns (Attenberg, Ipeirotis, and Provost 2015). A known unknown is a data point for which the model makes a low-certainty prediction, whereas unknown unknowns correspond to points for which the model is confident in its predictions but actually makes mistakes. Because the model lacks awareness of such unknown unknowns, approaches to addressing known unknowns (e.g. active learning) cannot be used to detect unknown unknowns. Unknown unknowns occur especially when the data used to build a prediction model is not representative of the samples that occur during the test period, i.e. when the model is used in the wild."}, {"heading": "Learning Algorithm", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Training Data", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Dogs Cats", "text": "This year it is so far that it will be able to erenen.lcihsrc\u00fcehnlcS mentioned above."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "In this section, we review previous research relevant to the discovery of unknown unknowns and cover the work related to Descriptive Space Partitioning and the Bandit for Unknown Unknowns algorithm in later sections. Unknown Unknowns The problem of incompleteness of models and the challenge of dealing with unknown unknowns in the real world has already come to the forefront as a critical topic in discussions about the use of AI technologies (Horvitz 2008). Attenberg et. al. introduced the idea of using human input to identify unknown unknowns, but their studies left the task of exploration and discovery entirely to humans without any support (Attenberg, Ipeirotis and Provost 2015). In contrast, we propose an algorithmic framework in which the role of the oracle is simpler and more realistic: the oracle is queried only for labels of selected instances selected by our algorithmic framework."}, {"heading": "Problem Formulation", "text": "Considering a black box prediction model that takes a data point x with the properties F = {f1, f2, \u00b7 fL} and a class c # x2 and a confidence point number s # x1 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x2 # x3 # x3 # x3 # x3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 #"}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "First, we introduce Descriptive Space Partitioning (DSP), which evokes a resemblance-like partition on set X. Then, we present a novel, multi-armed bandit algorithm, which we call Bandit for Unknown Unknowns (UUB), to systematically search for unknown unknowns within these partitions, using the feedback of an oracle."}, {"heading": "Descriptive Space Partitioning", "text": "A key intuition behind our approach is that unknown unknowns are often the result of systematic bias (Attenberg, Ipeirotis, and Provost 2015), and we assume that these blind points do not occur randomly, but instead focus on specific areas of the attribute space. The first step of our approach, DSP, divides the instances into X so that instances together are probably indistinguishable as far as the logic of modelM is concerned. Partitioning X allows our bandit algorithm to detect regions with high concentrations of unknown uncontrolled species. We consider two instances as a and one as indistinguishable."}, {"heading": "Multi-armed Bandit for Unknown Unknowns", "text": "The goal of the second step of our approach is to calculate an exploration policy on partitions in such a way that it is the general usefulness of discovering unknown unknowns.We formalize this problem as a multi-armed problem and the algorithms for deciding which partition is given in which step to the query. In this formalization, each partition corresponds to an arm of the bandit."}, {"heading": "Experimental Evaluation", "text": "We present experiments and results on constituent components of our framework and the entire pipeline as described above. Datasets and Nature of Biases We evaluate the performance of our methodology in four different sets of data, in which the underlying cause of unknown unknowns varies from bias in training data to domain adaptation: (1) Sentiment Snippets: A collection of 10K snippets / snippets expressing opinions on different movies (Pang and Lee 2005). Each snippet (set) corresponds to a data point. We divide this data equally into train and test sets. We then distort the training data by removing sub-groups of negative snippets from them. We consider positive feelings to be a critical class for this data. (2) Subjectivity: A set of 10K subjective and objective snippets extracted from Rotten Tomatoes websites (Pang and Lee 2004)."}, {"heading": "Evaluating the Partitions", "text": "The effectiveness of our framework is based on the idea that our partitioning scheme creates DSP partitions so that unknown unknowns are concentrated in a certain subset of partitions, rather than being evenly distributed across all partitions. If unknown unknowns are evenly distributed across all partitions, it is highly unlikely that our bandit algorithm can achieve better results than a strategy that randomly selects a partition at each step of the exploration process. As a result, we measure the quality of the partitions created by DSP by measuring the entropy of the distribution of unknown unknowns to the partitions in P. For each partition pi-tionspi-P, we count the number of unknown attributes, upi based on the true names known only to the oracle. We then calculate entropy through the following group: {Upi / i i i i i Upi | pi P}. Smaller entropy values are better because they show higher concentrations of unknown entropy less in partitions."}, {"heading": "Evaluating the Bandit Algorithms", "text": "We measure the performance of our multi-armed bandit algorithm UUB using a standard evaluation metric in the MAB literature called cumulative regret. Cumulative regret of a policy \u03c0 is calculated as the difference between the total rewards achieved by an optimal policy of regret, which plays the arm with the highest expected benefit (or reward) at each step, and the total rewards collected by the policy of regret. Small values of cumulative regret indicate better strategies. The benefit function defined in Eq. 1 determines the reward associated with each instance. We compare the performance of our algorithm, UUB, with the performance of several baseline algorithms such as random, greedy, greedy strategies (Chapelle and Li 2011), UCB, UCBf (Slivkins and Upfal 2008), sliding windows, and discounted UCB for various values of the discounting factor Ub {0,8}, 0,0.5."}, {"heading": "Evaluating the Overall Methodology", "text": "In this section, we compare the performance of our entire pipeline (DSP + UUB) with other end-to-end heuristic methods that we have designed as baselines. Due to space constraints, we regret the results only for the image data. Results for other data sets can be seen in the appendix. We compare the cumulative regret of our framework with several baselines: 1) Random sampling: Random we select B instances of set X to question the oracle. 2) Lowest average similarity: For each instance in X, we calculate the average Euclidean space. r.t All data points in the training set and select B instances with the greatest distance. The idea is that instances that differ from those encountered during the training of the model may be potentially unknown."}, {"heading": "Discussion & Conclusions", "text": "To guide the discovery, we partition the search space and then use bandit algorithms to identify partitions with higher concentrations of unknown unknowns. In addition to presenting new partitioning and scanning algorithms, we will discuss a new environment in which these algorithms can be used to gain insights into predictive models used. Our work paves the way for alternative formulations of the unknown unknown unknown discovery problem, for example, when the budget is defined in terms of the total cost of the oracle query rather than the number of queries. The method can be applied to more complex environments where diversity in unknown unknowns is preferred, or where the usefulness of some types of unknown discoveries diminishes over time when sufficient examples of the type are discovered (for example, after notifying the engineering team that owns the classifier). In many environments, the oracle can be approached using today's known knowledge."}], "references": [{"title": "Fast algorithms for mining association rules", "author": ["Srikant Agrawal", "R. others 1994] Agrawal", "R Srikant"], "venue": "In VLDB", "citeRegEx": "Agrawal et al\\.,? \\Q1994\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Agrawal et al\\.", "year": 1994}, {"title": "Beat the machine: Challenging humans to find a predictive model\u2019s &ldquo;unknown unknowns&rdquo", "author": ["Ipeirotis Attenberg", "J.
