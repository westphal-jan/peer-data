We also demonstrate that our algorithm provides an O (log n) approximate hierarchical cluster for generalizing this cost function, which was also investigated in [Dasgupta, 2016]. Experiments show that the hierarchies found through the use of ILP formulation, as well as our rounding algorithm, often have better projections into flat clusters than the standard linkage algorithms. We conclude with constant factor inaccuracies for this problem: 1) no problem can achieve a polymicrofactor size or a constant SLDP algorithm."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Hierarchical clustering is an important method in cluster analysis, where a data set is recursively divided into clusters of successively smaller size. They are typically represented by rooted trees, where the root corresponds to the entire data set, the leaves correspond to individual data points, and the internodes correspond to a cluster of their descending leaves. However, such a hierarchy often represents several possible flat clusters of data at different levels of granularity; in fact, each pruning of this tree returns a possible cluster formation. Therefore, in situations where the number of desired clusters is not previously known, a hierarchical cluster scheme is often preferable to flat clustering. The most popular algorithms for hierarchical clustering are bottom-up agglomerative algorithms such as single linkage, average linkage, and full linkage. In terms of theoretical guarantees, these algorithms are known to restore basic truth-finding properties if the corresponding data is correctly fulfilled."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "The immediate predecessor of this work is [Dasgupta, 2016], where the cost function of assessing hierarchical clustering can also be seen as a strategy. Prior to this, a long series of research papers on hierarchical cluster formation in the context of phylogenetics and taxonomy have been conducted (see e.g. [Jardine and Sibson, 1971, Sbelow et al., 1973, Felsenstein and Felenstein, 2004]. Several authors have also provided theoretical justifications for the success of popular linkage-based algorithms for hierarchical cluster formation (see e.g. [Jardine and Sibson, 1968, Zadeh and Ben-David, 2009, Ackerman et al, 2010]). In terms of cost functions, a hierarchy has been evaluated in terms of the k-means or k-median costs it induces (see [Dasgupta and Long, 2005])."}, {"heading": "1.2 Contribution", "text": "While studying convex relaxations of optimization problems is fairly natural for the cost function introduced in [Dasgupta, 2016] however, it is not immediately clear how one would go about writing such a relaxation. Our first contribution is to give a combinatorial characterization of the family of ultrametrics induced by this cost function on hierarchies. Inspired by the approach in [Di Summa et al., 2015] where the authors present an integral linear program for finding the tightest ultrametric, we are able to formulate the problem of minimal hierarchical clustering as a holistic linear program. Interestingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, the specific family of ultrametrics induced by this cost function shows linear constraints that are examined before finding balanced separators in weighted diagrams. We then show how to find an optimal fracture solution using the first introduced in 1988 Sphere Growth Stetch (Rainghton)."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "A similarity based on the problem of clustering consists of a dataset V of n points and a similarity function.

Furthermore, there is a close link between hierarchical aggregations and ultrametric orders over discrete propositions, which point to other orders for the cost function over hierarchies.

Thus using the best known approximation algorithm for Sparsest Cut due to Arora-Rao-Vazirani, the top-down algorithm returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most O ( log3/2 n ) times the cost of the optimal solution. We improve this by giving an O(log n)approximation algorithm for this problem. Our main technical ingredients are a combinatorial characterization of ultrametrics induced by this cost function, deriving an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for this family of ultrametrics, and showing how to iteratively round an LP relaxation of this formulation by using the idea of sphere growing which has been extensively used in the context of graph partitioning. We also prove that our algorithm returns an O(log n)-approximate hierarchical clustering for a generalization of this cost function also studied in [Dasgupta, 2016]. Experiments show that the hierarchies found by using the ILP formulation as well as our rounding algorithm often have better projections into flat clusters than the standard linkage based algorithms.
