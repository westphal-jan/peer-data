Position enhancement is inspired by the Chinese restaurant process (CRP) and the distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP). In the voting phase, when selecting an answer, the user chooses one of the two feedback options: a positive or negative vote based on intrinsic quality and presentation factors. Presentation enhancement is modelled by a log-linear model with temporally varying characteristics based on the P\u00f3lya Urinary Model. The CVP implements the dynamics of becoming rich rather than a combination of these two preferred reinforcements and learns latent qualities of individual responses as inspired in Table 1. Specifically, each user follows at a point in time that is not interested in the subject I have described in Table 2."}, {"heading": "2.1 Selection phase", "text": "The CRP [1, 2] is a self-reinforcing decision-making process through an infinite discrete selection. For each element (product / question) i, the first user writes a new answer (check / answer). The T-th subsequent user can select an existing answer j from J (t \u2212 1) i possible answers, the probability of which is proportional to the number of voices n (t \u2212 1) j, while the probability of writing a new answer J (t \u2212 1) i + 1 is proportional to a constant \u03b1. While the CRP models of self-reinforcement - each vote for an answer makes a later selection of this answer more likely - there is a decrease in the actual selection rate in an ordered list with the display rank [6]. Since such rankings are mechanism-specific and are not always clearly known in advance, we need a more flexible model that specifies different degrees of position preference."}, {"heading": "2.2 Voting phase", "text": "We construct next a self-reinforcing process for the internal tuning phase. The P\u00f3lya-urn model is a self-reinforcing decision-making process about a finite discrete number of voices, but because it is interchangeable, it is not possible to capture contextual information encoded in each sequence of voices. Instead, we use a loglinear formulation with features based on the urns, which allows us to flexibly integrate other representation features based on the modeler's observations. Each answer has initially x = x (0) positive and y = negative voices, which could be broken pseudo-voices. For each drawing of a voice, we return w + 1 voices with the same polarity, i.e., if w > 0. The following table 3 shows time-developing positive / negative ratios r (t) j t = x (t) j (t) j (x) j + y (t) j + y (t) j + y (t) j + j j j j j (j j j) j j j j j j j (j j j j j j j t (t) j j j j j j j j j j (t) j j j j j j j j j (t (t) j j j j (t) j j j j (t) j j j j j j j (t)."}, {"heading": "3 Inference", "text": "Each phase of the CVP depends on the outcome of all previous stages, so the decoupling of these related problems is crucial for the efficient conclusion. We need to estimate the parameters at the Community level, longitudinal preferences and intrinsic qualities; the graphical model of the CVP and the corresponding parameters for estimation are presented in Table 4. We also calculate two coefficients of behaviour at the Community level: trendiness and conformity, which are useful summary statistics for researching different voting patterns and explaining macroeconomic characteristics in different communities. 3One might think (1) that two behavioural parameters based on r (t) j + s (t) j = 1 are equally useful for all t. However, such repair ametrization adds contradictory translations to qTj and makes it difficult to interpret different inclinations between positive and negative voices for different communities. 4When a new answer is written at a given time, u (t) ij (t) (t) ij) (t)."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "We rate the CVP on Amazon product ratings and 82 topic-specific forums from the StackExchange network. [16] The Amazon database [16] originally consisted of 595 products with daily snapshots of write / vote results from October 2012 to March 2013. After eliminating duplicate responses to fewer than five reviews and products with fewer than five reviews or fragmented trajectories, there are 7,363 products left. For StackExchange database 8, we filter out questions from each community with fewer than five answers in addition to the answer chosen by the question. 9 We drop communities with fewer than 100 pre-processing questions. Many of these are \"meta\" forums where users discuss policy and logistics for their original forum data. 6different seasons of TV shows have different ASIN codes, but share the same ratings. 7If the number of total votes between the last snapshot and the first snapshot of the later fragment is insufficient, we simply fill in the missing information with the snapshots from the last snapshots."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "Unlike many interchangeable random processes, the CVP takes voting sequences into account by assigning different weights based on the context in which each vote was cast. Instead of trying to model the function of answering f, which is mechanism-specific and often based on the strategies of service providers, we use the fully observed voting sequences by assessing the hidden intrinsic quality of each answer and deriving two coefficients of conduct for community-level research from it. The proposed log-linear urnal model is capable of generating non-interchangeable voices with great scalability to include other factors such as length distortions or other textual features. As we are able to observe social interactions as they occur, and not just retrospectively, we will increasingly be able to use models that go beyond interchangeability, such as length distortions or other textual features."}], "references": [{"title": "Exchangeability and related topics", "author": ["D.J.
