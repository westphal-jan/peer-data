Sum-product networks are a class of deep models where, surprisingly, inference remains tractable even when an arbitrary number of hidden layers are present. In this paper, we generalize this result to a much broader set of learning problems: all those where inference consists of summing a function over a semiring. This includes satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, optimization, integration, and others. In any semiring, for summation to be tractable it suffices that the factors of every product have disjoint scopes. This unifies and extends many previous results in the literature. Enforcing this condition at learning time thus ensures that the learned models are tractable. We illustrate the power and generality of this approach by applying it to a new type of structured prediction problem: learning a nonconvex function that can be globally optimized in polynomial time. We show empirically that this greatly outperforms the standard approach of learning without regard to the cost of optimization.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Nov 2016 00:46:33 GMT  (267kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03553v1", "15 pages (10 body, 5 pages of appendices)"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages (10 body, 5 pages of appendices)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["abram l friesen", "pedro m domingos"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.03553"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.03553.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "The Sum-Product Theorem: A Foundation for Learning Tractable Models", "authors": ["Abram L.

Thus, we developed a general inference algorithm and an algorithm for learning tractable representations in each semiring. We demonstrated the power and universality of our approach by applying it to learning a nonconvex function that can be optimized in polynomial time, a new type of structured prediction problems. We demonstrated empirically that our learned function far exceeds a continuous function that was learned without taking into account the cost of its optimization. We also demonstrated that the sum product theorem specifies an exponentially weaker condition for tractability than small tree width, and that its conclusions include many earlier results in the literature, as well as a new set of results."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was partly funded by ONR grants N0001413-1-0720 and N00014-12-1-0312 and AFRL Treaty FA8750-13-2-0019.

Sumproduct networks are a class of deep models where, surprisingly, inference remains tractable even when an arbitrary number of hidden layers are present. In this paper, we generalize this result to a much broader set of learning problems: all those where inference consists of summing a function over a semiring. This includes satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, optimization, integration, and others. In any semiring, for summation to be tractable it suffices that the factors of every product have disjoint scopes. This unifies and extends many previous results in the literature. Enforcing this condition at learning time thus ensures that the learned models are tractable. We illustrate the power and generality of this approach by applying it to a new type of structured prediction problem: learning a nonconvex function that can be globally optimized in polynomial time. We show empirically that this greatly outperforms the standard approach of learning without regard to the cost of optimization.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
