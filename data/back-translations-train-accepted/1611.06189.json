Finding the \"best\" set of vertices of a tournament is a well studied problem in social choice theory. A {\\em tournament solution} takes a tournament as input and outputs a subset of vertices of the input tournament. However, in many applications, for example, choosing the best set of drugs from a given set of drugs, the edges of the tournament are given only implicitly and knowing the orientation of an edge is costly. In such scenarios, we would like to know the best set of vertices (according to some tournament solution) by \"querying\" as few edges as possible. We, in this paper, precisely study this problem for commonly used tournament solutions: given an oracle access to the edges of a tournament T, find $f(T)$ by querying as few edges as possible, for a tournament solution f. We first show that the set of Condorcet non-losers in a tournament can be found by querying $2n-\\lfloor \\log n \\rfloor -2$ edges only and this is tight in the sense that every algorithm for finding the set of Condorcet non-losers needs to query at least $2n-\\lfloor \\log n \\rfloor -2$ edges in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input tournament. We then move on to study other popular tournament solutions and show that any algorithm for finding the Copeland set, the Slater set, the Markov set, the bipartisan set, the uncovered set, the Banks set, and the top cycle must query $\\Omega(n^2)$ edges in the worst case. On the positive side, we are able to circumvent our strong query complexity lower bound results by proving that, if the size of the top cycle of the input tournament is at most $k$, then we can find all the tournament solutions mentioned above by querying $O(nk + \\frac{n\\log n}{\\log(1-\\frac{1}{k})})$ edges only.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Nov 2016 18:19:32 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06189v1", "To appear in AAAI 2017"], ["v2", "Mon, 21 Nov 2016 13:26:00 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06189v2", "To appear in AAAI 2017"], ["v3", "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 05:45:42 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06189v3", "To appear in AAAI 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in AAAI 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI cs.DM", "authors": ["palash dey"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.06189"}, "pdf": {"name": "1611.06189.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 161 1,06 189v 1 [cs.D S] 1 8N ov2 01A Direction chart, where there is exactly one edge between each pair of vertices, is called a tournament. Finding the \"best\" set of vertices of a tournament is a well-researched problem in the theory of social choice. A tournament solution takes a tournament as input and prints a subset of vertices of the entry tournament. However, in many applications we want to know the best set of vertices (according to any tournament solution) by \"queries\" as few edges as possible.

An important example of such scenarios is voting, where we have a set of alternatives and a set of voices that are linear sequence versus the number of alternatives. Indeed, many important voting rules, such as Copeland, are defined by the majority relationship of the votes entered. In contrast to voting, tournaments have found many applications in multi-criterion decision analysis [AR + 86, BMP + 06], zero-sum games [FR95, DLB96], coalitional games [BH10], argument theories [Dun95, Dun07], biology [CH07], where a tournament is dominant, has a combination of alternatives and a symmetrical relationship."}, {"heading": "1.1 Motivation", "text": "The fact is that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able, that we are going to be able."}, {"heading": "1.2 Our Contribution", "text": "Our specific contributions in this thesis are as follows: - We show that the query complexity of the problem of finding the set of Condorcetnon losers is 2n-1 [observation 3.1]. - We show that every algorithm for determining the Copeland theorem, the Slater theorem, and the Markov theorem in a tournament has query complexity (n 2) [theorem 3.1].

There are several other papers in the literature that investigate the query complexity of various problems in competitions. Thus, Noy and Naor use comparison-based sorting algorithms to find find find find feedback sets and Hamiltonian paths in tournaments [BNN90]. However, there is work in the computerized theory of social choices on the communication complexity of deviating voting rules [CS02] and the query complexity of preference determination in different do-mains [Con09, DM16a, DM16b, Dey16]. However, the query model in the above works is completely different from ours and as a result, neither the results nor the techniques involved in this work are directly applicable to our other work;

tournament solutions, at worst, you have to question almost all edges of the tournament. On the positive side, we have shown an important structural feature, as the top cycle of the tournament is small, which greatly reduces the complexity of the query in standard tournament solutions. An immediate future research direction is to investigate the complexity of the query for other tournament solutions, such as the minimum deck rate, the minimum extension rate, the minimum TC-retentive rate, the tournament equilibrium rate, etc. Searching for other structural properties of the tournament that can be used to reduce the complexity of the query in common tournament solutions is another important direction for research."}], "references": [{"title": "Social choice and multicriterion decision-making", "author": ["Kenneth J Arrow", "Herv\u00e9 Raynaud"], "venue": "MIT Press Books,", "citeRegEx": "Arrow and Raynaud,? \\Q1986\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Arrow and Raynaud", "year": 1986}, {"title": "Minimal retentive sets in tournaments", "author": ["Felix Brandt", "Markus Brill", "Felix Fischer", "Paul Harrenstein"], "venue": "Soc.
