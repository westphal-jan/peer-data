This ratio can be improved up to 111 if we impose a realistic limitation on the maximum number of resources used for each request.

We will then expand our mechanism to the general case and achieve a competitive ratio of 142 log k logT for both welfare and revenue, with T being the ratio of the maximum requirement length to the minimum requirement length and k the ratio of the true requirement density to the minimum requirement value contained in the previous style exceeding the Wang 1T."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Cloud computing is transforming today's IT industry, and more and more corporate and residential customers have moved their computing tasks securely from local devices to the cloud.

We say that M achieves a competitive relationship c for social prosperity, if and only if minI E (V (I)) v (OPT (I)))))). Similarly, we can define competitiveness for revenue. In this work, we design randomized mechanisms for the sale of reserved entities. Our results are summarized as follows: 5 (i) We will first consider a simple case in which k \u2264 2 and T \u2264 2.

We review only the most interrelated obligations in this area. In (Wang et al. 2015), the authors examine the same model as we do. However, truly deterministic mechanisms are designed on the condition that the number of resources used by each reservation is limited. Generally, a limit of 1 CkT is provided for deterministic algorithms. As already mentioned, their mechanisms offer no guarantee for the well-being of the provider. True online mechanisms for reusable or temporal sensitivity of goods have been well studied (Friedman and Parkes 2003; Porter 2004; 5Note that the basis of all logterms in this work 2 by default.Lavi and Nisan 2005; Hajiaghayi 2005; Gerding et al al al al al al al al al al al al al; 2011."}, {"heading": "Warmup: A Simple Case", "text": "In this section, we will examine a simple case in which k = T = 2.

There are several directions to explore in the future. Firstly, the competitive conditions of our mechanisms do not match the cap that we provide. It is interesting to examine whether there are ways to reduce this gap between the upper and lower limit. Secondly, as mentioned in the introduction, malleable reservations that allow the mechanism to determine the number of resources to be allocated to a reservation have been explored in other contexts. It is interesting to introduce malleable reservations in instance reservations in cloud and to introduce design mechanisms to optimize social welfare and revenue."}, {"heading": "IEEE.", "text": "[Chandra et al. 2015] Chandra, P.; Narahari, Y.; Mandal, D.; and Dey, P. 2015.
