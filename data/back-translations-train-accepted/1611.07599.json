Within this model, we provide the theoretical analysis and design an almost optimal delivery policy. Our contributions consist mainly of two parts, which are listed as the following. Theoretical analyses for optimal expected delivery of user consumption. By using some basic results at the end of the theory, we prove that the optimal offline consumption of user traffic is lower limited by an expected flow (THEOREM 1). This proves to be very useful for measuring the performance of delivery policy. In addition, we construct an optimal online delivery policy based on a recursion. However, solving this recursion requires an exponential time, which motivates us to design a more efficient approximation of delivery policy. Efficient near-optimal delivery policy. Inspired by some insights derived from the proof of a lower limit for optimal offline traffic consumption, we design a flow-based delivery policy that has as few advantages as possible for all users (this HALM delivery policy)."}, {"heading": "Related Works", "text": "The GD problem was considered a specific version of online mapping in the theoretical field. However, in the paper (Feldman et al. 2009), the authors examine the online matching problem when user types are drawn independently of a known distribution that resembles our attitude. Some generalizations take distribution information into account when it comes to distribution. In the paper (Feldman et al. 2009), the authors examine the online matching problem when user types are drawn independently of a known distribution that resembles our attitude. However, their goal is to maximize the appropriate size when there are users as a whole. They propose an algorithm with a competitive ratio of 0.6702. This result is improved by works such as (Bahmani and Kapralov 2010; Jaillet and Lu 2013)."}, {"heading": "Consumption Minimization Model", "text": "In a Guaranteed Scenario (GD), users are divided into a number of atomic types, identified by their characteristics (e.g. geographical, gender, age, etc.). (This means that each user who visits the publishing platform can belong to only one unique type.) Each advertiser has one or more ad campaigns, and each campaign corresponds to a contract with an publisher. The contract specifies how often the corresponding ad should be exposed and how many user types this platform can be used. (See Figure 1 as an example.) The first ad campaign retains 200,000 exposures, and all users aged 20 to 25 years are targets of this campaign. So if a user meets this requirement, the corresponding ad can be displayed to that user. Formally speaking, the ad campaigns and user types relationship are modeled as a demand chart G = (A, U, E) with the objectives of this campaign."}, {"heading": "Theoretical Analysis", "text": "In this section, we first demonstrate a lower limit on optimal offline expected user traffic, and then construct an optimal online policy based on recursion, the solution of which takes exponential time.

For convenience, we construct an input I (i) = (G, W (i), D) where W (i) = {W1,..., Wi \u2212 1, max {0, Wi \u2212 1}, Wi + 1,.., Wm}.

Settings constrained by GD's business model, the size of the demand-supply diagram in the real system is usually not large. So we conduct experiments with a random demand and supply diagram with 500 ad campaigns and 1000 user types. Edges are generated uniformly and randomly, while the average degree of user types is determined. To generate the user type distribution D, we select a random value rj > 0 for each user and set pj = rj = 1000 l = 1 rl. rj is selected in two ways: rj is uniformly [0, 1] (we call this method random normalization) or rj is equivalent to 11000 + E, using these user rates N (0, 1 / 60002) (we call this method Bouquet Perfection)."}, {"heading": "Experiments under Different Average Degrees", "text": "The first experiment is conducted under different average degrees of user types. Clearly, with a certain average degree, there are 100 input cases that are generated independently and randomly. Half of them use random normalization to generate D. The others use normalization perturbation. Wi is taken uniformly from [50, 100]. In the second experiment, we will show that the amount of exposure has little impact on performance, so a small value for Wi is sufficient. Experimental results for average grades 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 are shown in Figure 2. The height of the bar represents the average competition rates on 50 input cases with corresponding settings, while the vertical lines indicate the fluctuation ranges of these competition rates. According to this figure, the flow-based delivery competitive ratio among all average degrees has a much better competitive ratio. These fluctuation ranges of competition rates range from competitive rates to indicate that the flow-based delivery policy is second-best to the surprise-based policy on different degrees."}, {"heading": "Experiments under Different Exposure", "text": "In this part, we compare five strategies under different exposure constellations. Similarly, the number of exposures for each ad campaign is drawn uniformly from 100 to 2500, 5000, 10000 and 20000. We only look at averages 5 and 10. Similarly, 100 diagrams are drawn independently, and for 50 of them we construct distributions by random normalization, and for the rest Gauss perturbation is used. Then, input cases with different exposure constellations are constructed. Figure 4 shows the results for random normalization. The flow-based delivery policy outperforms other strategies among all exposure constellations. We point out that the amount of exposures seems to have little impact on performance for each supply policy. It somehow means that, considering an extreme case, when the demand-supply curve is complete, any reasonable delivery policy will be optimal."}, {"heading": "Conclusions and Future Works", "text": "In this paper, we examine the issue of minimising consumption for user traffic (CMPUT), which lies at the core of the DG scenario. We set a lower limit for optimal offline user traffic by using an expected flow of data that proves useful for performance evaluation, and then propose a flow-based delivery policy, which uses almost as little user traffic as possible to fulfil all contracts under realistic conditions. More importantly, it is robust in terms of estimation errors in the distribution of user types, and proves to be very useful for ordering and traffic management. Our flow-based delivery policy can be expanded to address other issues in DG, such as representation and smooth delivery. Nevertheless, there is still some work to be done, so that there can be a window of time for each advertiser indicating the start and deadline of the ad campaign. Another interesting issue is how the delivery guidelines will be designed, rather than how they will also come out of the delivery guidelines."}, {"heading": "Supplemental Material", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Omitted Proofs", "text": "Theoretically, the probability is higher than (1 + 2)."}, {"heading": "Extensions of the Flow Based Delivery Policy", "text": "It is not possible that we can simply change the number of users who decide to use email addresses in order to achieve representativeness.

A crucial problem for the advertising platform is how to fully utilize the valuable user traffic to generate as much as possible revenue. Different from previous works which usually minimize the penalty of unsatisfied contracts and some other cost (e.g. representativeness), we propose the novel consumption minimization model, in which the primary objective is to minimize the user traffic consumed to satisfy all contracts. Under this model, we develop a near optimal method to deliver ads for users. The main advantage of our method lies in that it consumes nearly as least as possible user traffic to satisfy all contracts, therefore more contracts can be accepted to produce more revenue. It also enables the publishers to estimate how much user traffic is redundant or short so that they can sell or buy this part of traffic in bulk in the exchange market. Furthermore, it is robust with regard to priori knowledge of user type distribution. Finally, the simulation shows that our method outperforms the traditional state-of-the-art methods.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
