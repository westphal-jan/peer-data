These methods ensure proportionality by ensuring that each party is assigned a number of representatives in a representative body proportional to the number of votes received. In this paper, we have proposed a simple and natural formal framework that allows us to consider approval-based multi-winner election rules as distribution methods. This framework has allowed us to establish similarities between multiple multi-winner rules, such as the PAV Rule, the Monroe Rule, the Top-k Rule, and the Chamberlin Courant Rule, as well as the appropriate distribution methods. These results provide interesting insights into the nature of the multi-winner rules analyzed, and they show how traditional distribution methods can be extended to environments where voters can vote for individual candidates. We thank Bernard Grofman, Pukkelson and Friedrich Skelson for their helpful discussions."}, {"heading": "A Proportional Justified Representation Implies Lower Quota", "text": "In this section, we demonstrate that the multiple winner rule, which fulfils proportional representation, establishes a method of proportional representation that meets the quota.
