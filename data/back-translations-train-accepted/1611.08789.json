It is learned from a very young age and is mastered with practice. In fact, the ability to imitate one's own handwriting is not infallible. A person's writing style varies slightly depending on the conditions. Therefore, we believe that the use of Generative Adversarial Networks to artificially synthesize a style of handwriting could offer a better solution to achieve human-like writing. The current state of handwriting recognition is achieved using recurring neural networks (Graves et al. 2008). We present a more biologically inspired outlook. We aim to provide the network with a training environment similar to that of humans. We provide the dataset consisting of alphabets (A-Z and a-z) to the generator network to learn individual alphabets."}, {"heading": "Architecture", "text": "The first layers of the DCGAN consist of a revolutionary network that performs incremental folds in reverse order, replacing the spatial scanning in conventional CNNs. This helps the generator shown in Figure 1 to learn its own upsampling. The same revolutionary layers are also present in the discriminator in reverse order. However, the fully connected layers are missing in DCGAN. The properties extracted from the highest revolutionary layer form the input of the generator and the output of the discriminator. To stabilize the learning process, batch normalization is applied to the discriminator input. Batch normalization is used to normalize the input to normalize the input and have the unit variance."}, {"heading": "Integrating Reinforcement Learning", "text": "The notion of reinforcement learning comes into play when letters need to be joined together to form words. For example, the distance between letters, strokes from one letter to another in italic handwriting is generally unique for a handwriting style. Therefore, the idea is to set up a reinforcement learning technique to give appropriate rewards or penalties so that the generator is able to learn the handwriting with greater accuracy. The idea of reinforcement learning is applied to the average distance between letters, ascent angle and descent angle of strokes. In training, the average spacing (distance) between the letters in words is tracked. Thus, 26x26x2 values are achieved (letter combinations can be Aa, Ab,..., Ba, Bb,..., Zy, Zz, aa, ab,..., ba, bb,..., zy, zz). Letter combinations such as aA, FF, etc. are ignored because such continuous combinations cannot easily be created for any English language."}, {"heading": "Experimental Analysis", "text": "We conducted our preliminary experiments with the MNIST dataset. Instead of using the character set of our own handwriting, we use the handwritten numerical database to test the scope of our architecture in generating digits. Accordingly, we use the ASCII value of the digits 0 to 9. The large variation in the font style results in variations in generated images of the same digit. For a certain font style, we believe that such variations will be low and the generator network will be much more accurate in reproducing a particular writing style. Further experiments would involve executing a specific handwritten dataset. We plan to use the phrase \"the fast brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\" several times to create a dataset that covers most variations. Further work would involve the use of trained generators and discriminators to generate words, and the dataset for the same will be generated accordingly."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Our algorithm hopes to provide insight into the role of GANs in achieving human-like behavior in complex activities and combining GANs with existing techniques such as reinforcement learning to enhance performance. Its uses include, but are not limited to, identification of forged documents, signature verification, computer-generated art, and document digitization. The implications of the results of the handwriting task are far-reaching. The task of imitating a handwriting style is just one example of how a complex task that requires practice can be learned from the proposed architecture and methodology. Therefore, the main purpose of the essay is to present a technique that we believe to be novel and closely mimic the learning network in humans."}], "references": [{"title": "Optical character recognition for cursive handwriting", "author": ["N.
