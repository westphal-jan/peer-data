The edge v represents a contiguous region of the river network (e.g. the total length of all segments). An edge e encodes a river barrier under which every person can move freely without crossing any barriers. A node v is associated with a reward that is proportional to the total probability of the habitat in that region (e.g. the total length of all segments). Figure 1 shows how a river network is to be coded as a directed tree. Each barrier is associated with an overall probability that a fish can pass the barrier."}, {"heading": "3 Our Method", "text": "We develop an iterative method (algorithm 1) to solve problem (2) using constraint generation (Boutilier et al. 2003). The overarching idea is to combine two optimization problems. First, the decision maker finds the best decision policy \u03c0T in relation to a limited opponent, who can only select policy parameter pairs from the finite group C. Then the opponent selects a new policy parameter pair in order to minimize the robust relationship with the current decision policy \u03c0T. The value of the decision maker U is an upper limit of the MRR value, since the opponent is limited to a finite subset of policy parameter pairs. The optimal value L of the opponent is a lower limit of the MRR value. At U = L we have an MRR-optimal decision policy. By allowing a small gap between the two boundaries, we can find a group R policy with almost optimal probabilities."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Decision Optimization Problem", "text": "The goal of problem (3) is to find a decision-making policy that maximizes the robust relationship with the limited adversary. Figure 3 represents a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to solve this problem, based on techniques from (Neeson et al. 2015). Variable M encodes the MRR value. Internal minimization is achieved by limiting inequality (6) to M. The continuous variable zp encodes the objective value of decision-making policy for determining probability p by (7). z (\u03c0; p) is a constant for each pair of measure parameters (\u03c0; p). C. xie is a binary decision variable that indicates whether the action i-Ae is applied to e (= 1) or not (= 0). Restriction (8) forces one and only one action to be taken on each edge, and (9) is the budgetary constraint that no action is taken on each edge."}, {"heading": "3.2 The Adversary Optimization Problem", "text": "In the opposing optimization stage, we first want to solve a dynamic programming problem (4) to find a problem (4), but then develop a strategy that reduces the time (4). In the opposing optimization stage, we want to solve a problem (4) to solve this problem (4). There is a policy-parameter pair with robust ratios at most (1 +) OPT in time O (n 4\u00b52), where the number of nodes in the tree, and OPT is the optimal value of (4). FPTAS only approximates minimizes the target, so that the value L reached does not reach a lower limit in algorithm 1. However, the approximation guarantee implies thatL = L 1 + is a lower limit. In the rest of this section, we prove theorem 1 (evidence of some auxiliary results is left in appendix)."}, {"heading": "4 Other Criterion of Robustness", "text": "A slightly different method of quantifying ruggedness is the use of regret (Kumar et al. 2016; Boutilier et al. 2003). The policy that minimizes regret is defined by the following measures: c (\u03c0) \u2264 B max \u03c0 \": c (\u03c0) \u2264 B z (p) \u2212 z (\u03c0; p) (30) The robust ratio and regret correlate asz (\u03c0; p) z (\u03c0; p) = 1 \u2212 z (\u03c0; p) \u2212 z (\u03c0; p) z (p) z (\u03c0; p) z (p) z (\u03c0; p). The robust ratio is in some ways the scaled version of regret. In experiments, we show that the \u03c0MRR also evokes little regret compared to measures calculated using other basic methods. Our algorithm with minor changes can empirically find a near-optimal \u03c0MR."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "We use data from the CAPS project (McGarigal et al. 2011) for the river networks in Massachusetts and synthetically define the missing parameters from the data. The data provide the point estimates of the initial feasibility probabilities. We use the method in (Kumar et al. 2016) to define the intervals of the initial passage probabilities before taking action. The interval of an initial passage probability is [p \u2212 \u03b2p, p + \u03b2p], where p is a point estimate and \u03b2 is a parameter that controls the interval probabilities: cultivations and dams. The point estimates for cultivations provided by the data are mostly in the range [0.8, 0.9]. A typical action that increases their passage probability to 1.0 and costs $100,000. Most of the point estimates for dams are less than 0.2. A typical action to repair a dam costs $3,030 and shifts its probability."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "The algorithm iteratively solves two optimization problems: the problem of decision optimization and the problem of quota minimization. The former is encoded in a MILP, and for the latter an FPTAS is developed, which is the more difficult problem. Empirically, we show that the strategies calculated by maximizing the robust ratio are more robust than strategies calculated by two other basic methods. In addition to searching for strategies with a high robust ratio, our algorithm can also produce strategies with little regret in large networks. These algorithms provide new calculation tools for environmental scientists who tackle decision problems with inaccurate models."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partially funded by a UMass Graduate School Dissertation Writing Fellowship awarded to the first author, who is supported by the Research Center at the School of Information Systems at Singapore Management University."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Stochastic network design is a general framework for optimizing network connectivity.
