Our key finding is that using automatically obtained discourse relations improves the prediction of when instructors intervene in student discussions, when compared with a state-of-the-art, feature-rich baseline. Our supervised classifier makes use of an automatic discourse parser which outputs Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) tags that represent in-post discourse features. We show PDTB relation-based features increase the robustness of the classifier and complement baseline features in recalling more diverse instructor intervention patterns. In comprehensive experiments over 14 MOOC offerings from several disciplines, the PDTB discourse features improve performance on average.

Forums are typically the only type of interaction between teachers and students. Forums often include hundreds of contributions from several thousand students, each competing with others for the attention of teachers. Reading and reacting to student intentions in forums is an essential teaching activity that helps instructors measure their course contents. Intervention is argued to facilitate the learning of students in which a teacher improvises in discussions. (Chen et al) 2016 and other online learning environments (Garrison, Anderson and Archer 1999; Phirangee, Demmans Epp, Hewitt 2016) instructors must be selective when responding to their limited selection strategies."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them are able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves, \"he said.\" But it is not so that they can survive themselves. \"In fact,\" it is not so that they are able to survive themselves. \"Most of them who are able to survive themselves are able to survive themselves, and most of the others who are able to survive themselves:\" It is so that they can survive themselves, that they can survive themselves. \""}, {"heading": "Data and Preprocessing", "text": "This year, it has never been as good as it has been this year."}, {"heading": "Baseline (EDM\u201915)", "text": "The basic system uses a maximum entropy classifier with the following features: Unigrams, thread forum type, student affirmations of a previous post, thread properties (# of posts, comments and posts + comments), average # number of comments per post, # of sentences in the thread, # of URLs and # timestamped references to parts of a lecture video. Authors found that their data sets were unbalanced, with non-intervening threads significantly more numerous than intervening, which motivated the use of class weights as a counterweight to the # non-intervening instances. Class weights, an important parameter of this model, were estimated to be the ratio of negative to positive samples in the training cases."}, {"heading": "Discourse Feature Extraction", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take one year to reach an agreement."}, {"heading": "Evaluation", "text": "We evaluate the models under two rating systems: an (i) in-domain scheme, and an (ii) out-of-domain scheme. We report on the performance of the models in terms of precision (P), recall (R), and F1 of the positive classes. We see that the combined model E + P outperforms baseline EDM '15 (Table 3), noting that stratification takes into account the highly unbalanced data and ensures that each fold has both positive and negative samples. We see that the combined model E + P outperforms baseline EDM' 15 (Table 3), in which we drill down, while EDM '15 performs well on the first offering (the \"-1\" suffix) of many courses that have higher intervention rates, E + P outperforms subsequent offerings that generally have lower intervention rates."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Unlike vocabulary-based models, PDTB-based features have proven resilient to domain differences between MOOCs. This domain independence supports improved prediction of interventions by instructors. Current F1 values are still significantly low. Better modeling of the instructor can help improve performance. We plan to address this in two ways: First, we model interventions by instructors based on the threads they have seen because they cannot intervene in threads they have not seen. Second, we model interventions based on the role that different types of training personnel play. We expect teaching assistants, course participants (also known as \"community TAs\" and \"mentors\") and the ability to have different motivations for interventions. They can also use different amounts of time to improve these course completions or make predictions."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research is funded in part by the NUS Learning Innovation Fund - Technology grant # C-252-000-123-001 and the Singapore National Research Foundation through its International Research Centre @ Singapore Funding Initiative and managed by the IDM Programme Office and an NUS Shaw Visiting Professor Award.
