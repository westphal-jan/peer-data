The typical approach is to ask the user to approach alternative solutions (Chajewska, Koller and Parr 2000; Boutilier et al. 2006; Guo and Sanner 2010; Viappiani and Boutilier 2010) and to use the resulting feedback to learn a (possibly approximately) consistent user use strategy. These algorithms are based on a fixed pool of solutions from which both candidates are selected for feedback and final recommendations. However, when thinking about an interaction between a user and a vendor, one imagines a more active role by the user who could suggest changes to candidates. \"For example, in a travel planning application, if the user comments on a trip to York Park, I would be more likely to answer a candidate to the MA."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "In this case, the shorter vector is implicitly zero padded to the length of the longer one.Coactive Learning.

We assume that the feature vector length is limited (x). The attractiveness or subjective quality of a configuration is measured by its utility, which we assume (Keeney and Raiffa 1976) to be expressive."}, {"heading": "Empirical Evaluation", "text": "We are not able to bring about an improvement in the proposed configuration. A real user would choose the improved configuration by balancing between cognitive performance and perceived quality of improvement. In order to take this fact into account, the user is asked to produce an improvement of the proposed configuration."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In contrast to coactive learning, the feature space is obtained dynamically through interaction with the user. We discussed the theoretical guarantees of the method and a heuristic query selection strategy that balances the effort of the user with the expressivity of the acquired feature space. We presented experimental evidence to support our results. Coactive critiquing competes with better informed baselines and often requires far fewer features to obtain comparable (or better) recommendations. As with conversation recommendations, coactive critiquing could in principle deal with text or speech crises in free form, see for example Grasch, Felfernig and Reinfrank (2013). Coactive critiquing is particularly suitable for constructive preference elimination tasks (Teso, Passerini and Viappiani 2016). Given that the computational costs of inferencing in these settings may become prohibitive, it is currently possible to support this interaction, which is unsafe to do."}, {"heading": "Appendix A: Proof of Proposition 2", "text": "We divide the evidence into three stages.
