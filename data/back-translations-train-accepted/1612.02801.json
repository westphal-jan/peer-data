There has been a significant increase in interest in generating conversation responses using statistical and neuronal machine translation. These approaches typically require a large number of message response pairs or context-message response triples than training data, and such data is usually derived from human annotations. One challenge remains to automatically identify coherent conversation lines in conversations, which is the goal of this paper. When answering questions, finding relevant context of questions through dependence modeling can help to select the answer; when generating text, the matching algorithm provides a message response to a particular message, but the other message's response to a particular context.In each case, the response to a specific message may be a contextual response."}, {"heading": "Data", "text": "We use customer service logs from a Chinese e-commerce site. Customers usually ask for products, promotions, deliveries and sometimes bargain with agents. Customers also ask for delivery of products. It is not uncommon for customer text messages to be ungrammatic and have spelling errors, making it difficult to use modern tagging and dependency analysis tools. Our record includes 9,000 chats with 5 to 60 utterances each. We randomly commented on 800 chats with 10 to 35 utterances each with an exchange ratio (percentage of consecutive messages from different speakers) ranging from 0.4 to 0.6. We processed the text using an open source word segmenter, Python-Jieba, and replaced non-character lexicographics and rare words by their type (e.g. links, emoticons and geographical names). We used only the most common annotator comments in our training. Annotations are executed by 6 native speakers."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "For each message we consider the following binary characteristics: 1) identity of the speaker, 2) contains question words or question marks, 3) contains answer words, 4) contains URL, 5) contains image, 6) contains emoticon. Let me [fki = a] = 1 if the kth characteristic of the message i assumes a value a (and otherwise 0). We also consider the distance between two messages. Let me [dij = m] = 1 if the message i m utterances is after the message j (and 0 otherwise). We define the probability that the message i depends on the message j as follows: p (ci = j | f, d, \u03b7, \u03b7, \u03c0, \u03c0, \u03c0, \u03c0 exp (\u2211 k, l, a, b I [fki = a] I [f l j = b] I [i = j] deploklab +."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "Rule1: Each message is associated with its immediate precedent if the precedent comes from the customer, otherwise it is associated with itself (i.e., customer / agent with customer, but not customer / agent with agent).The following table compares our discriminatory learning method with and without the semantic similarity feature of LDA with baselines. We also report the average probability that each method would have labeled a message in the same way as an annotator (uniformly randomly selected among the 3 annotators) based on a 5-fold cross validation. We also report the F1 measure (weighted average of the harmonic mean of precision and recall of each class).Our discriminatory learning method exceeds baselines, but the semantic similarity feature based on LDA did not bring any significant improvement."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We have identified a number of relevant characteristics and demonstrated how to train a simple probabilistic model from which links can be derived. We have achieved encouraging results, but there is clearly room for improvement. In particular, we believe that further improvements should be possible based on semantic similarity, and to this end we are investigating a variant of LDA that takes into account relationships between messages. We will take into account the correlation between characteristics. We also plan to refine the definition of dependencies in order to obtain more consistent annotations that will help improve the accuracy of the classifiers trained on the basis of these annotations."}], "references": [{"title": "Discourse parsing for multi-party chat dialogues", "author": ["Afantenos"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Afantenos,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Afantenos", "year": 2015}, {"title": "and Charniak", "author": ["M.
