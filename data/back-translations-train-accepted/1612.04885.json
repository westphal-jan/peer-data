Agents are anonymous in the sense that one cannot check whether a trade is being placed by one arbiter or non-arbiter, and whether multiple securities are being placed by the same actor. Letm = | A | refers to the number of arbiters. LetX is a binary event with a realized result in the sense that one is unable to establish a forecasting market for the outcome of X, with the resolution of the market decided by the arbitrators, and whether multiple transactions are being placed by the same actor. We consider forecasting markets implemented via a market scoring rule (MSR), where the underlying scoring rule is strictly correct (Hanson, 2003; Chen and Pennock, 2007). Any strictly proper MSR can be implemented as a market maker based on a convex cost function."}, {"heading": "3 Mechanism", "text": "The referees \"signals should be interpreted as the information they receive in relation to the outcome of X: review of news sources, observation of events, own opinions, etc. To ensure that referees report their information truthfully, we provide incentives through a peer prediction mechanism.

Since the market's closing price gives us a natural common prediction of the likelihood that a particular arbitrator will receive a xi = 1 signal, it is natural to use the 1 / previous reporting mechanism. (For prior signal probability, the 1 / previous mechanism uses the fact that the 1 / previous mechanism uses the fact that a truthful report achieves a higher payout than false reporting. However, as \u00b51 approaches, the payout for truthful reporting x = 1 is closer to the payout for false reporting x = 0. In isolation, there is still no reason for false reporting, but if the arbitrator has some involvement in the market, then it may be worthwhile to suffer a small false reporting loss in order to gain other profits. The following example illustrates this problem."}, {"heading": "Analysis", "text": "In this sense, it is also the way in which the US Federal Reserve takes hold of the US Treasury bonds it takes hold of.

The purpose of the exercise is to illustrate how theorem 2 can be used to inform the choice of fee f and confirm that realistic fees could be charged in practice to subsidize truthful arbitration. We will consider the logarithmic market rule (LMSR), which is the most common MSR fee in practice. For the LMSR, the costs and pricing functions can be calculatedCb (q) = b log (1 + e q / b), p (q) = eq / b1 + eq / b. Through the symmetry of the LMSR, q \u2212 and p \u2212 b (B) = \u2212 b (B). We will therefore resolve for the credits + b (B). We will find q \u2212 b (B) that we have the p (q) = f) and the solution for fq \u2212."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "This paper proposed and analyzed a mechanism whereby the outcome of a market for MSR predictions is determined by a peer prediction mechanism between a number of arbitrators, based on two important adjustments to incentivize truthful arbitration: market shares are paid according to the proportion of arbitrators voting for truthful arbitration rather than binary payouts, and payments for equal predictions are based on the middle of the two possible backbenchers, rather than the previous one. We have shown that this combination of adjustments makes it possible to charge a trading fee that fully subsidizes truthful arbitration. Calibration based on plausible values for clarity of question and trading volume suggests that realistic fees of 5% should be sufficient in practice."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Freeman has done some of this work during his time at Microsoft Research in New York City and also thanks NSF IIS-1527434 and ARO W911NF-12-1-0550 for their support."}], "references": [{"title": "Predicting your own effort", "author": ["D.F.
