Their results imply that optimal privacy can be achieved with only a sublogarithmic privacy loss (O (DP 128 log T)). We start this section by showing a similar result for EXP3 in Theorem 3.3 that EXP3 is already differentiated private, but with a per-round privacy loss of 2. 1 Our results suggest that EXP3 can achieve optimal regret, albeit with a linear privacy loss of O (2T) -DP. This is a huge gap compared to the full information setting and underscores the importance of our result in Section 3.1, where we demonstrate a concrete regret that optimal regret can only be achieved with a logarthmic data loss after T."}, {"heading": "In Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE 51st Annual Symposium on", "text": "[Dwork 2006] Dwork, C. 2006.
