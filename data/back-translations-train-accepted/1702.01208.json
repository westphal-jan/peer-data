Due to inherent ambiguity of data representation and poor data quality, ER is a challenging task for any automated process. As a remedy, human-powered ER via crowdsourcing has become popular in recent years. Using crowd to answer queries is costly and time consuming. Furthermore, crowd-answers can often be faulty. Therefore, crowd-based ER methods aim to minimize human participation without sacrificing the quality and use a computer generated similarity matrix actively. While, some of these methods perform well in practice, no theoretical analysis exists for them, and further their worst case performances do not reflect the experimental findings. This creates a disparity in the understanding of the popular heuristics for this problem. In this paper, we make the first attempt to close this gap.

For example, collecting human and corporate profiles or specifications of products and services from websites and social media can lead to billions of data sets that need to be solved. These entities are identified in a variety of ways, further complicated by linguistic ambiguity, missing values, changing attributes and formatting problems. ER is a fundamental task in data processing with a wide range of applications. There is a huge literature on ER techniques that includes machine learning, such as decision trees, SVMs, compilations of random learning strategies, random learning strategies."}, {"heading": "2 System model and techniques", "text": "The question that arises is whether this perfect oracle model is a pair of elements created by Wang et al. and Vesdapunt et al.

However, if we look at Hellinger distance, then Dist-1 is closer to the uniform distribution than Dist-2. These two distributions are used as representative distributions to illustrate the potentials of edge order and node order algorithms. In both cases, we get a uniform distribution that does not contain information about the similarities of the two edges. Consider the following probability density for fr and fg, where x [0, 1], and 0 < < 1 / 2, fr (x), fr (x), f (x), if x < 12 (x), if x (x)."}, {"heading": "5 Analysis of the Edge ordering algorithm: proof of Theorem 2", "text": "Leave R a random variable with the distribution fr and G1,.., Gt = ident random variables with the distribution fg.

Thus, for example, the expected cluster size of a node is in Vi | Vi | + (1 2 \u2212 2c) n, where c = 2 for Dist 1 and c = 1 for Dist 2. Therefore, the node sequence considered by (Vesdapunt, Bellare and Dalvi 2014) can be arbitrary. So let's take the current size of Vi is s, i.e. Vi already contains s nodes when v is considered. Let's consider another cluster Vj, j 6 = i, and let's leave the current size of Vi, i.e. the current size of Vi is s, i.e. Vi contains s nodes when v is considered."}, {"heading": "7 Experimental Observations", "text": "A detailed comparison of node order and edge order methods on multiple real datasets (McCallum 2004) is available for us in (Vesdapunt, Bellare, and Dalvi 2014, Figures 12,14). The number of queries output by the two methods is very close to full resolution. To further validate, we have conducted the following experiments. (i) We have created several synthetic datasets, each containing 1200 nodes and 14 clusters with the following size distribution: two clusters of size 200, four clusters of size 100, eight clusters of size 50, two clusters of size 30 and 20 each, and the rest of the clusters of size 10. The datasets differ in the way the similarity values are generated by using the values of either Dist-1 or Dist-2. The similarity values are further discredited to set values from {0, 0.1, 0.2,..., 0.9} We have used the widely used Cora values."}], "references": [{"title": "A", "author": ["K. Bellare", "S.
