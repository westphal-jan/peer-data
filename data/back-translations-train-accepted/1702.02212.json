As an example, MDLbased frameworks segment \"sing\" to \"s-ing\" due to the high frequency of morphemes: \"s\" and \"ing.\" Our framework combines semantic affinity with orthographic affinity to eliminate such an error. For the example mentioned, MORSE confirms morphemes such as \"s\" and \"ing\" from an orthographic perspective, but devalues the relationship between \"s\" and \"sing\" from a local and vocabulary-wide semantic perspective. Therefore, MORSE segments \"jump\" as \"jump-ing\" and does not perform segmentations on \"sing.\" To bring semantic understanding into this relationship, we rely on word representations (Mikolov et al, 2013a; Pennington et al, 2014)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Training Stage", "text": "Objects: \u2022 Rule set R, which reflects all possible affix transformations in a language. \u2022 R is populated by the following definition: Rsuffix = {aff1suffix\u00dd\u0441\u0438\u0441\u04422: D (w1, w2 ~ ~ ~) P V2, stem (w1) = stem (w2), w1 = stem (w1) + aff1, w2 = stem (w2), Rprefix is similarly defined for prefixes, and R = Rsuffix Y Rprefix.

First, performance is evaluated based on the task of morpheme segmentation and against the most commonly used morpheme segmentator: Morfessor 2.0. We evaluate performance in three languages of different morphological levels: English, Turkish, Finnish, with Finnish being the richest in morphology and English the poorest. Second, we highlight the inadequacies of benchmarking gold records for this task and describe a new data set we are creating to address the inadequacy. Third, we compare MORSE against morphologist using a number of words that should not be segmented from a semantic perspective, although they appear orthographically segmentable (such as \"freshman\"). In all of our experiments, we report on precision and recall (and corresponding F1 values) with positions of morphems that should be considered positive (since 2011)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Setup", "text": "Both systems, Morfessor and MORSE, were trained on the same monolingual corpus: Wikipedia2 (as of September 20, 2016) to control the factors within the experiment. For each language considered, the corresponding Wikipedia dump was pre-processed with an available Code3. We use Word2Vec (Mikolov2https: / / dumps.wikimedia.org 3https: / / github.com / bwbaugh / wikipedia-extractoret al., 2013a) to train word representations of 300 dimensions based on a size 5 context window."}, {"heading": "4.2 Morpho Challenge Dataset", "text": "As our first intrinsic experiment, we consider the online gold segmentation of the Morpho Challenge (MC) 5.

Examples of this are words such as \"red head,\" \"duck face,\" \"as always,\" \"whatever.\" A subset of these words is defined by linguists as exocentric connections (Bauer, 2008). MORSE does not suffer from this problem due to its use of a semantic model. We use a collection of 100 English words that appear to be segmentable but actually are not (example: \"however\"). Such a collection will demonstrate the ability of a system to distinguish frequent letter sequences from the semantic contribution of that sequence of letters in a word. We make this collection publicly available. 8https: / / goo.gl / EFbacj"}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "We compare MORSE with Morfessor and place the performance alongside the latest published results."}, {"heading": "5.1 Morpho Challenge Dataset", "text": "As shown in Table 3, MORSE performs better in English and Turkish than Mofessor and worse in Finnish. Considering English first, the use of MORSE instead of Morfessor resulted in a 6% absolute increase in F1 values. This supports our claim that semantic cues are needed in morpheme segmentation and also confirms the method used in this paper. Since English is a less systematic language in terms of the orthographic structure of words, semantic cues are more important, and therefore a system based on semantic cues is expected to perform better; indeed it does. Similarly, MORSE performs better in Turkish with an absolute 7% lead in F1 rating."}, {"heading": "5.1.1 Discussion", "text": "We suspect that the richness of morphology in Finnish has led to a sub-optimal performance of MORSE. This is because the richness of morphology leads to a rarity of vocabulary, which leads directly to: (1) deterioration in the quality of word representations (2) Increased vocabulary size exacerbates the problem of limited vocabulary (remember MORSE, which was limited to a vocabulary of 1M). In a language with productive morphology, the limitation of its vocabulary leads to a lower likelihood of finding morphologically related word pairs, which negatively affects MORSE's level of education, which relies on the availability of such pairs. In order to recognize the suffix \"ly\" from the word \"merry,\" MORSE also has to come across \"merry.\" Getting over \"merry\" is now a less likely event due to its high rarity."}, {"heading": "5.2 Semantically Driven Dataset", "text": "The performance of MORSE and Morfessor on SD17 is shown in Table 5. Using MC data (which does not adhere to the composition principle) to tune MORSE on SD17 (which adheres to the composition principle) is not optimal. Thus, we evaluate MORSE on SD17 with 5-fold cross validation, where 80% of the data set is used to tune and 20% is used to evaluate. Precision, recall, and F1 results are averaged and in Table 5 with the label MORSE-CV.Based on the results in Table 5, we make the following observations. Comparing MORSE-CV to MORSE reflects the fundamental difference between SD17 and MC datasets. Knowing the basis of the construction of SD17 and the fundamental weaknesses in MC datasets, we attribute the performance increase to the lack of compositionality in MC datasets."}, {"heading": "5.3 Handling Compositionality", "text": "We compare the performance of MORSE and Morfessor against a series of words that consist of morphemes that do not constitute the meaning of the word. As all boundaries in this data set are negative, we only give the number of segments generated to evaluate both systems (where MORSE is matched to SD17). The more segments a system generates, the worse its performance. We find that MORSE generates 7 false morphemes, while Morfessor generates 43 false morphemes. This demonstrates the robustness of MORSE in the face of such examples through its semantic knowledge and confirms our claim that Morfessor over-segments such examples."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own if they are not able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced MORSE, a first-ever morpheme segmentator that investigates the semantic structure at this scale (local and vocabulary-wide), demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms that use intrinsic evaluation in a variety of languages, identifying the weaknesses in current benchmarking datasets, and presenting a new dataset that is free of these weaknesses. Given a relative increase in performance that achieves 24% absolute increase over morfessor, this work demonstrates the importance of semantic cues and the validation of a new state-of-the-art morphem segmentator. For future work, we plan to address the limitations of MORSE: minimal oversight, greedy conclusions, and condensive orthographic models. In addition, we plan to optimize the training phase in the interest of broader adoption by the community."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work is supported in part by the IBM-ILLINOIS Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research (C3SR) - a research collaboration within the IBM Cognitive Horizons Network."}], "references": [{"title": "The CELEX lexical database [cd-rom] Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania", "author": ["RH Baayen", "R Piepenbrock", "H Van Rijn."], "venue": "Linguistic Data Consortium .", "citeRegEx": "Baayen et al\\.,? 1993", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baayen et al\\.", "year": 1993}, {"title": "The basics of item response theory", "author": ["Frank B Baker."], "venue": "ERIC.", "citeRegEx": "Baker.,? 2001", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baker.", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Unsupervised discovery of morphologically related words based on orthographic and semantic similarity", "author": ["Marco Baroni", "Johannes Matiasek", "Harald Trost."], "venue": "Proceedings of the ACL-02 Workshop on Morphological and Phonological Learning-", "citeRegEx": "Baroni et al\\.,? 2002", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baroni et al\\.", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Exocentric compounds", "author": ["Laurie Bauer."], "venue": "Morphology 18(1):51\u201374.", "citeRegEx": "Bauer.,? 2008", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bauer.", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Factored language models and generalized parallel backoff", "author": ["Jeff A Bilmes", "Katrin Kirchhoff."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technol-", "citeRegEx": "Bilmes and Kirchhoff.,? 2003", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bilmes and Kirchhoff.", "year": 2003}, {"title": "The SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task\u2014 morphological reinflection", "author": ["Ryan Cotterell", "Christo Kirov", "John Sylak-Glassman", "David Yarowsky", "Jason Eisner", "Mans Hulden."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2016 Meeting of SIGMORPHON.
