A morphological disambiguator is used to select the correct morphological analysis of a word. Morphological disambiguation is important because it generally is one of the first steps of natural language processing and its performance affects subsequent analyses. In this paper, we propose a system that uses deep learning techniques for morphological disambiguation. Many of the state-of-the-art results in computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing have been obtained through deep learning models. However, applying deep learning techniques to morphologically rich languages is not well studied. In this work, while we focus on Turkish morphological disambiguation we also present results for French and German in order to show that the proposed architecture achieves high accuracy with no language-specific feature engineering or additional resource. In the experiments, we achieve 84.12, 88.35 and 93.78 morphological disambiguation accuracy among the ambiguous words for Turkish, German and French respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Feb 2017 07:08:28 GMT  (42kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03654v1", "6 pages, 1 figure, Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 1 figure, Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["eray yildiz", "caglar tirkaz", "h bahadir sahin", "mustafa tolga eren", "omer ozan sonmez"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.03654"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.03654.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Morphology-aware Network for Morphological Disambiguation", "authors": ["Eray Yildiz", "Caglar Tirkaz", "H.

To perform POS markings in English, various approaches are proposed such as rule-based models (Brill 1992), statistical models (Brill 1995), maximum entropy models (Ratnaparkhi 1997), HMMs (Cutting et al. 1992), CRFs (Lafferty, McCallum and Pereira 2001) and decision trees (Schmid 1994). However, morphological disambiguation is generally a much more difficult problem due to the fact that it requires the classification of both languages, suffixes and the corresponding labels. Furthermore, compared to an agglu-tinative language such as Turkish, English, they can apply words to a limited number of word forms and part-of spoken products. Yu \u00bc ret and T\u00fcrre (2006) observe that more than ten thousand market types of corpus from a single door exist."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "This year it has come to the point where one is able to experience the aforementioned brain-consecrated, brain-consecrated brain-consecrated brain-consecrated brain-consecrated brain-consecrated brain-c\u00fccsrteeaeFnln"}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "Summary and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we present a model that is capable of learning word representation for languages with rich morphology. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to the task of morphological disambiguity in Turkey, Germany and France. We also show the effect of an unattended lecture on recognition accuracy and improve the current state of Turkish morphological disambiguity. We publicly provide a manually annotated test set of 20K characters that we believe will benefit the Turkish NLP. This paper presents a profound learning architecture specifically designed to deal with morphologically rich languages. Nevertheless, NLP systems that work with languages such as English can also benefit from our work. Using our model, English words can be divided into morphemes so that they can be better represented, enabling the creation of systems that are less affected by problems such as data sparseness (Luong, Socher and Manning 2013).While we are looking at the pre-schooling, we are just looking at the root formation."}], "references": [{"title": "and Karttunen", "author": ["K.R.
