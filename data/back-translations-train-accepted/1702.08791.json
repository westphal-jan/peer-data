But, in applications, the parameters of the problem are rarely known exactly, and using wrong parameters can lead to undesirable outcomes. We hence revisit a continuous version of the Budget Allocation or Bipartite Influence Maximization problem introduced by Alon et al. (2012) from a robust optimization perspective, where an adversary may choose the least favorable parameters within a confidence set. The resulting problem is a nonconvex-concave saddle point problem (or game). We show that this nonconvex problem can be solved exactly by leveraging connections to continuous submodular functions, and by solving a constrained submodular minimization problem. Although constrained submodular minimization is hard in general, here, we establish conditions under which such a problem can be solved to arbitrary precision $\\epsilon$.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:07:42 GMT  (228kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08791v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:24:28 GMT  (230kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08791v2", "ICML 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.DS cs.SI math.OC", "authors": ["matthew staib", "stefanie jegelka"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.08791"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.08791.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Robust Budget Allocation via Continuous Submodular Functions", "authors": ["Matthew Staib"], "emails": ["stefje}@mit.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The optimal allocation of resources in the EU is influenced when it comes to maximising the influence of information and information.

At this interval, each Rst strictly increases, and Theorem 3.1 applies. For D-standard sets, we have Rst (xst \u2212 x) / (ust \u2212 x) st \u2212 st) / (ust \u2212 st) and the fast search for elements, where each Rst is monotonous, Theorem 3.1 applies."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "We evaluate our Robust Budget Allocation Algorithm using both synthetic test data and a real quotation data set from Yahoo!

For both settings, we use | S | = 6 and | T | = 2, discrediting with \u03b4 = 0.001. We have created real probabilties Pst, generated beta posteriors, and constructed ellipsoidal uncertainty theorems XQ (\u03b3) and D standard theorems XD (\u03b3)."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Optimality", "text": "Theorem 3.1 and Remark 3.1 require that the values \u03c1 \u043a i (j) be distinguished at our chosen Lagrange multiplier \u03bb * and guarantee optimism under this condition. We illustrate this by four examples: for ellipsoidal or D-norm uncertainties and an overall influence budget C * {0,4, 4}. Figure 3 shows all elements of \u043c in sorted order, as well as a horizontal line indicating our Lagrange multiplier \u03bb \u0445, which serves as a threshold value. Despite some plates, the entries \u043c \u0445 i (j) differ in most regimes, in particular around \u03bb \u0445, the regime required for our results. Furthermore, in practice (on the Yahoo data) later in Figure 3, we determine that both solution-dependent limits from Remark 3.1 are very good and that all solutions within a very small gap are optimal."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Robustness and Quality", "text": "Next, we examine the effect of a robust versus a non-robust solution for different uncertainty rates and budgets of the adversary. We compare our robust solution with the use of a point estimate for x, i.e., ynom \u0109argmaxy \u0441Y I (y; x), where estimates are considered a basic truth, and the stochastic solution yexpect argmaxy \u0441Y E [I (y; X)] according to Section 2.1. These two optimization problems have been solved using standard first-order methods using TFOCS Becker et al. [2011]. Figure 2 shows that the alternative budgets are indeed sensitive to the adversary and the robust selected budget performs better in terms of yrobustness, even in cases where the other budgets do not have an impact. When the overall budget C is large, yexpect is almost as good as yrobust, but when resources are scarce (C is small) and the actual choice seems to be more important, yrobustness performs much better."}, {"heading": "4.2 Yahoo! data", "text": "To evaluate our method on the basis of real-world data, we formulate a budget allocation instance on the bid data of the advertiser Yahoo! Webscope [yah]. This record logs bids on 1000 different phrases through advertising accounts. We assign the phrases to channels S and customer accounts T, with a head start between s and t when a corresponding bid has been submitted. For each pair (s, t), we consistently subtract the associated transmission probability from [0, 0.4]. We tend these to zero because we expect that people will not be so easily influenced by advertising in the real world. Then, we generate an estimate and build up a latecomer by generating nst samples from Ber (pst), where nst is the number of bids between s and t in the data set. This transformation results in a two-part graph with | S | = 1000, T | = 10475 and more than the typical gap between the 50,000 people in the budget."}, {"heading": "4.3 Comparison to first-order methods", "text": "Given the success of first-order methods for non-convex problems in practice, it is natural to compare them with our method for determining the worst-case vector x. In one of our Yahoo problem cases with fixed D-standard uncertainty, we compared our sub-modular minimization scheme with Frank-Wolfe's fixed step size as in [Lacoste-Julien, 2016], implementing the linear oracle with MOSEK [MOSEK ApS, 2015]. Interestingly, Frank-Wolfe finds an optimal solution from various initializations, as confirmed by comparison with the guaranteed solution of our algorithm. Note that due to non-convexity, there are no formal guarantees that Frank-Wolfe is optimal here, which motivates the question of the global convergence properties of Frank-Wolfe in the presence of submodularity."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We deal with the problem of uncertain parameters (or faulty model specification) in Budget Allocation or Bipartite Influence Maximization [Alon et al., 2012] from a robust optimization perspective. The resulting Robust Budget Allocation is a non-convex concave saddle point problem. Although the inner optimization problem is non-convex, we show how continuous submodularity can be used to solve the problem with arbitrary accuracy problems, as verified by the suggested limits of the duality gap. In particular, our approach extends continuous submodular minimization methods [Bach, 2015] to more general limitations and introduces a mechanism for solving a new class of necessarily non-convex optimization problems. We confirm, based on synthetic and real data, that our method finds high-quality solutions that are robust to parameters that vary at will in a certain degree of uncertainty, up to and beyond 50,000 scale."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions.
