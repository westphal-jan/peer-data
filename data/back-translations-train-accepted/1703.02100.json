We prove theoretical guarantees supporting the empirical performance. Our guarantees are characterized by the (generalized) submodularity ratio $\\gamma$ and the (generalized) curvature $\\alpha$.

Bayesian A-optimality in Experimental Design", "text": "In Bayesian Experimental Design (Chaloner & Verdinelli, 1995), the goal is to select a series of experiments to perform them.

(2008, Section 8.4) Formally, it is assumed that there are n experimental stimuli {x1,.., xn}, each xi-Rd that form the data matrix X, Rd \u00b7 n.

The Determinantal Function", "text": "The determinant function of a square submatrix is used in many areas, e.g. in determinant point processes (Kulesza & Taskar, 2012) and active set selection for sparse Gaussian processes. In the second problem, monotonous, non-decreasing determinant functions appear. Suppose the covariance matrix is parameterized by a positive definitive core. In the Informative Vector Machine (Lawrence et al., 2003), the information gain of a subset of points S V 1 is 2 logF (S), whereas F (S): = det (I + \u03c3 \u2212 2\u0394S), (5), where \u03c3 is the noise variance in the Gaussian process model, the square submatrix with its two rows and columns is indexed by S. Although logF (S) is submodular, F (S) is generally not submodular. The approximation guarantee of GREEDY for maximizing the submodular of S (S) is not the supermodular one (S)."}, {"heading": "4.3. LPs with Combinatorial Constraints", "text": "Consider the following example: Suppose that V is the totality of all the products a company can manufacture. Given the budget constraints on the raw materials required, companies consider the LP maxx-P < d, x >, where d is the vector for the profits of each product and P is a polytopic that represents the continuous constraints. The above LP can be used to evaluate the profit maximization of the production schedule. Usually, the company must also consider combinatorial constraints, for example, the company has at most K production lines and therefore must select a subset of K products it must manufacture. Frequently, this type of problems can be called maxx-P, supp (x), I < d, x >, where I am the independent group of the combinatorial structure."}, {"heading": "4.4.

In order to quickly calculate the parameters and optimal solution by complete search, the first n = 14 samples were used.

In the first line of Fig. 5, the optimal LP lens (calculated using an exhaustive search) and the LP lens returned by GREEDY are displayed; the second line shows the curvature and submodularity ratio; the first column (Fig. 5a) shows the results for n = 6, m = 20, while the second column (Fig. 5b) for n = 8, m = 30. Note that the greedy submodularity ratio has values between 0.000 0.15 and 1 and that the curvature is close to the worst-case value of 1.

Determinantal Functions Maximization", "text": "We experimented with synthetic and real data: For synthetic data, we generated random covariance matrices \u03a3 \u0445Rn \u00b7 n with uniformly distributed eigenvalues in [0, 1]. We set n = 10, \u03c3 = 2. In Figure 6 (left), we plot the optimal determinant objective value and the value achieved by GREEDY. Figure 6 (right) plots the greedy submodularity ratio \u03b3G. Since the determinant objective is supermodular, the approximation guarantee corresponds to \u03b3G. We see that \u03b3G can reasonably predict the performance of GREEDY. For real data, we considered an active quantity selection task on the CIFAR 107 dataset. The first n = 12 images of the test set were used to calculate the covariance matrix with a square exponential kernel (k (xi, xj) = exkrip (\u2212 xi \u2212 xj \u00b2 / h.u)."}, {"heading": "6.

Conclusion", "text": "We analyzed the guarantees for greedy maximization of non-submodular, non-decreasing quantitative functions. By combining the (generalized) curvature \u03b1 and the submodularity ratio \u03b3 for generic quantitative functions, we demonstrated the first narrow approximate limits for these definitions for greedy maximization of non-decreasing quantitative functions. These approximate limits considerably increase the range within which GREEDY has guarantees.

Our theory can easily include Def. 4: Our approximation guarantee in Theorem 1 applies to Def. 4 as long as U is included. An advantage of the definition in this paper (Def. 1) is that it handles subtleties better in Def. 4, where the denominator is 0, - The curvature in this paper is a natural extension of the classical submodular functions for monotonous, non-decreasing ones (Conforti & Cornue \u0301 jols, 1984). - Note that classical terms of curvature measure how close a submodular set function is to modularity. The terms of (generalized) curvature in Def. 2 measure how close a set function is to supermodularity. - Our combinations of (generalized) modular curvature and REM ratio are presented as in this way (subarity ratio)."}, {"heading": "D.

We prove theoretical guarantees supporting the empirical performance. Our guarantees are characterized by a combination of the (generalized) curvature \u03b1 and the submodularity ratio \u03b3. In particular, we prove that GREEDY enjoys a tight approximation guarantee of 1 \u03b1 (1\u2212 e \u2212\u03b3\u03b1) for cardinality constrained maximization.
