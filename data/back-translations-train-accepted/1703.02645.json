Constraints determine the amount of realizable points. A convex object (a convex polytopic) can be constructed on the basis of a series of realizable points simply by taking their convex optimization problems, which cannot always be efficiently described. If possible, the linear program can be efficiently solved via this convex object, and the result is the optimal solution to the original combinatorial optimization problem.

Since each set of interventions must be a graph separator system according to theorem 1, we can work with the corresponding graph that separates the system matrices. Note that each graph separator system corresponds to a correct coloring based on 1. Thus, since every row of nodes with identical rows in M should be within the same color class, we know in each correct coloring that each color class is an independent set. Then, over all correct colorations, the color class with the maximum weight is given by the maximum weighted independent set. Since each row of M is either the all-zero vector or at least one single 1, the total cost is minimized by assigning the maximum vector to the weighted group of the most independent rows, and assigning the maximum vectors to the most independent ones below the 1."}, {"heading": "Proof of Theorem 3", "text": "/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /"}, {"heading": "Uniquely Colorable Graphs", "text": "Next, we give a special case that allows a simple solution without limiting the graph class.

We use this fact to create chord graphs on the basis of a randomly selected perfect elimination order: First, we select a random permutation to be the perfect elimination order for the chord graph.

We show that this problem is solvable in polynomial time. Later, we consider the case when the number of interventions is limited. For this case, we provide polynomial time algorithms when the skeleton is a tree or a clique tree. For a general chordal skeleton, we develop an efficient greedy algorithm, which can be improved when the causal graph skeleton is an interval graph.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
