See [32] for balanced and nearly balanced models, [15] for perfect graphs, and [30] for graphs with constant tree width. These conditions are often incorrect in practice, and a variety of general algorithms are able to solve the MAP problem for large inputs. One class is belief propagation and its variants [35, 29, 28]. Another class includes general ILP optimization methods (see e.g. [24]). Techniques that specialize in graphical models include cutting-plane methods based on cycle inequalities [26, 19, 27]. See also [16] for a comparative overview of technical methods. In [34], the authors examine how pseudomarginals and relaxations are closely related to the success of the Bethe approximation of the partition function [34]."}, {"heading": "3 Provable Integer Programming", "text": "A binary linear program is an optimization problem of the following form.max xcTxa This means: \"We have a successful condition for integrative programming based on the number of conversions we do not know.

In this case, we call qV a confusing singleton marginals. We are developing algorithm 3 to estimate the number of confusing singleton marginals for our experimental phase. It is based on the k-best enumeration method developed in [23, 21]. Algorithm 3 works with a branching argument. The root node is the original LP. A leaf node is branched by introducing a new leaf for each node in V and each element of {0, 12, 1} so that qi 6 = a in the parent node and the constraint {qi = a} is not contained in the constraints for the parent node. For i-V, we can create a new leaf for each parent node {12, 1} and each parent algorithm = 6 in the parent node = 1."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "We are looking at a synthetic experiment on randomly created graphical models, which were also used in [26, 31, 34].

Quantity determines how strong the connections between the nodes are. We do 100 pulls for each choice of edge thickness. For the complete graph, we observe that algorithm 3 does not yield points that do not correspond to the nodes, but that occur for other topologies.We first compare how the number of broken singleton margins (VC) we connect to the connection thickness.

2017, "abstractText": "Given a graphical model, one essential problem is MAP inference, that is, finding the most likely configuration of states according to the model. Although this problem is NP-hard, large instances can be solved in practice. A major open question is to explain why this is true. We give a natural condition under which we can provably perform MAP inference in polynomial time. We require that the number of fractional vertices in the LP relaxation exceeding the optimal solution is bounded by a polynomial in the problem size. This resolves an open question by Dimakis, Gohari, and Wainwright. In contrast, for general LP relaxations of integer programs, known techniques can only handle a constant number of fractional vertices whose value exceeds the optimal solution. We experimentally verify this condition and demonstrate how efficient various integer programming methods are at removing fractional solutions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
