Formally, there is a cost-sharing function defined across all segments of a set of elements (or players), and the goal is to share the cost of the entire bandwidth fairly between participants. However, cost-sharing is central to cooperative game theory, and there is a rich literature that develops the key terms and principles on the subject. While both the core and the Shapley value are easy to define, calculating them presents additional challenges when no group of players has an incentive to distract, and the Shapley value [39], which represents the unique vector of cost-sharing that fulfils four natural axioms, is to define both Shapley values easily; it establishes that calculating cost-sharing is involved in costs requires knowledge of costs in myriads of different scenarios."}, {"heading": "1.1 Our results", "text": "We build on the approach of Balcan et al.

Our main result is an algorithm that generalizes these results for all games in which the core is not empty and we derive sample complexity limits that show exactly the number of samples needed to calculate cost proportions (theorems 3 and 5).1 While the main approach of Balcan et al. [8] is based on learning the cost function first and then calculating cost proportions, we show how to proceed directly without explicitly learning a good estimate of the cost function.

The base set of size n = | N | is called the Grand Coalition, and we denote the elements with N = {1,.., n} = [n]. We assume that C (n) instead of C (i) stands for i (S) \u2265 0 for all S'N, and that maxS C (S) is limited by a polynomial in n, which is standard assumptions. We will easily misuse the notation, and C (i) for i (i) for i (N) when it is clear from the context. We remember three specific classes of functions that have submodular functions that have the property of diminutive yields: CS (i) for all S'T and N'epi."}, {"heading": "2.1 The core", "text": "The core is a balanced cost allocation where no actor has an incentive to deviate from the Grand Coalition - for each subset of actors, the sum of their shares does not cover their collective costs.Definition 1.

For example, in the battery blame scenario, such a guarantee means the following assurance: no matter what other apps run at the same time, an app will never be held responsible for more battery consumption than if it runs alone. Given that app developers are typically business competitors and that the battery of a mobile device is a very scarce resource, such a guarantee can pretty accurately avoid a large amount of blame. Unfortunately, for a certain cost function C the core may not exist (say that the core is empty), or may be multiple (there may be)."}, {"heading": "2.2 The Shapley value", "text": "The Shapley value provides an alternative cost-sharing method.

Definition 2. Consider a cooperative game with players N and cost function C.

It is easy to verify that the cost distribution is done in such a way that it lies at the core and that it is the Shapley value. To calculate these cost proportions, we estimate the expected marginal contribution of an element i to a random amount, i.e., vDi: = ES \u0445 D | i 6 \u0432 S [C (S \u0441i}) \u2212 C (S)].

A natural approach to this problem is to first learn the underlying model, C, from the data and then calculate a cost allocation for the function learned. As shown in [8], this approach works if C is approximately learnable, but there are functions that are not PAC learnable and for which a cost allocation that roughly satisfies the core can still be calculated. The main result of this section shows that a cost allocation that calculates the core property for each function with a non-empty core can be calculated. Furthermore, we show that the number of samples from D is needed to learn the core accurately. 2A limited product distribution has marginal probabilities that lie below and above 1 / poly (n) and 1 \u2212 1 / poly (n)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Cost shares in the probably stable core are efficiently computable", "text": "Balcan et al. [8] has shown that several function classes D have a core that is probably stable. These families include network flow, threshold task, and induced subgraph games, which are all known classes of cooperative games; and the class of monotonous simple games that take values in {0, 1}. We generalize their result so that it is not limited to specific function classes, and show how to create a likely stable core for each game with a non-empty core. Technically, we use the VC dimension of the class of half spaces to show that the performance on the samples is good at distribution D. We check the definition of VCdimension in Appendix C and only the state of the VC dimension class that is needed for our purposes. We first give the generalization error for a class of functions with VC dimension d.Theorem 1 ([37], Theorem 6.8)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Logarithmic sample complexity for probably approximately stable cores", "text": "We show that the complexity dependence of the sample on n can be improved from the linear to the logarithmic function \"x.\" However, this improvement comes with costs. We now find a probably stable core instead of a probably stable core, and the sample complexity depends on the distribution of function C, defined as maxS C (S) minS 6 = \u2205 S (S). This approach assumes that minS 6 = x x x x (S). We start with a cost allocation that satisfies the core property of all samples. However, we limit this search to cost allocations with a limited 1 standard. Such a cost allocation can be found efficiently, as the space of such cost allocations is constant. Analysis begins by limiting the \"1 standard of any vector in the core (Lemma 2). Combined with the assumption that the core is not empty, this implies a cost allocation that we fulfill the previous conditions.x."}, {"heading": "3.3 The approximately stable core is not computable", "text": "Since we have probably obtained a roughly stable core, a natural question is whether it is possible to calculate cost allocations that are approximately stable over natural distributions. In general, the answer is negative: even for the limited class of monotonous submodular functions, which always have a solution in the core, the core of samples cannot be approximately calculated, even via the uniform distribution.Theorem 6. Cost proportions in the (1 / 2 +) nearly stable core, i.e. such that for all S, (12 +) \u00b7 [i] samples i \u2264 C (S), cannot be calculated for monotonous submodular functions via the uniform distribution, for each constant > 0, Proof. The base set of elements is divided into \u2212 1 sets A1,.. A \u2212 1 of size n for a small constant > 0.

Since the properties (axioms) of the Shapley value are above elements and not propositions, there is no simple approximation of the Shapley value where the properties are \"likely\" above D as we had them for the core. However, since the Shapley value exists for all functions and is unique, natural relaxation is only an approximation of this value from the samples. We begin with the observation that there is a distribution that Shapley value can be estimated arbitrarily well from samples. However, in this work we are motivated by applications where the algorithms do not control the distribution over the samples, but where the distributions are drawn from a \"natural\" distribution. Therefore, in this section we look at the even distribution and generally product distributions examined in the learning literature for combinatorial functions."}, {"heading": "4.1 Submodular functions with bounded curvature", "text": "We consider submodular functions with limited curvature, a general assumption in the submodular maximization literature [27, 28, 40, 43]. We show that the Shapley value of these functions is roughly derivable from samples for which we derive a narrow limit. Intuitively, the curvature of a submodular function depends on how much the limit value of an element can decrease. This property is useful because the Shapley value of an element can be written as a weighted sum of its limit value contributions across all sectors. Definition 7. A monotonous submodular function C has a curvature [0, 1] if the CN\\ {i} (i) is greater than the sum of its limit value contributions. This curvature is limited if it is used by all i."}, {"heading": "4.2 Learnability does not imply approximability of the Shapley value", "text": "Although the Shapley value for the class of submodular functions with limited curvature is approximate, we show that the Shapley value of the coverage (and submodular) functions is not nearly derivable from the samples in general. Impossibility results are information theoretical and are not based on computational limitations. Coverage functions are an interesting class of functions because they are derived from samples of any distribution [3] according to the PMAC learning model [5], which is a generalization of PAC learning ability for real-world evaluated functions. In addition, coverage functions according to Theorem 1 have a Shapley value that can be efficiently approximated in the value quotation model."}, {"heading": "5 Data Dependent Shapley Value", "text": "The general impossibility of calculating the Shapley value from random samples stems from the fact that the concept is geared to the query model, in which algorithms can be asked for the cost of any amount of S'N.

We start by specifying the four axioms that resemble the Shapley value. The data dependent axioms for cost distribution functions are: \u2022 Our proposed value is the unique solution that meets it."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion and Future Work", "text": "Our results are divided into two categories: We provide results to approximate the Shapley value and the core area, and propose new cost-sharing concepts tailored to the statistical framework. We use techniques from several areas that include statistical machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and, of course, cost sharing. Since the cost-sharing literature is very rich, there is a significant number of future directions. One of the obvious possibilities is to study other methods of cost-sharing within this statistical framework, considering other classes of functions to approximate known methods, and improving the sample complexity of previous algorithms. Conceptually, there is an exciting modeling question when designing \"desirable\" axioms from data. Traditionally, these axioms have depended only on cost function, while in this model they may depend on both cost function and distribution, creating an interesting interplay."}, {"heading": "A Concentration Bounds", "text": "Let X1,..., Xn be independent indicator random variables with values in {0, 1}.

games in situations where the cost function C is not available via oracle queries, but must instead be derived from data, represented as tuples (S,C(S)), for different subsets S of players. We formalize this approach, which we call STATISTICAL COST SHARING, and consider the computation of the core and the Shapley value, when the tuples are drawn from some distribution D. Previous work by Balcan et al. [8] in this setting showed how to compute cost shares that satisfy the core property with high probability for limited classes of functions. We expand on their work and give an algorithm that computes such cost shares for any function with a non-empty core. We complement these results by proving an inapproximability lower bound for a weaker relaxation. We then turn our attention to the Shapley value. We first show that when cost functions come from the family of submodular functions with bounded curvature, \u03ba, the Shapley value can be approximated from samples up to a \u221a 1\u2212 \u03ba factor, and that the bound is tight. We then define statistical analogues of the Shapley axioms, and derive a notion of statistical Shapley value.
