The spread of fake news and mitigation events within the network is modeled by a multivariate Hawkes process with additional exogenous control terms. By choosing a feature representation of states, defining mitigation actions and constructing reward functions to measure the effectiveness of mitigation activities, we map the problem of fake news mitigation into the reinforcement learning framework. We develop a policy iteration method unique to the multivariate networked point process, with the goal of optimizing the actions for maximal total reward under budget constraints. Our method shows promising performance in real-time intervention experiments on a Twitter network to mitigate a surrogate fake news campaign, and outperforms alternatives on synthetic datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 19:09:12 GMT  (674kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07823v1", "Point Process, Hawkes Process, Social Networks, Intervention and Control, Reinforcement Learning"], ["v2", "Mon, 19 Jun 2017 20:59:29 GMT  (1349kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07823v2", "Point Process, Hawkes Process, Social Networks, Intervention and Control, Reinforcement Learning, ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Point Process, Hawkes Process, Social Networks, Intervention and Control, Reinforcement Learning", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["mehrdad farajtabar", "jiachen yang", "xiaojing ye", "huan xu", "rakshit trivedi", "elias b khalil", "shuang li", "le song", "hongyuan zha"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.07823"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.07823.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Fake News Mitigation via Point Process Based Intervention ", "authors": ["Mehrdad Farajtabar", "Jiachen Yang", "Xiaojing Ye", "Huan Xu", "Rakshit Trivedi", "Elias Khalil", "Shuang Li", "Le Song", "Hongyuan Zha"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

The mean and standard deviation of second-order empirical statistics averaging over 100 simulations has been compared with the theoretical mean. This experiment helps to verify whether it can be used in simulations to evaluate the merits of our proposed algorithm and over baselines. Figure 2 shows the second-order correlation profile of 4 random user pairs simulated 100 times. We see that the empirical mean almost coincides with the theoretical mean. Furthermore, it is interesting to see that the standard deviation increases over time due to the aggregation of more random elements over time.

We compare the empirical average and the standard deviation of the total reward with the baseline state assumed in our experiment. First, Figure 3 shows the results for correlation maximization and difference minimization. In both cases, the estimated w leads to a better estimate of the total reward by increasing the number of samples (used in LSTD). First, the figure shows that we can achieve reasonable accuracy with an appropriate number of samples.

Discussion", "text": "The use of point-process-based interventions involves a compromise: on the one hand, the stochastic nature of multivariate point processes allows to model the uncertainty of events in real networks; however, by adopting this stochastic model, the intervention policy can only determine the optimal conditional intensity and not the exact best times of fake news mitigation events, which can be improved in future experiments by selecting shorter time intervals for phases of the mitigation campaign. An assumption made in the real experiment is that all events of the user u will be seen by user v when v follows u, meaning that fake news events will be seen by u of v. While it is true for Twitter that all tweets from u appear on the home timeline of v following u (Twitter, 2016), it is not necessarily true that a follower v will see these tweets (assuming they do not have vvaccess to Twitter on that day), therefore, that they can estimate the probability of future performance and accuracy of certain experiments during the follow."}, {"heading": "A.

By choosing a feature representation of states, defining mitigation actions and constructing reward functions to measure the effectiveness of mitigation activities, we map the problem of fake news mitigation into the reinforcement learning framework. We develop a policy iteration method unique to the multivariate networked point process, with the goal of optimizing the actions for maximal total reward under budget constraints. Our method shows promising performance in real-time intervention experiments on a Twitter network to mitigate a surrogate fake news campaign, and outperforms alternatives on synthetic datasets.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
