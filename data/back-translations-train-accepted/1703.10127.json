Frequently, p can be considered a distribution via an alphabet \u03a3, and the goal is to determine from samples from p whether it corresponds to any model distribution q or not. This type of test is the lifeblood of the scientific method and has received enormous studies in statistics since its inception, with the focus, of course, on minimizing the number of observations from the unknown distribution that are necessary to determine with confidence whether p = q or p = q.However, in several areas of research and application, sensitive information about individuals may be contained; consider, for example, persons taking part in some clinical trials on a disease that carries a social stigma. It may therefore be crucial to guarantee that the operation of the samples needed to test a statistical hypothesis contains sensitive information about the samples does not align with the objective of the hypothesis, as the latter is about taking samples from the population, rather than the integrity of the sample being taken."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "For a distribution p = \u03b2\u03b22, we will use the notation pi to mark the mass p places on the symbol i.Definition 1.

More generally, we show that if an algorithm requires a dataset of size m for a decision problem, it (\u03b5, 0) -differential private can be made at a multiplicative price of 1 / \u03b5 in the sample size. This is a folkloristic result, but we consider and prove it here for completeness. Theorem 2. Assume that there is an algorithm for a decision problem P that is successful with a probability of at least 1 \u2212 \u03b2 and requires a dataset of size m. Then there is a (\u03b5, 0) -differential private algorithm for P that is successful with a probability of at least 45 (1 \u2212 \u03b2) + 1 / 10 and requires a dataset of size O (m / \u03b5)."}, {"heading": "4 Roadblocks to Differentially Private Testing", "text": "In this section, we describe roadblocks that prevent two natural approaches to differentiated private testing from working. In Section 4.1, we show that if you simply add Laplace noise to the empirical numbers of a dataset (i.e., perform the Laplace mechanism of Theorem 1) and then try to perform an optimal identity tester, the variance of the statistics dramatically increases and thus leads to much greater sample complexity, even in the case of uniformity testing. The intuition behind this phenomenon is this: If we perform uniformity testing in a small sample regime (if the number of samples m is the square root of the domain size n), we will see one (1 \u2212 o (1) n element 0 times, O (n) elements 1 times and O (1) elements 2 times. If we add Laplace (10) noise to guarantee (0.1, 0) differential privacy of the domain size n), we will see one (1 \u2212 o (1) n element 0 times, O (n) elements 1 times and O (1) elements 2 times. If we add uniformity checks in a small sample regime (if the number of samples m is the square root of the domain size n), we will see one (1 \u2212 o) element 0 times, O (n) element 0 times, O (n) element 0 times, O (n) elements 1), and O (1) elements 2 times."}, {"heading": "4.1 A Laplaced \u03c72-statistic has large variance", "text": "Proposition 2: Applying the Laplace mechanism to a data set before applying the identity test of [ADK15] results in a significant increase in variance, even if we consider the case of uniformity.

As shown in Section 5, it is a natural approach to reduce this statistic to the range [0, 1], to interpret it as probability, and to output the result of Bernoulli (Z) - if p = q, the result will probably be 0, and if dTV (p, q) \u2265 \u03b1, the result will probably be 1. One might hope that this statistic is of course private. Specifically, we would like the statistic Z to have a low sensitivity and not change much if we take out an individual person.
