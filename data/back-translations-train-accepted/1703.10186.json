Experiments show that this combined pragmatic model interprets color descriptions more accurately than the classifiers from which it is built. We observe that pragmatic reasoning helps primarily in the hardest cases: when the model must distinguish very similar colors, or when few utterances adequately express the target color. Our findings make use of a newly-collected corpus of human utterances in color reference games, which exhibit a variety of pragmatic behaviors. We also show that the embedded speaker model reproduces many of these pragmatic behaviors.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Mar 2017 18:15:06 GMT  (213kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10186v1", "12 pages, 3 tables, 5 figures.

Unlike traditional natural language processing tasks, in which participants make unbiased judgments about language in isolation, reference games were embedded in a goal-oriented communicative context (Clark, 1996; Tanenhaus and Brown-Schmidt, 2008). Because they offer the simplest experimental setup in which many pragmatic and discursive phenomena occur, these games have been widely used in cognitive science to study topics such as commonality and conventionalization (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), reference domains (Brown-Schmidt and Tanenhaus, 2008), perspective (Hanna et al., 2003), and over-informaticality (Koolen et al al al al al al, 2011).In order to obtain a corpus of natural color reference data in different contexts, we recruit our agents from Amazon's unique 967 contexts."}, {"heading": "3 Behavioral results", "text": "Our corpus was not only designed to facilitate the development of models of grounded language; to measure perceptible differences, we used the most recent CIEDE standard calibrated to human vision (Sharma et al., 2005); all distances had to be greater than a lower limit of = 5 to ensure perceptible differences; and we used a threshold of \u03b8 = 20 to create conditions.2 Specifically, we set a length criterion at 4\u03c3 of the mean number of words per message (in our case, about 14 words), excluding 627 expressions, often including meta-commentary on the game and not color terms. Derstanding, but also a richer picture of human pragmatic communication. Thus, the collection effort was structured like a large-scale behavioral experiment closely aligned with experimental designs such as those of Clarks and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986), paving the way for judging our model, which is based not only on the actual listener's classification but also on the accuracy of the actual results."}, {"heading": "3.1 Listener behavior", "text": "Since color reference is a difficult task even for humans, we compared the accuracy of the handset under different conditions to calibrate our expectations of the performance of the model.

RSA's starting point is a model of a literal listener: l0 (t, u, t) is a semantic interpretation function that takes the value 1 if there is a color in the setC context, u is a message drawn from a series of possible expressions. (Figure 2a shows the values of L defined for a very simple context in which U = {blue, teal, dull}, and C = {xx, xx}; Figure 2b shows the corresponding literal listener l0 if the previous P is flat over colors. (In our scalable extension, we will replace a neural network model for l0, circumnavigating, and erend L)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Base listener", "text": "Our base list agent L0 (Figure 3a) is an LSTM encoder model that predicts a Gaussian distribution over colors in a transformed representation space. Input words are embedded in a 100-dimensional vector space. Word embedding is initialized into randomly distributed vectors (\u00b5 = 0, \u03c3 = 0.01) and trained. The sequence of word vectors is used as input into a 100-dimensional hidden state LSTM, and a linear transformation is applied to the output representation to generate the parameters \u00b5 and \u03a3 of a square formular4score (f) = \u2212 (f \u2212 \u00b5) T\u03a3 (f \u2212 \u00b5), where f is a vector representation of a color. Each color is represented in its simplest form as a three-dimensional vector in RGB space. These RGB vectors are then measured in relation to the f representation as in Monroe et al. (2016)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Base speaker", "text": "The loudspeaker model consists of an LSTM context encoder and an LSTM description decoder (Figure 3b). In this model, the colors of the ci-C context are transformed into a more fourier display space, and the sequence of color representations is passed on by an LSTM context encoder with a 100-dimensional hidden state. Context is reordered to put the target color in last place, minimizing the length of dependence between the main input color and the output (Sutskever et al., 2014). The final cell state of this recursive network is replaced by the first input color and output (Sutskever et al., 2014)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Pragmatic agents", "text": "Using the above base agents, we define a pragmatic speaker S1 and a pragmatic listener L2: S1 (u | t, C; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p; p"}, {"heading": "4.4 Training", "text": "We divide our corpus into roughly equal tensile / dev / test sets (15,665 tensile attempts, 15,670 dev, 15,659 tests), ensuring that tests from the same dyad are present in only one split.

We use ADELTA (Zeiler, 2012) and Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014), adaptive variants of stochastic gradient lineage (SGD), to leave handling of the interactive dialogues of the stems to future work.

The results of this analysis will be presented alongside the human results in Table 2. Our pragmatic speaker model S1 did not differ qualitatively in any of the key indicators from our base speaker S0, so we will only summarize the results for humans and the pragmatic model. Words and signs We found human speakers more linguistic when the colors were closer together, both in the number of words and in the number of characters. As shown in Table 2, our S1 agent shows the same increase in the expression length in the splits (t = 18.07) and narrow (t = 35.77) contexts. Comparisons and superlatives people used more comparison and superlatives when the colors were closer together; however, comparison factors were preferred in the split contexts, superlatives in the narrow contexts. Our pragmatic speaker shows the first of these two patterns."}, {"heading": "5.2 Listener accuracy", "text": "Table 3 shows the accuracy and perplexity of the base listener L0, the pragmatic listener L1 and L2, and the mixed models La, Lb, and Le in resolving the human-written color references. Accuracy differences are significant for all pairs except L2 / Lb and La / Le. As we expected, the speaker-based model L1 alone performs worst of all models. However, mixing with L0 not only impairs the performance of L0, but results in a significant improvement over the two original models, in line with our expectation that the handset and speaker-based models have complementary strengths. We observe that L2 significantly exceeds its own base model L0, showing that pragmatic thinking alone contributes positively to this. Mixing the pragmatic models with the base listener also improves the quality of both models individually, though not significantly in the case of Lb over L2."}, {"heading": "6 Model analysis", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own, without being able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "7 Related work", "text": "Golland et al. (2010) develop a pragmatic loudspeaker model, S (L0), which provides reasons for loglinear listeners trained on human expressions with spatial references in virtual world environments. Tellex et al. (2014) apply a similar technique called inverse semantics to create a robot that can informatively ask humans for help in completing tasks. Meo et al. (2014) evaluate an end-to-end color-description generation model (McMahan and Stone, 2015) using color reference data from Baumgaertner et al. (2012) by creating an L (S0) listener. Monroe and Potts (2015) implement an end-to-end trained S (L (S0) model for listeners who reference expression generation in a reference game task. Many of these models require a list of possible Neapolitan arguments for any context that we consider unfeasible if such a game (S0) is."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we present a newly collected corpus of color descriptions from reference games, and we show that a pragmatic means of argument that includes neural listener and speaker models interprets color descriptions better in context than the listener alone. Separating reference and expression representation in our base speaker and listener models basically allows for simple substitution of speakers other than colors (for example, images), although the performance of listener agents could be limited by the representation of enunciation semantics as Gaussian distribution in the speaker presentation space. Our pragmatic actors also rely on the ability to list the number of possible speakers. To avoid this enumeration, as would be necessary for tasks with insoluble large reference spaces, it is a challenging theoretical problem for RSA-like models. Another important next step is pursuing a multi-turn dialogue."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Kai Sheng Tai and Ashwin Paranjape for their helpful feedback.

We observe that pragmatic reasoning helps primarily in the hardest cases: when the model must distinguish very similar colors, or when few utterances adequately express the target color.
