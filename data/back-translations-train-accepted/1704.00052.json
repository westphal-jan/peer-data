We use labeled data from a high-resource language to increase performance on a low-resource language. In experiments on 21 language pairs from four different language families, we obtain up to 58% higher accuracy than without transfer and show that even zero-shot and one-shot learning are possible.

Transfer learning is a solution to this problem: it uses annotations in a highly resource-intensive language to build a system for a resource-poor language. In this paper, we present a method for the linguistic transfer of inflectional language using an encoder-decoder-recurrent-neural network (RNN), enabling the development of tools for computational languages with limited annotational data."}, {"heading": "2 Inflectional Morphology and Paradigm Completion", "text": "Many languages have an inflection morphology, i.e. the form of a single lexical entry mutates into characteristics such as person, number, or case. The citation form of a lexical entry is called the lemma, and the collection of its possible inflections is called its paradigm. Tab. 1 shows an example of a partial paradigm; we show several forms for the Spanish verbal lemma son-ar. We can index the entries of a paradigm by a morphological keyword, e.g. the 2SgPresInd form suen-as in Tab. 1. 1. In the generation, the speaker must select an entry of the paradigm based on the context of the form. Generally, the presence of a rich inflection morphology is problematic for NLP systems, since it significantly increases the token-type ratio and thus the word form sparse. An important task in inflection morphology is the paradigmatic addition (Durrett and Deo Nerual, 2013; Ahlberg; 2014)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Transferring Inflectional Morphology", "text": "Compared to other NLP annotations, such as \"part-of-speech\" (POS) and designated entities, morphological inflection does not lend itself so easily to transmission. 1The joint task of SIGMORPHON 2016 (Cotterell et al., 2016a) on morphological inflection, a harder generalization of paradigm completion, showed that in many languages with neural sequence-to-sequence models an accuracy of \u2265 98% can be achieved, improving the state of the art by 10%. We can define a universal set of POS tags (Petrov et al., 2012) or entity types (e.g. coarse-grained types such as person and place or fine-grained types (Yaghoobzadeh and Protects, 2015), but the insertion is much more language-specific. It is impracticable to translate morphological knowledge from man-to-grained languages, since portuguese does not appear to be translated into Chinese transthrophologically."}, {"heading": "2.2 Formalization of the Task", "text": "We now offer a formal treatment of the task of cross-lingual paradigm completion and develop our notation.

We consider two tasks, namely the training of a paradigm builder (i) for a language with high resources and (ii) for a language with low resources. We want to train together to take advantage of related languages. Thus, we define the log probability asL (v) = 0 (k, w't), linking parameters for the two languages to enable the transfer of morphological knowledge between languages. (fk [w't], tk) + 0 (k, w's)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Encoder-Decoder RNN", "text": "We parameterise the distribution pulse as an encoder decoder gated RNN with attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015), the state-of-the-art solution for the monolingual case (Can and protects, 2016b). A bidirectional gated RNN encodes the input sequence (Cho et al., 2014) - the concatenation of (i) the languagetag, (ii) the morphological tag of the form to be generated and (iii) the character of the entered word - represented by embedding. The input to the decoder consists of concatenations of \u2212 \u2192 hi and \u2190 \u2212 hi, the forward and backward hidden states of the encoder. The decoder, a unidirectional RNN, uses attention: it calculates a weight for each hi decoding. Each weight reflects the meaning given to this input position."}, {"heading": "3.2 Input Format", "text": "In the same way, each source tag is represented as a sequence of subtags, and each subtag is represented as embedding. Formally, we define Pr eprin twe as the set of characters in the languages in L, where L is the set of languages in the given experiment. Next, we define S as the set of subtags that occur as part of the set of morphological tags T = \"LT\"; for example, if 1SgPresInd, then 1, Sg, Pres, Ind, S. Note that the set of subtags S is defined as attributes from the UNIMORPH scheme (Sylak-Glassman, 2016) and is therefore universal across all languages; the schema is derived from research in linguistic typology."}, {"heading": "4 Languages and Language Families", "text": "In order to verify the applicability of our method to a wide range of languages, we are conducting experiments on sample languages from several different families. Romance languages, a subfamily of Indo-European, are widely spoken, for example, in Europe and Latin America. Seeds derived from the common ancestor Vulgar Latin (Harris and Vincent, 2003) share large portions of their lexicon and inflationary morphology; we expect knowledge among them to be easily transferable. We are experimenting with Catalan, French, Italian, Portuguese, Portuguese and Portuguese terms. Tab. 2 shows that Spanish - which assumes the role of the resource-poor language in our experiments - is closely related to the other four related languages, with Portuguese being the most closely related to the other four - whereby Portuguese is closely related to the other languages."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "We conduct three experiments with 21 different language pairs to demonstrate the feasibility of the morphological transfer and analyze our method.

(iii) How closely related do the two languages have to be to achieve good results? Data based on complete term tables from unimorph.org (Kirov et al., 2016), we create datasets as follows: Each training set consists of 12,000 samples in the highly resource-articulated source language and not in the languages {50, 200} samples in the target language. We create target anguage dev and test kits in the sizes 1600 and 10,000, respectively. 3 For romance and Arabic, we create learning curves for nt (100, 400, 1600, 12000)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Exp. 2: Zero-Shot/One-Shot Transfer", "text": "In section 5.1 we examined the relationship between indomain (target) training set size and performance. Here we consider the extreme case of training set size 1 (one-shot) and 0 (zero-shot) for a day. We train our model on a single sample for half of the tags that appear in the language with low resources, i.e. if T \"is the set of morphological tags for the target language, the train set size is | T\" | / 2. As before, we add 12,000 source samples. We report one-shot accuracy (or zero-shot accuracy), i.e. the accuracy for samples with a tag that has been seen once (or never) during the training. Note that the model is composed of the individual subtags every day.6Data. Our experimental setup is similar to section 5.1: we use the same dev, test and high-resource train sets as before."}, {"heading": "5.3 Exp. 3: True Transfer vs. Other Effects", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own if they do not feel able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "In recent years, we have performed many tasks in the field of automatic speech recognition (Huang et al., 2013), parsing (Cohen et al., 2011; S\u00f8gaard et al., 2011; Naseem et al., 2012), entity recog-preprin tnition (Wang and Manning, 2014b), and machine translation (Johnson et al., 2016; Ha et al., 2016). A simple method is to translate datasets and then build a monolingual model (Fortuna and Shawe-Taylor, 2005; Olsson et al., 2005). Also, aligned corpora have been used to project information from annotations in one language to another (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Pado and Lapata, 2005). The disadvantage is that machine translation errors cause errors in the target language. Therefore, alternative methods have been suggested, e.g., to port a model trained to the target language (Shi et al., 2010)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "Our experiments showed that information from a resource-intensive language can be used for paradigm completion in a related language with limited resources. Our analysis showed that the degree to which the source language data is helpful for a specific target language depends on its kinship. Our method resulted in significant improvements in environments with limited training data - up to an absolute 58% improvement in accuracy - enabling the use of state-of-the-art paradigm completion models in languages with limited resources."}], "references": [{"title": "The Uralic Languages", "author": ["Daniel Abondolo."], "venue": "Routledge.", "citeRegEx": "Abondolo.,?
