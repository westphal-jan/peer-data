TUPASparse performs significantly better than both where DAGParser does not predict remote edges in the out-of-domain environment. TurboParser performs worse in this comparison, despite slightly better results at the remote edges. The LSTM parser from Dyer et al. (2015) achieves the highest primary value among baseline parsers, with considerable marginality. With an upstream NN and the embedding of functions, TUPAMLP achieves higher values than TUPASparse, but is surpassed by the LSTM parser from Dyer et al. (2015)."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "While previous work on the syntax-semantic interface has been used as the basis for semantic analysis by definition, the work focuses on the semantic role designation of verbal argumentation structures, the focus has lately shifted to the analysis of more complex representations that take into account a wider range of phenomena. [12] We have also experimented with a simpler version of TUPA without REMOTE transitions, which requires an increase of up to 2 marked F-score points to primary edges, at the expense of the inability to predict distant effects. [12] Semantic representation corresponds directly with the words and phrases of the text. (Evening and Rappoport, 2017).Grammar-based parsing. Linguistically expressive grammars such as HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994), CCG (Steedman, 2000) and TAG (Joshi and Schabes, 1997) provide a theory of syntax-semantic interface and have been used as the basis for analyses."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We introduce TUPA, the first parser for UCCA. Analyzed in domain and extra-domain settings, we show that when combined with an NN classifier and a BiLSTM feature extractor, it accurately predicts UCCA graphs from text, significantly outperforming a variety of strong baselines. Despite the recent variety of semantic analyses, the effectiveness of different approaches to structurally and semantically different schemes is not well understood (Kuhlmann and Oepen, 2016). Our contribution to this literature is a general parser that explores multiple parents, discontinuous units and non-terminal nodes. Future work will evaluate TUPA in a multilingual environment and evaluate the linguistic applicability of UCCA. We will also apply the TUPA transition scheme to various objectives, including AMR and SDP, exploring the limitations of its universality. In addition, we will evaluate different conversion methods (UCCA et al, 2015), we believe that a different framework for different types of application is possible."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the HUJI Cyber Security Research Center in collaboration with the Israel National Cyber Bureau in the Prime Minister's Office and the Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Computational Intelligence (ICRI-CI).

All feature templates define binary features. The other classifiers use the same elements listed in the feature templates, but all categorical features are replaced by vector embedding, and all count-based features are replaced by their numerical value. For some of the features, we used the term header, defined by the h \u0445 function (see Appendix D). Although headwords are not explicitly represented in the UCCA scheme, these features prove useful for encoding word-to-word relationships."}, {"heading": "B Extended Presentation of UCCA", "text": "This paper does not address two important constructions at the UCCA founding level: linkage, which represents discourse relationships, and implicit, which represents hidden entities. Table 3 shows the statistics of nodes and edges and implicit nodes in corpora.Linkage. Figure 7 shows a linkage relationship, which is omitted in Figure 1a. Linkage relationship is represented by the gray node. LA is linkage argument and LR is linkage relationship. The relationship represents the fact that the linkage \"after\" links the two parallel scenes, which are arguments of linkage. Linkage relationships are another source of multiple parents for a node, which we do not yet handle when distributing and evaluating. Implicit entities may contain UCCA diagrams without these coinciding in the text. Figure 8 shows the annexation for a tree is almost impossible to apply to another phrase similar to cotton."}, {"heading": "C Hyperparameter Values", "text": "Table 4 lists the hyperparameter values that we have found for the different classifiers by tuning to the development set.

To our knowledge, the conjunction of these formal properties is not supported by any existing parser.
