For popularizing knowledge bases (KBs), the results are usually presented in subject predicate objects (SPO) triples, such as: Baracki, Malia >, or sometimes n-ary tuples such as < MichaelPhelps, hasaris."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Some approaches, such as YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007) or DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007), focus on structured parts of Wikipedia, while others, such as OLLIE (Mausam et al., 2012), ClauseIE (Del Corro and Gemulla, 2013) or NELL (Mitchell et al., 2015), focus on unstructured content across the Web. In the latter, the scheme is usually not predefined either, hence such approaches are called Open IE. Most government systems today rely on either remote supervision (Craven et al., 1999; Mintz et al., 2009). Despite all efforts, KBs are immensely incomplete, such as the average number of children per person in Wikidata (Vrandec prior) or Cardinality."}, {"heading": "3 Relation Cardinalities", "text": "Definition We define a reference that expresses relation cardinalities in the following way: \"A cardinal number that indicates the number of objects that relate to a particular topic.\" Using this definition, we analyzed how often relation cardinals occur in Wikipedia. Using the Part-of-Speech (PoS) tag from Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014), we extracted numbers - i.e. words labeled as CD (cardinal number) - from 10,000 random Wikipedia articles. According to Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014), the distribution of their name cardinals (NE tags) is in Table 1. While time-related numbers are the most common, about 40% are classified only as non-specific NUMBER. By manually checking 100 random NUMBERs, we determined that 47 are relationship cardinalities, 1 i.e., about 18.86% of all numbers are in Wikipedia relational cardinalities."}, {"heading": "4 Relation Cardinality Extraction", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight."}, {"heading": "5 Analysis", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to survive ourselves if we do not put ourselves in a position to survive ourselves, and are able to survive ourselves, \"he told the German Press Agency in an interview with\" Welt am Sonntag \":\" I don't think we will be able to change the world. \""}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We believe that relationship cardinalities can be useful in a variety of tasks. Our next goal is to make remote monitoring incomplete-resilient and engage with compositivity in the hope that it can improve the precision of our approach. We also aim to take ordinalities into account and experiment with linguistic transformation in the cases of cardinalities 0 and 1, in the hope that they can boost memory. A limitation of our work is also to focus only on Wikipedia articles, assuming that all statements concern the topic of the article, and simply take the statement with the utmost confidence. In future work, we aim to include a larger article base in combination with called entity recognition, correlation resolution, and a step of truth consolidation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Werner Nutt and Sebastian Rudolph for their feedback on an earlier version of this work and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.
