While citations have been previously used in generating scientific summaries, they lack the related context from the referenced article and therefore do not accurately reflect the article's content. Our method overcomes the problem of inconsistency between the citation summary and the article's content by providing context for each citation. We also leverage the inherent scientific article's discourse for producing better summaries. We show that our proposed method effectively improves over existing summarization approaches (greater than 30% improvement over the best performing baseline) in terms of \\textsc{Rouge} scores on TAC2014 scientific summarization dataset. While the dataset we use for evaluation is in the biomedical domain, most of our approaches are general and therefore adaptable to other domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 16:17:58 GMT  (2066kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06619v1", "EMNLP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["arman cohan", "nazli goharian"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.06619"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.06619.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Scientific Article Summarization Using Citation-Context and Article\u2019s Discourse Structure", "authors": ["Arman Cohan", "Nazli Goharian"], "emails": ["arman@ir.cs.georgetown.edu", "nazli@ir.cs.georgetown.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to go in search of a solution that will enable them to find a solution."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "In these approaches, the content / thematic distribution in the final summary is an estimated problem.

We assume that the citation text (the text within the quoting article that refers to another article) is already known in each quoting article. We describe each step in the following subsections. Our proposed procedure generates a summary of an article with the premise that the article contains a number of citations. We refer to the article to as a \"reference article.\" We point out that we have summarized the text of the article into sentences by using the dot algorithm to detect unattended sentence boundaries (Kiss and Strunk, 2006)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Extracting the citation-context", "text": "As described in Section 2, one problem with existing quotation-based summaries is that they lack the context of the reference paper. Therefore, our goal is to use citationcontext in the reference article to accurately reflect the reference paper. To find citation contexts, we consider each quote as an n-gram vector and use vector space model to localize the relevant text spans in the reference article. Specifically, we give the ranking of text spans r1, r2,... that have the highest similarity to c. We call the retrieved text spans reference spans. These reference spans essentially form the context for each citation. The similarity function is the cosinal similarity between the rotated normalized vectors. We have evaluated four different approaches to the formation of the citation vector."}, {"heading": "3.2 Grouping the citation-contexts", "text": "In fact, it is so that it is a way in which one sees oneself in a position to trump oneself. \"(mti)\" It is not as if it is a reactionary act. \"(mti)\" It is an unpredictable process. \"(mti)\" It is an unpredictable process. \"(mti)\" It is very important that we are able to position ourselves in public. \"(mti)\" It is very important that we are able to put ourselves in a position. \"(mti)\" It is very important that we are able to put ourselves in a position. \"(mti)\" It is very important that we are able to put ourselves in a position. \"(mti)\" It is very important that we are able to hide ourselves. \"(mti)"}, {"heading": "3.3 Ranking model", "text": "To identify the most representative sentences of each group, we need a measure of the meaning of sentences.

There are various ways to measure the centrality of nodes, such as the degree of nodes, the difference, the proximity and eigenvectors.

That is, we first select the uppermost sentence from all groups, and if the threshold is not reached, we select the second sentence, etc. \u2022 Innovative: In the discourse-based method, the following order is used for selecting sentences from groups: \"Hypothesis,\" \"Method,\" \"Results,\" \"Implication,\" and \"Discussion.\" In the community recognition method, no predetermined order is specified. \u2022 Innovative: We use a greedy strategy similar to the MMR (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998); in the sentences from each group, the sentences from the following evaluation formula are selected: Summary, S (S) (S) (S) (S) (S) (S) = Equity, S (S) (S) (S) (S) (S) = Equity, S (S), S (S), S (S) (S) (S) (S), S (S), S (S), S (S), S (S), S (S), S (S), S (S), S (S), S (S), S (S), S (S), S (S (S), S (S), S (S), S (S (S), S (S), S (S (S), S (S), S (S), S (S (S), S (S), S (S (S), S (S), S (S (S), S (S (S), S (S), S (), S (), S (S (S), S (S (S), S (), S (), S (), S (), S (), S (), S (), S (), S (), S (), S (), S (S (), S (), S (), S ("}, {"heading": "4 Experimental setup", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data", "text": "The TAC2014 benchmark contains 20 topics, each of which consists of a reference article and several articles containing quotes from each reference article (the statistics of the data set are shown in Table 1), all of which are biomedical papers published by Elsevier.

Using the citation text to extract the context is almost as effective as other methods. Keyword approaches that use the terms with high idf values to localize the context achieve slightly higher rouge L precision with minimal memory. This is expected because keyword approaches only select informative terms to extract citation contexts, resulting in commands that may not themselves be keywords but help to create meaning. Noun phrases have the highest average F score, suggesting the fact that noun phrases are good indicators of important concepts in scientific text."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We proposed a pipeline approach to the summary of scientific articles that takes advantage of the discourse model inherent in the article and the citation contexts derived from Reference Article1. Our approach focuses on the problem of the lack of context in existing quote-based summaries.

That is, we improved in all cases via baselines; in some cases, we achieved an improvement of more than 30% in mean ROUGE values over the most powerful baseline.

Our method overcomes the problem of inconsistency between the citation summary and the article\u2019s content by providing context for each citation. We also leverage the inherent scientific article\u2019s discourse for producing better summaries. We show that our proposed method effectively improves over existing summarization approaches (greater than 30% improvement over the best performing baseline) in terms of ROUGE scores on TAC2014 scientific summarization dataset. While the dataset we use for evaluation is in the biomedical domain, most of our approaches are general and therefore adaptable to other domains.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
