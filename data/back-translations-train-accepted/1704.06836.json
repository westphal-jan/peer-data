In other words, \"Sarcasm is the giant chasm between what I say, and the person who doesn't get it.\". In this paper we present the novel task of sarcasm interpretation, defined as the generation of a non-sarcastic utterance conveying the same message as the original sarcastic one. We introduce a novel dataset of 3000 sarcastic tweets, each interpreted by five human judges. Addressing the task as monolingual machine translation (MT), we experiment with MT algorithms and evaluation measures. We then present SIGN: an MT based sarcasm interpretation algorithm that targets sentiment words, a defining element of textual sarcasm. We show that while the scores of n-gram based automatic measures are similar for all interpretation models, SIGN's interpretations are scored higher by humans for adequacy and sentiment polarity. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions for our new task.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 22 Apr 2017 18:59:25 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06836v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lotem peled", "roi reichart"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.06836"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.06836.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Sarcasm SIGN: Interpreting Sarcasm with Sentiment Based Monolingual Machine Translation", "authors": [], "emails": ["splotem@campus.technion.ac.il,", "roiri@ie.technion.ac.il"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Sarcasm is a sophisticated form of communication in which speakers convey their message in an indirect way.

This data, as well as the instructions for our human judges, will be made publicly available and hopefully will provide a basis for future work on sarcasm on Twitter. Despite the focus of the current work on the Twitter domain, we consider our task to be more general and hope that our discussions, observations and algorithms will also be beneficial in other areas. Using the Twitter API3, we have collected tweets marked with the # Sarcasm content tag posted between Januray and June 2016. Following Sarcasmus et al. (2010), Gonza \ufffd lez-Iba \ufffd nez et al. (2011) and Bamman and Smith (2015), we address the problem of noisy tweets with automatic filtering: we remove all tweets that were not written in English, disclaimer retweets that were forwarded or shared."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation Measures", "text": "As mentioned above, world knowledge is mandatory in certain cases in order to correctly evaluate sarcasm interpretations. For example, in the case of the second sarcastic tweet in Table 1, we need to know that 2: 30 is considered a late hour, so, despite the lexical difference, it would be considered equivalent to staying up until 2: 30 a.m. and getting up late. Furthermore, we note that converting a sarcastic utterance into a non-sarcastic one often has to change a small number of words. For example, a single phrase in the sarcastic tweet \"How I love Mondays\" leads to the non-sarcastic utterance \"How I hate Mondays.This is not typical of MT, where the entire source set is usually translated into a new sentence in the target language and we would expect the lexical similarity between the machine-generated translation and the human reference to which it is compared.

This, together with its low adequacy values (5.74 and 5.43, respectively) and its very low adequacy values, make this model immature for our task and data sets, so we exclude it from the tables of this section and do not discuss it further.

However, when it comes to a human assessment (Table 6), SIGN context represents significant progress."}, {"heading": "8 Discussion and Future Work", "text": "\"The performance gap between Moses and Sign may be due to the difference in their optimization criteria.\" We aim to optimize the BLEU score and, given the general lexical similarity between the original tweets and their interpretations, it therefore tends to keep tweets correct. SIGN, on the other hand, targets sentiment words and changes them frequently. Consequently, we do not observe significant differences between the algorithms in the automatic metrics, which are largely based on ngram differences between the source and the interpretation. Similarly, the human fluctuation measure requires that accounts for the legibility of the interpretation are not seriously affected by the translation process. When it comes to human appropriateness and sensation, which explains the understanding of the meaning of the tweet, SIGN reveals its power and demonstrates a much better performance compared to Moses. To understand the relationship between the automatic and human-based metrics, we calculate Pearson correlations for each pair of measurements (human)."}], "references": [{"title": "Contextualized sarcasm detection on twitter", "author": ["David Bamman", "Noah A Smith."], "venue": "Ninth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media. http://dblp.unitrier.de/rec/bib/conf/icwsm/BammanS15.", "citeRegEx": "Bamman and Smith.,? 2015", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bamman and Smith.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Paraphrasing with bilingual parallel corpora", "author": ["Colin Bannard", "Chris Callison-Burch."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics.

In this paper we present the novel task of sarcasm interpretation, defined as the generation of a non-sarcastic utterance conveying the same message as the original sarcastic one. We introduce a novel dataset of 3000 sarcastic tweets, each interpreted by five human judges. Addressing the task as monolingual machine translation (MT), we experiment with MT algorithms and evaluation measures. We then present SIGN: an MT based sarcasm interpretation algorithm that targets sentiment words, a defining element of textual sarcasm. We show that while the scores of n-gram based automatic measures are similar for all interpretation models, SIGN\u2019s interpretations are scored higher by humans for adequacy and sentiment polarity. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions for our new task.1", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
