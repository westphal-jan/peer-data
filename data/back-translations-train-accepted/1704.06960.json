We stress that the results in this section concern the theoretical properties of idealised games and are presented intuitively."}, {"heading": "7 Evaluation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7.1 Tasks", "text": "In the rest of the work, we evaluate the empirical behavior of our translation approach. Our evaluation takes into account two types of tasks: reference games and navigation games. In a reference game (e.g. Figure 6a), both players observe a pair of speakers. A speaker is assigned a speaker; he must communicate this goal to a listener who then performs a selection action corresponding to his belief in the true goal. In this thesis, we consider two variants of the reference game: a simple task for color naming and a more complex task with natural images of birds. For examples of human communication strategies for these tasks, we obtain the XKCD color dataset (McMahan and Stone, 2015; Monroe et al., 2016) and the Caltech Birds dataset (Welinder et al., 2010) with accom-panying Natural Language descriptions (Reed et al., 2016)."}, {"heading": "7.2 Metrics", "text": "A mechanism for understanding the behavior of a learned model should enable a human being to interpret his beliefs correctly and interact successfully with him. We use the available training data to develop simulated models of human decisions; by first showing that these models handle human judgments well, we can be sure that their use in evaluation correlates with human understanding."}, {"heading": "8 Results", "text": "In all the following cases, \"R\" indicates a DCP agent, \"H\" a real human being and \"H *\" a human model player. Reference games The results of the two reference games are shown in Table 1. In both cases, the consistently trained model achieves near-perfect accuracy, while a model that communicates in natural language achieves slightly lower performance. Regardless of whether the speaker is a DCP and the listener is a model person or vice versa, the translation achieves the best performance based on the belief matching criterion Section 5; in fact, the listener achieves a slightly higher score when translating neuralesian color names into natural language than natively. This suggests that the automated agent has discovered a more effective strategy than the one shown in the data sets, and that the effectiveness of this strategy is preserved through translation. Sample translations from the reference games are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 7.Driving Game Behavior roughly in the assessment of games, the reward is shown to be significantly higher than in Table 3."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "After introducing a translation criterion based on the listener's concurring beliefs about speaker states, we presented both theoretical and empirical evidence that this criterion surpasses a conventional machine translation approach in restoring the content of message vectors and facilitates collaboration between humans and scholars.While our assessment focused on understanding the behavior of deep communication policies, the framework proposed in this paper could be applied much more broadly. Any encoder decoder model (Sutskever et al., 2014) can be seen as a kind of communication game between the encoder and the decoder, so that we can analogously imagine calculating and translating \"beliefs\" generated by coding in order to explain what features of the input are transmitted. The current work focuses on learning a purely categorical model of the translation process, supported by an unstructured inventory of the translator's potential to erect the translator's structure."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "YES is supported by a Facebook Graduate Fellowship and a Berkeley AI / Huawei Fellowship.

Here we propose to interpret agents\u2019 messages by translating them. Unlike in typical machine translation problems, we have no parallel data to learn from. Instead we develop a translation model based on the insight that agent messages and natural language strings mean the same thing if they induce the same belief about the world in a listener. We present theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence that our approach preserves both the semantics and pragmatics of messages by ensuring that players communicating through a translation layer do not suffer a substantial loss in reward relative to players with a common language.1", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
