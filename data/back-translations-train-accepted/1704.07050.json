Therefore, we abstract some of the specifics of like-minded detection and present our algorithm more generally in this section, hoping that in the future it can be used for other applications in addition to detecting like-minded people. None of our abstractions detract from our understanding of the applicability of our method to detecting like-minded people and the fact that the method can in no way detract from the benefit we show it has in improving like-minded people. A common attitude is where you get a lot of X = {x1, x2,... xn} and a lot of Y = {y1, y2, yn} where the task is to extract (x, y) pairs that are related."}, {"heading": "2.1 Reverse Rank", "text": "We know that if (xi, yj) \u0433R, then (xk, yj) / \u0394R stands for k 6 = i if R is 1-to-1. We define the inverse rank (xi, yj) = | {xk, yj \u2265 sxi, yj} |. Intuitively, a high inverse rank means that there are many other elements of X that fit better to yj than xi; this could be proof that (xi, yj) does not belong to R and should have a lower score. If there are very few or no other elements of X that fit better to yj than xi, this could be proof that (xi, yj) belongs to R and should have a higher score. In accordance with this intuition, we use the inverse rank as the basis for recalculating our values as follows: scoreRR (xi, yj) = sxi, yjreverse rank (xi, yj) (2)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Forward Rank", "text": "Analogous to the inverse rank, we can apply another basis for correcting the scores, namely the forward rank. We define the forward rank (xi, yj) = | {yk \u0445 Y | sxi, yk \u2265 sxi, yj} |. Afterwards, we scale the scores analogously to how we do with inverted ranks via an inverse linear function.2"}, {"heading": "2.3 Combining Reverse Rank and Forward Rank", "text": "In order to combine the reverse rank and the forward rank, we present the results of experiments in two ways: The first is a one-step approach: scoreRR FR 1step (xi, yj) = sxi, yjproduct, (3) where product = reverse rank (xi, yj) \u00b7 forward rank (xi, yj). (4) The second combination method involves first calculating the reverse rank and adjusting each score based on the reverse rank. Subsequently, in a second step, the new scores are used to calculate the forward ranks, and then these values are adjusted based on the forward ranks. We call this method RR FR 2step."}, {"heading": "2.4 Maximum Assignment", "text": "Assuming that all the elements in X and Y are present, and that their partner element is present in the other group without any additional elements, and that the quantities are not too large, it is interesting to calculate what would optimize the \"maximum allocation\" with the Hungarian algorithm: max Z, X, Y, X, Y, Z-Score (x, y) s.t. (xi, yj).Z \u00b2 (xk, yj).Z \u00b2 (xi, yj).Z \u00b2 (xi, yk).Z \u00b2 (xi, yk).Z \u00b2 (k 6 = j. (5) 2Both for the reverse rank and for the front rank, we also experimented with exponential decay and step functions, but found that a simple division by ranks works just as well or better than any of these more complicated methods. We do this using data sets where the assumptions are correct and see how close our methods of the Hungarian maximum allocation at similar points of the accuracy sets and the Hungarian data curves are not complete for either the Hungarian ones, or for the larger data curves."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "Our goal is to test whether the use of the global structural algorithms we have described in Section 2 can significantly increase performance for cognate detection. To test this hypothesis, our first step is to implement a system that uses the latest research results to generate the initial score matrices, as a current state-of-the-art system would currently do for this task. To this end, we implemented a basic state-of-the-art system that uses the information sources that have proven helpful for this task, such as phonetic information, word context information, temporal context information, word frequency information, and word burstiness information (Kondrak, 2001; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013).

From these corpus we calculate linguistic context similarity values according to the method of Rapp (Rapp, 1995, 1999). The intuition behind this method is that cognates are more likely to occur in correlated context windows and this statistic from large amounts of data captures this correlation."}, {"heading": "3.3 Frequency Information", "text": "The intuition is that large amounts of data should have similar relative frequencies.

To do this, we calculate a measurement based on the Normalized Processing Distance (NED)."}, {"heading": "3.7 Combining Information Sources", "text": "We combine the information sources by using a linear support vector machine to learn the weights for each of the information sources from a small group of like-minded people. Thus, our end result assigned to a candidate pair (x, y) is: Score (x, y) = \u2211 m equations wmscorem (x, y), (6) where metrics are the set of metrics such as phonetic similarity measurements, word burstiness similarity, relative frequency similarity, etc., explained in sub-sections 3.2 to 3.6; wm is the learned weight for metric m; and Score (x, y) is the value assigned to the pair (x, y) by metric m.The values thus assigned represent state of the art in filling the matrix identified in Equation 1.

Previous work has produced a matrix of scores for all word pairs based on various helpful information sources such as phonetics, word context information, temporal context information, word frequency information, and word burstiness information. However, when mapping a score to a word pair, the current state of the art does not take into account scores associated with other word pairs. We proposed a matrix correction method that would produce current state-of-the-art methods by taking into account the scores of other word pairs. The methods presented in this paper complement existing state-of-the-art methods that are easy to implement, compress efficiently, and practically effective in improving performance by large amounts. Experimental results show that the new methods significantly improve the state of the art by conducting cognate recognition experiments that are performed on freely available and publicly available data pairs with different language pairings, including different cognate sizes."}], "references": [{"title": "Cognate production using character-based machine translation", "author": ["Lisa Beinborn", "Torsten Zesch", "Iryna Gurevych."], "venue": "Proceedings of the Sixth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing.
