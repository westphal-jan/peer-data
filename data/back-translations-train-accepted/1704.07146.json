Translators have always tried to be invisible; ideal translations should look as if they were written originally in the target language. We show that traces of the source language remain in the translation product to the extent that it is possible to uncover the history of the source language by looking only at the translation. Specifically, we automatically reconstruct phylogenetic language trees from monolingual texts (translated from several source languages). The signal of the source language is so powerful that it is retained even after two phases of translation. This strongly indicates that source language interference is the most dominant characteristic of translated texts, overshadowing the more subtle signals of universal properties of translation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 11:14:20 GMT  (91kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07146v1", "ACL2017, 11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL2017, 11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ella rabinovich", "noam ordan", "shuly wintner"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07146"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.07146.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Found in Translation: Reconstructing Phylogenetic Language Trees from Translations", "authors": ["Ella RabinovichM", "Noam Ordan", "Shuly Wintner"], "emails": ["ellarabi@gmail.com,", "noam.ordan@gmail.com,", "shuly@cs.haifa.ac.il"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, the translators are able to establish a standard in which the translation is obvious, and in which the product should look as if it was originally written in the target language.

Europarl is one of the most popular parallel resources in processing natural language and has been widely used in machine translation. We use a version of Europarl that covers the years 1999 to 2011 and in which the direction of translation was determined by a comprehensive cross-lingual validation of the original language of the speakers (Rabinovich et al., 2015). All parliamentary speeches have been translated from the original language into all other EU languages (21 at the time), with English being used as the intermediate, pivot language. We therefore refer to translations into English as the direct language, while translations into all other languages, via English as the third language, are indirect."}, {"heading": "3.2 Features", "text": "Following common practice (Volansky et al., 2015; Rabinovich and Wintner, 2015), we represented both original and translated texts as feature vectors, with the selection of features determining the extent to which we expect the source language to be disrupted in the translation product. Crucially, the features abstract from the content of the texts and focus on their structure, reflecting, among other things, morphological and syntactical patterns. We use the following feature sets: 1. The 1000 most common POS trigrams reflecting a flat syntactic structure; 2. Functional words (FW), words known to reflect the grammar of texts in numerous classification tasks, as they include non-substantive words such as articles, prepositions, etc. (Koppel and Ordan, 2011).3. Cohesive markers (Hinkel, 2001); these words and phrases are translated into text, where one explicitly translates the original, where, for example, two explicit quotes are made on the first note."}, {"heading": "3.3 The Indo-European phylogenetic tree", "text": "While the existence of the language family of Indo-Europeans (IE) is an established fact, its history and origin are still the subject of much controversy (Pereltsvaig and Lewis, 2015). Furthermore, the actual subgroups of languages within this family are not clearly defined (Ringe et al., 2002). Consequently, algorithms attempting to reconstruct the IE language tree face a serious evaluation challenge (Ringe et al., 2002; Rexova \u0301 et al., 2003; Nakhleh et al., 2005a). To evaluate the quality of the reconstructed trees, we define a metric to accurately assess their distance from the \"true\" tree. The tree we use as a down-to-earth truth (Serva and Petroni et al., 2003) has3For French, we have used the list of FW available at http: / / code.goo.com / archive / p / glestop-words / http / universal."}, {"heading": "3.4 Evaluation methodology", "text": "To evaluate the quality of the trees we produce, we calculate their similarity to the gold standard using two metrics: unweighted, where only structural (topological) similarity is evaluated and weighted, with similarities both on the structure and on the branching length.Several methods have been proposed to evaluate the quality of trees in the family tree language (Pompei et al., 2011; Wichmann and Grant, 2012; Nouri and Yangarber, 2016).One popular measurement is the Robinson-Foulds (RF) method (Robinson and Foulds, 1981), which is based on the symmetrical difference in the number of bifurcations, the way in which an edge can split the leaves of a tree into two sets. The distance between two trees is then defined as the number of splits induced by one of the trees but not by the other."}, {"heading": "4 Detection of Translations and their Source Language", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Identification of translation", "text": "First, we reaffirmed that originals and translations are easily separable and extended the results of the supervised classification of O against T (where O refers to English original texts and T to translated English texts) (Baroni and Bernardini, 2006; van Halteren, 2008; Volansky et al., 2015) to the 16 original languages taken into account in this paper. We also conducted similar experiments with French originals and translations. We used 200 chunks of about 2 tokens (taking into account the sentence boundaries) from O and T and normalized the values of lexical characteristics based on the number of tokens in each chunk. To classify, we used Platt's minimal sequential optimization algorithm (Keerthi et al., 2001; Hall et al., 2009) to support vector machine classification using the standard linear core. We evaluated the results with 10-fold cross-validation. Table 1 establishes the classification accuracy of classification of work against each winemic feature (85%)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Identification of source language", "text": "Identifying the source language of translated texts is a task where machines are clearly superior to humans (Baroni and Bernardini, 2006). Koppel and Ordan (2011) performed a 5-way classification of texts translated from Italian, French, Spanish, German and Finnish, achieving an accuracy of 92.7%. In addition, misclassified instances were more commonly assigned to genetically related languages. We expanded this experiment to 14 languages representing three language families (the number of languages was limited by the amount of data available). We extracted 100 characters of 1000 characters each from each source language and classified the translated English (and separately French) texts with the best-performing POStrigrams. Cross-validation evaluation yielded an accuracy of 75.61% to English translations (note that the baseline of 100 / 14% is limited to the other languages)."}, {"heading": "5 Reconstruction of Phylogenetic Language Trees", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Reconstructing language typology", "text": "Inspired by the results mentioned in Section 4.2, we created phylogenetic language trees from English and French texts translated from the other European languages. We assumed that source-language interference was present in the translation product to an extent that would facilitate the construction of a tree sufficiently similar to the GoldIE tree (Figure 1). The best trees closest to the gold standard were generated using POS trigrams: these are the features most closely associated with source-language interference (see Section 3.2). Figure 3 shows the trees that were generated from English and French translations using POStrigrams. Both trees reasonably group individual languages into three language families. Specifically, they group the Germanic and Romance languages closer together than the Baltic languages. Capturing the more subtle intrafamilial ties proved to be more challenging, though English reasonably regrouped its French counterpart in this task of proportionality, we rebalanced the two distinct cluster characteristics almost perfectly."}, {"heading": "5.2 Evaluation results", "text": "The unweighted evaluation results are listed in Table 2. For comparison, we also present the distance achieved for a random tree, generated by scanning a random distance matrix from the uniform (0, 1) distribution. The reported random tree evaluation value is averaged over 1000 experiments. Likewise, we present weighted evaluation results in Table 3. All distances are normalized to a zero-one scale, in which the boundaries - zero and one - represent the identical and the farthest away tree. Results show several interesting observations. Firstly, POS trigrams induce the distance between two nodes."}, {"heading": "6 Analysis", "text": "We have shown that source language traces are dominant in translation products to an extent that facilitates the reconstruction of the history of the source languages. We are now examining some of these phenomena more closely in order to better understand the outstanding characteristics of interference. For each phenomenon, we have calculated the frequency of patterns reflected in texts translated from each language into English and averaged the metrics for each language family (Germanic, Romance and Balto-Slavic)."}, {"heading": "6.1 Definite articles", "text": "As in other Germanic languages, there are definite (\"a\") and indefinite (\"the\") articles in English. However, many languages only have definite articles and some only have indefinite articles. Romance languages, especially the five Romance languages in our data set, have definite articles that can sometimes be omitted, but not as frequently as in English. Balto-Slavic languages typically do not have articles. Likewise, we expect that translations from Balto-Slavic languages \"the\" strain, which can lead to errors in non-native speakers (Han et al., 2006). Thus, we have calculated the frequency of \"the\" in English translations from each of the three language families."}, {"heading": "6.2 Possessive constructions", "text": "Languages also differ in the way they characterize possession. English characterizes possession in three ways: with the clitic \"s\" (\"the guest's room\"), with a prepositional phrase containing \"of\" (\"the guest's room\"), and, as in other Germanic languages, with nouns (\"the guest's room\"). Connections are much rarer in Romance languages (Swan and Smith, 2001); Balto-Slavic indicates possession by means of case markings. Languages also differ in whether possession is marked with the head or not. In Balto-Slavic languages, the genius case is marked with the head, reversing the order of the two nouns in terms of the construction of common English \"s.\" Since copying sequences of words is, if possible, one of the most important features of interference (Eetemadi and Toutanova, 2014), we expect Balto-Slavic languages to exhibit the highest rates of nonsensitivity."}, {"heading": "6.3 Verb-particle constructions", "text": "Verb-particle constructions (e.g. \"turn down\") consist of verbs that combine with a particle to create a new meaning (Dehe \u0301 et al., 2002). Such constructions are much more common in Germanic languages (Iacobini and Masini, 2005), so we expect them to be more common in English translations. We have calculated the frequency of these constructions in the data; the results show a marked overuse of verb-particle constructions in translations from Germanic and an underuse of such constructions in translations from Balto Slavic."}, {"heading": "6.4 Tense and aspect", "text": "Like other Germanic languages, English uses a complete system of aspective distinctions expressed in perfect and progressive forms (with the auxiliary verbs \"have\" or \"be\"). In contrast, Balto-Slavic does not have such a system, and the distinction is characterized lexically by two types of verbs. Romance languages are intermediate, with both lexical and grammatical differences. We have calculated the frequency of perfect forms (defined as auxiliary \"have\" followed by the score form of the past) and progressive forms (defined as auxiliary \"be\" plus a score form of the present). In fact, Germanic significantly exaggerates the perfect aspect; the use of the progressive aspect also varies between language families and shows the lowest frequency in translations from Balto-Slavic."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "Translations can be considered distortions of the original text, but this distortion is far from accidental; it shows a very clear picture that reflects the typology of the language to the extent that it disregards the sources as a whole, a phylogenetic tree can be reconstructed from a monolingual corpus consisting of several translations, the product of highly professional translators who adhere to a common standard, and whose products are edited by native speakers like themselves, even after two phases of translation. We are currently trying to extend these results to translations in another area (literary texts), in a completely different language (Hebrew)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank the three anonymous ACL reviewers for their constructive feedback, Sergiu Nisioi and Oren Weimann for their advice and helpful suggestions, and Yonatan Belinkov and Michael Katz for their insightful and valuable comments."}], "references": [{"title": "Identifying translationese at the word and sub-word level", "author": ["Ehud Alexander Avner", "Noam Ordan", "Shuly Wintner."], "venue": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities 31(1):30\u201354. http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqu047.", "citeRegEx": "Avner et al\\.,? 2016", "shortCiteRegEx": "Avner et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Corpus linguistics and translation studies: Implications and applications", "author": ["Mona Baker."], "venue": "Mona Baker, Gill Francis, and Elena Tognini-Bonelli, editors, Text and technology: in honour of John Sinclair, John Benjamins, Amsterdam, pages 233\u2013252.", "citeRegEx": "Baker.,? 1993", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baker.", "year": 1993}, {"title": "Reconstructing native language typology from foreign language usage", "author": ["Yevgeni Berzak", "Roi Reichart", "Boris Katz."], "venue": "Proceedings of the Eighteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning. pages", "citeRegEx": "Berzak et al\\.,? 2014", "shortCiteRegEx": "Berzak et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Shifts of cohesion and coherence in translation", "author": ["Shoshana Blum-Kulka."], "venue": "Juliane House and Shoshana Blum-Kulka, editors, Interlingual and intercultural communication Discourse and cognition in translation and second language acquisition stud-", "citeRegEx": "Blum.Kulka.,? 1986", "shortCiteRegEx": "Blum.Kulka.", "year": 1986}, {"title": "Universals of lexical simplification", "author": ["Shoshana Blum-Kulka", "Eddie A.

Translators have always tried to be invisible; ideal translations should look as if they were written originally in the target language. We show that traces of the source language remain in the translation product to the extent that it is possible to uncover the history of the source language by looking only at the translation. Specifically, we automatically reconstruct phylogenetic language trees from monolingual texts (translated from several source languages). The signal of the source language is so powerful that it is retained even after two phases of translation. This strongly indicates that source language interference is the most dominant characteristic of translated texts, overshadowing the more subtle signals of universal properties of translation.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
