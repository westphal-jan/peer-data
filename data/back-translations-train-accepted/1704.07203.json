This simple observation has not changed substantially since the early work on Aristotle's argumentation more than two thousand years ago, although argumentation scholars provide us with a wealth of often contradictory theories and models (van Eemeren et al., 2014). Despite the lack of a precise definition in contemporary argumentation theory, Toulmin's influential work on argumentation introduced a claim in the 1950s that deserves our attention (Toulmin, 2003, p. 11); current work describes a claim that is debatable and that we are trying to support with arguments \"(Govier, 2010). Argument mining, a computational counterpart of manual argumentation analysis, is a receptive sub-field of the NLP (Peldszus and Stede, 2013a)."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "rE \"s tis, so rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc"}, {"heading": "3 Claim Identification in Computational Argumentation", "text": "We briefly describe six English data sets used in our empirical studies; they all capture \"assertions\" at the discourse level.

Lexical features are truncated unique items. Syntax features take into account grammatical information at the sentence level. We include information about the part-of-speech and parse tree for each sentence. Discourse features encode information extracted using the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) style end-to-end discourse parser presented by Lin et al. (2014). Embedding features represent each sentence as a summary of its word embeddings (Guo et al., 2014). We also experimented with sentiment features (Habernal and Gurevych, 2015; Anand et al., 2011) and dictionary features (Misra et al., 2015; Rosenthal et McKeown, 2015), but these very poor results are not reported in this article."}, {"heading": "4.2 Deep Learning Approaches", "text": "We consider three deep learning approaches as alternatives to our function-based systems: the first is the Convolutional Neural Net of Kim (Kim, 2014), which has proven to be excellent in many different classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and question classification, and is still a strong competitor among neural techniques that focus on sentence classification (Komninos and Manandhar, 2016; Zhang et al., 2016b, c); we consider two variants of Kim's CNN, one in which word vectors are initialized with pre-trained GoogleNews word embeddings (CNN-w2vec); and one in which vectors are randomly initialized and updated during training (CNN-rand); our second model is a LSTM (long short-term memory) neural network for sentence classification (LSTM); and our third model is a bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM test) in which all neural net classifiers are used as hidden sentence classifiers for STM hyper-parameter hyper-term classification (STM)."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "In the following, we summarize the results of the various learners described above. To obtain all the results, an extensive calculation was required, e.g. the cross-validation experiments for label-based systems took 56 days of computing time. On purpose, the results of previous work on these data sets are not listed; the results are not comparable because we work strictly at the sentence level (not at the sentence level) and scan the training data downwards. All reported significance tests were performed using the two-step Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (Japkowicz and Shah, 2014)."}, {"heading": "5.1 In-Domain Experiments", "text": "Students \"performance varies widely across all datasets, with macro F1 scores ranging from 60% (WTP) to 80% (MT), averaging 67% (see Table 2). In all datasets, our best systems perform significantly better than both baselines. The most helpful are lexical, embedding, and syntax functions, while structural features have not helped in most cases. Discourse functions only contribute significantly to MT. Looking at the performance of the feature-based approaches, the most startling finding is the importance of lexical (in our setup unigrammable) information. The average performance of LR syntax and CNN margin is virtually identical, both for Macro-6described as FscoreM in (Sokolova and Lapalme, 2009).F1 and Claim-F1, with a slight advantage for the feature-based approach, but their difference is not statistically significant (\u2264 05)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Cross-Domain Experiments", "text": "Table 3 lists the results of the best feature-based (LR All Features) and deep learning (CNN-rand) systems, as well as individual feature groups (averages across all domains), but we find the greatest performance declines in the datasets that performed best in the in-domain setting (MT and PE). However, for the lowest scoring datasets, OC and WTP, the differences are only marginal if they are trained on a suitable dataset (VG or OC). However, the best feature-based approach outperforms the best deep-learning approach in most scenarios. In contrast to the in-domain experiments, the difference in claim-F1 measurement between the feature-based approaches and the deep-learning approaches is noteworthy. In the feature-based approaches, on average, a combination of all features is the best results (MSR Resources), which both Macro-F1 and Claim-F1 achieve the best results in the single-job area."}, {"heading": "6 Cross-Domain Claim Identification", "text": "To better understand what factors affect the cross-domain performance of the systems we tested, we considered the following variables as potential determinants of the outcome: source-target similarities, the source domain itself, training data size, and the ratio of claims to non-claims. We calculated the Spearman correlation of the top 500 dimmats between the datasets in each direction, see the results in Table 4. Most of the similarity factors are OC (source data) and WTP (target t) originating from the same authors. OC (s) and WD (t), as well as OC (s) and VG (t) are also highly correlated. For a statistical test of potential correlations between cross-domain performance and the variables introduced, we regress cross-domain results (Table 3) to Table 4 (T4 in the following equation), to the number of claims # C (directly related to the size of our training data and the ratio of claims)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In a rigorous empirical evaluation of different machine learning systems, we compared how six sets of data model claims as a basic component of an argument, and the differing performance of the systems tested in domains reflects different notions of claims, which are also observed in a qualitative study of claims in domains. Our results show that the best cross-domain system is not necessarily the best system in environments where the test domain is unknown. In particular, we found that two fairly loud sets of data (OC and VG) were the best candidates as source domains in the cross-domain setup, which seems to be due to some important lexical indicators (such as the word \"should\") that are easier to learn in these domains. In summary, our analysis shows that the essence of a claim is not much more than a few lexical indicators (such as the word \"should\") that hide themselves more easily in these domains."}, {"heading": "Supplementary Material", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Experimental Setup: Detailed Description of Hand-Crafted Features", "text": "Structural features: Structural features often capture the position, length and punctuation of a sentence. Firstly, we define two binary features that indicate whether the current sentence is the first or last sentence in the paragraph in which it is contained. These features are motivated by the results of Rod and Gurevych (2016), which found that structural properties of argumentation components are effective in distinguishing the argumentative function of argument components. Furthermore, Peldszus and Stede (2016) found that 43% of the claims appear in the first sentence. Secondly, we add the number of tokens of the sentence to our argumentation components, which have proved to be indicative of the identification of argumentatively relevant sentences (Biran and Rambow, 2011a; Moens et al, 2007).

It typically includes the identification of argumentative components, e.g. claims, as the central component of an argument. We perform a qualitative analysis across six different datasets and show that these appear to conceptualize claims quite differently. To learn about the consequences of such different conceptualizations of claim for practical applications, we carried out extensive experiments using state-of-the-art featurerich and deep learning systems, to identify claims in a cross-domain fashion. While the divergent perception of claims in different datasets is indeed harmful to crossdomain classification, we show that there are shared properties on the lexical level as well as system configurations that can help to overcome these gaps.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
