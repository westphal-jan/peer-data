We present a novel methodology for studying this question: analysis of eye-movement patterns in second language reading of free-form text. Using this methodology, we demonstrate for the first time that the native language of English learners can be predicted from their gaze fixations when reading English. We provide analysis of classifier uncertainty and learned features, which indicates that differences in English reading are likely to be rooted in linguistic divergences across native languages. The presented framework complements production studies and offers new ground for advancing research on multilingualism.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 18:04:17 GMT  (158kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07398v1", "ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Tue, 2 May 2017 21:40:35 GMT  (157kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07398v2", "ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yevgeni berzak", "chie nakamura", "suzanne flynn", "boris katz"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07398"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.07398.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Predicting Native Language from Gaze", "authors": ["Yevgeni Berzak", "Chie Nakamura", "Suzanne Flynn", "Boris Katz"], "emails": ["berzak@mit.edu", "chienak@mit.edu", "sflynn@mit.edu", "boris@mit.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will be able to drown the aforementioned lcihsrcnlrVo in order to drown them and drown them."}, {"heading": "2 Experimental Setup", "text": "The participants were recruited from 182 adult participants, of whom 37 were native speakers and 145 were students from four native languages: Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish.

The strongest result of these characteristics is the combination of unigrams and trigrams in our database.

In contrast to our work, such studies typically use controlled, rather than freely formulated sentences. Investigation of global metrics in the form of second language reading was recently published by Cop et al. (2015). This study compares ESL and native reading of a novel by native Dutch speakers, observing longer sentence reading times, more fixations and shorter saccades in ESL reading. Unlike this study, our work focuses on comparing reading patterns between different native languages. We also analyze a related but different metric, namely speed, standardized fixation time of word sequences."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Outlook", "text": "We show for the first time that this signal can be used to determine a reader's native language. In particular, the effectiveness of linguistic criteria for fixation clusters and our subsequent analysis suggest that the ESL reading process is influenced by linguistic factors. In particular, we show that linguistic similarities between native languages are reflected in similarities in ESL reading. We also identify several key features that characterize reading in different native languages and discuss their possible link to structural and lexical characteristics of native tongue. The presented results show that augmenting data can be helpful for the development of predictive and explanatory models of second language reading. While this work focuses on NLIR from fixations, our general framework can be used for additional aspects of reading, such as the analysis of saccades and eye trajectories."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Amelia Smith, Emily Weng, Run Chen and Lila Jansen for their contributions to stimulus preparation and data collection.

We provide analysis of classifier uncertainty and learned features, which indicates that differences in English reading are likely to be rooted in linguistic divergences across native languages.
