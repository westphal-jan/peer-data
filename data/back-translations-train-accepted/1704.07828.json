Because ideas are naturally embedded in texts, we propose the first framework to systematically characterize the relations between ideas based on their occurrence in a corpus of documents, independent of how these ideas are represented. Combining two statistics --- cooccurrence within documents and prevalence correlation over time --- our approach reveals a number of different ways in which ideas can cooperate and compete. For instance, two ideas can closely track each other's prevalence over time, and yet rarely cooccur, almost like a \"cold war\" scenario. We observe that pairwise cooccurrence and prevalence correlation exhibit different distributions. We further demonstrate that our approach is able to uncover intriguing relations between ideas through in-depth case studies on news articles and research papers.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 18:00:01 GMT  (1005kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07828v1", "11 pages, 9 figures, to appear in Proceedings of ACL 2017, code and data available atthis https URL"], ["v2", "Sun, 16 Jul 2017 16:34:49 GMT  (1005kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07828v2", "11 pages, 9 figures, to appear in Proceedings of ACL 2017, code and data available atthis https URL(fixed a typo)"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 9 figures, to appear in Proceedings of ACL 2017, code and data available atthis https URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL physics.soc-ph", "authors": ["chenhao tan", "dallas card", "noah a smith"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07828"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.07828.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Friendships, Rivalries, and Trysts: Characterizing Relations between Ideas in Texts", "authors": ["Chenhao Tan", "Dallas Card", "Noah A.

Coincidence shows the extent to which two ideas tend to occur in the same contexts; 2. Similarity between the relative prevalence of ideas over time shows how two ideas relate to each other in terms of popularity or obfuscation. Our input is a collection of documents, each of which is represented by a set of ideas and indexed by time. We refer to a static set of ideas like myself and a text corpus consisting of these ideas as C = {D1,..., DT}, where Dt = {dt1,., dtNt} indicates the collection of documents at a time, and each document, dtk, is presented as a subset of ideas in I. Here T is the total number of time pauses, and Nt is the number of documents at a time at which Mig t determines the number of documents at a time."}, {"heading": "2.2 Datasets and Representation of Ideas", "text": "We have two types of data sets for validation: the ones mentioned and the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned, the ones mentioned."}, {"heading": "3 Characterizing the Space of Relations", "text": "To give an overview of the four relationship types in Fig. 1, we first examine the empirical distributions of the two interesting statistics across idea pairs. However, in most explorative studies, we are most interested in pairs that illustrate each type of relationship, i.e. at the most extreme points in each quadrant. We therefore look at these pairs in each corpus to observe how the four types differ in their emphasis across datasets."}, {"heading": "3.1 Empirical Distribution Properties", "text": "To the best of our knowledge and belief, the distributions of paired coexistence and prevalence correlation have not been studied in the literature to date. We therefore first examine the marginal distributions of coexistence and prevalence correlation, and our framework is to analyze the relationships between ideas, so this choice is not essential in this work. Figure 3 shows three examples: two from news articles and one from research papers. We also focus our case studies on these three corpora in \u00a7 4. The corresponding plots for keywords have been reduced to supplementary material due to space constraints. Koccurrence tends to be unimodal but not normal. In all of our datasets, pairwise Cooccurrence (P-MI) represents an unimodal distribution that somehow resembles a normal distribution, but it is rarely exactly normal. We cannot reject the hypothesis that it is unimodal for any datasets (using topics or keywords)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Relative Strength of Extreme Pairs", "text": "We are interested in how our framework can identify fascinating relationships between ideas. These potentially interesting pairs are likely to correspond to the extreme points in each quadrant rather than those around the origin, where PMI and prevalence correlation are both close to zero. Here, we will compare the relative strength of extreme pairs in each dataset. We will discuss how these extreme pairs validate existing knowledge and new hypotheses through case studies in \u00a7 4. For each relationship type, we calculate the strengths of the 25 pairs with the strongest relationships in this type, with the strength defined in the equation 3. This heuristics (henceforth collective strength) allows us to collectively compare the strengths of the most prominent friendship, tryst, arms race and head-to-head relationships. Results are not sensitive to the choice of 25.Fig.4 shows the collective strength of the four types in all our datasets. The most common order is: Friendship > Head-to-Head Race > Arms."}, {"heading": "4 Exploratory Studies", "text": "We present case studies based on strongly related pairs of ideas in the four types of relationships. \"Rank\" in this section refers to the rank of relationship strength between an idea pair in its respective relationship type."}, {"heading": "4.1 International Relations in Terrorism", "text": "In fact, it is that we see ourselves as being able to assert ourselves, that we are able, that we are able to put ourselves at the top, and that we are able, that we are able, that we are able, that we are able, that we are able, that we are able, to be able, to be able, to be able, to be able, to be able, to be able, to be able, to be able, to be able to hide. \""}, {"heading": "4.2 Ethnicity Keywords in Immigration", "text": "Our observation begins with a first-class relationship between Latin American and Asian immigrants. Although these words probably co-exist, their prevalence patterns differ, with the discussion of Asian immigrants in the 1990s giving way to a focus on the word Latin American immigrants since 2000. Possible theories to explain this observation include that undocumented immigrants are generally perceived as a Latino problem or that Latin American voters increasingly influence U.S. elections. In addition, Latin America maintains head-to-head relations with two subgroups of Latin American immigrants: Haiti and Cuba. Specifically, the strength of the relationship with Haiti ranks 18th in head-to-head relations. Meanwhile, Haitian and Cuban voters have a friendship relationship that is in turn consistent with the structural equilibrium theory. The decreasing prevalence of Haitian and Cuban relations may explain the shift in the geographical focus of recent immigration to the U.S. and the fact that the majority of the Latino population has some relevance to the American population."}, {"heading": "4.3 Relations between Topics in ACL", "text": "Finally, we analyze the relationships between themes in the ACL anthology. It turns out that \"machine translation\" is central to the relationships in all four types (fig. 8).7 It is part of the strongest relationship in all four types except tryst (place 5).The complete relationship curve shows further patterns. Friendship shows transitivity: both \"machine translation\" and \"word alignment\" have similar relationships to other themes. But such transitivity does not apply to all areas: although the prevalence of \"rule, forest methods\" correlates with both \"machine translation\" and \"emotion analysis,\" \"mood analysis\" rarely takes place with \"rule,\" because in the ranking we filtered a topic where the top words are ions, ions, system, process, language, one, one, input, natural language, processing, grammar. For the purposes of this corpus, this is effectively a stop topic."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "Most studies have so far examined the trends of ideas individually (Michel et al., 2011; Hall et al., 2008; Rule et al., 2015). Hall et al. (2008), for example, present various trends in our own computer-aided linguistic community, including the rise of statistical machine translation. More recently, rhetorical framing has been used to predict such patterns (Prabhakaran et al., 2016). An exception is that Shi et al. (2010) use prevalence correlations to analyze delay relationships between issues in publications and research grants. Anecdotally, Grudin (2009) observes a \"head-head relationship\" between artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction in research funding. To our knowledge, however, our work is the first to systematically characterize the relationships between ideas."}, {"heading": "6 Concluding Discussion", "text": "We have proposed a method to characterize relationships between ideas in texts through the lens of chance within documents and the prevalence correlation over time. For the first time, we observe that the distribution of paired coincidences is unimodal, while the distribution of paired prevalence correlations is not always unimodal, and show that they are positively correlated. This combination suggests four types of relationships between ideas, and these four types are all found to varying degrees in our experiments. We illustrate our calculation method through exploratory studies of news organizations and scientific research papers. We not only confirm existing knowledge, but also suggest hypotheses about the use of Arabs and Islams in terrorism and Latinos and Asians in immigration. It is important to note that the relationships found with our approach depend on the way ideas are presented and the source of texts."}], "references": [{"title": "Correlated topic models", "author": ["David M.

Combining two statistics\u2014cooccurrence within documents and prevalence correlation over time\u2014our approach reveals a number of different ways in which ideas can cooperate and compete. For instance, two ideas can closely track each other\u2019s prevalence over time, and yet rarely cooccur, almost like a \u201ccold war\u201d scenario. We observe that pairwise cooccurrence and prevalence correlation exhibit different distributions. We further demonstrate that our approach is able to uncover intriguing relations between ideas through in-depth case studies on news articles and research papers.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
