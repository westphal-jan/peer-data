A particularly relevant area is the assignment of pages to a historical printed document by the individual (the composer) who determines the type. Analysis of orthographic patterns is of fundamental importance for the assignment of texts (Holmes, 1994; Juola, 2006; Koppel und Witten, 2010). Analysis of orthographic patterns is fundamental for the assignment of texts."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "In this paper, we focus on modeling the same types of observations made by scientists and show consistency with authoritative attributions. We use compositional studies of Shakespeare's first folio to support our approach, relying on the methods proposed by Hinman (1963), Howard-Hill (1973), and Taylor (1981). Hinman's groundbreaking 1963 study grouped the pages of the first folio by five different composers based on deviations in spelling between three common words. Figure 1, for example, shows portions of two pages of the first folio with different writing variations for the words that are and do expensive: one composer used graphics and doe, while the other used text deare and do. Hinman relied on the assumption that each composer was consistent in his preferences for convenience in the typesetting process (Blayney, 1991). Subsequent studies looked at general phrases of preference and generalized words (for example, prethothographical words) with preferences."}, {"heading": "3 Model", "text": "Our computational approach to assigning compositors works on the basis of evidence sources considered by the bibliographers as latent variables in a generative model. We assume that we have access to a diplomatic transcription of the document (a transcription faithful to the original orthography), which we automatically align with a modernized version. [2] In our model, we experiment with both manually and automatically produced (OCR) transcriptions, and assume that we have access to pixel-based distance information on each page that can be extracted using OCR, as described in Section 4.Figure 2. In our model, each of the I totals is generated independently. The assignment of the compositor to the ith side is represented by the ci [1,., C] variable and is generated from a multinomial previous mixer."}, {"heading": "3.1 Orthographic Preference Model", "text": "We choose the parameterization of the distribution of diplomatic words to capture two types of spelling preferences: (1) general preferences for certain character groups (such as -ie) and (2) preferences that relate only to a particular word and do not indicate a larger pattern. As it is not known which of the two behaviors prevails, we let the model describe both and learn to separate their effects. Here, f (m, d) is a feature function defined on the modern word m paired with the diplomatic word d, whilewc is a weight vector common to the composer c.2Modern editions are common to many books of interest to bibliographers, although future work may take into account how to deal with their absence."}, {"heading": "3.2 Whitespace Preference Model", "text": "The manual analysis of the spacing has revealed differences between the pages. In particular, the selection of punctuation marks with or without spacing is considered by the biobliographs to indicate the preference of the composition and the specific sentence structure. We add spaces to our model to capture these observations. While the bibliographers only made a rough distinction between commas with or without spacing, in our model we generate medial compass spacing widths, sik, which are measured in pixels to allow for a finer-grained analysis. We use a simple multinomial parameterization in which each pixel width is treated as a standalone result up to a maximum permissible width: sik | ci, Mult (prevci) Here \u03b8c represents the vector of multinomial spacing parameters corresponding to the composition c. We choose these parameters because they can capture non-uniodal spacing distributions as shown in Figure 2, making it easy to learn."}, {"heading": "3.3 Learning and Inference", "text": "To adapt the model to an input document, we estimate the orthographic preference parameters, wc and distance preference parameters, \u03b8c, for each compositor using EM. The E-step is performed via a tractable sum via composite assignments, while the M-step for wc is performed via gradient ascension (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010). The M-step for distance parameters, \u03b8c, uses the standard multinomial update. The prediction of compositor groups is performed via an independent Argmax over each ci. In all experiments, we perform 75 iterations of EM with 100 random restarts and select the learned parameters that correspond to the best model probability."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "Data: To evaluate our model when it has access to perfectly transcribed historical text, we use the Bodleian Diplomatic Transcription of First Folio.3 To test whether our approach can work with non-transcribed books, we applied the Ocular OCR system (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2013) to the Bodleian facsimile images to create an automatic diplomatic transcription. In both cases, we used Ocular Estimates of Glyphenbounding Boxes on the full First Folio images to extract spatial information.The modern text was taken by MIT Complete Works of Shakespeare 4 and was brought into line with diplomatic transcriptions by performing a word-level edit distance calculation. The extracted substitutions form the model of observed modern-diplomatic word attributions. Rating: To compare the restored mapping with the groups suggested by bibliographers, we rate, we rate against an authoritative assignment."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "Our experimental results are presented in Table 1. The BASIC variant, modeled using Hinman's original method, significantly exceeds the random baseline, with the HINMAN word list exceeding the larger AUTO word list. However, the use of B AC E D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! of the larger word list of function-based models results in large increases in all scenarios, including the evaluation of Hinman's original attributions and using diplomatic OCR transcriptions. The most powerful model for both manually transcribed and OCR text uses EDIT functions in conjunction with distance generation and achieves an accuracy of up to 87%. On top of that, taking into account WORD features, this results in slightly reduced performance, perhaps as a result of the significantly increased number of free parameters. In the OCR scenario, the addition of WORD features above EDIT features reduces the same accuracy as the experiment."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "The results on OCR (character error rate for most pieces \u2248 10-15%) are only slightly inferior to those on manual transcripts, which shows that our approach is generalizable in the general case where no manual diplomatic transcriptions are available. In our experiments, we also opted for a joint modern edition of Shakespeare instead of a more carefully produced modernized transcription of the facsimile - our goal is to demonstrate once again that this approach is generalizable, perhaps on documents where careful modernization of the facsimile is not available. Taken together, these results suggest that our model may be sufficiently robust to support bibliographers in their analysis of less studied texts. Figure 3 shows an example of the property weights and distance parameters learned through the FEAT w / ALL model. Our statistical approach is able to successfully explain some of the observations that scientists have made. Taylor (1981) notes, for example, that compositors do not allow C and D to advance it in young years."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "Our primary goal is to scale up the methods of assigning compositors, which include both textual and visual modes of proof, for use in books and corpora. By using statistical principles and considering evidence on a larger scale, we offer a more robust approach to identifying compositors than has been possible to date. The fact that our system works well for OCR texts means that we are not limited to documents for which we have manually transcribed, opening the possibility for bibliographic studies of a much larger class of texts. Although we are not able to include the kind of world knowledge used by bibliographers, our ability to include more information and finer-grained information, the results of which we can follow. Having validated these techniques in the First Folio, where historical claims are well established, we hope that future work can expand these methods and their application."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback.
