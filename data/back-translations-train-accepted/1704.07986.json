This kind of knowledge is useful not only for stance detection across multiple topics but also for various real-world applications including public opinion surveys, electoral predictions, electoral campaigns, and online debates. In order to extract users' preferences on Twitter, we design linguistic patterns in which people agree and disagree about specific topics (e.g., \"A is completely wrong\"). By applying these linguistic patterns to a collection of tweets, we extract statements agreeing and disagreeing with various topics. Inspired by previous work on item recommendation, we formalize the task of modeling inter-topic preferences as matrix factorization: representing users' preferences as a user-topic matrix and mapping both users and topics onto a latent feature space that abstracts the preferences. Our experimental results demonstrate both that our proposed approach is useful in predicting missing preferences of users and that the latent vector representations of topics successfully encode inter-topic preferences.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 07:04:46 GMT  (1596kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07986v1", "To appear in ACL2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ACL2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["akira sasaki", "kazuaki hanawa", "naoaki okazaki", "kentaro inui"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07986"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.07986.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Other Topics You May Also Agree or Disagree: Modeling Inter-Topic Preferences using Tweets and Matrix Factorization", "authors": ["Akira Sasaki", "Kazuaki Hanawa", "Naoaki Okazaki"], "emails": ["inui}@ecei.tohoku.ac.jp"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is as if most people who are able to survive themselves are not able to survive themselves.

Formally, we are interested in acquiring a collection of tuples (u, t, v) where: u, u, U is a user; U is the set of all users on Twitter; t, T is a topic; T is the set of all topics; and v, {+ 1, \u2212 1} is + 1 if the user agrees with the topic and \u2212 1 otherwise (i.e. disagreement). During this work, we use a corpus of 35,328,745,115 Japanese tweets (7,340,730 users) crawled from February 6, 2013 to September 30, 2016. We have removed retweets from the corpus."}, {"heading": "2.1 Mining Linguistic Patterns of Agreement and Disagreement", "text": "We use linguistic patterns to extract tuples (u, t, v). Based on this regular Chinese corpus. Specifically, when a tweet message matches a linguistic pattern of coincidence (e.g. \"t is necessary\"), we consider that the author u of the tweet coincides with the topic t. Conversely, a statement of disagreement is identified by linguistic patterns of disagreement (e.g. \"t is unacceptable\"). To design linguistic patterns, we focus on hashtags that appear in the corpus, which are popular cues for locating subjective statements such as sensations (Davidov et al., 2010), emotions (Qadir and Riloff, 2014), and irony (Van Hee et al, 2016). Hashtags are also useful to find strong supporters and critics, as well as their target topics; for example, # immigrantsWelcome indicates that the author favors immigrants."}, {"heading": "2.2 Extracting Instances of Topic Preferences", "text": "If a sentence in a tweet whose author is user u matches one of the pro patterns (e.g. \"t is necessary\") and topic t is included in the set of target topics T, we recognize this as an example of (u, t, + 1. If a sentence matches one of the pro patterns (e.g. \"I do not want\") and topic t is included in the set of target topics T, we recognize this as an example of (u, t, \u2212 1). Using this approach, we collected 25,805,909 tuples corresponding to 3,302,613 users and 4,899 topics. Since these collected tuples comprised comparatively rare users and topics, we removed users and topics that appeared less than five times. In addition, there were also meaningless, less topics such as \"of\" and \"of them,\" so we sorted these topics in descending order of the 1,279 most common topics."}, {"heading": "3 Matrix Factorization", "text": "Using the methods described in Section 2, from the corpus, we have collected a number of user preferences regarding various topics (Q = 1). However, Twitter users do not necessarily express preferences for all topics. Furthermore, it is inherently impossible to predict whether a new (i.e., non-existing) user agrees or disagrees with predefined topics. Therefore, in this section, we apply matrix factorization (Koren et al., 2009) to predict missing topics, inspired by research on Item recommendations (Bell and Koren, 2007; Dror et al., 2011). Essentially, matrix factorization maps both users and topics to a latent feature space that abstracts users \"topic preferences."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Determining the Dimension Parameter k", "text": "And can we find the \"sweet spot\" for the number of dimensions k of latent space?

By developing linguistic patterns to identify support and contradiction statements, we extracted users \"preferences on various topics from a large collection of tweets. We formalized the task of modeling cross-topic preferences as a matrix factorization that maps both users and topics to a latent trait space that abstracts users\" preferences. By our experimental results, we showed that our approach was able to accurately predict missing topic preferences of users (80-94%) and that our latent vector representations of topics cross-topic preferences correctly encode. In our immediate future work, we plan to embed the topic and user vectors to create a cross-topic point detector. It is possible to generalize our work to model heterogeneous signals, such as those that support A and B's interests, and those that are also interested in B's behavior."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 15H05318 and JST CREST Grant Number J130002054, Japan."}], "references": [{"title": "The political blogosphere and the 2004 U.S. election: Divided they blog", "author": ["Lada A.

This kind of knowledge is useful not only for stance detection across multiple topics but also for various real-world applications including public opinion surveys, electoral predictions, electoral campaigns, and online debates. In order to extract users\u2019 preferences on Twitter, we design linguistic patterns in which people agree and disagree about specific topics (e.g., \u201cA is completely wrong\u201d). By applying these linguistic patterns to a collection of tweets, we extract statements agreeing and disagreeing with various topics. Inspired by previous work on item recommendation, we formalize the task of modeling intertopic preferences as matrix factorization: representing users\u2019 preferences as a usertopic matrix and mapping both users and topics onto a latent feature space that abstracts the preferences. Our experimental results demonstrate both that our proposed approach is useful in predicting missing preferences of users and that the latent vector representations of topics successfully encode inter-topic preferences.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
