Linguistic features, mainly from parsers, have been used to detect MCI, but this is not suitable for large-scale assessments. MCI disfluencies produce non-grammatical speech that requires manual or high precision automatic correction of transcripts. In this paper, we modeled transcripts into complex networks and enriched them with word embedding (CNE) to better represent short texts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The network measurements were applied with well-known classifiers to automatically identify MCI in transcripts, in a binary classification task. A comparison was made with the performance of traditional approaches using Bag of Words (BoW) and linguistic features for three datasets: DementiaBank in English, and Cinderella and Arizona-Battery in Portuguese. Overall, CNE provided higher accuracy than using only complex networks, while Support Vector Machine was superior to other classifiers. CNE provided the highest accuracies for DementiaBank and Cinderella, but BoW was more efficient for the Arizona-Battery dataset probably owing to its short narratives. The approach using linguistic features yielded higher accuracy if the transcriptions of the Cinderella dataset were manually revised. Taken together, the results indicate that complex networks enriched with embedding is promising for detecting MCI in large-scale assessments", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:06:25 GMT  (2026kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08088v1", "Published in Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguist 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguist 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["leandro santos", "edilson anselmo corr\u00eaa j\u00fanior", "osvaldo oliveira jr", "diego amancio", "let\u00edcia mansur", "sandra alu\u00edsio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.08088"}, "pdf": {"name": "1704.08088.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Enriching Complex Networks with Word Embeddings for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from Speech Transcripts", "authors": ["Leandro B. dos Santos", "Edilson A.

Since dementia is chronic and progressive, early diagnosis ensures a greater chance of success for patients in non-pharmacological treatment strategies such as cognitive training, physical activity and socialization. (Teixeira et al., 2012). Language is one of the most efficient sources of information for assessing cognitive function. Changes in language use are common in patients with dementia and are usually first detected by patients themselves or their family members. Therefore, the automatic analysis of discourse production is promising in diagnosing MCI in the early stages that can address potentially reversible factors."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Detection of memory impairment is based on linguistic, acoustic and demographic characteristics determined by memory analysis (in addition to dozens of neuropsychological tests.

(2016) to generate word embedded.This method expands the model of the skip gram to use information at the character level, presenting each word as a bag of character n-grams. It offers some improvement over the traditional skip gram model in terms of syntactical evaluation (Mikolov et al., 2013b), but not for semantic assessment.Once the network has been enriched, we characterize its topology using the following ten measurements: 1.

We also combined these classifiers through ensemble and multi-view learning. In ensemble learning, multiple models / classifiers are generated and combined with a majority match or average of class probabilities to produce a single result (Zhou, 2012). In multiview learning, multiple classifiers are trained in different feature spaces and thus combined to produce a single result. This approach is an elegant solution compared to the combination of spatial truths to improve these features for first weighting or second weighting."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments and Results", "text": "All experiments were carried out using Scikitlearn6 (Pedregosa et al., 2011), where classifiers were not evaluated on the basis of classification accuracy, i.e. the total proportion of narratives correctly classified, and the evaluation was carried out with 5-fold cross-validations, which were however optimized with the best values, which are 0.7 in the well accepted 10-fold cross-validations, since the data sets in our study were small and the test set would have shrunk, which would have resulted in less precise measurements of accuracy. However, the threshold was optimized with the best values, which are 0.7 in the cookie theft data and 0.4 in the data sets of Cinderella and ABCD. We used the model proposed by Bojanowski et al, which leads to less precise measurements of accuracy.

To our knowledge, these metrics were never used to recognize MCI in language transcripts; CN were enriched with word embedding to better represent short texts produced in neuropsychological assessments; the topological characteristics of CN exceed traditional linguistic metrics in the results of individual classifiers; linguistic characteristics depend on grammatical texts to present good results, as can be seen in the results of the manually processed Cinderella dataset (Table 7); and we found that the combination of machine and multivisionary learning can improve accuracy; the accuracies found here are comparable to those of other authors, ranging from 60% to 85%, in order to determine the relevant results."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by CAPES, CNPq, FAPESP and Google Research Awards in Latin America.

Linguistic features, mainly from parsers, have been used to detect MCI, but this is not suitable for large-scale assessments. MCI disfluencies produce nongrammatical speech that requires manual or high precision automatic correction of transcripts. In this paper, we modeled transcripts into complex networks and enriched them with word embedding (CNE) to better represent short texts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The network measurements were applied with well-known classifiers to automatically identify MCI in transcripts, in a binary classification task. A comparison was made with the performance of traditional approaches using Bag of Words (BoW) and linguistic features for three datasets: DementiaBank in English, and Cinderella and Arizona-Battery in Portuguese. Overall, CNE provided higher accuracy than using only complex networks, while Support Vector Machine was superior to other classifiers. CNE provided the highest accuracies for DementiaBank and Cinderella, but BoW was more efficient for the Arizona-Battery dataset probably owing to its short narratives. The approach using linguistic features yielded higher accuracy if the transcriptions of the Cinderella dataset were manually revised. Taken together, the results indicate that complex networks enriched with embedding is promising for detecting MCI in large-scale assessments.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
