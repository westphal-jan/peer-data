We consider two languages to be different if they have different ISO 639-3 codes.The translations are verse-level oriented, but many translations are not completely covered, so most verses are not present in at least one translation.One reason for this is that sometimes several consecutive verses are merged, so that one verse contains material that is not actually part of the translation, and the merged verses may then be missing from the translation. Therefore, there is a balance between the number of parallel translations and the number of verses they have in common. Although some pre-editing has been done by the authors of the resource, many translations are not pre-edited."}, {"heading": "3.2 Experiments", "text": "1. Selection of a linguistic feature.

We process 1556 translations, so in total we extract 1556 x 5 x 10 n-grams. Table 3.2 shows that the middle rank (MRR) for 10 languages. The rank for a particular ranking of n-grams is the first n-gram that is strongly correlated with the relevant tension; e.g., character sequences of the name \"Paul\" are rated as wrong, the sequence \"-ed\" in English as correct for the past. MRR is averaged over all n-gram sizes, 2 \u2264 n languages have uniform tense labeling only for the future, so the results are poor. Russian and Polish perform poorly because their central grammatical category is aspect, not tense. \"The poor performance in Arabic is due to the limitations of the n-gram traits for a\" templatic \"language."}, {"heading": "4 A map of past tense", "text": "To illustrate the potential of our method, we select five out of the past 100 times, which do not include five of these figures. - > WKs > > WKs > > WKs > WKs > WKS > WKS > WKs > WKs > WKs > WKs > WKs > WKs > WKS > WKs > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS > WKS. \"WKS\" n \"WKS.\" WKS. \"WKS.,\" WKS. \"....\"........\"....\"....\"....\"....\"....\",\"....\"....\"....\"....\", \"....\"....\"....\"....\",\" WKS., \"(TZO),\" (TZO), \"WKS.....\"....\"....\"....\"....\"....\"....\",\"....\"....\"....\"....\"....\"....\", \"....\"....\",\" WS.....\", \"....\"....\",\"....\"....\", \"....\",\"....\", \",\" WS."}, {"heading": "5 Related work", "text": "In fact, it is such that people live in the countries in which they live, in the countries in which they live and live, in the countries in which they live and live, in the countries in which they live and live, in which they live and live, in which they live and live, in which they live and live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live and live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, they live in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, they live in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, they live, in which they live in which they live, they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, they live in which they live, they live in which they live in which they live, in which they live, they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live"}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We introduced SuperPivot, a method of analysis for low-resource languages that occur in a superp parallel corpus, i.e. a corpus that contains an order of magnitude more languages than currently used parallel corpus. We demonstrated that SuperPivot performs well in the cross-lingual lysis of the linguistic phenomenon of the tense. We produced analysis results for more than 1,000 languages and conducted - to the best of our knowledge - the largest cross-border computer study to date. We expanded the existing methodology for using parallel corpus for typological analysis by overcoming a limiting assumption of previous work. We only require that a linguistic trait be excessively marked in several thousand languages, rather than requiring it to be marked in all the languages studied. There are at least three future directions that seem promising to us: (i) the creation of a common map of time along the lines of Figure 5, but the uniformity of the characteristics (three) can be summarized in general tendencies."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "We present SuperPivot, an analysis<lb>method for low-resource languages that<lb>occur in a superparallel corpus, i.e., in a<lb>corpus that contains an order of magni-<lb>tude more languages than parallel corpora<lb>currently in use.
