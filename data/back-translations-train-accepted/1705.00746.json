To address the lack of benchmark datasets for this task, we construct a new dataset consisting of 15; 160 utterances collected from the real log data of a commercial intelligent assistant (and will release the dataset to facilitate future research activity). In addition, we investigate using tweets and Web search queries for handling open-domain user utterances, which characterize the task of chat detection.

Although the functionalities offered by the two types of SDS complement each other, little practical effort has been made to combine them.

The resulting dataset will be published to facilitate future studies. The technical challenge in chat detection is that we have to deal with endless expressions of intelligent assistants. Commercial intelligent assistants have a huge amount of users and in particular when they chat with a variety of subjects."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Previous studies on combining task-oriented and non-task-oriented SDS", "text": "Task-oriented and non-task-oriented SDS have long been studied independently of each other, and little effort has been made to develop hybrids of the two types of SDS. Consequently, previous studies have not explored chat detection without a few exceptions.4Niculescu and Banchs (2015) explored the use of non-task-oriented SDS as a back-off mechanism for task-oriented SDS. However, they have not proposed any concrete methods to automatically determine when to use non-task-oriented SDS.4Unfortunately, we can discuss little about chat detection in existing commercial intelligent wizards as most of their technical details have not been disclosed. We best try to balance this by comparing the proposed methods with our in-house intelligent wizard in the experiment. Lee et al. (2007) suggested an example-based dialogue manager to combine task-oriented and non-task-oriented SDS. In such a framework, however, it is difficult to use a flexible component."}, {"heading": "2.2 Intent and domain determination", "text": "Chat detection is related to, but different from, intention and domain identification, which have been investigated more in the area of SDS (Guo et al., 2014; Xu and Sarikaya, 2014; Ravuri and Stolcke, 2015; Kim et al., 2016; Zhang and Wang, 2016).Both intention and domain identification have been investigated in domain-specific task-oriented SDS. Intention determination aims to determine the type of information a user is looking for in singledomain task-oriented SDS. For example, in the ATIS dataset collected by a flight information system, the information types include flight, city and so on (Tur et al., 2010). On the other hand, domain identification aims to determine which domain is relevant to a given utterance of a user, in multi-domain task-oriented SDS identification systems is not relevant (Xu and Sarikaya, domain identification 2014, and notice that it is possible)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Intelligent assistant", "text": "Previous studies on smart assistants have not looked at chat detection, but their research focuses on user behaviour, including predicting user satisfaction and engagement (Jiang et al., 2015; Kobayashi et al., 2015; Sano et al., 2016; Kiseleva et al., 2016a, b) and gamification (Otani et al., 2016). For example, Jiang et al. (2015) looked at predicting whether users would be satisfied with intelligent assistants \"responses by combining various functions such as clicks and utterances. Sano et al. (2016) looked at predicting whether users would continue to use smart assistants in the future by looking at long-term usage histories. Some previous work used the Cortana dataset as a benchmark for domain definition (Guo et al., 2014; Xu and Sarikaya, 2014) or suggested a development framework for Cortana (but did not focus on DS)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Non-task-oriented SDS", "text": "While early studies used rule-based methods (Weizenbaum, 1966; Wallace, 2009), statistical approaches have recently become popular (Ritter et al., 2011; Vinyals et al., 2015), a research direction advanced by Ritter et al. (2011), which applied a phrase-based SMT model to response generation. Later, Vinyals et al., 2015; Sordoni et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016a, b; Gu et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016). These studies assume that users always chat with systems and only want to investigate methods of generating appropriate responses to given utterances."}, {"heading": "2.5 Use of conversational data", "text": "The recent explosion of conversation data on the web, especially tweets, has triggered a large number of dialog studies that typically use tweets either to train response generators (see Section 2.4) or to unattended detection of dialog files (Ritter et al., 2010; Higashinaka et al., 2011). This treatment of tweets differs from that used in our work."}, {"heading": "3 Chat Detection Dataset", "text": "In this section, we explain how we constructed the new benchmark dataset for chat detection, and then analyze the data to gain insight into actual user behavior."}, {"heading": "3.1 Construction procedure", "text": "The log data was collected between January and Aug. 2016. In the log data, some utterances such as \"hello\" appear frequently. To construct a data set containing both high and low frequency utterances, we set the frequency thresholds 7 to divide utterances into three groups (high, medium and low frequency) and then randomly collect the same number of utterances. 5The utterances are all in Japanese. Examples of utterances in this paper are English translations. 6https: / / v-assist.yahoo.co.jp 7We cannot disclose the exact thresholds in order to keep the detailed statistics of the original log data confidential. The instructions come from each of the three groups. During the data collection, we have ensured privacy by making statements that included a person's full name or detailed address information."}, {"heading": "3.2 Data analysis", "text": "The design process described above resulted in a data set consisting of 4, 833 CHAT and 10, 327 NONCHAT statements. We examined the annotation agreement among the crowd workers. Table 2 shows the distribution of votes received by the majority of the labels. Comments given by the seven workers matched perfectly in 5, 811 of the 15, 160 statements (38%). Also, at least six workers agreed in the majority of cases, 10, 789 (= 4, 978 + 5, 811) statements (71%), indicating a high level of agreement among the workers and the reliability of the comments. During data construction, we found that a typical confusing case arises when the utterance can be interpreted as an implicit request for information. For example, the utterance \"I am hungry\" can be considered as a user trying to have a chat with the assistant, but it could be a local restaurant."}, {"heading": "4 Detection Method", "text": "We formulate chat detection as a binary classification problem in order to train supervised classifiers. In this section, we will first explain the two types of classifiers examined in this paper, and then explore the use of external resources to improve these classifiers."}, {"heading": "4.1 Base classifiers", "text": "The first classifier uses SVM for its popularity and efficiency. It uses characters and word grammes (n = 1 and 2) as well as word embedding functions (Turian et al., 2010). A skipgram model (Mikolov et al., 2013) is trained on the entire log8 intelligent wizard to learn word embedding, and the embedding of words in the utterance is then averaged to generate additional traits. The second classifier uses a Convolutionary Neural Network (CNN) because it has recently proven to be good at text classification problems (Kim, 2014; Johnson and Zhang, 2015a, b). We follow (Kim, 2014) to develop a simple CNN that has a single folding and max pooling layer, followed by the soft-max layer. As a non-linear activation function, we use a reflected linear unit (LU) that is used for word embedding."}, {"heading": "4.2 Using external resources", "text": "Thanks to the rapid development of the Web over the past decade, a variety of textual data, including not only conversational (i.e., chat-like) but also non-conversational data, is abundantly available nowadays. These data provide an effective way to improve basic classifiers. In particular, we use tweets and web searches as conversation and non-conversation text data. \u2212 rt \u2212 rt-based language models on tweets and web searches, and use their8We used the same log data as in Section 3. Detailed statistics are confidential. \u2212 We also trained word-based language models in preliminary experiments and found that character-based models consistently achieve better results (i.e. the standardized protocol probabilities of utterance) as two additional features. Let u = c1, c2,... cm be an expression from m characters."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Results", "text": "We evaluate the proposed methods empirically on the basis of the chat detection data set."}, {"heading": "5.1 Experimental settings", "text": "We performed 10-fold cross-validation of the chat recognition data sets to train and evaluate the proposed classifiers. In each fold, we used 80%, 10% and 10% of the data for training, development and evaluation. We used word2vec10 to learn 300-dimensional word embeddings. They were used to induce the additional 300 features for SVM. They were also used as pre-trained word embeddings for CNN. We used the faster Toolkit11 to train the GRU language models. The size of the embedding and hidden layer was set at 256. The contrastive estimate (Gutmann and Hyva \ufffd rinen, 2010) was used to train the Soft Max function and the number of noise samples was also trained to 50. Maximum entropy 4-gram models were trained to obtain a combined model (Mikolov et al, 2011). 100 language models were collected on 100 million tweets between July and April 2016."}, {"heading": "5.2 Baselines", "text": "For comparison, the following basic methods were implemented: Majority Utterances are always classified as a majority class, NONCHAT.Tweet GRU Utterances are classified as CHAT when the score of the GRU language model trained on the tweets exceeds a threshold. We used exactly the same GRU language model as the one used to derive the feature, and the threshold was calibrated based on the development data by maximizing the F1 score of the CHAT class."}, {"heading": "5.3 Result", "text": "Table 4 gives the accuracy, recall, F1 score (for the CHAT class) and general classification accuracy results. We report only accuracy for the majority baseline. + embedded and + pre-training. represent the use of the word embedding features for SVM and the pre-trained word embeddings for CNN, respectively. + Tweet query represents the use of the three features resulting from the tweets and web search query. Table 4 shows that both the classifier, SVM and CNN, perform accurately. We see that both + embedded and + pre-training. improve the results. The most powerful method, SVM + embedded. + Tweet query, achieves an accuracy of 92% and 87% F1 score that exceed all baselines. CNN performed worse than SVM in contrast to the results reported by recent studies (Kim, 2014). We think this is because the architecture of our CNN model is fairly simplified."}, {"heading": "5.4 Training data size", "text": "Next, we examine the impact of training data size on classification accuracy. Figure 3 illustrates the learning curve, showing that classification accuracy improves almost monotonously as training data size increases. Although our training data is by no means small, the shape of the learning curve indicates that further improvement could be achieved by adding more training data, implying that a very large amount of training data is required to cover cross-domain expression in intelligent assistants. At the same time, the figure represents the usefulness of external resources. We see that SVM + can compensate for the scarcity of commented data. + Tweet queries, which are trained on approximately 25% of training data, can achieve comparable accuracy with SVM +, which is trained on the entire training data. This result suggests that external resources are able to compensate for the scarcity of commented data."}, {"heading": "5.5 Utterance length", "text": "Figure 4 illustrates the classification accuracy of SVM + embedded and SVM + embedded. + Tweet query for each utterance length in the number of characters. Figure 4 shows that the difference between the two suggested methods is evident in short expressions (i.e. \u2264 5). This is because these expressions are too short to provide sufficient information for classification, and the additional features are helpful. We note that the Japanese font system uses ideograms and therefore five characters are sufficient to represent a simple sentence. We also see a clear difference in longer expressions (i.e. 15 \u2264). We find these long expressions difficult to classify because some words in the expressions are irrelevant for classification and the n-gram and the embedding features contain these irrelevant ones. On the other hand, we believe that language model evaluations are good at capturing stylistic information regardless of the utterance length."}, {"heading": "6 Future Work", "text": "As discussed in Section 3.2, some user statements such as \"I am hungry\" are of an ambiguous nature and therefore difficult to handle within the current framework. An important future work is the development of a sophisticated dialogue manager to deal with such utterances, for example through clarification questions (Schlo \u00bfder and Fernandez, 2015).We have examined the dialogue file in the chat recognition data set manually (c.f., Section 3.2).It is interesting to automatically determine the dialogue file in order to generate appropriate system reactions. Some related studies exist in such a research direction (Meguro et al., 2010).Although we have only used text data for chat recognition, we can also use context information such as the previous statements (Xu and Sarikaya, 2014), the acoustic information (Jiang et al., 2015) and the user profile (Sano et al., 2016).It is an interesting research topic to use such contextual information beyond the information."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "To address the shortage of benchmark datasets for this task, we constructed a new benchmark dataset from the real log data of a commercial smart wizard. In addition, we investigated the use of external resources, tweets, and web searches to handle open domain user statements that characterize the task of chat detection, and the empirical experiment showed that the standard-monitored methods supplemented with the external resources work precisely, exceeding the basic approaches. We hope this study will help break the long-standing boundary between task-oriented and non-task-task-oriented SDS.To facilitate future research, we will release the dataset along with the feature values derived from tweets and web searches.14"}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Manabu Sassano, Chikara Hashimoto, Naoki Yoshinaga and Masashi Toyoda for fruitful discussions and comments and also the anonymous reviewers."}], "references": [{"title": "Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on sequence modeling", "author": ["Junyoung Chung", "Caglar Gulcehre", "KyungHyun Cho", "Yoshua Bengio."], "venue": "arXiv:1412.3555.", "citeRegEx": "Chung et al\\.,? 2014", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chung et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Task completion platform: A selfserve multi-domain goal oriented dialogue platform", "author": ["beth Krawczyk", "Xiaohu Liu", "Danko Panic", "Vasiliy Radostev", "Nikhil Ramesh", "Jean-Phillipe Robichaud", "Alexandre Rochette", "Logan Stromberg", "Ruhi Sarikaya"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Krawczyk et al\\.,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Krawczyk et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Incorporating copying mechanism in sequence-to-sequence learning", "author": ["Jiatao Gu", "Zhengdong Lu", "Hang Li", "Victor O.K.
