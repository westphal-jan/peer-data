However, some structures appear to occur more frequently or occur more frequently than others. Perhaps one of the simplest typological questions comes from phonology: Which vowels tend to occur and quantify within the phoneme inventories of different languages? Inspired by linguistic literature, we propose models of the probability distribution from which the certified vowel inventories were drawn. It is a typological universe in which each language contains both vowels and consonants (Velupillai, 2012). Which vowels a language contains is guided by softer constraints in which certain configurations are more common than others. In a typical phoneme inventory inventory, there tend to be far fewer vowels than consonants."}, {"heading": "2 Vowel Inventories and their Typology", "text": "Vowel inventories are a simple entry point into the study of linguistic typology. Each spoken language chooses its own set of vowels, and the number of vowel phonemes ranges from 3 to 46, with an average of 8.7 (Gordon, 2016). Nevertheless, the empirical distribution over vowel inventories is remarkably high: the majority of languages have 5-7 vowels, and despite many possibilities, there are only a handful of different 4-vowel systems that are documented. Recurring linguistic theory (BeckerKristal, 2010) has suggested that vowel inventories are shaped by the principles discussed below."}, {"heading": "2.1 Acoustic Phonetics", "text": "One way to describe the sound of a vowel is its acoustic energy at different frequencies. A spectrogram (Figure 3) is a visualization of the energy at different frequencies over time. Consider the \"peak frequencies\" F0 < F1 < F2 <..., which have a greater energy than their neighboring frequencies. F0 is referred to as the fundamental frequency or pitch. The other qualities of the vowel are largely determined by F1, F2,..., known as formants (Chargefoged and Johnson, 2014). In many languages, the first two formants F1 and F2 contain enough information to identify a vowel: Figure 3 shows how they differ between three English vowels. We consider each vowel listed in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to be characterized as cross-linguistic by some (F1, F2) pairs."}, {"heading": "2.2 Dispersion", "text": "The dispersion criterion (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972; Lindblom, 1986) states that the phonemes of a language must be \"spread out\" so that they can be easily distinguished from the listener.

The first two formants F1 and F2 are marked with colored arrows for each vowel. We used the praat toolkit to generate the spectrogram and find the formants (Boersma et al., 2002). Language seeks phonemes that are sufficiently \"far\" from each other to avoid confusion. Distances between phonemes are defined in any latent \"metric space.\" We use this term as a reflection of their similarity, rather than their similarity."}, {"heading": "2.3 Focalization", "text": "A commonly accepted explanation is the Quantum Theory of Speech (Stevens, 1972, 1989). Quantum Theory states that certain sounds are easier to articulate and perceive than others. These vowels can be characterized as those where F1 and F2 frequencies are close to each other. On the production side, these vowels are easier to pronounce because they allow greater imprecision in articulation. On the perception side, they are more prominent because the two spectral peaks aggregate and act as one, larger peaks to some extent. Generally, languages will prefer these vowels."}, {"heading": "2.4 Dispersion-Focalization Theory", "text": "A good vowel system today consists of vowels that are distinct and individually desirable (Schwartz et al., 1997). This paper provides the first probabilistic treatment of DFT and new evaluation metrics for future probabilistic and non-probabilistic treatments of the vowel inventory. [1] In this paper, we assume that metric space is universal - although it would not be unreasonable to assume that the vowel system has adapted to each language to avoid confusion in the specific communicative environment of its speakers."}, {"heading": "3 Point Process Models", "text": "In this essay, we take V as a set of all IPA symbols corresponding to the vowels. Thus, a dot process is a vowel inventory V, and the dot process itself is a distribution over such inventories. We consider three basic dot process models for vowel systems: the Bernoulli dot process, the Markov dot process, and the determinant dot process. In this section, we review the relevant theory of dot processes, highlighting aspects related to \u00a7 2."}, {"heading": "3.1 Bernoulli Point Processes", "text": "If one takes V = {v1,.., vN}, a Bernoulli dot process (BPP) makes an independent decision about whether each vowel should be included in the subset. The probability of a vowel system V V is thusp (V) if the ith vowel is good in the sense of \u00a7 2.3. Marginal conclusion in a BPP is computationally trivial. The probability that the inventory contains V vi is vi (vi) / (1 + \u03c6 (vi)), independent of the other vowels in V. Since a BPP predicts each vowel independently, it is only a model of focus. Thus, the model provides an adequate basis to measure the importance of the dispersion principle."}, {"heading": "3.2 Markov Point Processes", "text": "A Markov Point Process (MPP) (Van Lieshout, 2000) - also known as the Boltzmann machine (Ackley et al., 1985; Hinton and Sejnowski, 1986) - generalizes the BPP by adding pairs of vowels. The probability of a vowel system V is nowp (V) as well as vis-vis-vis (vi, vj), vj-V vowels (vi, vj), (2) where each vowel (vi) \u2265 0 is a simple potential that evaluates the quality of the ith vowel, and each vowel (vi, vj) \u2265 0 is a binary potential that evaluates the combination of ith and jth vowels."}, {"heading": "3.3 Determinantal Point Processes", "text": "A Determinantal Point Process (DPP) (Macchi, 1975) represents an elegant alternative to an MPP, and one that lends itself directly to modelling both focusing and dispersion. Conclusion requires few matrix calculations and runs tractively in O (V | 3) time, although the model can encode a rich set of multiway interactions. We focus on L-ensemble parameterization of DPP, due to borodin and rains (2005).4 This type of DPP defines the probability of an inventory V V asp (V).detLV, (3) where L-ensemble parameterization of DPP is a symmetric positive semidefinitive matrix, and LV refers to the submatrix of L with only these rows and columns corresponding to these elements in subset V. Although the MAP inference in DPPs (exactly as in Ps) remains hard, we can become a constant."}, {"heading": "4 Dataset", "text": "At this point, it is helpful to introduce the empirical data set that we are going to model. 5 Becker-Kristal (2010) provides the vowel inventory for each of the 223 languages as a set of IPA symbols, listing the first 5 formants for each vowel (or less if it is not available in the original source). Some corpus statistics are presented in figs. 4 and 5.6. For the present paper, we take V as the set of all 53 IPA symbols that occur in the corpus. We consider these IPA labels significant because we consider two vowels in different languages to be the same vowel in V when they are (for example) both commented as [O]. We characterize this vowel by its average formant vector in all languages in the corpus that contain the vowel: e.g. (F1, F2,...) = (500, 700,...) for [O] both of which are commented as [O]. We are planning this vowel on the basis of its average formant vector in all languages in the corpus that contain the vowel: e.g. (F1, F2,...) = (700,...) for [O] are we allowed to consider it [future work on loosening it]."}, {"heading": "5 Model Parameterization", "text": "The BPP, MPP and DPP models (\u00a7 3) require us to specify parameters for each vowel in V. In \u00a7 5.1, we will achieve this by deriving the parameters for each vowel vi from a possibly high-dimensional embedding of that vowel, e (vi) and Rr. In \u00a7 5.2, we are again defined as an learned function of f (vi) and Rk, where f: V 7 \u2192 Rk is the function that assigns a vowel to a k-vector of its measurable acoustic properties. This approach allows us to determine reasonable parameters even for rare vowels, based on their measurable properties. It will even enable us in 5Becker-Kristal to list several languages multiple times with different measurements. If a language had multiple listings, we selected a random vowel for our experiments. 6Caveat: The corpus is a curation of information from different phonetics papers in a common electronic format."}, {"heading": "5.1 Deep Point Processes", "text": "Deep Bernoulli Point PP Process. We define \u03c6 (vi) = | | e (vi) | | \u2265 0 (5) Deep Markov Point Process. MPP uses the same simple potential as BPP, as well as the binary potential. (vi, vj) = exp \u2212 1T \u00b7 | e (vi) \u2212 e (vj) | | 2 < 1 (6), where the learned temperature T > 0 controls the relative strength of the single and binary potential. This formula is inspired by Coulomb's law describing the repulsion of static electrically charged particles. Just as the repulsive force between two particles approaches each other, the probability of finding two vowels in the same inventory is greater than the probability that they will approach each other."}, {"heading": "5.2 Embeddings", "text": "We have considered only the first layer of irrationality, since our dataset unfortunately does not provide higher information for all languages. (7For7Considering what we have learned in recent years, we can now describe three possible methods to capture the different characteristics of the IPA vowel. (vi) Each of these maps has learnable parameters. (7) First, we consider the meaning of each vowel embedded in a vector space. (vi) = W1 tanh (vi) + b0) + b1, (7) Equation gives an architecture with 1 layer of irrationality; in general, we consider these neural networks (vi) = W1 tanh (vi)."}, {"heading": "6 Evaluation Metrics", "text": "Essentially, we are interested in whether our model has abstracted the basic principles of what constitutes a good vowel system. Our choice of a probabilistic model represents a natural test: How surprised is our model of held-up languages? In other words, how likely is it that our model goes unheeded, but attested vowel systems are? This is a natural evaluation paradigm in the NLP, but - to the best of our knowledge - it has not been applied to a quantitative study of linguistic typology. As a second evaluation, we are introducing a vowel system cloze task, which could also be used to evaluate non-probabilistic models. This task is defined in analogy to the traditional semantic cloze task [Taylor, 1953), where the reader is asked to fill a vowel system cloze task [vowel] vowel task [vowel task] vowel task [semantic cloze task] vowel task [Taylor, 1953] where the reader is asked to fill a text text text, a text task [text task] a missing word in the sentence from the context.

We specify the mean performance in the 10 folds. Performance in each fold (\"test\") was determined by training many models in 8 of the other 9 folds (\"pull\"), selecting the model that achieved the best task-specific performance in the remaining fold (\"development\"), and evaluating these on the test fold. Minimization of the parameters is done using the L-BFGS algorithm (Liu and Nocedal, 1989). As a pre-processing step, the first two formant values F1 and F2 are centered by a factor of zero and scaled down by a factor of 1000, since the formant values themselves can be quite large. Specifically, we use the development fold to select from the following combinations of hyperparameters. For neural embedding, we have r {2, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200}, 200}, wotype values for 2, wotype {, 40-40}, the number of components, etc."}, {"heading": "7.1 Results and Discussion", "text": "Figure 1 illustrates the diffeomorphism from formant space to metric space for one of our DPP models (depth d = 3 with r = 20 prototypes). Similar figures can be generated for all interpretable models. We report on results for cross entropy and cloze evaluation in Table 1.9. Under both measurements, we see that the DPP is slightly better than the MPP; both are better than the BPP. This ranking applies to 9Computing Cross-Entropy. The embedding schemes themselves are exactly intractable to the MPP, so we resort to an unbiased sampling scheme in which we take samples from the BPP and reweight them according to the MPP (Liu et al., 2015). Each of the three embedding schemes itself is compared in the picture caption. Within each embedding scheme, the BPP performs several points worse than the Cloze tasks and confirms that the structure of PP is much less useful, however, the differentiation of PP is necessary."}, {"heading": "8 Discussion: Probabilistic Typology", "text": "We see this as a natural approach to typology because it directly describes which types of linguistic systems occur more or less frequently. In fact, the traditional implicit universal concepts (\"all languages with vi have vj\") have been softened in our approach to conditional probabilities, such as \"p (vj) evolutionary types of linguistic systems.\" This is not merely an empirical relationship, but a probability derived from the fully estimated distribution. It is meant to make predictions about invisible languages that exploit the properties of these distribution10. Jakobson (1941) found that children's acquired phonemes reflect in an order the principles of similar dispersion (\"maximum contrast\") and focalization.At each rate, we estimate the distribution of certain systems that go beyond the typology."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions", "text": "We have presented a series of point process models for modeling the inventory typology of the vowel system, with the aim of providing a mathematical basis for research in phonological typology. In addition, all models were given in-depth parameterization to learn representations that resemble the perceptual space in cognitive science. Furthermore, we have established our preference for probabilistic modelling in linguistic typology over previously proposed computerized approaches, arguing that it is a more natural research paradigm. In addition, we have introduced several new evaluation metrics for research in vowel system typology that we hope will spark further interest in this area. Their performance has been empirically confirmed in the Becker-Kristal corpus, which includes data from over 200 languages."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The first author was funded by an NDSEG graduate scholarship, the second author by the NSF scholarship IIS1423276.
