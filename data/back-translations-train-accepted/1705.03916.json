Researchers have modeled various problems, such as the allocation of meetings (Maheswaran et al. 2004; Zivan et al. 2014), distributed allocation of targets to sensors in a network (Farinelli et al. 2008), allocation of resources in disaster protection classes (cumulative network)."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "In this section we present an overview of DCOPs, describe DPOP, a complete distributed algorithm for solving DCOPs, and provide some basic definitions of ASP."}, {"heading": "2.1 Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems", "text": "We assume that this will be a finite set of (decision) variables.

The second module is the Controller Module (CM), encoded as a prolog program.

Specifically, we compare ASP-DPOP with the original DPOP and three other implementations of complete DCOP solvers: Asynchronous Forward-Bounding (AFB), Hard Constraint-DPOP (H-DPOP) and Open-DPOP (ODPOP). AFB (Gershman et al. 2009) is a complete search-based algorithm for solving DCOPs. H-DPOP (Kumar et al. 2008) is a complete DCOP solver that also propagates hard constraints to edit the search space. ODPOP (Petcu and Folding 2006) is an optimization algorithm for DCOPs that combines some advantages of both search-based algorithms and dynamically programmable algorithms."}, {"heading": "5.1 Background on AFB", "text": "The asynchronous predictive algorithm (AFB) (Gershman et al. 2009) is, to the best of our knowledge, the latest complete search-based algorithm for solving DCOPs. AFB uses a branch-and-bounce scheme to determine a complete value allocation that minimizes the total benefit of all constraints. To do this, agents extend a partial value allocation as long as the lower limit of their total service program does not exceed the global limit, which is the total benefit of the best full value allocation ever found. In AFB, the state of the search process is represented by a data structure called Current Partial Assignment (CPA). The CPA starts blank from an initialization agent that records the value allocation of its own variables and passes the CPA to the next agent."}, {"heading": "5.2 Background on H-DPOP", "text": "In H-DPOP (Kumar et al. 2008), the authors consider how to take advantage of the hard constraints that exist in the problem in a dynamic programming framework, so that only feasible subassignments are calculated, transferred, and stored (Kumar et al. 2008). To this end, they encode the combinations of mappings based on DPOP. Basically, CDDs eliminate all inconsistent mappings and include only utilities that match the value combinations that are consistent. The resulting algorithms, H-DPOP, a hybrid algorithm based on DPOP, uses CDDs to exclude unworkable mappings, thus making UTIL messages.A CDD G = < G > encodes the consistent mappings for a set of mappings."}, {"heading": "5.3 Background on ODPOP", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive themselves are not able to survive themselves, \"he told the German Press Agency in an interview with\" Welt am Sonntag \":\" I don't think we will be able to save the world. \"He added:\" I don't think we will be able to fix the world. \"He added:\" I don't think we will be able to fix the world. \"He added:\" I don't think we will be able to keep the world in order. \""}, {"heading": "5.4 Discussion on FRODO Platform", "text": "In our experiment, we compare the performance of ASP-DPOP against DPOP, AFB and ODPOP variable for a virtual agent; in particular, we use the implementation of the last three systems publicly available on the FRODO platform.

However, agents in DCOP problems used in our experiments have their own multiple variables. We will discuss in this subsection the preprocessing technology (i.e., decomposition, also known as virtual agents) that FRODO translates a general DCOP with multiple variables per agent into a new DCOP with a variable."}, {"heading": "5.5 Experimental Results", "text": "We implement two versions of the ASP-DPOP algorithm - one that uses soil programs, which we call \"ASP-DPOP (Facts),\" and one that uses soil programs, which we call \"ASP-DPOP (Rules).\" Furthermore, since the observation of H-DPOP occurs in Section 5.2, we also implemented a variant of H-DPOP, called PH-DPOP, which stands for 100% -based H-DPOP, which limits the amount of information that any actor can access to the amount common in most DCOP algorithms, including DPOP and ASP-DPOP, which limits a variant of H-DPOP-10% -10% -10% -10% -10% -10% -10% 10% -10% -10% -% -10% -% -% of their own access."}, {"heading": "5.6 Discussions on ASP-DPOP", "text": "The advantages of using ASP-DPOP are achieved by having ASP as a basis. Here, we will illustrate the two main advantages of using ASP within ASP-DPOP, while using the highly expressive ASP language to encode constraints in DCOPs: 1. the use of this highly expressive ASP language to encode constraints in DCOPs; and 2. the ability to use the highly optimized ASP grounders and solvers to narrow the search space based on hard constraints. In the rest of this section, we will discuss these advantages further and apply them to the observations drawn from the experiments. These considerations will be followed by a discussion on how ASP-DPOP simplifies the simplistic assumption of having a single variable per agent."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "The use of declarative programs, especially logic programs, to argue in multi-agent domains is not new. Starting with some pioneering papers (Kowalski and Sadri 1999), several authors have examined the use of several different flavors of logical programming, such as normal logic programs and inductive logic programs, to address collaboration between agents (Kakas et al. 2004; Sadri and Toni 2003; Gelfond and Watson 2007; De Vos et al. 2005). Some proposals have also explored the combination of constraint programming, logic programming, and formalization of multi-agent domains (Dovier et al. 2013; Vlahavas et al. 2010a; Dovier et al. 2010b). Logic programming has been used in modeling multi-agent scenarios that include knowledge of other actors (Baral et al. 2010)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this paper we have the advantages of using logical programmers as a platform to offer complete solutions for DCOPs.
