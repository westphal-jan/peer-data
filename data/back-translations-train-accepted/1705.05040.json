Ideally, however, debates would be won on the merits, as a function of which side has the stronger arguments. We propose a predictive model of debate that estimates the effects of linguistic features and the latent persuasive strengths of different topics, as well as the interactions between the two. Using a dataset of 118 Oxford-style debates, our model's combination of content (as latent topics) and style (as linguistic features) allows us to predict audience-adjudicated winners with 74% accuracy, significantly outperforming linguistic features alone (66%). Our model finds that winning sides employ stronger arguments, and allows us to identify the linguistic features associated with strong or weak arguments.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 00:21:03 GMT  (435kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05040v1", "Accepted by TACL, 14 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by TACL, 14 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lu wang", "nick beauchamp", "sarah shugars", "kechen qin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.05040"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.05040.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Winning on the Merits: The Joint Effects of Content and Style on Debate Outcomes", "authors": ["Lu Wang", "Nick Beauchamp", "Sarah Shugars", "Kechen Qin"], "emails": ["luwang@ccs.neu.edu,", "n.beauchamp@northeastern.edu", "qin.ke@husky.neu.edu", "shugars.s@husky.neu.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Dre eeisrrllllllllllllrrrrrrllllllrrrrrllllrlllrrrrrllllrrrrrrrrllllrrrrrlllrrrrrlllrrrrllrllrlrlrlrrrrrrllrlrlrlrrrrlrlrlrrrlrrlrlrrlrrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrrlrlrlrrlrlrlrlrlrrrlrlrlrlrrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrrrlrlrlrlrrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrrlrlrlrlrlrrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlllrlrlrlrlrllrlllrllllllrrrrrrrllllllllrrrrrrrllllllllrrrrrlllllrrrr"}, {"heading": "2 Data Description", "text": "This study uses transcripts from debates conducted by Intelligence Squared U.S. (IQ2).1 Each debate brings together panels of renowned experts to argue for or against a particular topic before a live audience.

For each linguistic trait, we calculate two versions: one for the full debate and one for the discussion phase. We consider the frequency of words, numbers, named entities per type and each personal pronoun. For example, the use of personal pronouns can imply the communicative goals of the speaker (Brown and Gilman, 1960; Wilson, 1990). We also count the frequency of each individual word used by Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). Sentiment and emotional language use is prevalent for discussions on controversial topics (Wang and Cardie others). We count words of positive and negative sensation based on MPQA lexicon (Wilson, 2005), and words per emotion type of Mohammad and Turney."}, {"heading": "3.4 Topic Strength Inference", "text": "Our goal is to find a mapping that maximizes the strengths that only take into account the strengths, here we discuss how we can transform these functions into the ILP formula.

For details on HTMM, we refer readers to Gruber et al. (2007). HTMM assigns the topics at the sentence level, assuming that each sentence is generated by a topic followed by a word from that topic, with a transitional probability that determines whether each subsequent sentence has the same topic as the previous one or a new creation from the topic distribution. However, unlike the standard HTMM process, we assume that both sides of the debate share the same topics, but may have different distributions of topics that reflect the different strengths of these topics for both sides."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "We test all experiments on leave-one-out. For logistic regression classifiers, we use L2 regularization with a trade-off parameter of 1.0. For Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers and our models, we set the trade-off parameter between training error and margin to 0.01. Really evaluated characteristics are normalized to [0, 1] using linear transformation.Our modified HTMM is executed for each debate on 10 to 20 topics. Topic coherence, measured by Ro \u00bc der et al. (2015), is used to select the number of topics that gives the highest score. On average, there are 13.7 unique topics and approximately 322.0 arguments per debate."}, {"heading": "4.2 Baselines and Comparisons", "text": "We consider two baselines trained with logistic regressions and SVM classifiers: (1) NGRAMS, including unigrams and bigrams, are used as characteristics and (2) AUDIENCE FEEDBACK (applause and laughter) as characteristics according to Zhang et al. (2016)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Results", "text": "For our models, we only show results with latent strength initialization based on the frequency per topic that achieves the best performance. Survey results for different initialization methods are shown and discussed later in this section. As can be seen, our latent variable models outperform non-trivial Baselines8 (bootstrap resampling test, p < 0.05). Our latent variable models also achieve better accuracy than SVMs trained on the same linguistic characteristics. Without audience feedback features, an accuracy of 72.0% results, while SVM can predict a topic strength from the sample by learning the interaction between observed linguistic characteristics and unobserved latent strengths."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "In this section, we first analyze the argument strength of winners and losers, followed by a comparison of these results with human ratings (\u00a7 5.2), then we examine the interactive topic change behavior of debaters (\u00a7 5.3) and analyze the linguistic characteristics that predict the outcome of the debate, especially those that interact with the topic strength (\u00a7 5.4). Results are reported by training our model based on the complete dataset. Initialization of the topic strength is based on the frequency of use, unless otherwise stated."}, {"heading": "5.1 Topic and Argument Usage Analysis", "text": "We start with a basic question: Do winning sides use strong arguments more often? For each side, we calculate the proportion of strong and weak themes, as well as the total number of strong and weak arguments on each page. Figure 2 shows that among all three topic strength initiatives, our model includes a larger number of strong themes for winners than losers. This result is reflected in the human assessment of the topic strength as described in Figure 5.2. Similarly, winners also use significantly stronger individually strong arguments. Interestingly, the C3 constraint indicates that a topic is strong for most pages, but increased accuracy for an initialization case. This indicates that the model has generally been improved by the fact that some themes are strong for both sides."}, {"heading": "5.2 Human Validation of Topic Strength", "text": "We randomly selected 20 debates with a total of 268 topics, followed by arguments from PRO and CON. Note that debate results were not displayed to the commentators. We hired three human commentators who spoke English. Each of them was asked to evaluate the coherence of the topics first by reading the list of words and rating them on a scale of 1-3 (1 as incoherent, 3 as very coherent). If the verdict was coherent (i.e. a 2 or 3), they read the arguments and judged whether (a) both sides are strong on the topic, (b) both sides are weak, (c) pro is strong and con is weak, or (d) con is strong and pro is weather.54.9% of the topics were classified as strong on the topic, (b) both sides are strong on the topic, (c) pro is strong and con is weak."}, {"heading": "5.3 Topic Shifting Behavior Analysis", "text": "Within competing debates, strategy can be quite interactive: one often tries not only to find the best arguments, but to make the opponent better from round to round. Agenda setting or shifting the debate topic is therefore a crucial strategy. An important question, therefore, is: Do debating topics strategically change to topics that benefit themselves and weaken their opponent? According to the HTMM results, debaters make an average of 1.5 thematic shifts per round. Both winning and losing teams are more likely to shift the topic to topics that benefit themselves (61.4% of shifts), although debate losers also try this strategy (53.6% of shifts). A more sophisticated strategy is when debaters also try to disadvantage their opponents by shifting topics. We consider the strength of a current argument both for the speaker (\"themselves\") and for their \"opponent\" as well as for the strength of the following argument. \"The top 3 types of shifts are listed in Table 3."}, {"heading": "5.4 Feature Analysis", "text": "Finally, we examine the linguistic traits associated with issues of varying strengths that affect the audience. Table 4 shows some of the 50 most heavily weighted traits that interact with strong and weak topics. In many previous studies (Brown and Gilman, 1960; Wilson, 1990), it was found that the use of personal pronouns is associated with communicative goals. We find that strong topics are associated with more ego arguments, potentially an indicator of group responsibility (Wilson, 1990). On the other hand, our model shows that weak topics are associated with second-person pronouns, which can either be arguments that attack other debaters or appeal to the audience (Simons and Jones, 2011). In terms of feelings, previous work (Tan et al., 2016) found that convincing arguments are more negative in online discussions. Our model associates negative feelings and anger words with strong topics and neutral and joyful languages with weak topics."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "Previous work on debate and persuasion has examined the dynamics of the audience's response to debates and the rhetorical framework that speakers use (Boydstun et al., 2014). However, this work is limited by the scarcity of data and does not focus on the interactions between content and language usage. Our work complements their work in investigating topic interactions, but brings an additional focus on the latent persuasive power of topics, as well as on strength interactions. (2016) examine various structural and linguistic traits associated with persuasive power on Reddit; they find that some topics correlate more strongly with malleable opinions. Here, we develop a more general model of latent theme forces and the linguistic traits associated with strength."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We present a debate prediction model that learns latently compelling strengths of topics, the linguistic style of arguments, and the interactions between the two. Experiments with predicting debate outcomes suggest that our model outperforms comparisons solely by audience reactions or linguistic traits. Our model also shows that winners use stronger arguments and strategically shift topics to stronger terrain. We also find that strong and weak arguments differ in their use of language in ways that are relevant to different behavioral theories of conviction."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation grant IIS-1566382 and a GPU gift from Nvidia.
