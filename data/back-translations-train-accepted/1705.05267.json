Patient X's latent clinical state (t) at any given time t-R + (t = 0 corresponds to the time of admission to the ward) belongs to a finite space in which the patient can be safely discharged home, i.e. state N is the state of clinical deterioration in which the patient must be admitted to ICU. If the patient is in state 1 or N, his episode will be terminated by clinicians shortly thereafter.

Observable Physiological Data", "text": "The latent clinical state process X (t) of the patient manifests itself in two ways: (1) it modulates the intensity of the sampling of the physiological variables of the patient (informative sampling), and (1) it modulates the residence time by means of a gamma distribution, since it includes, as a special case, memoryless exponential distributions of the Markov models (Liu et al., 2015). (2) it modulates the distribution properties of the observed physiological variables. We capture these two effects by means of a marked point process model for episode E of the patient: The marked point process {(ym, tm)} m \u00b2 N + includes an observation process {tm} m \u00b2 N +, which represents the sampling times of the physiological variables, and a marking process {ym} m \u00b2 N +, which represents the realized physiological variables at these sampling times.

Vital signs include diastolic and systolic blood pressure, Glasgow coma scale, heart rate, eye opening, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation and device support, best motor and verbal responses. Laboratory tests included measurements of chloride, glucose, urea, white blood cells, creatine, hemoglobin, platelet count, potassium, sodium and CO2.

The learned Hawkes process functions for these two states are given by\u03bb (t, 1) = 0.55 patient intensity in 4 clinical states where clinical deterioration (absorbing) is added."}, {"heading": "6. Discussion: Chicken-and-egg", "text": "We emphasize that in calculating our risk score for the test phases, we have not used the information provided in the observation process to infer the clinical condition of patients. This is because the value of the real-time risk score R (t) itself influences the physician's behavior and therefore influences the observation process, creating a chicken-and-egg dilemma in which the causal relationship between the risk score and the physician's assessments cannot be clearly determined. A very interesting direction of research is to consider an observation process that is modulated both by the patient's condition and the real-time risk score by an intensity function (t, X (t), R (t)), in which the algorithm learns the clinical status representation online by sharing experiences with physicians. That is, the algorithm uses the clinical condition assessments to refine the clinical condition model, resulting in a more refined risk score."}, {"heading": "Appendix A: Multitask Gaussian Processes as Vector Autoregressive Models", "text": "To show the equivalence between a multitask GP with a mate \u0301 rn kernel and the continuous-time VAR process (VAR process), we must first of all use the classic discretetime VAR process y (t) in its differential equation form as sequence (t) = e (t) + A1 \u00b7 y (t \u2212 1) +. + Ap \u00b7 y (t \u2212 p), (A1), where e (t) is a white noise vector and Am = [am] ij (t) ij (t) RQ \u00b7 Q is the matrix associated with the mth lag of the process y (t).

In addition, our model captures \u201cinformatively censored\u201d patient episodes by representing the patient\u2019s latent clinical states as an absorbing semi-Markov jump process. The model parameters are learned from offline patient episodes in the electronic health records via an EM-based algorithm. Experiments conducted on a cohort of patients admitted to a major medical center over a 3-year period show that risk prognosis based on our model significantly outperforms the currently deployed medical risk scores and other baseline machine learning algorithms.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
