Temporal Point Process", "text": "A point-of-time process (Cox & Lewis, 2006) is a random process whose realization consists of a list of events located in time, {ti} with ti-R +. Equivalent, a given point-of-time process can be represented as a counting process, N (t), which records the number of events before time. An important method for characterizing point-of-time processes is the conditional intensity function \u03bb (t), a stochastic model for the time of the next event that shows all previous events. Formally, \u03bb (t) dt is the conditional probability of observing an event in a small window [t, t + dt) given the history T (t): = {tk | tk < t} to t, i.e., \u03bb (t) dt: = P {event in [t, t + dt) | T (t)}} = probability (t) = E [dN (t) | T (t)]]] (1), typically assuming that a window is a small one, i.e."}, {"heading": "2.2. Temporal Knowledge Graph representation", "text": "We define a time-limited knowledge graph (TKG) as a multirelational graph with timed edges between arbitrary node pairs and can consider it as a dynamic counterpart to the static knowledge graphs described above. In TKG, each edge between two nodes represents an event in the real world between two entities and the edge type (relationship) the corresponding event type. Furthermore, an edge may or may not exist multiple times (repetition). We do not allow double edges and self-loops in the graph. Therefore, all recurring edges will have different time points and each edge will have different subject and object titles.Given individual entities and nr relationships, we expand the traditional triplet representation for knowledge graphs to introduce the time dimension and represent each fact in TKG as a quadrangular (es, r, eo, t)."}, {"heading": "3. Evolutionary Knowledge Network", "text": "The reasoning power of Know-Evolve rests on three main components of the Evolutionary Knowledge Network: 1. A powerful mathematical tool of the point-of-time process that models the occurrence of a fact; 2. A bilinear relational value that captures multirelational interactions between units and parameterizes the intensity function of the process described above; 3. A novel, deeply recurring network that dynamically and reciprocally learns latent representations of units based on their interactions with other units in multirelational space over time."}, {"heading": "3.1. Temporal Process", "text": "Large temporal knowledge diagrams show highly heterogeneous temporal patterns of events between different units. As these units coevolve nonlinearly, they complement the complex temporal dependencies. Individual epoch-based methods have been widely used to model temporal behavior in different environments with interaction data, but these methods fail to grasp the complex temporal dependencies underlying them. Therefore, we model time as a random variable and use temporal point processes to model the occurrence of factors. Specifically, in the face of a series of observed events O, which correspond to a TKG, we construct a relationship-modulated multidimensional point process to model the occurrence of these events. We characterize this point process with the following conditional intensity function: p, eo r (t | t) = f (ge s, eo r (t))) = f (t (t (t)))), eo (t (t), t), (t), (t), (t), (t), (t), (t), (t), (t), (t), (t), or (t) the event prior to the time (t)."}, {"heading": "3.2. Relational Score Function", "text": "The first term in (3) modulates the intensity function by the relational compatibility score between the entities involved in this specific relationship. Specifically, the score term ges, eor is calculated using a bilinear formulation as follows: ge s, eo r (t) = v es (t \u2212) T \u00b7 Rr \u00b7 ve o (t \u2212) (4), where ve s, ve s \u00b2 Rd represent latent feature embeddings of entities that appear in subject or object position, respectively. Rr \u00b2 Rd \u00b7 d represents a relationship weight matrix that attempts to capture the interaction between two entities in the specific relationship space r. This matrix is unique for each relationship in the dataset and is learned during the training. Rr \u00b2 Rd \u00b7 d represents the time of the current event and t \u2212 represent a time just before time. ve (t \u2212) and veo () \u2212 therefore represent the objects of these vector dynamics before being incorporated into the time."}, {"heading": "3.3.

Understanding Unified View of Know-Evolve", "text": "Figure (2) and Figure (3) show the architecture of the knowledge development framework and a complete step of our model. We offer a summary of all the notations in the appendix. The updates of the entity representations in Equation (5) and (6) are driven by the events related to those entities that make the embedding constant bit by bit, i.e. an entity remains unchanged in the duration between two events affecting that entity and is only updated when an event occurs in its dimension. This is justified because the properties of an entity can only be updated if it forges a relationship with other entities within the diagram. Note that the first term in Equation (5) and (6) already takes external influences into account. After observing an event in due course, Know-Evolve considers it as a fact that generates new knowledge of the entities involved in that event within the diagram."}, {"heading": "4.

GDELT data is collected from April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016 (temporal granularity of 15 minutes); ICEWS data is collected from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 (temporal granularity of 24 hours); both sets of data contain recordings of events involving actors, event-related actions and timestamps of the event; and we use different hierarchies of actions in two sets of data - (top-level 20 relationships for GDELT, while the last level 260 relationships for ICEWS) - to test the diversity of knowledge locations or configurations."}, {"heading": "5.2. Competitors", "text": "We compare the performance of our method with the following methods of relational learning: RESCAL, Neural Tensor Network (NTN), Multiway Neural Network, TransE and TransR. To our knowledge, there are no existing approaches to relational learning that can predict the time for a new fact. Therefore, we have developed two basic methods for assessing time prediction performance: Multidimensional Hawkes Process (MHP): We model dynamic interactions between entities as a multidimensional Hawkes process similar to (Du et al., 2015). Here, an entity pair represents a dimension, and for each pair we collect event sequences on its dimension and train and test on that sequence. Relationships are not modeled in this sequence. Recurring Temporal Point Process (RTPP): We implement a simplified version of RMTPP (Du et al., 2016) in which we do not predict the marker."}, {"heading": "5.3. Evaluation metric", "text": "We report experimental results on two tasks: link prediction and time prediction. Link prediction: Faced with a test quadruple (es, r, eo, t), we replace eo with all entities in the dataset and calculate the conditional density de s, eor = \u03bb es, eo r (t) S es, eor (t) for the resulting quadruplets including soil truth. We then sort the quadruplets in descending order of that density to rank the correct entity for the object position. This procedure can be calculated symmetrically for subject and object. Next, we perform tests after applying the filter techniques described in (Bordes et al., 2013) - we only rank against entities that do not produce real triplets (seen in train) when replacing the basic truth object. We report Mean Average Rank, standard deviation for test samples over the top 10 and HITS @ correctness."}, {"heading": "5.4.

Relational Learning", "text": "Among the various relational learning methods that focus on learning low-dimensional representations of entities and relationships is the performance of the state. Specifically, these methods are embedded in a low-dimensional continuous vector space and an evaluation is made for the fact that is based on different operations of these new representations. To learn these representations, either logistical losses or paired ranking losses must be minimized using stochastic gradient algorithms (Nickel et al., 2016a). Such models can be mainly categorized into two variants: compositional models such as RESCAL or paired ranking losses. Nickel et al., 2011) and Neural Tensor Network Descent Algorithms (Nickel et al., 2013), we use tensor product-specific interactions between entities and relationships that represent a specific weight matrix to explain triplexes."}, {"heading": "6.2. Temporal features in relational models", "text": "Recently (Esteban et al., 2016), the authors proposed a multi-path neural network-based model for the task of event forecasting in event-based relational graphs. In this paper, the authors establish a synergistic relationship between a static knowledge graph and an event set based on this graph, with the knowledge graph providing information about units participating in events and new events, which in turn contribute to improving the knowledge graph. They do not capture the evolving dynamics of units. In addition, they model time as individual points and adopt a time series-based approach that limits the ability to model complex temporal dynamics. (Jiang et al., 2016) suggests a method for time-conscious link forecasting, but they model the dependence of the relationship to time."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "We propose a profound new type of evolutionary knowledge network that can efficiently learn dynamically evolving entity-embeddings and grasp complicated temporal dependencies in a multirelational environment. We demonstrate the evolutionary dynamics of both subjects and object-entities through a deep, recurring neural network that learns from the historical evolution of entity-embeddings in a particular relationship space. We demonstrate the superior performance and high scalability of our method through extensive experiments with large real-world event graphs. Therefore, it confirms the importance of modelling temporal dynamics in dynamically evolving relationship processes. Our model establishes a previously unexplored link between relational processes and time-point processes and it has the potential to open up a new direction of exploration of thinking over time."}, {"heading": "A.

Both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 show that the computational graph will be significantly different for each mini-batch, as the interactions in each window vary greatly. To facilitate efficient training on dynamic computation diagram settings, we use the embedding system proposed in (Dai et al., 2016), which allows us to learn about the graph structure, in which the objective function can have potentially different computation diagrams for each batch. We use Adam Optimizer with gradient cutouts for parameters updates. With the help of the search parameter, we set a minimum parameter for each hynamics parameter."}, {"heading": "D.

The above test event is a new relationship and has never been seen in training. This case is interesting as there are at least 5 different entities in intertwined relationships that make a very challenging test case predictive.

Traditionally, these graphs are considered to be static in nature. However, recent availability of large scale event-based interaction data has given rise to dynamically evolving knowledge graphs that contain temporal information for each edge. Reasoning over time in such graphs is not yet well understood. In this paper, we present a novel deep evolutionary knowledge network architecture to learn entity embeddings that can dynamically and nonlinearly evolve over time. We further propose a multivariate point process framework to model the occurrence of a fact (edge) in continuous time. To facilitate temporal reasoning, the learned embeddings are used to compute relationship score that further parametrizes intensity function of the point process. We demonstrate improved performance over various existing relational learning models on two large scale real-world datasets. Further, our method effectively predicts occurrence or recurrence time of a fact which is novel compared to any prior reasoning approaches in multi-relational setting.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
