This problem arises when users respond only occasionally to a recommendation with a positive rating, and never with a negative one. We study the impact of the probability of a user responding to a recommendation, p_f, on the sample complexity, i.e., the number of ratings required to make `good' recommendations, and ask whether receiving positive and negative ratings, instead of positive ratings only, improves the sample complexity. Both questions arise in the design of recommender systems. We introduce a simple probabilistic user model, and analyze the performance of an online user-based CF algorithm. We prove that after an initial cold start phase, where recommendations are invested in exploring the user's preferences, this algorithm makes---up to a fraction of the recommendations required for updating the user's preferences---perfect recommendations. The number of ratings required for the cold start phase is nearly proportional to 1/p_f, and that for updating the user's preferences is essentially independent of p_f. As a consequence we find that, receiving positive and negative ratings instead of only positive ones improves the number of ratings required for initial exploration by a factor of 1/p_f, which can be significant.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 May 2017 19:37:12 GMT  (2569kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00061v1", "ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.IT math.IT stat.ML", "authors": ["reinhard heckel", "kannan ramchandran"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.00061"}, "pdf": {"name": "1706.00061.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "The Sample Complexity of Online One-Class Collaborative Filtering", "authors": ["Reinhard Heckel", "Kannan Ramchandran"], "emails": ["<heckel@berkeley.edu>."], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

One versus two class CF", "text": "Remember that pf = 1 means that users submit positive and negative ratings and that the user-CF algorithm in pf is nearly optimal. Since the expected number of ratings a user receives in a given number of time steps is proportional to pf, one consequence of our finding is that obtaining positive and negative ratings instead of just positive ratings improves the number of ratings required for initial research by a factor of 1 / pf, which can be significant. Finally, we note that Bresler et al. (2014) provided a performance guarantee for a closely related, collaborative-greedy two-tier CF algorithm that is called collaborative-greedy. Bresler et al. (2014) consider the regime in which the number of users is much greater than the number of items, i.e. N = O (MC), C > 1, and additionally the number of user types obeys (N = M) in the basic theory (1)."}, {"heading": "4.3. Alternative exploration strategies", "text": "While there are other reasonable preference exploration strategies, the essential element of our approach is to divide the article space into subsets of articles Q0, Q1,..., first explore Q0, then allow exploitation steps, continue exploring Q1, allow exploitation steps again, and so on. Instead, when examining the entire article space [M] at the beginning, the learning time required for p-ui to indicate whether an article is likable or not is proportional to M and can therefore be very large. To see this, we consider a preference exploration step that recommends to all users a single element that is uniformly randomly selected from the totality of articles [M]. To ensure that this expectation is greater than 0, Tr must be relevant for assessing whether pui > 1 / 2 is the expected number of u neighbors to which I was recommended, and therefore proportional to Trk M. To ensure that this expectation is greater than the expectation must be set to 0."}, {"heading": "5.

We prove that after an initial cold start phase, where recommendations are invested in exploring the user\u2019s preferences, this algorithm makes\u2014up to a fraction of the recommendations required for updating the user\u2019s preferences\u2014perfect recommendations. The number of ratings required for the cold start phase is nearly proportional to 1/pf , and that for updating the user\u2019s preferences is essentially independent of pf . As a consequence we find that, receiving positive and negative ratings instead of only positive ones improves the number of ratings required for initial exploration by a factor of 1/pf , which can be significant.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
