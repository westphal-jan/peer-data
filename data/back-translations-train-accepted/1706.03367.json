To do this, we allow the right-arc and left-arc transitions to create arcs between each pair of nodes without constraints. If the node already had a previous head as a dependent, the existing attachment is discarded in favor of the new one. This allows the parser to correct erroneous attachments from the past by assigning new heads while still enforcing the single-head constraint, since only the most recent head assigned to each node is kept.To enforce acclimatization, one way would be to maintain the logic of the monotonical algorithm by prohibiting the creation of arcs that would create cycles, making it considerably more difficult to define the individually unreachable arcs that we need to calculate the loss limits used by the dynamic oracle."}, {"heading": "4 Non-Monotonic Approximate Dynamic Oracle", "text": "In order to successfully learn a non-monotonic system, we need a dynamic oracle with error investigation, so that the parser is put into erroneous states and must use non-monotonic transitions to repair them. To achieve this, we modify the dynamic oracle defined by Go-Rodr\u00ed guez and Ferna \u0301 ndez-Gonza \u0301 lez (2015) so that it cannot deal with non-monotonicity. To achieve this, we use an approximate dynamic oracle: due to the additional flexibility added to the algorithm by non-monotonicity, we do not know how to obtain an efficient method of obtaining an exact calculation of the loss of a given configuration. Instead, we use upper or lower words that we show empirically that we are very narrow (less than 1% error in terms of real loss) and are sufficient for better accuracy than monotonical acceptance."}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation of the Loss Bounds", "text": "To determine how narrow the lower limit is | U (c, tG) and the upper limit | U (c, tG) are to the actual loss in the practical scenarios, we use an exhaustive search to calculate the real loss of a given configuration, and then compare it with the limits. This is feasible because the lower and upper limits allow us to trim the search space: If an upper and a lower limit match for a configuration, we already know the loss and do not need to look any further, and if we find the lower limit of one is greater or equal to the upper limit of the other, we can discard the first limit, as it will never result in a smaller loss than the second limit."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "To prove the usefulness of our approach, we implement the static, dynamic monotonous and non-monotonous oracles for the non-projective Covington algorithm and compare their accuracy to nine sets of data from the joint task CoNLL-X4 (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) and all sets from the joint task CoNLL-XI. (Nivre et al., 2007) For the non-monotonous algorithm, we test the three different loss expressions defined in the previous section. We train an average perceptron model for 15 iterations and use the same characteristic patterns for all languages 5, which are detailed in Table 2."}, {"heading": "6.1 Results", "text": "The accuracy achieved by the non-projected Covington parser with the three available oracles is shown in Table 3, in the sense of Unlabeled (UAS) and Labeled Attachment Score (LAS). For the non-monotonic dynamic oracle, three variants are shown, one for each loss expression introduced. As we see, the novel non-monotonic oracle improves through the accuracy of the monotonic version to 14 out of 19 languages (0.32 in UAS on average) with the best loss calculation as | U (c, tG)."}, {"heading": "6.2 Comparison", "text": "To allow a broader contextualization of our approach, Table 4 provides a comparison of the average accuracy and parser speed achieved by some known transition systems with dynamic oracles. Specifically, we include both monotonous (Goldberg and Nivre, 2012) and non-monotonous (Honnibal et al., 2013) versions of the arc-eager parser and the original monotonous Covington system (Go \u0301 mez-Rodr\u00ed guez and Ferna \u0301 ndez-Gonza \u0301 lez, 2015) in this comparison, which were performed with our own implementation so that the comparison is homogeneous. We also report on the published accuracy of the non-projective Attardi algorithm (Go \u0301 mezRodr\u00ed guez et al., 2014) on the nineteen data sets used in our experiments. From Table 4, we can see that our approach achieves the best average speed of the UAS, but the parser setup is slightly slower than the monotonical configuration."}, {"heading": "6.3 Error Analysis", "text": "We also perform some fault analyses to gain insights into how non-monotony improves accuracy over the original Covington parser. Specifically, we note that non-monotony tends to be more advantageous on projective arcs than on non-projective arcs. In addition, the non-monotonous algorithm performs remarkably well on long arcs (which are more prone to error propagation): the average accuracy on arcs longer than 7 goes from 58.41% in the monotonous version to 63.19% in the non-monotonous parser, which may mean that non-monotonics mitigate the effects of error propagation. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of non-monotonous arcs (i.e. those that break a previously generated arc), finding that on average across all the data sets tested, 36.86% of the arc transitions performed were non-monotonic arcs (i.e. those that break a previously generated arc, without breaking gold, without breaking it, without breaking gold)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We presented a novel, completely non-monotonous model of the well-known, non-projective Covington parser, trained with a dynamic oracle. Due to the unpredictability of a non-monotonous scenario, the real loss of any configuration cannot be calculated. To overcome this, we proposed three different loss expressions that tie the loss tightly and allow us to implement a practical, non-monotonous dynamic oracle. On average, our non-monotonous algorithm achieves better performance than the monotonous version, regardless of which of the variants of loss calculation are used. In particular, one of the loss expressions developed proved to be very promising, offering the best average accuracy, although it is the furthest approximation to actual loss. On the other hand, the proposed lower limit makes the non-monotonous oracle the fastest of all the dynamic oracles developed for the non-projective Covington algorithm."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme of the European Union (funding agreement no. 714150 - FASTPARSE), the second author was funded by the MINECO TELEPARES-UDC project (FFI2014-51978-C2-2-R)."}], "references": [{"title": "CoNLL-X shared task on multilingual dependency parsing", "author": ["Sabine Buchholz", "Erwin Marsi."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 10th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL). pages 149\u2013164. http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W06-", "citeRegEx": "Buchholz and Marsi.,? 2006", "shortCiteRegEx": "Buchholz and Marsi.", "year": 2006}, {"title": "A fast and accurate dependency parser using neural networks", "author": ["Danqi Chen", "Christopher Manning."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).
