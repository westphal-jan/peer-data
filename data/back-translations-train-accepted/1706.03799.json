When looking at verb implications, size, weight, strength, and rigidity refer to semantics at the individual level; the relative properties that verbs imply in these dimensions are generally true. On the other hand, speed affects semantics at a level; their implicit relationships hold only during a window surrounding the verb (Carlson, 1977)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Relative physical knowledge", "text": "First, consider the problem of the representation of relative physical knowledge between two objects. We can write a single piece of knowledge such as \"A person is greater than a basketball\" as a person > Size basketballAny statement may have exceptions and counter-examples. Furthermore, we must deal with uncertainties associated with the acquisition of knowledge. Therefore, we assume that each piece of knowledge is associated with a probability distribution.1https: / / uwnlp.github.io / verbphysics / Formally, we define a random variable Oax, y for objects x and y, whose range in relation to a knowledge dimension is \"SIZE, WEIGHT, STRENGTH, RIGIDNESS, SPEED,\" so that: P (Oax, y = r), r {>, <, '.This immediately yields two simple properties: P (Ox, y = >) = P (Oy, x = < P) (Ox) = 1."}, {"heading": "2.3 Physical Implications of Verbs", "text": "Next, let's look at the representation of relative physical implications of actions applied to two objects.

Formally, we define a random variable F av to denote the implication of the action verb v when viewed through its arguments x and y in relation to a knowledge dimension a such that: P (F sizewarf isewarf = > Size y) P (Fwgtwarf y = > Size y): P (\" x threw y threw y \"when applied to its arguments x > wgt y, in relation to a knowledge dimension: P (F sizewarf verbal dimensions of dimensions > =)."}, {"heading": "3 Data and Crowdsourced Knowledge", "text": "Action verbs: We select 50 classes of Levin verbs from both \"alternative classes\" and \"verb classes\" (Levin, 1993), corresponding to about 1100 unique verbs. We sort this list by frequency of occurrence in our frame patterns in the Google syntax Ngrams Corpus (Goldberg and Orwant, 2013), and select the top 100 verbs. Action frames: Figure 2 illustrates examples of action frame relationships. Because we look at implications via paired reasoning relationships for each frame, there are sometimes several frame relationships that we consider for a single frame. To enumerate the action frame relationships for each verb, we use syntactical patterns based on dependence, by extracting the core components (subject, verb, direct object, preposition object) of an action, the subject is assigned to an agent that leads the direct object to a topic, and the prepositional object to a target."}, {"heading": "3.1 Crowdsourcing Knowledge", "text": "We collect human judgments about the implications of framework knowledge, which we use as a small set of seed knowledge (5%), a development set (45%), and a test set (50%).Crowd workers are given a framework template such as \"x threw y\" and are then asked to list a few plausible objects (including humans and animals) for the missing slots (e.g. x and y).This step consists of compressing them to think about the particular template; we do not use the objects they provide. We then ask them to evaluate the general relationship that the frame's arguments have with respect to all knowledge dimensions (size, weight, etc.).For each knowledge dimension or attribute, workers select an answer from (1) x > a, (2) x < a y, (3) x'a y, or (4) no general relationship between the frame and (3) no general relationship. We perform a similar crowdsourcing step for the set of object paths by asking each of the knowledge paths of 36d workers to compare each of the knowledge paths."}, {"heading": "4 Model", "text": "As shown in Figure 3, the graph consists of several substrates (page-wide boxes) corresponding to different knowledge dimensions (illustrated are only three of them - Strength, Size, Weight - in brief).Each substrate consists of two types of subgraph: verb subgraphs and object subgraphs linked by factors that quantify the compatibility of action and object. Linkages between substrates are factors that model interdependencies across different knowledge dimensions. In the following, we describe each graph component."}, {"heading": "4.1 Nodes", "text": "The factor graph contains two types of nodes to capture two classes of knowledge: The first type of nodes are object pair nodes. Each object pair node is a random variable Oax, y, which is the relative strength of an attribute a between objects x and y.The second type of nodes are frame nodes. Each frame node is a random variable F avt. This is the verb v used in a certain type of frame t, and captures the implicit knowledge frame vt along an attribute a. All random variables take on the values {>, <, '}. For an object node Oax, y, the value represents the belief in the relationship between x and y along the attribute a. For a frame node F avt, the value represents the belief in the relationship along the attribute a between any two objects located within the frame vt.We denote the sets of all object pairs and frame variables O or F."}, {"heading": "4.2 Action\u2013Object Compatibility", "text": "The key aspect of our work is to think about two types of knowledge at the same time: the relative knowledge of grounded object pairs and the implications of actions related to these objects. Thus, we connect the verb subgraphs and object subgraphs by selective preference factors between two such nodes, Oax, y and F a vt, when we find evidence from texts suggesting that objects x and y are used in the frame vt. These factors encourage both random variables to agree on the same value. Consider, for example, a node Osizep, b representing the relative size of a person and a basketball, and a node F sizethrewdobj representing the relative size implied by an \"x threw y\" frame. If we find significant evidence in the text that \"[person] threw basketball\" occurs, we would add a selective preference factor to Osizethrewdobj representing the relative size implied by an \"x threw y\" frame.

Verb frame similarity: We add a group of factors between two verbs v and u (to associate a specific frame of v with a corresponding frame of u) based on verb and verb similarities, giving us more evidence of a wider range of frames when textual evidence is spared. Similar to verbs, we add factors that encourage similar pairs of objects to assume the same value, given that each node represents a pair of objects when textual similarity is spared. < f o vsObjekt similarity: As with verbs, we add factors that encourage similar pairs of objects to assume the same value."}, {"heading": "4.4 Cross-Knowledge Correlation", "text": "Some dimensions of knowledge, such as size and weight, have a significant correlation in their implicit relationships.

An example from the development group is \"x contained y.\" While x and y can be real objects, the more abstract senses of \"contained\" could be y as a \"forest fire\" or even a \"revolution.\" In these cases, x > size y as an abstract term is plausible: If a whole can contain a revolution, we might think that a whole could be \"bigger\" or \"stronger\" than the revolution.Error analysis: Examples 6-10 in Figure 4 highlight failures for the model. Example 6 shows a case where the comparison is nonsensical because \"for\" of course a purpose would be pursued (\"he drove the car for work.\") or a duration (\"she drove the car for hours.\") instead of a concrete object, the size of which the car is painted on, the example 7 is the car."}, {"heading": "7 Related work", "text": "Several papers cover the gap between IE, knowledge base completion and learning common sense from texts. Previous work in these areas uses large amounts of text to try to extract general statements such as \"A THING CAN BE READABLE\" (Gordon et al., 2010) and frequencies of events (Gordon and Schubert, 2012). Our work focuses on specific areas of knowledge rather than general statements or event statistics and develops a framework-centric approach to circumventing report distortions (Angeli and Schubert, 2012). Other papers use a knowledge base and scores based on similarity to existing ones (Angeli and Manning, 2013; Li et al., 2016), or expand it by deriving new facts from unstructured texts with natural language inferences (Angeli and Manning, 2014). Zhang et al. (2017) predict the likelihood of deconstructed statements being extracted from a large text corpus."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "We presented a novel interpretation of verb-centric framework semantics to learn implicit physical knowledge latently embedded in verbs.

For example, a statement like, \u201cTyler entered his house\u201d implies that his house is bigger than Tyler. In this paper, we present an approach to infer relative physical knowledge of actions and objects along five dimensions (e.g., size, weight, and strength) from unstructured natural language text. We frame knowledge acquisition as joint inference over two closely related problems: learning (1) relative physical knowledge of object pairs and (2) physical implications of actions when applied to those object pairs. Empirical results demonstrate that it is possible to extract knowledge of actions and objects from language and that joint inference over different types of knowledge improves performance.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
