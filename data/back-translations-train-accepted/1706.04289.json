This paper presents a Bayesian probabilistic approach that incorporates various kinds of node attributes encoded in binary form in relational models with Poisson likelihood. Our method works flexibly with both directed and undirected relational networks. The inference can be done by efficient Gibbs sampling which leverages sparsity of both networks and node attributes.

Analyzed in (Zhou, 2015; Hu et al., 2016b; a), BPL has the appealing property that if yi, j = 0, then xi = 0 with probability one. Thus, only non-zeros must be sampled in Y, which gives huge computational savings for large sparse networks, illustrated in sections 3 and 5.4.The latent matrix X is further factoralized into latent factors with a non-zeros in Y, resulting in huge computational savings for large sparse networks, illustrated in section 5.4.The latent matrix X is further factoralized into latent factors with a non-negative model."}, {"heading": "2.2.

Here, the latent counting matrix X is factored as X-Poi matrix, whereby the attributes of the node are referred to as factor loading matrix or factor score matrix."}, {"heading": "2.3. Incorporating Hierarchical Node Attributes", "text": "Relational networks can be associated with hierarchical ancillary information (Hu et al., 2016a). Suppose, for example, that in a patent citation network, patents can be labeled with the code of the International Patent Classification (IPC), which represents a hierarchy of patent categories and subcategories. Suppose the attributes of the second level are stored in a binary matrix F \u00b2 {0, 1} L \u00b7 M, where M is the number of attributes in the second level. Our models can be used to integrate hierarchical node attributes by a simple extension: Replace the hyperparameter \u00b50 in Equation (6) with \u00b5l, k = Hm \u00b2 f \u00b2 l, m \u00b2 k.

Inference with Gibbs Sampling", "text": "Both Sym-NARM and Asym-NARM enjoy local conjugation, so that the conclusion of all latent variables can be made through closed form Gibbs sampling. In addition, the conclusion only needs to be based on the non-zero entries in Y and F. This section focuses on the sample of hl, k (bk), the key variable in the proposed inclusion of node attributes. The sample of the other latent variables is similar to those in EPM and BGGPF, detailed in (Zhou, 2015; Zhou et al., 2012). Like the sample for hl, k is analogous in Sym-NARM and Asym-NARM, our introduction is based on Asym-NARM alone.With the Poisson-gamma conjugacy, the liquidity, the liquidity for gi, k, k marginalized ti, is: p (gi-NARM), k-NARM onalone.With the poisson-gamma-gamma-gamma-gamma, gamma-gamma-gamma-conjugacy."}, {"heading": "4. Related work", "text": "Compared to models of node attributes such as NMDR and niMlei, whose methods lead to complicated conclusions, our Sym NARM is much more efficient on large sparse networks, as shown in Table 1.The model most closely related to our Asym NARM theme, which also extends the BGGPF algorithm, is SSI-PF. But it uses gamma additivity to construct the state of node factor loads with the sum of attribute factor loads. Our model has several advantages over SSI-PF: (1) Deriving Gibbs sampling from SSI-PF requires that each column of node factor loads be normalized (Eq. (18)), limiting the application of SSI-PF to other models such as EPM, which is an unnormalized model. (2) Represented in Table 1, Asym NARM, superordinate MARM models."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "In this section, we evaluate Sym-NARM and Asym-NARM with a series of link prediction tasks on 10 real relational datasets of different sizes and types of node attributes. We compare our models with current relational models and show that our models outperform competitors on these datasets in terms of link prediction performance and runtime per iteration. To quantitatively analyze the models, we give the average range below the curve of both receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) and precision recall (AUC-PR).

EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS", "text": "For each data set, we varied the training data from 10% to 90% and used the rest in the test. To generate five random splits, we used the code in the EPM package (Zhou, 2015), which splits a network in terms of its nodes. Reported AUC-ROC / PR values were averaged over the five splits. We used the standard hyperparameter settings for EPM, niMM and iMMM contained in the published code. For our Sym NARM, we set the size of \u00b50 = 1 for each data set and all other hyperparameters the same as in EPM. Note that the models are not parametric models in comparison with DMR-MSB. For Sym-NARM and EPM, we set the truncation level large enough for each data set: Kmax = 50, 100, 256 for Lazega-Cowork, Facebook-ego and NIPS12, DIPS12."}, {"heading": "5.1.2. RESULTS", "text": "Overall, our Sym-NARM model performs significantly better than niMM, iMMM and DMR-MMSB on all datasets and EPM on 3 datasets (except Facebook ego with large training portions). Interestingly, the performance of EPM on Facebook ego gradually approaches ours when more than 30% of training data is used. Note that Facebook ego is much denser than the others, meaning that the network information itself may be rich enough for EPM to reconstruct the network and the node attributes to contribute less. However, in general, when relational data is highly incomplete (with less training data), our model can achieve improved link prediction performance. To illustrate how page information helps, we compared our model qualitatively with EPM and node attributes by estimating the link probabilities on NIPS234."}, {"heading": "5.2. Link Prediction on Directed Networks", "text": "Here we compared our Asym-NARM (implemented in MATLAB on top of the BGGPF code) with two models that do not take into account node attributes, BGGPF (Zhou et al., 2012) and iMMM, and three node attributes models, niMM, SSIPF (Hu et al., 2016a) and DMR-MSB. We used the following four datasets: \u2022 Lazega Consulting: This dataset is a directed network with 892 links of consulting relationship between the lawyers.

Kmax was set to 50 for Lazega Consulting and 200 for all three datasets (such as (Hu et al., 2016a). For our Asym NARM, we used a total of 1,500 MCMC iterations and the last 500 samples to calculate the AUC-ROC / PR values.

Running Time", "text": "In this section we compare the runtime of the directional network models (all implemented in MATLAB and running on a desktop with 3.40 GHz CPU and 16 GB RAM), using 80% training data, the runtime for Asym-NARM, SSI-PF and niMM on Aminer with different node attributes is shown in Table 2. Note: DMR-MMSB was not terminated with \"Authors\" and \"All\" due to our computing resources. Asym-NARM is about 10 times faster than SSI-PF with all attributes and about 3https: / / people.cs.umass.edu / mccallum / data.html2 times faster with the designations. Asym-NARM is therefore more efficient, especially with large attributes, which supports complexity analysis in Table 1."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "As a summary of the experiments, Asym / Sym-NARM achieved better link prediction performance with faster inference. While EPM, a non-node attribute model, performed well on nearly complete networks, it deteriorated with less training data. NiMM and DMR-MMSB, extensions to MMSB with the logistical-normal transformation, achieved similar results to Sym-NARM, but scaled inefficiently. SSI-PF was not as good in terms of performance and scalability in the presented cases with flat and hierarchical attributes as Asym-NARM, and it was less effective with a larger number of attributes. Therefore, NARM is a comparatively simple but effective and efficient method of incorporating node attributes, including hierarchical attributes, for relational models with Poisson probability. This results in improved link prediction and matrix completion for less complete data with both our link attributes and with large network input capabilities."}], "references": [{"title": "Gamma process Poisson factorization for joint modeling of network and documents.
