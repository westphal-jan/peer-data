Applications", "text": "The objective functions in these applications are not negative, monotonous and submodular, and are used in our numerical experiments in Section 5.Robust influence maximization. The goal in influencing maximization problem is to find a set of k-nodes (i.e., a targeted set of images) in a network that maximizes a certain amount of influence. For example, this problem appears in viral marketing, where companies want to spread the word of a new product by addressing the most influential individuals in a social network. Due to the poor incentives or dissatisfaction with the product, for example, some of the users of thetargeted set might make the decision not to spread the word about the products. For many of the existing diffusion models used in the literature, we see (Kempe et al, 2003), given the desired number of influenced nodes at the end of the process, we are a diffusion."}, {"heading": "4.

Conclusion", "text": "We have provided a new partitioned rugged (PRO) submodular maximization algorithm that provides a constant factor approximation guarantee for general \u03c4 = o (k), solving an open problem (Orlin et al., 2016). Our algorithm uses a novel partitioning structure with partition walls consisting of buckets of exponentially decreasing size, thus representing a \"robust part\" of size O (\u03c4poly log \u03c4). We have presented a variety of numerical experiments in which PRO exceeds both GREEDY and OSU. A potentially interesting direction for further research is to understand the linear regime in which \u03c4 = \u03b1k applies to some constant \u03b1 (0, 1), and in particular to seek a constant factor guarantee for this regime.

In this paper, we solve a key open problem raised therein, presenting a new Partitioned Robust (PRO) submodular maximization algorithm that achieves the same guarantee for more general \u03c4 = o(k). Our algorithm constructs partitions consisting of buckets with exponentially increasing sizes, and applies standard submodular optimization subroutines on the buckets in order to construct the robust solution. We numerically demonstrate the performance of PRO in data summarization and influence maximization, demonstrating gains over both the greedy algorithm and the algorithm of (Orlin et al., 2016).", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
