Good and A. Turing (Good, 1953), and R.A. Fisher (Fisher et al., 1943), which was quickly followed by (Gut & Toulmin, 1956), which introduced the Good Toulmin Estimator. While the Good Toulmin Estimator is always unbiased, the variance increases rapidly for c \u2265 1.

[Xji] j = 1,..., m i = 1, nj. These are the data we have seen. In the second period, which will take place in the future, we will collect additional tjnj samples from the total population, {Y ji} j = 1, tjnj i = 1, tjnj. The period of two samples is unseen and we would like to estimate some statistical U ({Y ji}, {X j}). We can imagine that tj = 0 as the extrapolation."}, {"heading": "4.

Estimating the multi-population frequency distribution", "text": "While we need to estimate the number of invisible elements in a new sample, it is difficult to find good estimators of other statistics (e.g. number of new elements we have observed) directly from the fingerprints. As discussed in Sec. 3, we can also estimate the less direct approach to the actual underlying multi-population history. In view of an accurate reconstruction of this underlying histogram, we can then estimate any symmetrical statistics of the future samples. We discuss some of the uses of such representation in Section 5.Recovering the frequency distribution The multi-population histograms for restoring the multi-population histograms is a natural extension of the population number presented in Valiant & Valiant (2011; 2013).Estimulation of multi-population histograms: Core Approach."}, {"heading": "6.

Discussion", "text": "We provide a weighted linear estimator for the number of new elements and a general optimization algorithm for estimating the multipopulation histogram. These two approaches have a complementary strength. The weighted linear estimator U-W specifically estimates the number of invisible elements. Its accuracy is independent of the number of populations m, and it is optimal at worst. This can be a good method, especially if m is large and the extrapolation factor is small compared to recording the number of samples observed. However, if the extrapolation is greater, U-W is consistently downward due to its variance-reducing weights. For relatively small populations (m = 2, 3, 4) and larger extrapolation factors, the invisible predictions of our histogram estimators H-count and H-ll are much more precise than U-W. While both probably show comparable performance in the worst case, the linear estimation factors are always larger than the worst case, we consider the worst extrapolative factors."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Gregory Valiant's contributions were supported by NSF CAREER CCF-1351108 and a Sloan Research Fellowship.
