We use a syntax-based DSM to build a prototypical representation of verb-specific roles: for every verb, we extract the most salient second order contexts for each of its roles (i.e. the most salient dimensions of typical role fillers), and then we compute thematic fit as a weighted overlap between the top features of candidate fillers and role prototypes. Our experiments show that our method consistently outperforms a baseline re-implementing a state-of-the-art system, and achieves better or comparable results to those reported in the literature for the other unsupervised systems. Moreover, it provides an explicit representation of the features characterizing verb-specific semantic roles.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Jul 2017 07:51:05 GMT  (208kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05967v1", "9 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, EMNLP, 2017, thematic fit, selectional preference, semantic role, DSMs, Distributional Semantic Models, Vector Space Models, VSMs, cosine, APSyn, similarity, prototype"], ["v2", "Wed, 26 Jul 2017 17:22:54 GMT  (215kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05967v2", "9 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, EMNLP, 2017, thematic fit, selectional preference, semantic role, DSMs, Distributional Semantic Models, Vector Space Models, VSMs, cosine, APSyn, similarity, prototype"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, EMNLP, 2017, thematic fit, selectional preference, semantic role, DSMs, Distributional Semantic Models, Vector Space Models, VSMs, cosine, APSyn, similarity, prototype", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["enrico santus", "emmanuele chersoni", "alessandro lenci", "philippe blache"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.05967"}, "pdf": {"name": "1707.05967.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Measuring Thematic Fit with Distributional Feature Overlap", "authors": ["Enrico Santus", "Emmanuele Chersoni", "Alessandro Lenci", "Philippe Blache"], "emails": ["santus@sutd.edu.sg", "emmanuelechersoni@gmail.com", "alessandro.lenci@unipi.it", "philippe.blache@univ-amu.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In the last two decades, the number of working-age women in Germany has doubled, and the number of working-age men has multiplied in recent years."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Erk et al. (2010) were, to the best of our knowledge, the first authors to measure the correlation between man-made thematic adjustments and the ratings assigned by a syntax-based Distributional Semantic Model (DSM). More specifically, their gold standard consisted of the human judgments proposed by McRae et al. (1998) and Pado. (2007) The plausibility of each individual verb-filler pair was calculated as the similarity between new candidates and previously tested examples of each specific verb-role pairing (as already proposed in Erk). Baroni and Lenci (2010) rated their verb-filter pairs as identical. (ongoing DM) 4 Questionable Questions that represent an approach to the task that occupies a dominant role."}, {"heading": "3 Methodology", "text": "As reported by Sayeed et al. (2016), most work on unattended thematic adaptation estimation varies in the method used to construct the prototypes. (The semantic role prototypes are usually a vector achieved by averaging the most typical fillers, and the plausibility of new fillers depends on their similarity to the prototype evaluated using vector cosines (the standard similarity measurement for DSMs and Pantel (2010))). We argue that this method is not optimal for the characterization of roles. Distribution vectors are typically constructed as contextual representations, and they contextualize different perceptions. By building the prototype as the center of a vector and measuring the thematic fit with vector cosines, the plausibility is inevitably influenced by many contexts that are irrelevant."}, {"heading": "3.1 Typical Fillers", "text": "Following Baroni and Lenci (2010), we weighted the raw coexistence between verbs, syntactic relationships and fillers in DM's typeDM tensor with positive local mutual information (PLMI; Evert (2004)). Taking into account the coexistence number Ovrf of the verb v, a syntactic relationship r and the filler f, we calculated the expected number Evrf under the assumption of statistical independence: PLMI (v, r, f Ev, r, f, f); Ov, r, f (1) From the ranking of (v, r, f) tuples, we selected for each slot the uppermost k-lexeme with the highest PLMI values as typical fillers (see examples in Table 1, Column Typical fillers)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Role Prototype Vectors", "text": "To represent the typical fillers, candidate fillers, and verb-specific role prototypes (obtained by summing up their typical fillers vectors), we built a syntax-based DSM. These include relationships: word contexts, such as sbj: dog, obj: apple, etc. Contexts were weighted with positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI; Church and Hanks (1990), Bullinaria and Levy (2012), Levy et al. (2015). Given a context c and a word w, the PPMI is defined as: PPMI (w, c) = max (PMI (w, c), c), c) = log (P (w, c)) = log (c), the PPMI is defined as follows: PPMI (w, c), c)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Filtering the Contexts", "text": "Filtering the prototype dimensions by syntactical criteria could be useful in improving our role representations. Indeed, it is reasonable to assume that predicates that interact with the typical patients of a verb are more relevant to characterizing its patient role than, say, prepositional supplements, since they correspond with other actions that are typically performed with the same patients. Imagine that apple, pizza, cake, etc. are some of the most prominent fillers for the OBJ slot you need to eat, and that OBJ-1: Slice-v, OBJ-1: Eat-v, SBJ: Kidn, INSTRUMENT: Fork-n, LOCATION: Table-n are some of the most prominent contexts of the prototype. 9 things that are typically sliced and / or devoured are more likely to be good fillers for the patient role, than the things located on a table."}, {"heading": "3.4 Computing the Thematic Fit", "text": "Our hypothesis is that fillers whose alienated vector has a large overlap with the prototype representation should have a high thematic fit accuracy. Such overlap should take into account not only the number of common features, but also their respective ranks in the highlighted vectors. If the prototype has been calculated and the candidate fillers vector has also been sorted, we can measure the weighted overlap by adapting APSyn (Santus et al., 2016a, b, c) to our needs: WO (wx, wy) = \u2211 f (x [1: N] and [1: N]) 1avg (rx (f), ry (f)) (4), with each feature f at the intersection between the uppermost N features of the sorted vectors x, x [1: N] = \u2211 f (x [1: N]) and y [1: N] of the filter sequence = the weighted characteristics of the divided by the candidates."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "We tested our method on three popular data sets for estimating size, namely McRae et al. (1998), Ferretti et al. (2001) and Pado \u0301 (2007). All data sets contain human plausibility judgments for the verb roll filler tripel. McRae and Pado - the results for the role of the agent and the patient, while Ferretti includes instruments and locations (see Table 2 for the coverage of each system for the data sets). Performance is evaluated as the Spearman correlation between the systems and the human plausibility judgments."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "In the first three lines, the table shows the results obtained by us. This baseline is equivalent to the approach of Baroni and Lenci (2010), except for the fact that it is applied to a standard dependency-based DSM and not to TypeDM, which combines dependency compounds and handmade lexico-syntactic patterns: see Section 2.System, which varies the types of dependency contexts (i.e., SO, PREP) and the number of fillers considered for the prototype (i.e., 30 and 50); the other lines each show the results obtained by calculating the vector vectors between the roll prototype vectors (i.e. the vector vectors), adding the most typical fillers without ranking the dimensions) and the candidate filler vectors and ii scores, which are best reported in the overlaid and superimposed scores for the literature."}, {"heading": "5.1 Error Analysis", "text": "We performed an error analysis to verify - for the best settings of WO in each dataset - the correlation between vector cosine and WO values (see Table 5) and the peculiarities of the entries with the strongest and weakest correlation (see Table 4). We also found that WHERE and vector cosine always have a high correlation (i.e. above 0.80), with the highest correlations reported for McRae and Ferretti instruments. Looking at Table 4, we can also find the following: \u2022 the average gold value of the 35 most (4.65) and least (4.56) correlated items is not significantly different from the average gold value calculated on the complete datasets (4.31), meaning that the distribution of probable and unlikely fillers among the best and worst correlated items is similar to that in the datasets (i.e. no distortion can be identified on the full datasets); both are likely to have the same measurement values among the best and worst correlated items (i.e., no distortion can be identified)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced an uncontrolled distribution method for modelling predictor adaptation judgments based exclusively on syntactical information, inspired by cognitive and psycholinguistic insights, which consists of: i) extracting and filtering the most prominent second-order contexts for each verb-specific role, i.e. the most prominent semantic dimensions of typical verb-specific role fillers; and ii) estimating the thematic adaptation as a weighted overlap between the peak characteristics of the candidate fillers and the prototypes. Once tested on some popular datasets of thematic adaptation judgments, our method consistently exceeds a baseline that re-implements the thematic adaptation model of Baroni and Lenci (2010) as a weighted overlap between the peak characteristics of the candidate fillers and the prototypes, and proves to be competitive, it even requires the best performance on the ferreti-based instruments and the second-best fit set."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank the anonymous critics for their helpful suggestions, thanks to the support of the A * MIDEX Fellowship (nANR-11-IDEX0001-02), which is funded by the French government's Investissements d'Avenir programme."}], "references": [{"title": "Incremental Interpretation at Verbs: Restricting the Domain of Subsequent Reference", "author": ["Gerry T.M Altmann", "Yuki Kamide."], "venue": "Cognition 73(3):247 \u2013 264.", "citeRegEx": "Altmann and Kamide.,? 1999", "shortCiteRegEx": "Altmann and Kamide.", "year": 1999}, {"title": "The WaCky wide web: a Collection of Very Large Linguistically Processed Web-crawled Corpora", "author": ["Marco Baroni", "Silvia Bernardini", "Adriano Ferraresi", "Eros Zanchetta."], "venue": "Language Resources and Evaluation 43(3):209\u2013226.", "citeRegEx": "Baroni et al\\.,? 2009", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baroni et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Dont Count, Predict!
