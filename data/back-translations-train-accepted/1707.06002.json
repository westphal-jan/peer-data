However, the gap between theories and everyday reasoning, in understanding what \"argumentative quality\" actually is, remains an open research question (Wachsmuth et al., 2017; Habernal and Gurevych, 2016a) argumentation theories and critical thinking textbooks offer an alternative view of the quality of arguments, namely the notion of fallacies: prototypical arguments or types that pretend to be correct and valid arguments but suffer logically, emotionally or rhetorically."}, {"heading": "2 Background and Related Work", "text": "While Aristotle's legacy in the twentieth century was still palpable, a \"fresh\" glance from Hamblin (1970) showed that the concept of fallacies \"seems valid as arguments but does not\" deserve to be scrutinized. \"3 Theories of fallacies developed in various categories and treatments, ranging from more practical educational approaches (Tindale, 2007; Schiappa and Nordin, 2013) to rhetorical ones in informal logic (Walton, 1995) or pragmatic dialectics (Van Eemeren and Grootendorst, 1987).See for a historical overview of fallacies, e.g. Hansen, 2015).Surprising is the vast majority of current work on fallacies, and especially textbooks that are unlikely to be found in real life."}, {"heading": "3 Argotario: Overview", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have given themselves, and will be able to break the rules they have given themselves."}, {"heading": "4 Gamifying Fallacy Recognition", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want to do."}, {"heading": "5 Benchmarking", "text": "The first study of early versions of Argotario examined the impact of hard feedback and its absence on overall engagement of users in the game. We found that soft feedback did not have a significant negative impact on user experiences8 (Hannemann, 2015).In a subsequent study, we examined player levels using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).We asked workers to play a special version of Argotario (20 and 17 participants, respectively) with the same game configuration, but either with soft or hard feedback; final questionnaire with Likert scale questions; Mann-Whitney-U non-parametric test.Configured version of Argotario to \"win\" 20 points needed to submit HIT. Since the player against the player requires two rounds of dialogue from two users and thus two or more people actively participating in the interpretation over a longer period of time, we should quickly match this naive game for a larger audience with the same unpaid game with the same number of media in 2016."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and Outlook", "text": "Argotario is a serious game that serves several purposes. First, it is a software tool for computer-aided linguistic research, since it focuses on fallacies in argumentative discourse, an important part of qualitative criteria in computer-aided reasoning. Second, it is software that supports learning and education. Its main educational purpose is to raise awareness - not only that fallacies exist, but that they can easily be overlooked and misused in everyday reasoning. Finally, Argotario is also a data collection and annotation tool that applies successful crowdsourced quality estimation techniques. All content is created by users within the game, as opposed to common annotation tools. In the long run, we expect Argotario to provide a viable method of data collection compared to standard crowdsourcing. First, a purely monetary perspective is not always the deciding factor to play additional levels, as demonstrated by ickmhoff Etraal (2012)."}], "references": [{"title": "Designing games with a purpose", "author": ["Luis von Ahn", "Laura Dabbish."], "venue": "Communications of the ACM, 51(8):57.", "citeRegEx": "Ahn and Dabbish.,? 2008", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ahn and Dabbish.", "year": 2008}, {"title": "The Fake, the Flimsy, and the Fallacious: Demarcating Arguments in Real Life", "author": ["Maarten Boudry", "Fabio Paglieri", "Massimo Pigliucci."], "venue": "Argumentation, 29(4):431\u2013456.", "citeRegEx": "Boudry et al\\.,? 2015", "shortCiteRegEx": "Boudry et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Quality through flow and immersion: gamifying crowdsourced relevance assessments", "author": ["Carsten Eickhoff", "Christopher G.

The nonexistence of resources dealing with fallacious argumentation calls for scalable approaches to data acquisition and annotation, for which the serious games methodology offers an appealing, yet unexplored, alternative.
