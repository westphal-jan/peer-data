However, predicate reasoning statistics for word-word pairs (eat, eat) 1 are easy to obtain but not generalize pairs (Agirre and Martinez), but require a disambiguation of words into classes and are limited by the coverage of the lexical resource that such classes provide (e.g. WordNet).Other possible relationship inventories include semantic representations such as FrameNet and roles, event type types, and abstract representations."}, {"heading": "3 Implementation", "text": "We train our model by combining term context pairs from two sources.

After filtering, we obtain approximately 1.4 billion phrase context pairs such as (Titanic, sank @ nsubj) from GigaWord and approximately 12.9 million entity type context pairs such as (/ product / ship, sank @ nsubj) from Wikilinks.

To be effective, a selective preference model (1) should have high coverage so that it can be used for large datasets such as CoNLL, and (2) can be combined with other knowledge sources in a non-linear manner. Our selective preference model slightly improves the performance of the correlation resolution, but given the additional resources required to train the model, it is questionable whether such small improvements are beneficial for solving the correlation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank the three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.
