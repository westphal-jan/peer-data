We have proposed a series of algorithms based on program transformation followed by calls to a response solver. We have conducted an experimental analysis of these algorithms using incoherent ASP competition programs, with analysis of incoherent response set programs being the primary application we envisage for paracoherent response sets. Experiments show that minimizing and columns exceed other tested algorithms, and the results show that calculating a paracoherent response set is not only a theoretical problem, but also a difficult one in practice."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was partially supported by the EU funding agreement H2020 Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie No. 690974 \"MIREL,\" MIUR within the project \"SI-LAB BA2KNOW,\" by MISE within the project \"PIUCultura,\" N.

An ASP program can have no answer set due to cyclic default negation. In this case, it is not possible to draw any conclusion, even if this is not intended. Recently, several paracoherent semantics have been proposed that address this issue, and several potential applications for these semantics have been identified. However, paracoherent semantics have essentially been inapplicable in practice, due to the lack of efficient algorithms and implementations. In this paper, this lack is addressed, and several different algorithms to compute semi-stable and semi-equilibrium models are proposed and implemented into an answer set solving framework. An empirical performance comparison among the new algorithms on benchmarks from ASP competitions is given as well.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
