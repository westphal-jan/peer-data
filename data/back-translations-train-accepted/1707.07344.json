Among event mentions in the same chain, we distinguish within- and cross-document event coreference links by using two distinct pairwise classifiers, trained separately to capture differences in feature distributions of within- and cross-document event clusters. Our event coreference approach alternates between WD and CD clustering and combines arguments from both event clusters after every merge, continuing till no more merge can be made. And then it performs further merging between event chains that are both closely related to a set of other chains of events. Experiments on the ECB+ corpus show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in joint task of WD and CD event coreference resolution.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Jul 2017 20:49:18 GMT  (251kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07344v1", "EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["prafulla kumar choubey", "ruihong huang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.07344"}, "pdf": {"name": "1707.07344.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Event Coreference Resolution by Iteratively Unfolding Inter-dependencies among Events", "authors": ["Prafulla Kumar Choubey", "Ruihong Huang"], "emails": ["huangrh)@tamu.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Various approaches focusing on either WD or CD correlation chains have been proposed for event correlation resolution (most of them in 2016); specific work for WD event correlation includes pair classifiers (Ahn, 2006; Chen et al., 2009) graph-based cluster methods (Chen and Ji, 2009), information propagation (Liu et al., 2014), and markov logical networks Lu et al.

Although it is interesting to understand the influence of false document clusters on event correferences, this algorithm led to perfect document clusters on the ECB + Dataset benchmark (Cybulska and Vossen, 2014b, a), which is consistent with the previous study (Lee et al., 2012) on the associated ECB datasets (Bejan and Harabagiu CD, 2010) 1, which shows that clustering in the ECB document input algorithm of EM documents algorithm (algorithm C) is algorithmic."}, {"heading": "4.2 Iterative WD and CD Merging", "text": "Specifically for WD merges, as described in lines 8-10 of Algorithm 1, we iteratively traverse pairs of clusters that contain a pair.

If the similarity value between the two event mentions is above a matched threshold of 0.6 2, we merge the two clusters.

We then analyzed the effects of characteristics on each type of event linkage by comparing the learned neural net weights for each characteristic. Table 1 shows comparisons of feature weights. We see that the linkage of events within a document is mainly based on Euclidean distance and cosine similarity values, which are calculated using event word characteristics, with an appropriate amount of weight also assigned to overlapping arguments. However, very low weights were assigned to the similarity and distance values calculated using context embedding. In contrast, the classifiers with cross-doc core event characteristics clearly demonstrated the overlapping similarity and overlapping cosmic features."}, {"heading": "5.2 Neural Net Classifiers and Training", "text": "In both WD and CD classifiers we use neural network layers with 60 neurons for embedding event word properties and another layer with 1 neuron for embedding argumentation features.

In addition, the second stage of iterative merging further improves the performance of both WD and CD event correlation resolutions by using the stable interdependence of second-order events. The improvements are consistent when measured using different evaluation metrics of correlation resolution. In addition, our complete model achieved more than 8% improvements over the comparison basis, using the CoNLL F1 score for both WD and CD correlation resolution tasks."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion and Analysis", "text": "The first stage of our algorithm that we are in is able to hide in the position we are in, and in which we are able to be in the position we are in."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We have presented a new approach to resolving event references that takes full advantage of event interdependencies between second-order event references in the same chain and event references in chains.

Our system has proven effective for both WD and CD event references and has surpassed the best event correlation system to date in both tasks.

Among event mentions in the same chain, we distinguish withinand cross-document event coreference links by using two distinct pairwise classifiers, trained separately to capture differences in feature distributions of withinand crossdocument event clusters. Our event coreference approach alternates between WD and CD clustering and combines arguments from both event clusters after every merge, continuing till no more merge can be made. And then it performs further merging between event chains that are both closely related to a set of other chains of events. Experiments on the ECB+ corpus show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in joint task of WD and CD event coreference resolution.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
