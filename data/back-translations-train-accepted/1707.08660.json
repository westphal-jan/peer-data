To evaluate our approach, we adapt the violent armed groups to the embedding of these groups."}, {"heading": "1.1 Contributions", "text": "The most important contributions of this paper are: 1. We show that distributional semantic models, especially word embedding, can be used not only to trace diachronic semantic shifts in words, but also the temporal dynamics of semantic relationships between word pairs. 2. The necessary prerequisites for achieving this task are a gradual updating of the models with new text data (rather than learning from scratch each time new data is added) and a way to expand the vocabulary of the models."}, {"heading": "2 Gold standard data on armed conflicts", "text": "The UCDP / PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset maintained by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program and the Peace Research Institute Oslo is a manual annoted geographical and temporal dataset with information on a state, in the time from 1946 to the present (Gleditsch et al., 2002; Allansson et al., 2017). It encodes conflicts where at least one party is the government of a state. The Armed Conflict Dataset is widely used in statistical and macroeconomic conflict research; however, it has been adapted and introduced into the NLP field, starting with (Kutuzov et al., 2017)."}, {"heading": "3 Predicting armed conflict participants", "text": "In this section we will give a detailed description of our approach, starting with a synchronous example in 3.1 and continuing to a diachronic example for a few years in 3.2.

We applied this approach to the task of predicting armed groups active in specific geographical locations and showed that it clearly exceeds the basics, but it can be used for any kind of semantic relationship. We believe that studying time shifts of such projections can produce interesting results that go far beyond the usual example of \"king is queen as well as man for woman.\" To the best of our knowledge, the behavior of semantic relationships in updated word embedding models has not yet been explored. Our experiments show that the models maintain these \"directions\" and that the predictions learned apply not only to the word pairs known to the original model, but can also be used to predict relationships for the new words."}], "references": [{"title": "Organized violence, 1989\u20132016", "author": ["Marie Allansson", "Erik Melander", "Lotta Themn\u00e9r."], "venue": "Journal of Peace Research, 54(4).", "citeRegEx": "Allansson et al\\.,? 2017", "shortCiteRegEx": "Allansson et al\\.", "year": 2017}, {"title": "On the linearity of semantic change: Investigating meaning variation via dynamic graph models", "author": ["Steffen Eger", "Alexander Mehler."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Pa-", "citeRegEx": "Eger and Mehler.,? 2016", "shortCiteRegEx": "Eger and Mehler.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Armed conflict 1946-2001: A new dataset", "author": ["Nils Petter Gleditsch", "Peter Wallensteen", "Mikael Eriksson", "Margareta Sollenberg", "H\u00e5vard Strand."], "venue": "Journal of Peace Research, 39(5):615\u2013637.", "citeRegEx": "Gleditsch et al\\.,? 2002", "shortCiteRegEx": "Gleditsch et al\\.", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Cultural shift or linguistic drift?
