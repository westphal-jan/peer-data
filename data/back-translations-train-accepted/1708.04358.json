Then, the coordinates are pooled heuristically into dialect regions, based on the lexical choices of users in each region relative to the amount of contrast. This processing is very expensive and time-consuming and relies crucially on knowledge of lexical alternatives a priori. For example, they require a prioritized knowledge of the fact that people in different regions of the US and soda use the same type of drinks."}, {"heading": "3 Model", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Bivariate Gaussian Distribution", "text": "The probability mass function is given by: N (x | \u00b5, \u03a3) = 1 (2\u03c0) 1 | \u03a3 | 1 / 2exp {\u2212 12 (x \u2212 \u00b5) \u03a3 \u2212 1 (x \u2212 \u00b5)}, where \u00b5 is the 2-dimensional mean vector, the matrix \u03a3 = (\u03c31 2 \u03c112\u03c31\u03c32\u03c112\u03c31\u03c32\u03c112\u03c31\u03c32 \u03c32) is the covariance ma-trix and | \u03a3 | is its determination. \u03c31 and \u03c32 are the standard deviations of the two dimensions, and \u03c112 is the covariance. x is a latitude / longitude coordinate whose probability we want to predict."}, {"heading": "3.2 Mixtures of Gaussians", "text": "A mixture of Gaussian distributions is a probability model for representing subpopulations within a global population (K) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 K distributions in which a higher weight with a component Gaussian indicates a stronger association with that component. A Gaussian mixture model's probability mass function results from: P (x) = K \u00b2 k = 1\u03c0kN (\"MDN\"), where Kk = 1 \u03c0k = 1, and the number of components K is a hyper parameter.3.3 Mixing density network (MDN) A mixing density network (\"MDN\") is a latent variable model in which the conditional probability of p (y | x) is modelled as a mixture of K-Gaussian proportions."}, {"heading": "3.4 Mixture Density Network with Shared", "text": "Parameters (MDN-SHARED) In the original MDN model proposed by Bishop (1994), the parameters of the mixture model are separate input functions, which is appropriate when inputs and outputs are directly related, but in the case of geolocation or lexical dialectology, the relationship between inputs and outputs is not so obvious. Consequently, it may be a difficult task for the model to learn all the parameters of each sample correctly. Instead of using the output to predict all parameters, we divide \u00b5 and \u03a3 among all samples as parameters of the output layer and use the input only to predict \u03c0, the mixing probability, using a SoftMax layer. We wine \u00b5 by applying K-mean clusters to the training coordinates and setting each value of \u00b5 to the centering of the K clusters; we randomly initialize Louisiana between 0 and 10. We use the original cost function to distort the weights matrix by dividing the MN and MN models."}, {"heading": "3.5 Continuous Representation of Location", "text": "Gaussian mixtures are usually used as an output layer in neural networks (such as MDN) for inverse regression problems. We extend their application by using them as input representation when the input is a multidimensional continuous variable. Problems such as lexical dialectology are real 2D coordinates, and the goal is to predict dialectology words from a given location. Small differences in longitude and latitude can lead to large shifts in language usage (e.g. in regions such as Switzerland or Gibraltar). A better solution is to use a K component Gaussian compound representation of the place where micro and area indications are divided in the classification, with the significant downside that the model is unable to learn / fine-tune regions on a data-based basis. A better solution is to use a K component Gaussian compound representation of the location where microparameters are then used as input parameters."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "We apply the two described MDN models to two widely used geotagged Twitter datasets for localization and compare the results with state-of-the-art classification and regression baselines.

Each dataset has fixed training, development and test partitions, and a user is represented by the concatenation of his tweets and labeled with the latitude and longitude of the first geotagged tweet.2 GEOTEXT and TWITTER-US cover the continental US with 9k, 449k users. DARE is a dialect term dataset that appears from the dialect dictionary of American Regional English (Cassidy, 1985) by Rahimi et al. DARE consists of dialect regions, terms, and the meaning of each term.4 It represents the aggregation of a number of dialect surveys in different regions of the USA."}, {"heading": "4.2 Geolocation", "text": "We use a three-layer neural network, as shown in Figure 1a, where the input is removed from a user's l2 normalized vocabulary model with stop words, @ - mentions, and words with a document frequency of less than 10. Input is fed into a hidden layer with tanh nonlinearity, which produces the output of the network (without applied nonlinearity). The output is the capture of Gaussian mixing parameters (\u00b5, \u03a3, \u03c0) from MDN. For prediction, the micron of the mixing component is selected, which has the highest probability within the mixing component. In the case of MDN-SHARED, the output is only a vector with size K, but the output layer contains additional global parameters \u00b5 and \u0445lat (\u03c3lat, \u0441lon, \u0441lon, \u043c), which are split between all samples. The negative logic of the optimization of the target layer is used with Adam (2014) and Kingma (Kingma) and Kingma (Kingma) are narrowly matched with the actual one."}, {"heading": "4.3 Lexical Dialectology", "text": "To predict dialect words from a location, we use a 4-layer neural network as shown in Figure 1b. Input is a latitude / longitude coordinate, the first hidden layer is a Gaussian mixture with K components that has a probability distribution across the vocabulary and produces a probability for each component as an activation function, the second hidden layer with tanh nonlinearity captures the association between different Gaussians, and the output is a SoftMax layer that leads to a probability distribution across the vocabulary. For a user label, we use an l1 normalized word set that represents its text content, and use binary tf and idf for weighting terms. The model should learn to predict the probability distribution across the vocabulary and thus be able to determine dialect words with a higher probability than the ratio of words to words."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Geolocation", "text": "The performance of regression, MDN and MDN-SHARED, as well as several state-of-the-art classification models, is shown in Table 2. MDN and MDN-SHARED models perform significantly better than regression and achieve competitive or slightly worse results than the classification models, but offer uncertainty over the entire production area. Geographical error distribution for MDN-SHARED across the development group of TWITTER-US is shown in Figure 3, indicating larger errors in the Midwest and particularly in the North Pacific regions (e.g. Oregon)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Dialectology", "text": "The confusion of the lexical dialect model using Gaussian mixing representation (MDN layer) is 840 for the 54k vocabulary of the TWITTER-US dataset, 1% lower than with a similar network architecture with a tanh hidden layer (tanh layer), which is not a significant improvement. We also evaluated the model using Recall at at k and compared it with the tanh layer model, which in turn competes with tanh layer, but has the advantage of learning dialect regions at the same time. As the DARE dialect regions are not widely used in Twitter, many of the words, despite their size, are not covered in our dataset. However, our model is capable of retrieving dialect regions that are clearly associated with regions."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We proposed a continuous representation of the site using the mix of Gaussians and applied it to geotagged Twitter data in two different settings: (1) geolocation of social media users and (2) lexical dialectology.
