On the other hand, studies of natural logic strive for formal logic, whose formulas come as close as possible to linguistic expressions. Inspired by these research ideas, Muskens (2010) proposed an analytical tableau system for natural logic, in which logic of higher order based on a simple type theory is used as natural logic and a version of the analytical tableau method is developed for it. Later, Abzianidze (2015b, a, 2016a) made the tableau system suitable for far-reaching consideration by extending it and implementing a theorem tester based on it."}, {"heading": "2 Natural Tableau", "text": "A tableau rule has advantages and disadvantages and is therefore often easy to read, e.g. NOT in Figure 3, if no A is a B, then for each entity c, either it is not A or it is not B. A tableau proof, in short a tableau, is often presented as an upward-facing tree with initial formulas at its root (Figure 2). After each rule application, new derived formulas are introduced into the tableau. Depending on the rules applied, the tableau branch can grow or in depth. A tableau branch model is a situation that satisfies all formulas in the branch. Closed branches, marked with x, correspond to conflicting situations."}, {"heading": "3 LLF Generator", "text": "To do this, we implement a module called LLFgen that generates LLFs from syntactical derivatives (see Figure 4).4 Figure 5 shows a CCG derivative, where VP i abbreviates Si\\ NP. LLFs are derived from a CCG tree in three important steps (Figure 4): (i) removing guidelines from CCG trees, (ii) correcting semantically inadequate analyses, and (iii) type-enhancing quantified NPs (QNPs). Below, we briefly describe each of these steps and give corresponding examples.Directionality information in CCG categories and compositional rules is redundant from the perspective."}, {"heading": "4 Natural Logic Theorem Prover", "text": "The Tableau Theorem Prover for Natural Logic (NLogPro) is a core component of LangPro (Figure 1). It is responsible for checking a number of linguistic expressions for consistency. NLogPro consists of four components: The proof engine creates tableau proofs by applying the rules from the set of rules; the rule applications are validated by the properties of lexical terms (encoded in the signature) and lexical knowledge (available in the Knowledge Base)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Signature", "text": "The Signature (DG) lists lexical terms that exhibit algebraic properties relevant to conclusions, such as monotonicity, intersectivity, and implicativity. The lexical terms in the DG have an argument structure in which each argument position is associated with a series of algebraic properties. For example, each in the DG is characterized as [dw, up], meaning that in its first argument each is monotonous downwards, while in the second it is monotonous upwards. Currently, the DG lists about 20 lexical terms, mostly generalized quantifiers (GQs) found in the development data."}, {"heading": "4.2 The Inventory of Rules", "text": "The Rule Inventory (IR) contains all the follow-up rules used by the examiner. Currently, there are about 80 rules in the IR (some of them in Figure 3), about a quarter of which originate from Musken (2010) and the rest are collected manually while the developmental data is being studied. The rules cover a wealth of phenomena, some of which are formal in nature such as Boolean connectivity and monotonicity and other linguistic types. One such rule is (NOn T) in Figure 3, which is a specific version of (NOT). The use of derivative rules results in shorter tablets, passive and adjustment combinations.The IR comprises about 25 derivative rules - the rules that represent abbreviations of several rule applications. One such rule is (NOn T) in Figure 3, which is a specific version of (NOT). The use of derivative rules results in shorter tableau proofs, but raises a problem of implementing the same rule several times."}, {"heading": "4.3 Knowledge Base", "text": "The Knowledge Base (BS) is based on the prolog version of WordNet 3.0 (Fellbaum, 1998). Currently, the KB contains only hyponymy / hypernymia, similarity and antonymic relationships. For convenience, LangPro does not use any sense-of-word disambiguation (WSD), but allows multiple senses of a lexical term. For example, A B iff SynSetA is a hyponym of SynSetB, or there are similar SenseA and SenseB, in which SenseA SynSetA and SenseB SynSetB are used. In the prover, a user can limit the number of senses per word by specifying a cutoff N, i.e. the N-most common senses per word. In addition to the WN relationships, a user can introduce new lexical relationships in the KB as prolog facts, e.g. is _ (quantity, group)."}, {"heading": "4.4 The Proof Engine", "text": "In fact, it is as if most people who are able to play by the rules are able to play by the rules. \u2022 It is as if they are able to play by the rules. \u2022 It is as if they are able to play by the rules. \u2022 It is as if they are able to play by the rules. \u2022 It is as if they are able to play by the rules. \u2022 It is as if they are able to play by the rules. \u2022 It is as if they are able to play by the rules. \u2022 It is as if they are able to play by the rules. \u2022 It is as if they are able to play by the rules. \u2022 It is as if they are able to play by the rules. \u2022 It is as if they are able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "5 LangPro: Natural Language Prover", "text": "In this context, it is worth mentioning that this project is a project, which is primarily a project."}, {"heading": "6 Related work", "text": "Theory testing techniques (Bos and Markert, 2005) or ideas from Natural Logic (MacCartney, 2009) have already been used in the recognition of textual correlations (RTE), but the combination of these two is a novel approach for RTE. The underlying higher order logic of LangPro guarantees sound thinking across multiple premises, including some complex semantic phenomena. This is in contrast to RTE systems that cannot think across multiple premises or cannot take Boolean and quantifier into account, including those inspired by Natural Logic (MacCartney, 2009), and in contrast to those that use FOL representations and cannot cover overarching phenomena such as generalized quantifiers or subsectional adjectives. LangPro achieves state-of-the-art semantic competence (with an accuracy of 87%) on the FraCaS sections commonly used for evaluation (Abzize, S82.8b) of the systems (20161K)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "The presented natural language examiner combines a unique combination of natural logic, higher order logic and tableau method. Its natural logic simplifies the generation of logical forms and makes the examiner relatively easy to scale. By virtue of its higher order virtue, the examiner can easily accommodate complex semantic phenomena that cannot be tamed in the FOL. Due to its high reliability (less than 3% of its entanglement and contradiction judgments are incorrect), the examiner's judgments can be successfully adopted by other RTE systems. Further scaling for longer sentences (e.g. messaging) and automated knowledge acquisition present future challenges for the examiner."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the NWO-VICI scholarship \"Lost in Translation - Found in Meaning\" (288-89-003)."}], "references": [{"title": "A tableau prover for natural logic and language", "author": ["Lasha Abzianidze."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2492\u20132502.
