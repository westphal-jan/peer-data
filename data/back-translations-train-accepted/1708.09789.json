The ability to reliably predict a person's impact may affect events they encounter has a number of potential applications, including monitoring mood and mental health (Isaacs et al., 2013) and getting dialogue assistants to respond appropriately (Bowden et al., 2017). Furthermore, since these narratives are told from a protagonist's perspective, this research could be used to understand other types of protagonist-captured narratives, such as those in fiction. We are interested in the opinions that a protagonist has, not the author per se. This is sometimes referred to as an internal feeling or self-reflexive feeling. While in many situations that are superimposed with the author's opinions, because the author of the protagonist, we are the protagonist."}, {"heading": "2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus", "text": "We begin with a series of first-person narratives (weblogs) drawn from the Spinn3r pattern = 3 person patterns covering a wide range of topics (Burton et al., 2009; Gordon and Swanson, 2009). To reduce noise, we limit blogs to those of known blogging patterns (Ding and Riloff, 2016) and select 15,466 stories ranging in length from 225 to 375 words. To capture these, we need to select a set of 477 positive and 440 negative patterns and use these to boot a larger set of 1,420 negative and 2,288 positive stories. To bootstrap these arguments, we use AutoSlog-TS, a weakly supervised pattern learner that only requires training sets called POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. (Riloff, 1996; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) we use a set of syntactical templates to define different types of linguistic expressions."}, {"heading": "3 Experimental Setup", "text": "It is about the question to what extent it is a way in which people are able to recognize themselves, and whether people are able to identify themselves and understand how to behave. (This means that we can learn the polarity of events in such narratives without them marking the individual sentences.) Our training consists of 46,255 positive and 25,069 negative sentences. Test Set: We create the test sets by selecting 4k random sentences in the first person. We either have explicit sentences in the first person, i.e. we andmy, or start with a progressive verb orpleonastic it."}, {"heading": "4 Results and Analysis", "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "Previous work learns phrase markers of implicit polarity by bootstrapping from large-format text sources, e.g. Vu et al. (2014) learn emotion-specific event types by extracting emotions, pairs of events on Twitter. Li et al. (2014) use Twitter to filter \"significant life events\" and typical responses to these events. Ding and Riloff (2016) extract subverb-obj triples from blog posts. They then use label propaganda to transfer polarity from sentence to event. However, the triples they learn are not focused on ego experiences. They also filter private states from the verbs used to learn their triples, while we have found that verbs referring to private states such as need, desire, and realization are important indicators of ego-affects. Balahur et al. (2012) they use the narratives produced by the EISAR-first person (1986) to extract emotions."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We show that we can learn lexical-functional linguistic patterns that reliably predict ego affects. We constructed a dataset of positive and negative first-person narrator sentences and used them to learn such patterns. We then demonstrated that the performance of current sensation classifiers can be improved by adding these patterns to them. By adding the results of our AutoSlog classifier to existing classifiers, we were able to improve from a baseline of 0.67 to 0.75 macro F with a cascading classifier of NRC, AutoSlog and SVM. Furthermore, we analyze the linguistic functions that suggest positivity and negativity for the first-person narrator, and show that they are very different. In first-person narratives, positivity is often signaled by active participation in events, while negativity involves private states. In the future, we plan to integrate these observations into mood resources such as the Lexicon + Effect and Choice."}], "references": [{"title": "Verb classes as evaluativity functor classes", "author": ["Pranav Anand", "Kevin Reschke."], "venue": "Proceedings of Verb pages 98\u2013103.", "citeRegEx": "Anand and Reschke.,? 2010", "shortCiteRegEx": "Anand and Reschke.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Building and exploiting emotinet, a knowledge base for emotion detection based on the appraisal theory model", "author": ["Alexandra Balahur", "Jesus M.

People blogging about their day tend not to explicitly say I am happy. Instead they describe situations from which other humans can readily infer their affective reactions. However current sentiment dictionaries are missing much of the information needed to make similar inferences. We build on recent work that models affect in terms of lexical predicate functions and affect on the predicate\u2019s arguments. We present a method to learn proxies for these functions from firstperson narratives. We construct a novel fine-grained test set, and show that the patterns we learn improve our ability to predict first-person affective reactions to everyday events, from a Stanford sentiment baseline of .67F to .75F.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
