Therefore, a lot of research has been spent in improving its accuracy. Off-the-shelf tools, however, are: i) complicated to use and ii) domain/dialect dependent. We explore three language-independent alternatives to morphological segmentation using: i) data-driven sub-word units, ii) characters as a unit of learning, and iii) word embeddings learned using a character CNN (Convolution Neural Network). On the tasks of Machine Translation and POS tagging, we found these methods to achieve close to, and occasionally surpass state-of-the-art performance. In our analysis, we show that a neural machine translation system is sensitive to the ratio of source and target tokens, and a ratio close to 1 or greater, gives optimal performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 2 Sep 2017 18:45:48 GMT  (869kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00616v1", "ACL 2017 pages 7"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017 pages 7", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hassan sajjad", "fahim dalvi", "nadir durrani", "ahmed abdelali", "yonatan belinkov", "stephan vogel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1709.00616"}, "pdf": {"name": "1709.00616.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Challenging Language-Dependent Segmentation for Arabic: An Application to Machine Translation and Part-of-Speech Tagging", "authors": ["Hassan Sajjad", "Fahim Dalvi", "Nadir Durrani", "Ahmed Abdelali", "Yonatan Belinkov", "Stephan Vogel"], "emails": ["svogel}@qf.org.qa", "belinkov@mit.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In recent years, it has been shown that the quality of the word has improved significantly in NLP tasks such as machine translation (Habash and Sadat, 2006; Almahairi et al., 2016), and that the processing of language (Diab et al., 2004; Habash and Rambow, 2005) and the retrieval of information (M. Aljlayl and Grossman, 2002) is considerable. A considerable amount of research has therefore been devoted to morphological segmentation over the past two decades, ranging from rule-based analyzers (Beesley, 1996) to statistical segments (Pasha et al, 2014; Abdelali et al., 2016; Khalifa et al.) Morphological segmentation splits words into morphemes. For example, \"wktAbnA JK.\""}, {"heading": "2 Segmentation Approaches", "text": "We experimented with three data-driven segmentation schemes: i) morphological segmentation, ii) subword segmentation based on BPE, and iii) two variants of character-based segmentation. First, we map each source word to the corresponding segments (depending on the segmentation scheme), embed all segments of a word into the vector space, and feed them one by one to an encoder decoder model. See Figure 1 for illustration."}, {"heading": "2.1 Morphological Segmentation", "text": "There is a lot of work to be done on the statistical segmentation of Arabic. Here we use the modern Arabic segmentator MADAMIRA and Farasa as the basis. MADAMIRA includes a morphological analyzer that creates a list of possible analyses at the word level (regardless of the context), and the analyses are provided with the original text of a feature modeling component that uses an SVM and a language model to make predictions that are evaluated by an analysis ranking component. Farasa, on the other hand, is a lightweight segmentator that ignores the context and instead uses a variety of attributes and lexicographs for segmentation."}, {"heading": "2.2 Data Driven Sub-word Units", "text": "A number of data-based approaches have been proposed that learn to segment words into smaller units based on data (Demberg, 2007; Sami Virpioja and Kurimo, 2013) and to improve phrase compression (Fishel and Kirik, 2010; Stallard et al., 2012). Recently, with the advent of neural MT, some subword-based techniques have been proposed that segment words into smaller units to address limited vocabulary and unknown word problems (Sennrich et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016). In this paper, we investigate Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), a data compression algorithm (Gage, 1994) as an alternative to morphological segmentation of Arabic. BPE splits words into symbols (a sequence of symbols) and then iteratively replaces the most common symbols by their merged variants. Essentially, frequent sequences of n symbols are merged into one."}, {"heading": "2.3 Character-level Encoding", "text": "Character-based models have proven effective in translating closely related language pairs (Durrani et al., 2010; Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012) and OOV words (Durrani et al., 2014). Ling et al. (2016) used character embeddings to solve the OOV word problem. We examined them as an alternative to morphological segmentation. Their advantage is that character embeddings do not require complicated pre-processing and post-processing steps, except for segmenting words into characters. The full character encoder treats the source sentence as a letter sequence and encodes each letter (including white space) in the LSTM encoder (see Figure 1). Decoding can follow identical settings. We limited word embeddings to the Arabic side of the parallel corpus and use words for the English side."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "In the following, we describe the data and system settings and later present the results of machine translation and POS marking."}, {"heading": "3.1 Settings", "text": "Data The MT systems were trained to 1.2 million sets, a concatenation of TED corpus (Cettolo et al., 2012), LDC NEWS data, QED (Guzma \u0301 n et al., 2013) and an MML-filtered (Axelrod et al., 2011) UN corpus.1 We used dev + test10 for tuning and tst11-14 for testing. For English Arabic, the results were detokenized using the MADA detokenizer. Before we achieved the results, we normalized them and reference translations using the QCRI normalizer (Sajjad et al., 2013).POS tagging We used Parts 2-3 (v3.1-2) of the Arabic Treebank (Mohamed Maamouri, 2010). Data consisted of 18268 sets (483,909 words).

In machine translation, BPE segmentation delivered the best results and even outperformed modern morphological segmentation in Arabic-English. In POS tagging, character-based models came closest to using modern segmentation. Our results showed that data-driven segmentation schemes serve as an alternative to highly developed language-dependent tools and can achieve very competitive results. In our analysis, we showed that NMT performs better when the source-target-token ratio is close to one or greater."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank the three anonymous reviewers for their useful suggestions.

Therefore, a lot of research has been spent in improving its accuracy. Off-the-shelf tools, however, are: i) complicated to use and ii) domain/dialect dependent. We explore three language-independent alternatives to morphological segmentation using: i) data-driven sub-word units, ii) characters as a unit of learning, and iii) word embeddings learned using a character CNN (Convolution Neural Network). On the tasks of Machine Translation and POS tagging, we found these methods to achieve close to, and occasionally surpass state-of-the-art performance. In our analysis, we show that a neural machine translation system is sensitive to the ratio of source and target tokens, and a ratio close to 1 or greater, gives optimal performance.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
