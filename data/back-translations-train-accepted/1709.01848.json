In this work, we present a neural framework for supporting and studying users in both types of communities. We propose methods for identifying posts in support communities that may indicate a risk of self-harm, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong previously proposed methods for identifying such posts. Self-harm is closely related to depression, which makes identifying depressed users on general forums a crucial related task. We introduce a large-scale general forum dataset (\"RSDD\") consisting of users with self-reported depression diagnoses matched with control users. We show how our method can be applied to effectively identify depressed users from their use of language alone. We demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines on this general forum dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 14:50:42 GMT  (103kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01848v1", "Expanded version of EMNLP17 paper.

We propose models based on this architecture to perform two tasks in the areas of social media and mental health, which we call Selfharm Risk Classification and Detection of Depression. The task of Selfharm Risk Classification is to assess a user's current risk of self-harm in light of his or her contribution to a mental health support forum and previous posts in this thread. The task of identifying depression in users is to identify Reddit users with self-reported depression diagnoses based on a user's post history (with the exception of posts containing mental health keywords or being published in mental health subreddits). While both tasks focus on predicting a user's mental health status, they differ in both the type of classification performed (i.e. assessing severity on a four-point scale versus the general text classification) and in the two-step process of identifying each user (1)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Shared Architecture", "text": "Our proposed models share one or more entries as input, process the entries with a conventional layer to identify the characteristics contained in the text windows, merge the characteristics into a vector representation of the user's activity, and use a series of dense layers to perform the classification; the type of merge is performed as a loss function using both methods, but also the experiments with other loss functions are performed in the following section.

Each twisted network performs an average pooling to generate its output. These pool representations are then merged with a second twisted layer to create a user representation; we found that this approach resulted in more stable performance than the use of a second average pooling or max pooling layer. The user representation generated by the merge step is then passed to one or more dense layers before being passed on to a dense output layer with a Softmax classification activation function. The number of dense layers used is a hyperparameter described in \u00a7 5. The categorical transverse entropy is used as the loss function of the model."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Self-harm risk assessment", "text": "Our self-harm risk classification model uses two inputs: the target post that is classified and the previous posts (if any) in the target thread. Previous posts provide context and are therefore useful for assessing the self-harm risk that is present in the target post. These two inputs are both processed by a Convolutionary Network as in the user-level classification, but in this case the results of the Convolutionary Network are merged by linking them together. \u2212 The merged representation is then passed on to one or more denser layers and to an output layer.

To do this, we train the CNN-R model as described in paragraph 5.1 and report F1 on the validation set. If npost is varied, we set nterm = 100 and if nterm is varied, we set npost = 1500. As shown in Figure 3, the best performance of the CNN-R model is achieved by taking 100 terms into account in posts and up to 1750 posts per user. F1 increases with the increase of npost to the maximum tested value of 1750 (Figure 3a). There is relatively little change in F1 from npost = 1250 to npost = 1750, so in our experiments we use npost = 1500 for efficiency reasons. As shown in Figure 4a, approximately 20% of users have more than 1500 posts. The effect of the maximum length of posts is not uniform (Figure 3b) but the performance is maximized to 100% in Figure 3b."}, {"heading": "6.2 Post selection", "text": "For users with more than the maximum number of npost posts, a post selection strategy determines which posts will be used as input into the model. Table 5 shows the impact of the post selection strategy on the validation set of the Reddit record. Selecting the earliest posts of a user leads to the worst results regardless of the value of npost, although the differences in F1 are smaller if npost = 400. Random selection of posts for each user produces the best results across all metrics at npost = 1500, significantly increasing precision in selecting the earliest posts of users and a small increase in selecting the last posts of users."}, {"heading": "6.3 Phrases contributing to classification", "text": "In this section, we analyze the language that has greatly contributed to the identification of depressed users in the Reddit dataset. Unfortunately, it is impossible to show entire Reddit posts without compromising the anonymity of users; we have found that even if a post is paraphrased, there is enough information left to easily identify it with the help of a web search engine. For example, a Reddit post that greatly contributed to the author's classification as a depressive user included the mention of a certain type of abuse and several comments that are vaguely related to this type of abuse. We tried to paraphrase this post, but found that any paraphrase that included generic language in both the nature of the abuse and the user's comments was sufficient to identify the user. So, in order to protect the anonymity of the users in our dataset, we do not publish posts in any form. Instead of publishing posts, we identify key phrases in posts that have been identified by users who have been correctly identified as depressed."}, {"heading": "6.4 CLPsych \u201917 shared task", "text": "In this section, we report on the results of the 2017 CLPsych workshop on the classification of self-harm risk as a task. 7 While CLPsych '17 performed the same self-harm risk classification task as CLPsych' 16 (\u00a7 5.3), new test data was used to perform the evaluation, providing the opportunity to further evaluate our model for the task of self-harm risk assessment and perform a fault analysis, which was configured and evaluated in Table 7.

Self-harm is closely related to depression, which makes identifying depressed users on general forums a crucial related task. We introduce a large-scale general forum dataset (\u201cRSDD\u201d) consisting of users with selfreported depression diagnoses matched with control users. We show how our method can be applied to effectively identify depressed users from their use of language alone. We demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines on this general forum dataset.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
