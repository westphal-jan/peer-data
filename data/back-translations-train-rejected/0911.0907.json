But prior to recognition, it is necessary to segment the character from the text to sentences, words etc. Segmentation of words into individual letters has been one of the major problems in handwriting recognition. Despite several successful works all over the work, development of such tools in specific languages is still an ongoing process especially in the Indian context. This work explores the application of ANN as an aid to segmentation of handwritten characters in Assamese- an important language in the North Eastern part of India. The work explores the performance difference obtained in applying an ANN-based dynamic segmentation algorithm compared to projection- based static segmentation. The algorithm involves, first training of an ANN with individual handwritten characters recorded from different individuals. Handwritten sentences are separated out from text using a static segmentation method. From the segmented line, individual characters are separated out by first over segmenting the entire line. Each of the segments thus obtained, next, is fed to the trained ANN. The point of segmentation at which the ANN recognizes a segment or a combination of several segments to be similar to a handwritten character, a segmentation boundary for the character is assumed to exist and segmentation performed. The segmented character is next compared to the best available match and the segmentation boundary confirmed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Nov 2009 18:32:08 GMT  (529kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0907v1", "International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Volume 5, pp9-16, October 2009"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Volume 5, pp9-16, October 2009", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kaustubh bhattacharyya", "kandarpa kumar sarma"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.0907"}, "pdf": {"name": "0911.0907.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "ANN-based Innovative Segmentation Method for Handwritten text in Assamese", "authors": ["Kaustubh Bhattacharyya", "Kandarpa Kumar Sarma"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

MLP is trained to do this. The algorithm involves the first training of an ANN with individual handwritten characters extracted by different individuals. Handwritten sentences are separated from the text using a static segmentation method. First, the individual characters are separated from the segmentation line by segmenting the entire line. Before all these steps, some pre-processing steps are required for the scanned image. 3. Parts: Noise removal: It is about removing noise by certain filter operations. 2. Magnification: Here, the filtered images are enhanced by certain high-boost filter and histogram compensation techniques. 3. Parts: For degraded or blurred images after noise cleaning operations, the image can be sharpened and the line can be improved. 4."}, {"heading": "1.

In certain cases, the character spacing is not uniform after the headers are removed. Base line spacing is then comparable to word spacing. This affects word spacing, as described in such a situation morphological disposition in [14]. In this case, modifiers are not separated from characters, especially in the case where modifiers are below the middle zone."}, {"heading": "4. ANN Based Segmentation", "text": "The aforementioned persons were taken into custody by the police and taken into custody."}, {"heading": "5. Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "The paper provides an insight into the development of a segmentation system for Assam fonts using ANN. The work focuses on improving the performance of the segmentation level in handling handwritten input with the aim of supporting a character recognition system. It handles well-contactless handwritten characters and even partially contactless characters, but fails to address styles in which characters are tilted and touch each other. Further development of the system can be a stage in which the system can handle the touch of handwritten characters. The advantage of such a system is that it improves the performance of segmentation, which is so important in an OCR system. ANN, which is trained with different character shapes, can be used as a decision tool in selecting segmentation boundaries. As the segmentation boundary is set dynamically, the system can effectively deal with segmentation problems that are caused by induced character variations in size and size."}, {"heading": "6.
