Introduction", "text": "In many practical problems, the data does not reveal itself at the beginning, but comes in an online way. In considering a request, the vendor must make an irrevocable decision whether to accept or reject the current offer with the overall goal of maximizing sales while satisfying resource constraints. Similarly, the Network Capacity Manager receives a sequence of requests from users intending to use the network, and its goal is to maximize network capacity. A similar format also appears in online keyword matching problems, and various other problems of online revenue management and resource allocation."}, {"heading": "1.1. Specific applications", "text": "The following are some specific applications of the linear online programming model. Examples are only a few among the wide range of applications of this model. (1) The one-dimensional version of the linear online programming problem investigated in this paper is usually referred to as an online knapsack or secretary problem. In such problems, a decision maker is faced with a sequence of options, each with a specific price and value, and he must select a subset of them in an online manner to maximize the overall value without violating cost constraints. Applications of this problem arise in many contexts, such as hiring workers, job planning, and bidding in sponsored search auctions. Random permutation model has been widely included in the study of this problem, see Kleinberg (2005) and Babaioff et al al (2007) and references thereafter. In these papers, either a consistent competitive relationship is suggested for this problem or a near-optimal algorithm for this problem."}, {"heading": "1.2. Key ideas and main results", "text": "The main contribution of this paper is to propose an algorithm that solves the linear online programming problem with a near-optimal competitive ratio under the random permutation model. (Our algorithm is based on the observation that the optimal solution for the linear offline program can be determined largely by the optimal dual solution p-Rm, which corresponds to the m imbalance constraints.) The optimal dual solution functions as a threshold, so that our algorithm only works if it learns a threshold price vector from some initial inputs, and then uses the price vector to determine decisions for later periods. (Instead of calculating the price vector only once, our algorithm waits steps or arrivals, and then calculates a new price vector each time, i.e. it doubles, 2o, 4o n, and so on."}, {"heading": "1.3. Related work", "text": "The design and analysis of online algorithms is a topic of wide interest in the competitive improvement of science, operations research and management science communities. Although the rating permutation model has recently gained increasing popularity as it avoids the pessimistic lower limits of the competing input model, the online matching and adwords problem is (Devanur and Hayes (2009), Feldman et al.

Organization", "text": "The rest of the work is organized as follows: In sections 2 and 3, we present our online algorithm and prove that it achieves a competitive ratio of 1 \u2212 O on the input under mild conditions. In order to follow the discussions clearly and easily, we begin in section 2 with a simpler one-time learning algorithm. While the analysis of this simpler algorithm will be useful to demonstrate our evidential techniques, the results obtained in this environment are weaker than those obtained by our dynamic learning algorithm discussed in section 3. In section 4, we provide detailed evidence for theorem 2 regarding the need for a condition with lower limits used in our main theorem. In section 5, we present several extensions of our study. Then, we conclude our work in section 6."}, {"heading": "2. One-time Learning Algorithm", "text": "In this section we propose a unique learning algorithm for the linear online programming problem. We will consider the following linear subprogram, which is defined only at input, until the time s = 1 aitxt (for the simplicity of notation, without loss of generality, we assume that this number is an integer in our analysis): maximize the competitive value st = 1 aitxt until the time s = 1 aitxt \u2264 1,..., m 0 \u2264 xt \u2264 xt \u2264 xt \u2264 xt 1, t = 1,.., s, (7) and its dual problem: minimize m i = 1 aitxt \u2264 (1 \u2212 2) snbipi + 0 yt subject to the trick mi = 1 aitpi + yt \u2265 0, t = 1,."}, {"heading": "2.1. Competitive Ratio Analysis", "text": "Note that the unique learning algorithm awaits the following simplistic technical issues in our general discussion, and then sets the solution to time t like xt (p), unless it violates the limitations. To prove its competitiveness, we follow the following steps: First, we show that if p \u00b2 is the optimal dual solution for (1), then {xt (p \u00b2)} is close to the primary optimal solution x \u00b2, i.e. learning the dual price is sufficient to determine a near primary solution. However, since the columns are revealed online, we cannot get p \u00b2 s during the decision period. Instead, we use p \u00b2 in our algorithm as a substitute. We then show that p \u00b2 is a good substitute for p \u00b2. With a high probability, xt (p) meets all the limitations of the linear program; 2) the expected value of the p \u00b2 solution (p \u00b2) is close to the optimal offline value."}, {"heading": "3. Dynamic Learning Algorithm", "text": "The algorithm discussed in Section 2 uses the first inputs to learn a threshold price, and then applies it in the remaining time horizon. While this algorithm has its own merits, it requires in particular the solution of a small linear program defined on the basis of variables, the lower limit required on B is stronger than that which is doubled in Theorem 1 by a factor. In this section, we propose an improved dynamic learning algorithm that will achieve the result in Theorem 1. Instead of calculating the price only once, the dynamic learning algorithm will update the price every time the story doubles, that is, it will learn to give a new price.Note: n, 2\u0445n, 4\u0445n,. To be precise, let p define the optimal dual solution for the following partial linear program defined on the inputs until the time is defined: maximize that the deviation from the time is defined as \u0445n, An\u0445n is given a new time, 4\u0445n is given:"}, {"heading": "3.1. Competitive Ratio Analysis", "text": "The analysis for the dynamic learning algorithm proceeds in a similar way to that for the unique learning algorithm (= > Ps = = 1).

We will prove this by constructing an instance of (1) with m elements and B elements of each element in such a way that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio of 1-2 (except B-2). In this construction we will refer to the 0-1 vectors as demand vectors and as profit coefficients. Assume m = 2z for some integers e.g. We will construct z pairs of need vectors in each pair in such a way that the need vectors in each pair complement each other and not item.However, each set of z vectors consisting of exactly one vector of each pair is at least one common element.

Online integer programs", "text": "From the definition of xt (p) in (9), our algorithm always outputs integer solutions. Since the analysis of the competitive relationship compares the online solution with the optimal solution of the corresponding linear programming relaxation, the competitive relationship given in Theorem 1 also applies to the online integer programs.

Fast solution for large linear programs by column sampling", "text": "Apart from online problems, our algorithm can also be used to solve (offline) linear programs that are too large to explicitly include all variables. Similar to the unique online learning solution, one could randomly select a selection of variables and for this smaller program use the dual solution p \u0442 to set the values of the variables xj as xj (p) This approach is very similar to the method of column generation used to solve large linear programs Dantzig (1963). Our result provides the first rigorous analysis of the approximation achieved by the approach of reducing linear program size by randomly selecting a subset of columns."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we provide a competitive 1-O algorithm for a general class of linear online programming problems, assuming a random order of arrival and mild conditioning of input on the right. The conditions we use are independent of the optimal objective value, objective coefficients and distribution of input data. Our dynamic learning algorithm works by dynamically updating a threshold price vector in atgeometric time intervals, in which the dual prices we have learned from the uncovered columns in the previous column are used to determine sequential decisions in the current period. Our dynamic learning approach could be useful to design online algorithms for other problems. There are many questions for future research. An important question is whether the current evolution of the size of input on the right is narrow? Currently, as we show in this paper, there is a gap between our algorithm and the lower limit."}, {"heading": "Appendix A: Supporting lemmas for Section 2", "text": "A.1.

On the other hand, although a priori input distribution can simplify the problem to a great extent, the choice of distribution is very critical and the performance can suffer if the actual input distribution is not as assumed. Specifically, Assumption 1 is weaker than assuming the columns are drawn independently from some (possibly unknown) distribution. Indeed, one can view n i.i.d. columns as first drawing n samples from the underlying distribution and then randomly permute them. Therefore, our proposed algorithm and its performance would also apply if the input data is drawn i.i.d. from some distribution.

Specific applications In the following, we show some specific applications of the online linear programming model. The examples are only a few among the wide range of applications of this model. 1.1.1. Online knapsack/secretary problem The one dimensional version of the online linear programming problem studied in this paper is usually referred as online knapsack or secretary problem. In such problems, a decision maker faces a sequence of options, each with a certain cost and a value, and he has to choose a subset of them in an online fashion so as to maximize the total value without violating the cost constraint. Applications of this problem arise in many contexts, such as hiring workers, scheduling jobs and bidding in sponsored search auctions.

In this paper, we study an extension of this problem to higher dimension and propose a near-optimal algorithm for it. 1.1.2. Online routing problem Consider a computer network connected by m edges, each edge i has a bounded capacity (bandwidth) bi.
