Authentication is a challenging issue in order to guarantee the security of use of collaborative systems during the access control step. Many solutions exist in the state of the art such as the use of one time passwords or smart-cards. We focus in this paper on biometric based solutions that do not necessitate any additional sensor. Keystroke dynamics is an interesting solution as it uses only the keyboard and is invisible for users. Many methods have been published in this field. We make a comparative study of many of them considering the operational constraints of use for collaborative systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Nov 2009 13:35:40 GMT  (214kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3304v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["romain giot", "mohamad el-abed", "christophe rosenberger"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.3304"}, "pdf": {"name": "0911.3304.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Keystroke Dynamics Authentication For Collaborative Systems", "authors": ["Romain Giot", "Mohamad El-Abed", "Christophe Rosenberger"], "emails": ["romain.giot@ensicaen.fr,"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, the fact is that most people who are able to survive themselves are able to survive themselves, in the way they do it, in the way they do it, in the way they do it, in the way they do it, in the way they do it, in the way they do it, in the way they do it."}, {"heading": "2. STATE OF THE ART", "text": "The research on keystroke dynamics began more than twenty years ago. In [7], authors have done the first work of our knowledge on keystroke dynamics authentication, showing that keystroke dynamics, as well as signature dynamics, can characterize a user. This study was conducted by a database consisting of the work of seven secretaries who were asked to type three pages of text. It is easy to see that this approach is not a real operational solution for collaborative applications (no one would agree to type such a large amount of data), but many improvements have been made since then."}, {"heading": "2.1. Main Approaches", "text": "The main scheme for keystroke dynamics is illustrated in Figure 1: (i) the registration (which consists of the registration of the user in the system) embeds the data acquisition, possibly some data filtering, the extraction of functions and the learning step; (ii) the verification process implements the data acquisition, the extraction of functions and the comparison with the biometric model. Depending on the study, this scheme can be easily modified. Some algorithms can also customize the user's model by adding the template created during the last successful authentication. Common biometric system. There are two main families of key dynamics systems: The first is based on free text. During the registration, a huge amount of text must be typed to create the user's model. For verification, the procedure may be different because the user is asked to enter different texts. The other family uses static text: The same set of passwords is used for the least authentication in the vast number of studies."}, {"heading": "2.2. Principles", "text": "Most articles in the literature collect the following data (see Figure 2): (i) the hold time of a key: this is the duration of key printing (T3-T1) and (ii) the key time: this is the delay between releasing a key and printing the next one (T3-T2). Other measurements can also be recorded [8]: the duration of password entry, the use of \"invisible keys\" (such as BACKSPACE) to add entropy (or count the user's input error rate), data cleansing can be performed to improve system performance, in [9] times above 500 ms are ignored (they are considered the result of a user error), and in [10] a reduction in dimensions is performed using genetic algorithms associated with the Support Vector Machine algorithm."}, {"heading": "2.3. Existing Methods", "text": "Table 1 shows the estimated equal error rate (corresponding to a compromise error that will be formally defined later in the work) of several methods presented in the literature. Since most articles do not provide value for the EER, Table 1 represents an estimated value that we calculate by determining the average error rate of rejected real users and accepted cheaters. This estimated error rate is less than 10% for most articles, and the best rates are achieved when we use data mining methods that require a lot of data and do not meet our requirements. Therefore, the next part presents a comparative study, taking into account the fact that the system must be used in a cooperative system (only five vectors or inputs, compile the model and the response is immediate). Another way to improve the performance of the system is the fact that the user learns to type the password while entering it. Therefore, it is quite important to add the last template to the model."}, {"heading": "3. COMPARATIVE STUDY", "text": "In order to get a good overview of the performance of the existing methods for operational use, we have created an experimental protocol which aims to test several points: the acquisition process, the performance of existing algorithms and the perception of the users about the system. It is also the aim to compare the original performance in a specific environment with the performance in a more realistic environment. First, we present the experimental protocol, then the selected state-of-the-art methods for this experiment and then the results we obtained."}, {"heading": "3.1. Experimental Protocol", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1.1. Test Population", "text": "We asked sixteen people to log into our biometric system during three sessions with the password \"laboratoire gryc.\" During each session, the user was asked to type the password correctly five times (there are fifteen vectors per user), the first five vectors being used for the registration process of the biometric system, while the others are used for testing the system. People who participated in the protocol have daily computer use, they are familiar with a keyboard. The test population consists of thirteen men and three women and their age is between twenty-three and forty-five years old."}, {"heading": "3.1.2.

Algorithms Performances", "text": "The efficiency of a biometric algorithm can be analyzed by the following measures: (i) the False Acceptation Rate (FAR), the percentage of authenticated fraudsters, (ii) the False Rejection Rate (FRR), the percentage of real users rejected, (iii) the Failure To Acquire Rate (FTA), the percentage of the biometric template that the system could not capture, (iv) the Error Equal Rate (EER), where the rate if the FAR corresponds to the FRR, and (v) the ROC curves, the FRR versus FAR for all possible thresholds. It is a good representation of the performance of the algorithm."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Biometric Modality Performance", "text": "In addition to biometrics, other data were collected: (a) the time it takes to enter the entire password, (b) the time it takes to enter all passwords during the session, (c) the number of errors during the session (if the user makes an error while entering the password, he cannot correct it and must enter it from scratch) and (d) the subjective evaluation questionnaire during the last session."}, {"heading": "3.2.3. User Perception", "text": "At the end of the last session, users were asked to (I) try to authenticate three times in the system, (ii) try to identify themselves and (iii) answer the following questions: Q1: Is the verification fast? Yes, no Q2: Is the system easy to use? Yes, no Q3: Are you ready to use this system in the future? Yes, no, do you not know Q4: Do you have confidence in this system? Yes, no Q5: Do you feel embarrassed when using this system? Yes, no, do you not know Q6: What is your general assessment of the system? Very good, good, average, bad? The purpose of this questionnaire is to give an idea of the user's perception after using the system. It gives us some information about its acceptance and whether it can be used in real life (where is the interest to perform this type of authentication in a collaborative environment if no users agree with the system?)."}, {"heading": "3.3. Experimental Results", "text": "Several types of results can be analyzed: the numbers extracted throughout the protocol, the performance of the biometric algorithm and the responses of the subjective analysis."}, {"heading": "3.3.1. Acquisition", "text": "Most users have decreased the minimum and average typing speed of the password (they improve their way of typing), and the maximum time of typing has increased (due to lack of concentration and interference from the environment). We can also see that the standard deviation of the typing speed is more important than the data from a session. This can be interpreted by the problem of learning, which is why it is preferred to work with the latest patterns and not all of them to avoid this effect. Thus, the users with the greatest increase in the standard deviation are the less constant users with an increase in the maximum time."}, {"heading": "3.3.3. Off-line Performance", "text": "Even if 100% of the users are authenticated in three attempts at worst, the performance of the algorithm described in Equation (5) and used during the protocol is anything but good. Figure 6 shows the point distribution (depending on the threshold) and the ROC curve. The first curve shows that the threshold of the system must be configured to 0.28 in order to obtain the EER, and the second curve shows that the EER is better than 20%. Such a poor rate can be explained for several reasons: the poor quality of the algorithm (this work was done before the state of the art), the relatively small number of users in the database, and the fact that an identical threshold is used for all users. Table 2 gives the EER, calculated using the best parameters, of each method tested. The first column is the number of methods tested, the second column presents the best biometric template, the typical threshold for all users."}, {"heading": "3.3.4. Discussion", "text": "The results of Table 1 and Table 2 show that these results do not improve the results of previous studies, mainly because our work was carried out in a more restrictive environment (only five vectors used for registration), because no filtering is done on users (all users with the required number of vectors are included in the study, even those who reduce the results), or because the data and all users use the same password (hence the number of patterns used to test attacks for each user is much greater than the number of patterns used to test genuine authentication). It is not an easy task to achieve enough good results to use in a collaborative environment. The low number of registrations could be the main reason for this decrease in performance, so we will have to find other methods to improve the results while maintaining this small number of registrations. Although users answered the questionnaire after testing the worst algorithm of this study, their overall confidence and appreciation for the system is more than 60%."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES", "text": "We examined the ability of key-driven authentication systems for their application to collaborative systems (collaborative systems must authenticate users there).We can see from this study that the results obtained are almost correct even with fairly simple state-of-the-art methods (Method 2, with less than 5% error rate), but still need to be improved. Single-class vector machines with only five vectors per user for training appear to provide better outcomes.In [8] the authors present some useful and simple techniques to improve the quality of a key-driven dynamic system without modifying the algorithms: it is up to the users of the system to add pauses in their notation (they can be supported by the software with visual or other references).Perhaps these good practices for composing dynamic passwords at the touch of a button could be better accepted than the good practice of classical passwords.

the ability and the benefits of using a keystroke dynamics authentication method for collaborative systems. Authentication is a challenging issue in order to guarantee the security of use of collaborative systems during the access control step. Many solutions exist in the state of the art such as the use of one time passwords or smart-cards. We focus in this paper on biometric based solutions that do not necessitate any additional sensor. Keystroke dynamics is an interesting solution as it uses only the keyboard and is invisible for users. Many methods have been published in this field. We make a comparative study of many of them considering the operational constraints of use for collaborative systems.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
