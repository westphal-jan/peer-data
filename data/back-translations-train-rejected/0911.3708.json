We study empirically the cost of manipulating the single transferable vote (STV) rule. This was one of the first rules shown to be NP-hard to manipulate. It also appears to be one of the harder rules to manipulate since it involves multiple rounds and since, unlike many other rules, it is NP-hard for a single agent to manipulate without weights on the votes or uncertainty about how the other agents have voted. In almost every election in our experiments, it was easy to compute how a single agent could manipulate the election or to prove that manipulation by a single agent was impossible.

Fortunately, it is often mathematically difficult to find successful manipulation [1]. For example, Bartholdi and Orlin have proven that the Single Transferable Vote (STV) rule NP is difficult to manipulate [2]. This remains one of the few commonly used electoral rules that NP is difficult to manipulate without weighting votes, or uncertainty about how the other agents voted. NP hardness is only a worst-case outcome and cannot reflect the difficulty of manipulation in practice. Indeed, a number of recent theoretical results suggest that manipulation can often be mathematically simple [3,4,5,6,7]. Most recently Walsh has suggested that empirical studies could provide insights into the computational complexity of manipulation that can supplement such theoretical results."}, {"heading": "2 Manipulating STV", "text": "Individual Transferable Vote (STV) runs in a number of rounds. We look at the case of the election of a single winner. Each agent lists the candidates in full. Unless a candidate has a majority of the first votes, we eliminate the candidate with the least number of first votes. All votes that put the eliminated candidate in first place are reallocated to the second-placed candidate. We then repeat until a candidate has a majority. STV is used in a variety of elections, including the Irish Presidency, the Australian House of Representatives, the Academy Awards and many societies and organizations, including the American Political Science Association, the International Olympic Committee and the British Labour Party. As in previous studies, we assume that the agents who manipulate the election know all the other votes. The problem with manipulation is to decide how the manipulators should vote, perhaps other than their true preferences, so that a selected candidate wins."}, {"heading": "3 Uniform votes", "text": "We start with one of the simplest possible scenarios: elections in which every vote is equally likely. We have an agent trying to manipulate an election of m candidates in which n vote for other agents. Votes are drawn evenly from all m! possible votes. This is the model of the Impartial Culture (IC)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Varying number of candidates", "text": "Figures 1 and 2 show the probability that a manipulator will win a random agent, and the search to calculate whether this is possible if we specify the number of agents, but the number of candidates varies. In this and subsequent experiments, we tested 1,000 problems at each point. Unless otherwise stated, the number of candidates m and the number of agents n in potencies vary from 1 to 128. The number of voting agents is fixed and we vary the number of candidates. In contrast to phase transition behavior [12] in areas such as satisfaction [13,14], satisfaction of limitations [15,16], partitioning of numbers [17,18], graphic coloring [19,20] and expectation of the election decreases. In contrast to phase transition behavior [12] in areas such as satisfaction [13,14], satisfaction of limitations [15,16], variation of numbers [17,18], deviation of numbers [19,20] and the problem of the person sending [21]."}, {"heading": "3.2 Varying number of agents", "text": "In Figures 3 and 4, we show the probability that a manipulator can let a random agent win, and the cost of calculating whether this is possible if we determine the number of candidates but the number of agents in the election varies. An agent's ability to manipulate the election decreases as the number of agents increases. Only if there are few votes and few candidates, there is a significant chance that the manipulator will be able to change the result. Finding manipulation or not is easy unless we have both a large number of agents and a large number of candidates. In this situation, however, the probability that the manipulator can change the result is very low."}, {"heading": "4 Urn model", "text": "To investigate the effects of a stronger correlation between the votes, we looked at random votes drawn from the Polya Eggenberg urn model [24]. In this model, we have an urn containing all the m! possible votes. We pull votes from the ballot box at random and put them back into the ballot box with an additional vote of the same type (where a is a parameter). To give a parameter regardless of the size of the problem, we look at b = am!. For example, with b = 1, there is a 50% chance that the second vote is the same as the first. In Figures 5 and 6, we plot the probability that a manipulator can win a random agent and the cost of calculation if this is possible, since we vary the number of candidates in an election in which votes are drawn from the Polya Eggenberg urn model."}, {"heading": "5 Sampling real elections", "text": "For example, there may be some votes that are never cast. On the other hand, with the models studied so far, any possible vote with a probability is non-zero. We sampled some real voting records [25,26]. Our first experiment used the votes from 10 The number of voting agents is set, and we vary the number of candidates. The y axis measures the probability that the manipulator can win a random candidate. Teams of scientists chose one of 32 different trajectories for NASA's Mariner spacecraft. [27] Each team ranked the different trajectories based on their scientific value. We sampled these votes. For elections with 10 or fewer voting agents, we simply took a subset of the 10 votes. For elections with more than 10 agents, we chose the same number to rate them with uniform frequency. For elections with 32 or fewer candidates, we simply took a random subordination of the 32 candidates."}, {"heading": "6 Related work", "text": "They have also conducted an empirical study that shows that only relatively small coalitions are necessary to change the elimination sequence of the STV rule. They have observed that most uniform and random elections are not trivially manipulatable using a simple greedy heuristics. On the other hand, our results suggest that manipulation by a single agent requires a limited degree of reverse to find a manipulation or prove that none exists. Walsh empirically examines the costs of manipulating the veto rule by a coalition of agents whose votes were weighted [8]. He has shown that there was a smooth transition in the likelihood that a coalition could elect a desired candidate as the size of the manipulating coalition increases. He has also shown that it was easy to find manipulations of the veto rule or to prove that there are no independent and identically distributed voices for many, even if the coalition of the manipulating class was critical."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "We have empirically investigated whether computational complexity is an obstacle to manipulation of the STV rule. We have looked at a number of different distributions of votes, including uniform random votes, correlated votes from a ballot model, and votes from some real-world elections. We have looked at manipulation by a single actor and a coalition of actors voting together. In contrast to phase transition behavior in areas such as satisfaction, we have not observed rapid transitions in the manipulation of STV elections, which are aggravated by a fixed point, but rather fluid transitions. We have also not observed hard cases around the transition in tamability. In fact, almost every one of the millions of elections in our experiments was easy to manipulate or prove that it could not be manipulated. Our results suggest that it may be easy for a single actor to calculate a manipulation or to prove that no election with a hundred or fewer actors and candidates is possible."}], "references": [{"title": "The computational difficulty of manipulating an election", "author": ["J.
