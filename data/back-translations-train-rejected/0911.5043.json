In fact, it uses only semantic conclusions such as instance verification (to solve the recall problem [1], which amounts to calculating the extension of a concept by an A-box); it does not use the syntactical structure of the concept description, so it is independent of the granularity level of the descriptions. This fact reflects the intrinsic complexity of expressive DL languages such as ALC, for which a structural approach to argumentation is simply ineffective (submission is calculated using tablets rather than a structural algorithm). Therefore, the definition of s uses quantity thetics and semantic services so that it makes use of the numerical approach despite its application on a symbolic DL representation."}, {"heading": "5.1 Properties of the Similarity Measure", "text": "In this section, we will prove that the s function is actually a measure of similarity (or similarity function [26]), according to the formal definition: Definition 5.1 (measure of similarity). Let E be a series of elements under which a measure of similarity must be defined. A measure of similarity E is a newly evaluated function d defined on the set E \u00b7 E and fulfills the following properties: 1. f (a, b) \u2265 0 \u0445 a, b \u00b2 E (positive definition) 2. f (a, b) = f (b, a), b \u00b2 E (symmetry) 3. D a, b \u00b2 E: f (a, b) \u2264 f (a, a) \u00bfFrom the definition given in the previous section, it is easy to prove that s fulfills the first property because s has a value in the real interval [0, 1]."}, {"heading": "5.2 Complexity Issues", "text": "In order to assess the complexity of s, the three different cases of the applicability of the measure are discussed separately, all of which depend on the complexity of the instance examining conclusions for the adopted DL language, hereinafter referred to as C (IC). Similarity between the concepts: s is a numerical measure, all calculations require constant complexity; it states that: C (s) = 3 \u00b7 C (IC), because the instance examination is repeated three times: for the concept descriptions C, D and I. Similarity between an individual and a concept: In this case, in addition to the instance verification operations required in the previous case, the MSC approximation of the considered individual must be calculated. Consequently, the complexity of the MSC approximation referred to as C (MSC) depends, in addition to the MSC approximation, on the fact that: C (s) = C (MSC) = C (MSC) + 3 \u00b7 C (previous similarity between the MSC approximation is analogous to the MSC: this is the difference between the two individuals)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We have introduced a new similarity measure, which is primarily intended to calculate a similarity value between concept descriptions, but, as already shown, could also be used to assess the similarity between individuals and between a concept description and an individual. As already proposed, such a measure could be applied to many tasks, namely clustering and retrieval on DL knowledge bases. This measurement could be improved in the case of non-overlapping concepts. In particular, we will try to assess similarities in different cases using an idea of distance between concepts, which is closely related to the weakness of the presented semantic similarity measure in cases involving individuals. In particular, we are looking at our research on the coordination of a semantic operator to generalize the approximated MSC value. In this way, we could overcome the real problem, because the concept would be less specific than MSC and would instantiate more individuals than the one selected to calculate the similarity value."}], "references": [{"title": "eds.: The Description Logic Handbook", "author": ["F.
