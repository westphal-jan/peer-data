Complexity of lexical structures and related domains Lexical databases play a central role in all natural language processing applications (Briscoe, 1991), ranging from simple spellcheckers to more complex machine translation systems. In most cases, they constitute the sole parameter information for the corresponding software, and apart from some vary basic methods such as stemming (Lovins, 1968; Frakes, 1992) relying on pure string processing principles and low linguistic requirements, hardly any language technology application can avoid relying on a minimal lexical resource.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
