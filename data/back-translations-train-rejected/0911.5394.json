Covering rough sets based on neighborhoods", "text": "This section consists of three subsections. In Section 2.1, we recall the definitions of Pawlak's rough sets and the coverage of rough sets based on neighborhoods, and gather some necessary facts that will be used in later sections. Section 2.2 is devoted to providing an equivalent description of the upper sets without using neighborhoods. Using the equivalent description, we briefly discuss the relationships between the lower and upper sets described in Section 2.3.1. We begin by recalling some basic terms in Pawlak's rough set theory [11, 12]. Let U be a finite and not empty universal set, and let R'U \u00b7 U have an equivalent relationship to U. Denote U / R the set of all equivalence classes generated by R. Such equivalence classes, also called elementary sets, give a division of U; each union of elementary sets is called a definable set."}, {"heading": "3. Operations on covers", "text": "This section deals with several operations on coverings and the properties of the lower and upper coverings resulting from the operations.For each universal set U we write cov (U) for the set of all coverings of U. It is well known that the number of possible coverings for a set U of n elements is clearly defined. This fast growing sequence is the entry A003465 by Sloane [19]. Since Cov (U) contains a large number of coverings in general, it may be of interest to examine the operations on these coveres.3.1. Unary operationLet U be a universal set 5 we may view irr as an unary operation on Cov (U) that maps C to irr (C)."}, {"heading": "4. Homomorphisms between covering approximation spaces", "text": "In this section, we look at the conservation properties of the lower and upper approximations under homomorphism. < < D > D < D > D < D > D < D < D > D > are called definable sets. By using the concept of definable sets, we can conveniently give the definition of homomorphisms. < V > lt; D > if it sends any definable set of < U, C > and < V > to a definable group of < V >. In other words, a homomorphism is a mapping that sends definable sets to definable sets. Let's see several examples."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "It has been shown that the upper approach, which is based on neighborhoods, can be defined equally without using the concept of neighborhood. Several operations on lids and homomorphisms between the coverage of neighborhoods have been introduced to define the coverage of neighborhoods. We have also verified the properties of the lower and upper approaches obtained by the operations and homomorphisms. The present work focuses on the coverage coarse based on neighborhoods. It would be interesting to examine the operations on coverage and homomorphisms between the coverage of neighborhoods for other types of coverage coarse groups. In addition, some other topological issues such as continuous maps and homomorphisms in the coverage coarse quantities based on neighborhoods need to be addressed."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China."}], "references": [{"title": "Extensions and intentions in the rough set theory", "author": ["Z.

Covering rough sets are a natural extension of classical rough sets by relaxing the partitions arising from equivalence relations to covers. Recently, some topological concepts such as neighborhood have been applied to covering rough sets. In this paper, we further investigate the covering rough sets based on neighborhoods by approximation operations. We show that the upper approximation based on neighborhoods can be defined equivalently without using neighborhoods. To analyze the covers themselves, we introduce unary and composition operations on covers. A notion of homomorphism is provided to relate two covering approximation spaces. We also examine the properties of approximations preserved by the operations and homomorphisms, respectively.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
