Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to set out in search of a solution that originates in the real world."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "This section consists of four subsections. We recall the definition of Pawlak's rough sets in section 2.1. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 are dedicated to the roughness measures proposed by Pawlak [23], Xu et al. [35], and Liang et al. [17], respectively. Some necessary properties of these units of measurement are collected for later purposes. [17] Rough setsWe begin by pointing to some basic terms in Pawlak's rough set theory [22, 23]. Let U be a finite and non-empty universal set, and let R U \u00b7 U have an equivalence relationship to U. Denote by U / R the set of all equivalence classes induced by R. Such equivalence classes are also called elementary propositions; each union (not necessarily empty) of elementary propositions is called a definable set. For each A U one can distinguish A by a pair of upper and upper seams."}, {"heading": "3. An axiomatic definition of roughness measure", "text": "This section is composed of three subsections. Motivated by the dimensions of roughness in [17, 35], we present an axiomatic definition of roughness and discuss its basic properties in Section 3.1. To construct further dimensions of roughness, we introduce an axiomatic definition of the dimensions of separation in Section 3.2. by integrating the dimensions of roughness in Pawlak's dimension of roughness, we introduce a strong dimension of roughness and examine their properties in Section 3.3.1. roughness measurements for later needs, let us introduce the following idea, which refers to two approximation spaces: Definition 1. Let < U, \u03c0 > and < V, \u03c3 > be two approximation spaces, and let us assume that f: U \u2212 \u2192 V is an illustration."}, {"heading": "4. Case study of strong Pawlak roughness measures", "text": "As we have seen in the previous section, if you can show that h is a partition measurement on U, then \u03b2h is a strong Pawlak roughness measurement and therefore has the characteristics found in Corollary 3 and Propositions 5, 6, 7 and 8. In this section, we will first consider the roughness measurements \u03b2X and \u03b2L based on Xu et al. [35] and Liang et al. [17], both within the strong Pawlak roughness measurements, and then provide three new strong roughness measurements. Proposition 9. The roughness measurement \u03b2X based on Xu et al. is a strong Pawlak roughness measurement. Proof. By definition, \u03b2X roughness measurement is A) = \u03b2P roughness measurement, A-Con (G) \u00b7 (G) \u00b7 con-U | U-1, which is sufficient to show that it is a strong roughness measurement."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we have examined roughness measurement in an axiomatic way. Axiomatic definitions of roughness measurement and pitch were provided. On this basis, we have given a uniform construction of roughness measurement, which is called the strong Pawlak roughness measure, by combining the roughness measure in Pawlak's roughness measurement. Some properties of the strong Pawlak roughness measure have also been investigated. Furthermore, we have shown that the existing roughness measurements in [35] and [17] are two special cases of our strong Pawlak roughness measurement that support our axiomatic definitions. The advantage of the axiomatic approach is that it can combine some seemingly different terms. As a result, we can examine the properties of roughness measurement in Definition 2 and weak roughness measurement in Definition 3."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was published by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants 60821001, 60873191, and 60903152.

To measure numerically the roughness of an approximation, Pawlak introduced a quantitative measure of roughness by using the ratio of the cardinalities of the lower and upper approximations. Although the roughness measure is effective, it has the drawback of not being strictly monotonic with respect to the standard ordering on partitions. Recently, some improvements have been made by taking into account the granularity of partitions. In this paper, we approach the roughness measure in an axiomatic way. After axiomatically defining roughness measure and partition measure, we provide a unified construction of roughness measure, called strong Pawlak roughness measure, and then explore the properties of this measure. We show that the improved roughness measures in the literature are special instances of our strong Pawlak roughness measure and introduce three more strong Pawlak roughness measures as well. The advantage of our axiomatic approach is that some properties of a roughness measure follow immediately as soon as the measure satisfies the relevant axiomatic definition.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
