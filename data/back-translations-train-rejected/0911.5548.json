They are completely counter-intuitive with many bizarre behaviors. However, this paper shows that they may make sense from the perspective of a general decision-optimization principle for cooperation. This principle also offers a generalization of Nash equilibrium, a key concept in game theory, for better payoffs and stability of game playing. In physics, discovering more fundamental laws that can be used to derive some existing laws usually gives us a better understanding about nature, e.g., the discovery of Newton\u2019s laws of motion and gravitation for explaining Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion. This paper shows that a global optimization algorithm can be used to derive the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, one of the most important equations in quantum mechanics. Such a connection suggests that the laws of quantum mechanics might embed a global optimization process such that a dissipative quantum system, caused by the interactions with its environment, tends to evolve towards its ground state of the global energy minimum. Contrary to that, the same system under the laws of classic physics tends to get stuck at one local minimum energy state or another. The former is more deterministic and predictable than the latter in terms of the final result (no dice playing) because an energy function usually has an enormous number of local minima but only one global minimum. In addition to a computational approach to quantum mechanics, the global optimization algorithm also offers an intuitive, direct mechanism to compute the stationary states of a quantum system starting from any random initial states. The global optimization algorithm is defined by the cooperative optimization theory [1]. The theory is for a mathematical understanding of ubiquitous cooperative behaviors in nature and translating them into optimization algorithms. Specifically, given a society with n persons, assume that the objective of person i is described as minimizing a function Ei(x). A simple form of cooperative optimization is defined as an iterative computation of each person\u2019s expected returns described by a function \u03a8i(xi, t) as follows: \u03a8i(xi, t) = \u2211", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
