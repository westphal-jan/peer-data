A CBR system often benefits from a retrieval method by selecting a source case similar to the target problem in a case basis, and from an adaptation method that adapts the retrieved source case to the specificity of the target problem. Adaptation method depends on domain-dependent adaptation knowledge (AK, hereinafter). Acquisition of AK can be carried out by experts or through the use of machine learning techniques. An intermediate approach is Knowledge Finding (KD), which combines efficient learning algorithms with human-machine interaction.Most previous AK acquisition strategies are offline: they are disconnected from the use of the CBR system. In contrast, recent work aims to integrate the acquisition of AK from experts into specific argument sessions: this unopportune acquisition of AK."}, {"heading": "2 Basic Notions About CBR", "text": "In the following, the problems are presented in a language Lpb and solutions in a language Lsol. A source case represents a problem solving by a pair (srce, Sol (srce), in which srce, Lpb is the representation of a problem and Sol (srce), Lsol the representation of its associated solution. CBR aims to solve a target problem by naming a series of source cases CB. The CBR process is usually divided into two main steps: retrieval and adaptation. Retrieval selects a source case (srce, Sol) from the case base so that srce is judged according to a given similarity."}, {"heading": "3.1 Representation Issues", "text": "It is not as if it is a real problem that can be contained in a hierarchical structure that represents a set of logical implications and a set of logical implications.

The first approach was implemented in the CabamakA system [5] and learns AK from the differences between cases by means of knowledge finding techniques (Section 4.1). The second approach was implemented in the IakA system [8] and acquires adaptation knowledge at the time of problem solving through interactions with the user (Section 4.2)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Adaptation Knowledge Discovery from the Case Base", "text": "The methods of machine learning aim to extract some regularities from a number of observations. Knowledge-gathering techniques combine efficient machine-learning algorithms with human-machine interaction. In [5], one learns from differences between cases using knowledge-finding techniques. A number of source cases are used as input for a frequent itemset extraction algorithm that produces a series of itemsets. Each of these itemsets can be interpreted as an adaptation rule. This approach to AK-learning was motivated by the original idea of Kathleen Hanney and Mark T. Keane in [11], in which the authors suggest that AK can be learned from differences between cases. The main assumption is that the differences that occur between cases in the case base are often representative of differences that will occur between future problems and the case base. In order to learn adaptation rules from differences between cases, the representation of differences between cases is indispensable."}, {"heading": "4.2 Opportunistic and Interactive Knowledge Acquisition", "text": "It is the aim of interactive and opportunistic knowledge acquisition strategies to support this acquisition, in which the system exploits the interactions with its user to build, test and, if successful, retain new knowledge. Furthermore, the process of acquiring knowledge is often opportunistic, i.e. it is triggered by a prior failure to think: thinking errors highlight a lack of knowledge and thus provide guidance for the acquisition process. A great advantage of interactive knowledge acquisition strategies is that they ensure that the user is in a favorable context when participating in the acquisition process. [7] A review of interactive and opportunistic approaches to acquiring knowledge is proposed, and two strategies are developed, illustrating the efficiency of interactive and opportunistic approaches to acquiring specific knowledge. On the other hand, it shows that such approaches only allow systems to acquire small pieces of knowledge at once."}, {"heading": "4.3 Combining the two Approaches", "text": "In this context, it should be mentioned that the solution to problems that have arisen in the past is not a solution, but a solution that is capable of bringing about a solution."}, {"heading": "5.1 AK Discovery", "text": "In taaable, the AK discovery process is in learning a set of substitutions from the case base = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = olive oil = oil os = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = oil = os = os = os = os = os = os = oil = os = oil = oil = oil = os = oil = oil = os = oil = oil = os = os = oil = oil = os = os = oil"}, {"heading": "5.2 Opportunistic Adaptation Knowledge Discovery", "text": "The AK discovery process transforms the case base into an additional source of adaptation knowledge. This new source of knowledge is used during a problem solving session to provide adaptation knowledge to the CBR system \"on demand.\" A collection of variations is learned from the case base by comparing two recipe sets, and each learned variation is considered a substitution project with which the adaptation path AP can be repaired. Each learned substitution process is submitted to the user for validation together with the corrected solution S ol (tgt) resulting from its application. If the user validates the corrected solution, a new reformulation (\u03c3, \u03a3) is added to the adaptation knowledge base AKB, so that the learned substitution process can later be used to adapt new formulations.

Future work will include the development of a graphical user interface and more extensive testing. Opportunistic and interactive knowledge discovery in Taaable implies that the user plays the role of domain expert, which raises several questions, such as how to ensure that the knowledge expressed by a particular user is valuable, and how to ensure that the knowledge base for adaptation is consistent with time? In addition, Taaable is intended as a multi-user, so that if the knowledge of the system develops with experience, some synchronization problems may arise."}], "references": [{"title": "Knowledge-Intensive Case-Based Reasoning in Creek", "author": ["A.
