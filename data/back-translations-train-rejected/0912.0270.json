This planner family is quick to find solutions, but the solutions are far from optimal and need to be post-processed to shorten, flatten or otherwise flatten the characteristics desirable for each problem. Moreover, rescheduling RRTs is costly in terms of computation time. Then, we will introduce an evolutionary planner with somewhat opposite qualities: slow in finding workable solutions to difficult maps, but efficient in re-planning when a workable solution has already been found. It can also optimize the solution according to a given fitness function, without requiring any post-processing."}, {"heading": "2.1 Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree", "text": "One of the most successful probabilistic methods for offline path planning currently in use is the Rapid Exploring Random Tree (RRT), a single query planner for static environments, which was first introduced in [Lav98]. RRTs works to find a continuous path from a state qinit to a state qgoal (RRT) in the free configuration space Cfree by building a tree that is rooted in qinit. A new state qrand is uniformly located from the configuration space T. Then the next node, qinit, is located in the tree, and if qrand and the shortest path from qrand to qnear are in Cfree, then qrand is added to the algorithm 1. Tree growth is stopped when a node is found near qgoal. To speed up the conversion quency qgoal, the search in qgoal is not distorted: qgoal with a small probability.

ERRT uses a kd tree (see Section 2.7) to speed up the search for the nearest neighbor, and does not use a bidirectional search. The waypoint cache is implemented by maintaining a constant array of states, and when a plan is found, all states in the plan are replaced by random substitutes. If the tree is then no longer valid, a new tree must be 8grown, and there are three ways to select a new target state, as shown in Algorithm 6, which is used instead of RandomConfig () in previous algorithms.

It works by allowing a tree to grow from qgoal to qinit, as in Algorithm 7. This has the advantage that the root of the tree does not have to be moved during the life of planning and execution. In some problem classes, the robot has constraint sensors, which means that the newly emerging obstacles are located near the robot, not near the target. In general, this strategy attempts to trim smaller branches that are further away from the root. When new information enters the configuration space, the algorithm removes the newly invalid branches of the tree (algorithms 9 and 10) and grows the remaining tree, focusing, 9 with a certain probability (empirically matched to S4: Vlt4 in [FKS06]) to the proximity of the recently worked robot."}, {"heading": "2.5 Multipartite RRT", "text": "The multipartite RRT presented in [ZKB07] is another RRT variant that supports planning in unknown or dynamic environments.

(as seen in algorithms 11 and 12) With given probabilities, the algorithm attempts to connect T to a new random state, to the target state, or to the root of a tree in F (algorithm 13). In [ZKB07], a simple greedy, smoothing heuristics is used that attempts to shorten paths by skipping middle nodes.

A difference to RRT is that it can optimize the path according to a fitness function that is defined (length, smoothness, etc.) without showing the need for a step after processing.

Although the combined RRT-EP / N performs more operators and automatic adjustment of the operator probabilities according to their effectiveness, it is still better than the RRT variants, but about 55% slower than the simple multi-stage algorithm.

The problem is finding and traversing a collision-free path for a holonomic robot, without kinodynamic restrictions, moving in an environment with several unpredictably moving obstacles or adversaries. The availability of perfect information of the environment at all times is assumed. Several static and dynamic variants of the Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm are explored, as well as an evolutionary algorithm for planning in dynamic environments called the Evolutionary Planner/Navigator. A combination of both kinds of algorithms is proposed to overcome shortcomings in both, and then a combination of a RRT variant for initial planning and informed local search for navigation, plus a simple greedy heuristic for optimization. We show that this combination of simple techniques provides better responses to highly dynamic environments than the RRT extensions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
