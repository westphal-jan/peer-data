THE PROPOSED INTELIGENT LAYER FOR DATABASES", "text": "With advances and profound applications of computer technologies, in particular the extensive applications of web technology in various fields, databases have become the repositories of large amounts of data. It is known that databases respond only to standard SQL queries, and it is highly impossible that a common person is well acquainted with SQL queries. In addition, they cannot know the database structures, namely the table formats, their fields with corresponding types, primary keys and more. The primary advantage of the system is that it accepts as input the inherent complexity involved in information queries, and converts them into standard SQL queries to retrieve data from relative databases based on knowledge."}, {"heading": "A. USER QUERY CONTRIBUTION", "text": "The following subsection vividly describes how the user query is transformed to be used for retrieving data from databases. In our proposed approach, we define a universal set uQ, which contains all the individual tokens in the user-typed query. Each token represents a unique element in the universal set uQ. Each user query is likely to contain a display or subjective part indicating the intended result, the part of the link that determines the SQL definition clause, and the part of the criteria that describes the condition or limitation. All these parts of the user query are presented as three distinct sentences dP, jP, and cP. Here, the sentences dP, jP, and cP tokens representing the topic, the subjunctive clause, and the criteria. uQ user query QuerydP Subjectives / display terms are presented as three distinct sentences dP, jP conjunctive part of the conjunctive clause, the conjunction clause of the Q."}, {"heading": "B.

Otherwise, if it yields an empty set, then the element of the singleton set jP is intersected with the set TS to retrieve the matching table name associated with the matching semantics. Otherwise, the distance measurement between the element of jP and each individual element of the set TS is calculated.

SEMANTIC MATCHING", "text": "Semantic matching is used as a basic technique in many fields of application such as resource discovery, data integration, data migration, query translation, peer-to-peer networks, agent communication, schema and ontology. Indeed, it has been a massive problem for years, accepted as a valid solution to the problem of semantic heterogeneity, namely, the management of knowledge diversity. Interoperability between people of different cultures and languages, different perspectives and the use of different terminology. Especially with the advent of the Internet and the resulting information explosion, the problem seems to be more pronounced. D. DISTANCE MEASUREThe Levenshtein distance is a metric used to measure the difference between two sequences (i.e., the so-called edit spacing). Levenshtein distance is defined by the minimum number of operations required to transform one string from one string to another, with a distance from a string, or one translation being possible."}, {"heading": "V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "In this section we have presented the experimental results of the proposed IDBS. The presented IDBS was implemented in JAVA with MySQL and MS-Access as databases. Flexible user queries and results obtained in the designed IDBS are as follows: A. Flexible user query: listing of orders where the unit price exceeds 200 Generated SQL Query: Select * from orders AS A, Order details AS B where A.OrderID = B.OrderID and B.UnitPrice > 200B. Flexible user query: list provides details for which the city of London corresponds. Generated SQL Query: Select * from suppliers AS A where A. city = LondonResults of query A: Results of query B: ISSN: 0975-339738From the above example pair we understand that if the SQL query matches the user query, the results are likely to be correct."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "Relational data model is a universally applied tool for the construction of database systems and applications. A dominant technology for data storage and retrieval was developed by Relational Database Management Systems. Nevertheless, these systems struggle with the problem of rigidity. Any requirement of the user cannot be solved directly by the classical query system, because the characteristics of the requirements cannot be expressed by standard query languages. In this paper we have presented an innovative approach for the design of an intelligent database system for the execution of flexible queries in databases. An intelligent layer was designed and integrated into the existing database systems. The presented system accepts flexible user queries and converts them into a standard SQL query. Expression mapping, stop word removal, semantic matching and Levenshtein distance measurement techniques were used by the intelligent layer in the formation of the SQL query. The usefulness of the presented system was demonstrated with the help of experimental results."}, {"heading": "VII. REFERENCES", "text": "[1]. Elmasri R. and Navathe S.

The explosion of massive data sets created by businesses, science and governments necessitates intelligent and more powerful computing paradigms so that users can benefit from this data. Therefore most new-generation database applications demand intelligent information management to enhance efficient interactions between database and the users. Database systems support only a Boolean query model. A selection query on SQL database returns all those tuples that satisfy the conditions in the query. But lately, there is an overwhelming need for non-expert users to query relational databases in their natural language using linguistic variables and terms instead of working with the values of the attributes. As a result, intelligent databases have emerged, which provides expanded and more flexible options for manipulating queries. In this paper, we propose an intelligent layer for database which is responsible for manipulating flexible queries. Initially, the flexible queries from users in their natural language are submitted to intelligent layer and this layer converts the amorphous query into a structured SQL query. The shaped query is executed and the results are presented to the user. Afterwards, on the basis of results, feedback and the acceptance or rejection of the results are requested from the user. It enables the design of a knowledge based self learning system based the values obtained from user, which will aid the selection of appropriate SQL query, when a same flexible query is issued in the future.
