Detection by histogram analysis", "text": "In the artificial visual field, color images are captured by a video camera and then digitized by a computer. As the football video is captured by a static camera, the trailer and useless information can be removed by delimiting the play zone with an affinity function. Object recognition in color images is a relevant step in the classification study; therefore, we start by subtracting the background to recognize the players and then classify each of them into their appropriate class. The algorithm is based on the following steps: Convert the original image to default values rgb values and remove the light reflections. Recognize the high and low thresholds of each histogram and then perform the threshold on the three chromatic levels. Apply a logical \"AND\" on the three levels and the original images."}, {"heading": "B. Detection by statistical learning", "text": "Recognition by histogram analysis consists in segmenting color images and removing useless information that does not contribute to the classification phase. This method is not a good choice of segmentation for many applications, as shown in Figure 2. The main problem of this technique corresponds to the time when background and foreground have the same characteristics, so many false detections may occur after the histogram threshold: for example, it can remove a large amount of useful information, so we should develop an appropriate technique. As the parametric background model still lacks flexibility in dealing with nonstatic backgrounds, a highly flexible nonparametric technique is proposed for estimating background probabilities from many newer samples using the nuclear density estimation. In the nonparametric model, all recently observed pixel values x1, x2... xN are flexible in dealing with nonstatic backgrounds, a high-grade nonparametric technique for determining nuclear density, with the band density function being chosen as the final gauge function, often being the gauge density function."}, {"heading": "C.

(To separate the color nuance distributions according to pixel players from each team.1) Hybrid color system After extracting useful information that the pixel players represent, we separate the two classes by means of color analysis. However, the traditional RGB space cannot be the most discriminatory display space. In fact, other color systems derived from the RGB components may be more appropriate depending on the case under consideration. Therefore, the treatment of pixel players in different color systems results in a hybrid space represented by the three best color components.2) Method description N.Vandenbroucke [29] considers a multidimensional space that is currently composed as follows: E = {R, B, r, v, b, X, Y, I1, I2, I3, y, s, l, s, s, s, s."}, {"heading": "B.
