Dipoles are defined by A, B, C,., starting points by sA and end points by eA, respectively (see Figure 1). These dipoles are used to represent spatial objects with an intrinsic orientation. In view of a number of dipoles, it is possible to specify many different relationships in different ways, e.g. depending on the length of the dipoles, on the angle between different dipoles, or on the dimension and nature of the underlying space. In investigating different relationships, the aim is to obtain a set of jointly exhausted and paired disjunctural relationships, so that exactly one relationship exists between any two dipoles. The elements of the basic relationships are called general relations."}, {"heading": "2.2 Several Versions of Sets of Dipole Base Relations", "text": "It is an unrealistic goal to construct a single set of basic qualitative relations suitable for all possible contexts. In general, the desired granularity of a representational framework depends on the specific application [35]. A rough granularity needs only a small amount of basic relations. A finer granularity can lead to a large number of basic relations. Therefore, when it comes to applying a spatial complexity, it is advantageous if a choice can be made between several versions of basic relations. Then, a calculation can be selected that only has the necessary number of basic relations and therefore less representational complexity, but it is sufficiently fine-grained to solve the respective spatial rationale problem. Focusing the smallest number of basic relations also fits better with the principle of a vocabulary relationship that is compatible with linguistic principles. [15, 14] For this purpose, several basic relations can be constructed."}, {"heading": "2.3 Relation Algebras for Spatial Reasoning", "text": "The Theory of Relationalisms [39, 40] allows a purely symbolic treatment of conditional problems involving relationships over infinite domains; the corresponding conditional reasoning techniques were originally introduced for time reasoning [32] and have later proved valuable for spatial reasoning [6, 19]. The central data for a calculation is given by: \u2022 a list of (symbolic names for) basic relationships that are interpreted as relationships over some domains and exhibit the decisive properties of paired uniformity and common exhaustion (a general relation is then simply a set of basic relationships). \u2022 a table for the conversions of the relationships we connect to each other. \u2022 a table for the composition of the relations \"relations\" composition. \u2022 a table for the composition of the relations \"relations. Then the path consistency algorithms [41] and backtracking techniques are the tools used to address the problem of consistency of relationships."}, {"heading": "2.4 Constraint Reasoning", "text": "Let's not necessarily let the relation algorithms lead to consistent networks, but only to algebraic ratios. (Definitive) definitive constraints are written as xRy, where x, y are variables for the dipoles and R is necessarily a DRAf or DRAfp relationship. Given a number of dipole constraints, an important argument problem is to decide whether there is consistency, i.e. whether there is a mapping of all variables of consistency with dipoles, so that all constraints are met (a solution). DSAT is a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) [51]. We rely on relation-algebraic methods to verify consistency, namely the above-mentioned path-consistency algorithms. For non-associative algebras, the abstract composition of relationships does not have to agree with the (associative) set-theory relationship."}, {"heading": "3 A Condensed Semantics for the Dipole Calcu-", "text": "The 72 base relationships of DRAf or the 80 base relationships of DRAfp have so far been derived primarily manually, which is a potentially flawed procedural17, especially if the calculation has many base relationships such as the DRAf- and DRAfp-calculations. Therefore, it is necessary to apply methods that provide more reliable results. First, we tried to verify the composition table of DRAf directly by using the resulting quadratic inequalities as in [28], but it turned out that it is impracticable to base the argument on these inequalities, even with the help of interactive theory proofs such as Isabelle / HOL [52] and HOL-light [53] (the latter being devoted to proving facts about real numbers).This impracticability is probably related to the above mentioned NP hardness of the consistency of the DRAf base relationships."}, {"heading": "3.1 Seven qualitatively different configurations", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead in order to achieve the objectives I have mentioned."}, {"heading": "3.2 Computing the composition table with Condensed Semantics", "text": "For the composition of (oriented) dipoles, we use the seventeen different configurations for three (unoriented) lines for the three (unoriented) lines for the three (unoriented) lines for the three (unstructured) lines. (Fig.) A qualitative configuration consists of a qualitative configuration of three lines (the lines will serve as carrier lines for the dipoles) that carry qualitative location information for the beginning and end points of three dipoles, as detailed in the sequence. While the notion of qualitative configuration is motivated by geometric terms, it is purely abstract and symbolic and does not explicitly refer to geometric objects. This ensures that it can be directly represented in a finite data structure. Each of the three (abstract) lines laA, l a B, l a C of a qualitative configuration carries two abstract segmentation points SX and X (X)."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Geometric Realization", "text": "In this section we claim that every qcc has a realization, first of all we have to define what such a realization is. < R = Q = Q = Q = Q; R = F = F = F = F; R = F; R = F = F = F; R = F = F = F; R = F = F; R = F = F; R = F = F; R = F; R = F = F; R = F; R = F; R = F; R = F; R = F; R = F; R = F; R = F; R = F = F; R = F; R = F = F; R = F; R = E = F; R = E = F; E = F = F; F = F = F; F = F = F; R = F; R = F = F; R = F = F; R = F = F; R = F = F; R = F = F = F; R = F = F; R = F = F; R = E = F; R = F = F = F; E = F = F; R = F = F = F; F = F = F = F; F = F = F; F = F = F; F = F = F; F = F = F; F = F = F = F; R E = F; F = F; F = F = F; F = F = F; F = F = F; F = F = F; F = F; F = F = F = F; R = F; R E; F = F = F; F = F = F; R E; F = F; F = F = F; F = F = F; F; F = F = F = F; F = F; F = F; F; F = F = F; F = F = F; F = F = F = F; F; F; F = F; F = F; F = F = F; F; F; F; F = F; F = F; F = F; F = F; F; F = F = F; F; F; F = F; F; F; F = F = F; F; F = F; F; F; F; F; F; F; F; F; F"}, {"heading": "3.3 Primitive Classifiers", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to move to another world in which they are able to integrate."}, {"heading": "3.4 Basic Classifiers", "text": "Based on the primitive classifiers introduced in sect A, B, C, etc., we have defined the basic classifiers for determining DRA relationships in scenarios. For DRAf, we always need exactly four primitive classifiers to determine the relationship. For DRAfp, in some cases, we need an additional fifth classification to determine the qualitative angle. We will first focus on the DRAf case. Thus, we will get an entry in the composition table. We will look at a qcc table with i = 1 + and a (SB) relationship between the first and second dipoles, (2) to the second and third and (3). We will get an entry in the composition table. We will look at a qcc table with i + and an s relationship."}, {"heading": "3.6 Implementation of the Classification Procedure", "text": "Qualitative composition configurations can, of course, be represented as a finite data type. Classifiers are implemented as simple programs (mainly case distinctions) based on qccs in the sense of Def. 29. Classifiers are selected in terms of identifier i and mapping a of qcc. In our special implementation, we took advantage of some symmetries to limit the number of classifiers we had to implement. Using compressed semantics, we are able to efficiently calculate the composition tables of the DRA calculations. In fact, we have decided to implement the calculation of composition tables for both DRAf and DRAfp as Haskell programs, using Haskell's parallelism extensions. Haskell implementations of the basic classifiers for DRAf and DRAfp are written so that they are a library of primitive classifiers type we only share with these classifiers < in this case, we only create the three types of DR7qAFP."}, {"heading": "3.7 Properties of the Composition", "text": "We have examined several properties of the composition tables for DRAf and DRAfp.
