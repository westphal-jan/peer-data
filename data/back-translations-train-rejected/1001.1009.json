INTRODUCTIONIn many applications, especially peer-to-peer and overlay, it is beneficial to know what kind of performance end-to-end networks can offer. Specifically, knowing the speed at which data can be sent between two nodes, so that the injected traffic causes minimal congestion, is very valuable for directing peer selection in peer-to-peer streaming, selecting transfer rates in video streaming, or selecting client-server shortcuts in content delivery networks [1]. In this paper, however, we are interested in finding the largest rate at which data can be sent on an end-to-end path, so that there is a high probability that the output rate is almost the same as the penetration rate. One network metric closely related to this value is available bandwidth, which is typically defined as the average unused capacity of a path over a specified period of time."}, {"heading": "A. Contributions", "text": "Unlike previous work on available bandwidth estimates, which focused on estimating the average unused capacity VI, we are using a probable idea of available bandwidth. We are focusing on estimating the largest bandwidth rate for each path, so that the target is received with almost equal probability. This is a natural way to quantify available bandwidth for streaming and file transfer applications. This paper proposes a method of estimating the available bandwidth in multiple ways on the network at the same time. Our goal is to tap available bandwidth in multiple ways without overloading the network with excessive measurement traffic. Our approach to efficient testing is based on two underlying concepts that develop a probabilistic model that allows us to pull the measurements along a path to draw conclusions about the available bandwidth that we have on other bandwidths on the network."}, {"heading": "II. PROBABILISTIC AVAILABLE BANDWIDTH", "text": "We use the term \"probabilistic available bandwidth\" to highlight the fact that the quantity we are aiming for for the estimate is not the same as the standard available bandwidth estimation techniques based on the principle of self-induced congestion (defined in terms of capacity and use of the constituent links of the path) 1. The assumption is that the available bandwidth of the available bandwidth is equal to the largest probe rate at which the emission rate is approximately the same, and that the emission rate beyond this rate will fall below the emission rate."}, {"heading": "III. PROBLEM STATEMENT", "text": "Now that we have defined the (, \u03b4) -available bandwidth of a path, we can formalize our underlying estimate = secondary estimate. For a fixed (, \u03b4) and a network (L, P), we use measurements of the packet path, with the goal of making estimates of the (, \u03b4) -available bandwidth of all paths in the network. Let the available bandwidth of each connection and the path p be considered as discrete random variables x \"and yp (e.g. Pr (yp = r) as the probability that the (, \u03b4) -available bandwidth on the path p r). For each measurement of the packet path, we evaluate a binary result z\" and yp, indicating whether the exit rate of the train was within the entry rate. Then we are interested in the marginal Pr (yp | zk) -available bandwidth."}, {"heading": "A. Assumptions", "text": "We assume that the routing topology is known, i.e. that we are able to construct the network (L, P). We first derive links and the assignment of IP addresses to routers that use traceroute (which are known to increase the number of routers observed, record false links, and distributions of bias router grade [8]). However, due to our problem formulation, our approach is robust against this type of inference error; additional links can lead to an increase in the number of measurements, but have little impact on the accuracy of the estimates. However, if our validation shows that our estimate of the likely bandwidth available is accurate, the accuracy of the actual topology is not relevant. We use logical topologies (combining all connections that are in a row) rather than using routing topologies to reduce the number of links and the complexity of the factor graph."}, {"heading": "IV. METHODOLOGY", "text": "Our approach to network-wide estimation of available bandwidth is based on measurements of the packet train. Each packet train probes a path at a specified rate. If we probe the path p at a rate rp, the result of the measurement is a binary variable z = 1 {r \u2032 p > rp \u2212}, which indicates whether the output rate r \u2032 p was within the input rate. Each measurement is then a (p, rp, zRDT) triple result, where zRDT is the binary result of the Rate Difference Test (RDT). The information gained from all previous measurements is merged and summarized after each measurement by maintaining an estimate of the available bandwidths for each path. The way information is divided between nodes in a factor graph is through message transmission or belief propagation [9]. This method allows us to estimate the marginals in a factor graph and easily update these measurements from a new information < if we have new information."}, {"heading": "A. Rate Difference Test", "text": "Whenever rp > yp, one of the connections of path p receives more traffic than it can serve, resulting in queues along the way; ultimately, the rate observed at the recipient's end, r \u2032 p, should be lower than rp. The special case where = 0 in the RDT then corresponds to the use of the input / output rate ratio used in several previously suggested estimation algorithms for the available bandwidth. We define the result of the rate difference test as zRDT = 1 {r \u2032 p \u2265 rp \u2212}. In Fig. 1, we show an example of the behavior of the RDT in the case in which = 5. We notice how the increasing trend of the receiver rate for check rates exceeding 7 Mbps ceases. As an indicator, we show a metric related to our work: the available bandwidth as estimated by Pathload."}, {"heading": "B. Graphical Model", "text": "The available bandwidth of each path is determined by all the links that exist, or more precisely, by the minimum of all available bandwidths. The common probability distribution, which represents the functional relationship between links and paths of a topology, is very complex. To capture this relationship, we use factor diagrams that allow us to calculate marginals for each path and each connection more easily. We construct the graphical model using variables and factor nodes. Each link and path p have a variable node in the factor graph (x and yp: the probability that the available bandwidth is r) that are connected to each other by minimal factor nodes. Each link variable node is also connected to a factor node that represents previous knowledge of the associated link variable. For each measurement we make, we add a variable node zk equal to the binary result of the measurement k."}, {"heading": "C. Active Path Selection", "text": "A conventional approach to mapping many paths is to use non-adaptive unified techniques [11]: the path could be chosen either randomly or with an approach such as Round Robin (RR). However, since each measurement is costly in terms of time and bandwidth, there is an incentive to reduce the total number of measurements. By actively selecting the path and rate using the information gathered up to that point, adaptive scanning can offer significant benefits in terms of time and resources. The disadvantage of this approach is that it is difficult to estimate the informativeness of each potential measurement. We will now describe two greedy active learning methods to choose the path for testing on each iteration. Both algorithms are probable in nature: they determine the probability that each path is chosen (fkprobe (p), and then the choice is made by a random selection according to the specified probabilities. The first algorithm is called weighted entropy (we have designated a higher probability, and therefore we have higher criteria)."}, {"heading": "D. Active Probing Rate Selection", "text": "Previous approaches have been limited to determining the interval within which the available bandwidth is located. To decide the probing rate, they use either a linear or a binary search approach and choose the mean of the boundaries. We choose a different approach and choose the rate that halves the distribution: the median of the rear distribution of the path. By probing in the median, there is (to our present knowledge) an equal probability that the available bandwidth is smaller or larger than the probing rate. We therefore maximize the expected information gain from our measurement; it corresponds to conducting a probable binary search for the available bandwidth on path p [11]. By using a probabilistic and non-deterministic approach to rate selection, hard decisions (which may be wrong) are not enforced."}, {"heading": "A. Simulation Results", "text": "The purpose of the simulations is to explore the effectiveness of our proposed learning strategies, but these are not network simulations, so they do not test the modelling assumptions at all (that is the purpose of the PlanetLab experiments).We use the HOT topology generated by Orbis to perform our simulations 2, which comprises 939 nodes and 988 linkages from which we extract subsets of M = 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 paths. We assign link capacities using an even distribution between [1, 100] and generate a total of 500 topologies. At each iteration, the results of the probes are generated according to our probability model.As stop criteria, we use \u03b7 = 0.95, \u03b2 = 10 and a maximum of 10,000 measurements. We compare three path selection algorithms (RR, WE and WCI) and also show the average number of measurements and accuracy required when our learning algorithm is performed independently of each SEQ and sequence."}, {"heading": "B. Obtaining and Calculating rp and r\u2032p", "text": "For our online experiments, we used our measurement software, which is encoded in C, on different nodes of the PlanetLab network3. Although this network was once considered too stressed, Spring et al. explained that PlanetLab has evolved further and this is no longer true [12]. The authors also describe how other myths, such as load prevents the sending of precise packet trains and load prevents the sending of precise packet packets, can be avoided with proven methods. To collect measurement data, we have implemented software that is able to send and receive sequences of packet trains. A single measurement consists of sending Nt sequences (trains) of L's UDP packets of size Pp at a rate rp and observing the rate r-p on the receiver side. We then take the median r-p, which is obtained from each of the Nt trains, and run the RDT sequences to obtain the receipt rate sequences."}, {"heading": "C.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this thesis, we defined probabilistic available bandwidth, a set that differs from the standard available bandwidth, as the highest rate at which data can be sent, so that the exit rate corresponds to the entry rate (within a tolerance level) with the probability \u03b4. The methodology we presented addresses the estimate on multiple paths and is the first to use probabilistic inference, graphical models and active learning. We implemented measurement software and used it in the PlanetLab network. We used our software to identify a suitable probability model. We designed a method for mapping a topology to a factor chart format and used a loopy belief propagation algorithm to update the estimates of the available bandwidths of the paths."}, {"heading": "A. Future Work and Challenges", "text": "Although these initial results are very encouraging and promising, there are many ways to explore to improve our method. We need to examine the trade-off between accuracy and the number of measurements more closely, taking advantage of the fact that we can achieve the desired level of accuracy with relatively few packets per turn. By gaining a better understanding of this, we could formulate the problem in terms of optimizing a resource budget (time, bytes) while achieving the required level of accuracy. We also need to develop an automated method to determine what number of packets in a turn is appropriate for a particular network (for some networks we may need long trains, for others short trains may be sufficient). We are currently exploring an approach that uses twitter to scan a wider bandwidth of bandwidth with a single measurement [6]. To further reduce the number of measurements required, we would like to use a more computerized tool before linking than the unified distributions we would currently use, such as to implement larger prioritization solutions (for example, the number of prioritizing)."}], "references": [{"title": "Path selection using available bandwidth estimation in overlay-based video streaming", "author": ["M.
