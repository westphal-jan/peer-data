Various strategies of reaction production can be adopted, including haphazard / chaotic attractant studies, formation of mental schemas and heuristics. In this paper, we propose a model of a Boolean neural network that incorporates these strategies by drawing on global optimization strategies during the learning session. The model also characterizes the transition from an unstructured / chaotic neural network typical of data-driven processes to a faster, forward-looking and representative model of IGQ, which will be introduced in the International Psychological Model 8Q on June 24th, 2009, to coincide with the International Psychological Model 8Q."}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "This year, the time has come for such a process to take place, and the question is to what extent such a process will take place."}, {"heading": "2. The Model", "text": "The model assumes that cognitive activities during task resolution can be represented as a Boolean neural network whose nodes do not necessarily correspond to individual biological neurons, but rather organized groups of neurons designated as functional areas. We choose this formalization in order to remain within the framework of the neural domain. [0, 1] While the abstract version of the Wason selection task results in a correct performance of 3.9%, the actual execution results in a correct performance of 91%. These results are interpreted for the availability of past experiences applied today. [43, c: degree of connectivity, i.e. the number of afferent synapses of neural neurons are linked by connections called synapses."}, {"heading": "3. Results", "text": "Figure 2 shows how achieving a configuration with E = 0 can depend on the size of the realizable region in our model function of N. During a series of local disturbances, all of which are accepted, the greater N is, the more difficult it becomes to find a configuration capable of solving the problem. In any case, this dependence is also found by applying the algorithms of global optimization during the learning phase. The results of the optimization process are presented in Figure 3. Comparing Fig. 3a with Fig. 2b, it becomes clear what happens with the slow dynamics during the optimization. As there is a large temperature T at the beginning, all movements can be accepted despite their respective error E. Thus, the beginning T0 is set once for all to 5. Every 10 epochs, we decrease the probability of acceptance ap = 0.5 \u00b1 0.2, then Tk + 1 = cl \u00b7 Tk.8 of the passage between the pools. By reducing T, the minimum motions are reduced to only the probability of Eq, the probability of a pass 4E and a pass 4b are accepted."}, {"heading": "4. Testing the model", "text": "The task is to maximize your own budget."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion and future perspectives", "text": "We have presented preliminary results of applying a Boolean model of neural networks to relevant cognitive strategies involved in decision-making tasks. Currently, only mental schematics have been studied, and the choice of such formalization is due to the possibilities offered by Boolean neural networks in terms of robustness, simple simulation, and easy generation of samples for data adaptation; the model appears to capture the most relevant psychological knowledge in terms of scope. By moving from an unstructured neural attractor network to a faster forward-looking network, it also applies to learning studies on the complexity of tasks and the number of cognitive resources employed. As defined, mental schematics will lead to fast and adaptive cognitive strategies of behavioral response. In terms of model adaptation, the behavior of our network on the simplified version of IGT will yield results qualitatively comparable to those of humans. Future studies will focus on hypothetical aspects related to probability and probability models in 11."}, {"heading": "Appendix A", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Implementation algorithm", "text": "The model described above was implemented with Matlab R2007a.
