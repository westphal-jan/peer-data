INTRODUCTION", "text": "Simulation has become a preferred tool in surgical research for modeling complex systems. Therefore, studies on modeling human behavior have received increased attention and attention from simulation research in the United Kingdom [Robinson 2004]. Research on modeling human behavior has been applied to various fields of application such as manufacturing (e.g. [Siebers 2004]), health care (e.g. [Brailsford et al. 2006]), military operations (e.g. [Wray and Laird 2003]), mass behavior (e.g. [Loftin et al. 2005]), retail management (e.g. [Siebers et al. 2008]), and consumer behavior (e.g. [Schenk et al. 2007]). As noted in the literature, some researchers choose discrete event simulation (DES) as a means of investigating their human behavior problems; others choose agent-based simulation (ABS) for this purpose. The choice of simulation method we use to use the individual assessment of the modeler and their experience with the modeling method is DES."}, {"heading": "2. LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Over the past three decades, simulation has become a widely used modeling tool in surgical research (OR) [Kelton 2007]. Its ability to support studies of complex systems has made simulation the preferred choice of academics and practitioners over analytical approaches. Simulation models used in OR can be divided into three groups: (traditional) discrete event modeling, system dynamics modeling, and agent-based modeling. DES models represent a system based on chronological sequences of events in which each event changes the system state in discrete time. SD models represent real-world phenomena that use stock phases and flowcharts, crucial loop diagrams, and differentiated equations. In contrast, ABS models include a range of autonomous, reactive, and proactive agents that interact with each other to achieve their goals."}, {"heading": "3. CASE STUDY FIELDSWORK", "text": "To achieve our goal, we have applied a case study approach. The research focused on the operation of the main dressing room in the women's apparel department of one of the ten largest retailers in the UK (see Figure 1).For a customer, the goal of such a simulation study could be to identify the potential impact on the performance of the dressing room if a different number of sales personnel permanently present in the dressing room set up. We have studied the reactive behavior of employees who respond to the customer when these are available and requested. Based on our case studies, we have developed some conceptual models. Our DES concept model (see Figure 2) is represented by a flow chart, as in DES we focus on the process flow.Our ABS concept models (see Figure 3, 4 and 5) are statechart diagrams for the various agent types that we need to represent (in our case, and we need to focus on the dressing room, as in BS)."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTATION", "text": "Both models were designed as conventional M / M / 1 queue systems and consist of an arrival process (customer), three individual queues (customer entry queue, customer return queue, customer assistance queue) and a resource (sales staff).The arrival process we observed in the real system over the cycle of a typical day is illustrated in Figure 6. In our simulation models, we have the arrival process based on an exponential distribution with an annually changing arrival rate in accordance with the one shown in Figure 6.Both simulation models use the same model inputs, so if we see differences in model output, they will be due to differences between the two modeling techniques. Simulation models end after one working day (8 hours) and mimic the operation of the real department store where we replicate 100 parameters each."}, {"heading": "4.1. Model Validation", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city in which we find ourselves."}, {"heading": "4.2. Comparing Multi-Scenarios", "text": "In this section, we look at different management scenarios related to locker room staffing. These types of scenarios could be used to investigate how to improve locker room performance, which we modeled in our validation experiment. We will use the results of our validation experiment as scenario 1 and measure the improvement in system performance against it. The purpose of this experiment is to see how both simulation methods behave when testing different scenarios. Also, we will keep in mind the actual performance predicted by the simulation models. We have formulated the following two hypotheses: HoG = Both simulation methods produce similar results when used in a multi-scenario process. HoH = When we assign more personnel to the locker room, our simulation model shows a reduction in waiting times and time expenditures in the system. Overall, we have found the efficiency of three different management policies with different numbers of distributors we can test in this scenario set-up specifically for 3."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we examined which simulation method (DES or ABS) is suitable to provide a good representation of the human centric system, taking into account only the reactive behavior of humans. In this case, \"good\" means that the simulation model output matches the performance of the real system, including not only the metrics of the central tendency, but also the metrics of dispersion. For our test, we conducted a case study in which we analyzed the plant operation of a women's department. Once we had a good understanding of the operation of the system, we were able to build some simulation models using different modeling techniques (DES and ABS), and then we conducted two experiments to compare the behavior and results of our simulation models with those of the real system. The first experiment was a validation experiment, while our second experiment was a comparison."}, {"heading": "6.
