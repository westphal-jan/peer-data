In recent years a new threat has emerged in the form of networks of hijacked zombie machines used to perform complex distributed attacks such as denial of service and to obtain sensitive data such as password information. These zombie machines are said to be infected with a 'bot' - a malicious piece of software which is installed on a host machine and is controlled by a remote attacker, termed the 'botmaster of a botnet'. In this work, we use the biologically inspired Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) to detect the existence of a single bot on a compromised host machine. The DCA is an immune-inspired algorithm based on an abstract model of the behaviour of the dendritic cells of the human body. The basis of anomaly detection performed by the DCA is facilitated using the correlation of behavioural attributes such as keylogging and packet flooding behaviour. The results of the application of the DCA to the detection of a single bot show that the algorithm is a successful technique for the detection of such malicious software without responding to normally running programs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jan 2010 15:05:02 GMT  (204kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2195v1", "10pages, 5 tables, 6 figures, IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI2008), Hong Kong"]], "COMMENTS": "10pages, 5 tables, 6 figures, IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI2008), Hong Kong", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CR cs.NE", "authors": ["yousof al-hammadi", "uwe aickelin", "julie greensmith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.2195"}, "pdf": {"name": "1001.2195.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "DCA for Bot Detection", "authors": ["Yousof Al-Hammadi", "Uwe Aickelin", "Julie Greensmith"], "emails": ["yxa@cs.nott.ac.uk,"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "These viruses were a major problem in the late 1980s, and computer worms were problematic from the 1990s into the early 21st century.

Bots", "text": "To achieve this goal, each bot is armed with various methods to facilitate its malicious activities. However, in order to communicate with the bot commander, the IRC bot must connect to an IRC channel in which the bot is designated as a victim. However, once a bot is installed and becomes active on a channel, it expects commands from its controller. Bots often rely on the ability to perform keylogging, which is the means of intercepting and recording user activity such as keystrokes. Keylogging poses a serious threat to the privacy and security of our systems, as the keylogger can collect sensitive information from the user, passwords and credit card numbers. Acquisition of this information can constitute identity theft and fraud. Another malicious activity is the execution of a denial of service attack by sending numerous network packets to the remote host over the network, including SYN and UDP packets."}, {"heading": "B.

Data Collection", "text": "It is assumed that either a bot is already installed on the victim's host, by an accidental infection mechanism in the style of a \"Trojan horse.\" Therefore, we do not try to prevent the initial infection of the boot, but limit its activities on a host computer. The bot runs as a process when the user reboots the system and tries to connect to the IRC server via standard IRC ports (in the range of 6667-7000). Then the bot joins the IRC channel and waits for the botmaster to login and issue commands. For the purpose of being used by the DCA, a listening program is implemented and executed on the victim computer to collect the required signals and antigens data. This collected data is then processed, normalized and forwarded to the DCA. With regard to the function calls, three specific types of function calls are used as signal and antigenic input to the DCA. These function calls are: File, File, File, File, File, File, File, File, File, File, and File."}, {"heading": "C.

To detect the bot, the correlation of the antigen signals is required to define which processes are active when the signal values are changed. Any process that calls one of the selected API functions is stored as an antigen in the antigen log file in Section IV. The more active the process, the more antigen it generates.

In this table, the calculated p-values are presented using an unpaired Mann-Whitney test, the results of which are considered not to be statistically significant with asterisks. This can be attributed to the fact that the total number of antigen produced by both processes is too low to provide an accurate description of the state of the monitored host, supported by the fact that the MAC values for this particular scenario differ significantly, implying that the MAC is a useful supplement to the analysis of the data generated by the DCA, as the DCA data permitted the inclusion of the antigen data that may influence the interpretation of the result.Significant differences for the normal MAC values are that the MAC values for the MCA values are equally low."}, {"heading": "C.
