Philosophy and Development of Fuzzy Logic", "text": "Fuzzy logic was introduced by Zadeh in [17] and used by Mamdani to control the dynamic system in [18]. Since then, fuzzy logic has been successfully applied to many applications for automatic control (especially for non-linear, poorly defined systems) [19-21. The concept of fuzzy logic is a class with blurred boundaries. It provides a basis for a qualitative approach to the analysis of complex systems using linguistic rather than numerical variables to describe the behavior and performance of the system. Thus, in this paper, a fuzzy controller is proposed that incorporates blurred techniques into automatic image zooming to achieve automatic control during the zoom function."}, {"heading": "B. Model Description", "text": "Unlike a conventional proportional integral derivative function (PID), FLC membership is generally defined in such a way that the goals of continuous production and satisfactory transient performance can be achieved simultaneously. However, the decisions of rule sets and membership functions significantly influence the achievement of these performance goals [22]. Two well-known rule-based inference systems are Mamdani fuzzy method and TagakiSugeno (T-S) fuzzy method [23]. Advantages of the Mamdani fuzzy inference system are intuitive, have widespread acceptance and are well suited for human cognition [24-26]. The TS fuzzy inference system works well with linear techniques and guaranteed continuity of the output interface [27-28]. But the T-S fuzzy inference system has difficulties in handling multi-parameter synthetic assessments; it has difficulty assigning weight to each input and fuzzy rules."}, {"heading": "C.
