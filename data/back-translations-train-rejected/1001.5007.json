Nominal trajectories are determined and learned using data driven methods. Standard procedures are used by air traffic controllers (ATC) to guide aircraft, ensure the safety of the airspace, and to maximize the runway occupancy. Even though standard procedures are used by ATC, the control of the aircraft remains with the pilots, leading to a large variability in the flight patterns observed. Two methods to identify typical operations and their variability from recorded radar tracks are presented. This knowledge base is then used to monitor the conformance of current operations against operations previously identified as standard. A tool called AirTrajectoryMiner is presented, aiming at monitoring the instantaneous health of the airspace, in real time. The airspace is \"healthy\" when all aircraft are flying according to the nominal procedures. A measure of complexity is introduced, measuring the conformance of current flight to nominal flight patterns. When an aircraft does not conform, the complexity increases as more attention from ATC is required to ensure a safe separation between aircraft.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jan 2010 19:24:33 GMT  (2835kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.5007v1", "15 pages, 20 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 27 Jan 2010 21:23:03 GMT  (2835kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.5007v2", "15 pages, 20 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 20 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["maxime gariel", "ashok n srivastava", "eric feron"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.5007"}, "pdf": {"name": "1001.5007.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Trajectory Clustering and an Application to Airspace Monitoring", "authors": ["Maxime Gariel", "Ashok N.

Literature review", "text": "The use of positioning devices such as GPS and the collection of data has increased in the last 15 years, leading to an increasing number of tracking applications. The aim of tracking is to detect common patterns on the one hand and to detect outliers on the other. Piciareli et al. [4] presented an online trajectory cluster method for real-time video surveillance. Moving objects such as pedestrians are identified in video frames and their trajectories are compared against existing cluster representatives, i.e. an average of all trajectories in the cluster. Agreement between a trajectory and a cluster is determined by the mean of the standardized 3 distances of each trajectory distance to the next point of the cluster representatives. If a match is found, the cluster representative is updated. If not, a new cluster is created, the cluster representative representatives are developed over time."}, {"heading": "B. Waypoint based trajectory clustering", "text": "This algorithm takes advantage of the trajectory characteristics: planes normally fly straight, with a limited number of turns. This method is derived from the current instrument flight rules procedures. When approaching an airport, planes usually follow a sequence of waypoints marked by their GPS coordinates, sometimes representing an altitude indication. Planar localization of a waypoint is therefore very accurate, but its vertical component often looks like \"at or above - ft.\" Vertical distances are provided by ATC and trajectories, which are then at the pilots \"discretion. Therefore, this method focuses on the 2D coordinates of waypoints in the (x, y) plan. This method is an efficient way to determine compliance with flown trajectories using published procedures."}, {"heading": "C. Trajectory-based clustering via component analysis", "text": "This method follows the following steps, which are summarized in a diagram in Figure 10: 1) Resample the trajectories, to get time series of equal length for each aircraft. 2) Augmented the dimensionality of the data. 3) Normalize and concatenate all the data into asingle vector for each flight. 4) Run a principal components analysis (PCA) and keep the first 5 principal components (PCs). 5) Clusters using a density-based clustering algorithm. This paper proposes improvements to the approach used by Eckstein [9] to realize a trajectory taxonomy. In [9], trajectories are first resampled, then the principal components are extracted and final, the clustering is realized using k-means on the first two main components. Figure 11 (a) presents the resulting clusters on the main components and on the trajectories."}, {"heading": "III. AIRSPACE MONITORING", "text": "This section proposes an airspace monitoring technique that automatically detects when an aircraft does not conform to standard procedures. Standard procedures are determined by the centroids of the clusters found using the previous cluster methods. Centroids correspond to the trajectory frequently traveled, and the value of the parameters used for clustering allows for greater variation in trajectories around the centroids. The purpose of the monitoring task is to determine when an aircraft deviates from the nominal trajectory in real time."}, {"heading": "A. Literature review and motivation", "text": "Observation tasks require knowledge of the structure of the airspace, the trajectory points and the intention of the aircraft. It is a powerful tool when the flights cannot be used according to their flight plan, but the sequence of waypoints may change, some could be skipped or added to ensure optimum separation of the aircraft on the runway. This monitoring method cannot be used."}, {"heading": "B. Data formatting", "text": "It is not possible to directly compare the current trajectories with the nominal trajectories, because the current trajectories are incomplete. In real-time system operation, only past data is known. Therefore, the nominal data set is fragmented. Trajectories with 50 points are divided into 10 fragments of 5 points each. The average travel time in TRACON for aircraft landing in SFO is about 14 minutes. Therefore, 5 data points correspond to about 14 * 60 / 10 = 84 seconds. For current trajectories, a memory of 80 seconds is used. Radar beats of the last 80 seconds of flight are traced back to 5 points, which can now be compared with the database of the nominal trajectories."}, {"heading": "C. Anomaly detection: Inductive Monitoring System", "text": "IMS is a good alternative to model-based health monitoring systems. It provides a highly accurate detection tool and there is no need to build a model manually. IMS is a two-step process: learning phase and detection of anomalies. IMS learns the nominal behaviors using a training data set provided by the user. IMS forms clusters using k-means clusters and density-based clusters. During the detection phase of the anomaly, the input data is compared with the knowledge base created from the training data. The anomaly can be interpreted as distance to the next cluster. The input data belongs to a cluster if all parameter values are within the range specified by the cluster boundaries. The training data set corresponds to all trajectories identified as nominally fragmented in 10 segments of 5 points. The total number of segments was 276,040."}, {"heading": "D.
