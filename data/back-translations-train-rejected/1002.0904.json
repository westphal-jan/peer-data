Likewise, our lexicon is rather short and we are not concerned with polysemy, the SENSE feature will be a scalar value rather than a series of related senses. Therefore, our lexeme will be the structure in Figure 2.

In addition, we can deduce some from the semantic analysis (Section 3) and create a template-like structure. For example, [IS [y]] can be used to represent a state of a noun z with a property of y. It can be nested (IS [IS] \"torn apart\") and can be stored in the event template list, roughly equivalent to the state on which semantic limitations are imposed below, but (the set of values z and y, or JJ and NN, can be taken): NP - > JJ NP NP NP NP NP NP - > NNNSo we can write a few entries for the simple noun phrases we have {1. - 3.

By using the event templates together with the properties of the lexeme, we could cover much more semantically correct phrases and sentences without unnecessary lexicon swelling than with purely function-based models, allowing the lexicon to match the infinite possibilities of a natural language in capturing semantics, rather than defining them as a finite series of lexemes or vice versa. It can also be a lexemes event template list (LET) matrix with rows as event templates that overload the lexemes in w / o, overload the list of lexemes with pointers to allowed templates or vice versa. It can also contain a lexemes event template matrix (LET) with rows as event template indexes and columns that either represent a lexemes with a boolean entry indicating matrix, explicit and explicit (explicit)."}, {"heading": "5 Summary, Critique, and Conclusions", "text": "The [Fon01] work focuses mainly on semantic oppositions (e.g. torn as opposed to sentences repaired in 1a related to the final state of the dress), but only briefly touches on other types of relationships (e.g. red vs. torn in relation to the dress).Both works focus mainly on the lexical semantics of verbs related to events and give almost no credit to the semantics of NPs and others in relation to the work done. No one explicitly defines what their lexical elements would be in the lexicon and why. However, the material presented allows to deduce the meaning of noun phrases, adverbs and prepositional phrases and how they can shift event types from another. It is my belief that the resulting lexicon is fairly comprehensive, but the instances of it presented are not perfect and incomplete, and there is no time to fix them as this is written."}], "references": [{"title": "in: Introduction to Linguistics; course notes", "author": ["Doug Arnold.
