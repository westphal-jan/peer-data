Introduction", "text": "Information systems [5, 8], also known as knowledge representation systems, are a formalism for the representation of knowledge about some objects related to attributes (e.g. color) and values of attributes (e.g. green). In recent decades, the concept of information systems has received considerable attention, including some successful applications in information processing, decision-making and control (see, for example, [1, 7, 10, 11, 16, 18, 20]. In order to study transformations of information systems while maintaining their basic functions, a mathematical tool, homomorphism, has been introduced and studied in the literature [2, 6, 14, 15, 19, 21]. More recently, Wang et al. have studied the properties of information systems under homomorphisms in [12, 13]. Specifically, they showed that attribute reductions in the original fuzzy information system and homorphic images are equivalent."}, {"heading": "2. Consistent functions", "text": "For a detailed introduction to the terms (A), the reader can refer to [4, 9]. (Let U be a universal group of A, or rather a fuzzy group A of U, is defined by a function that assigns to each element x of U a value defined by A (x) if A (x), B (x) the set of all fuzzy subsets of U. For all A, B and F (U), say that A is contained in B (or B contains A), denoted by A B if A (x) \u2264 B (x) the set of all fuzzy subsets of U. Supporting a fuzzy group A is a crisp group defined as supp (A) = {x x) > 0."}, {"heading": "3.

Let U and V not be empty, and f: U \u2212 V be a figure. (1) The blurred relation defined by f, denoted by the same notation f, is a figure of F (U \u00b7 U) on F (V \u00b7 V), that Maps R is defined on f (R), where f (R) is a figure of f (R).

Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have presented preceding and succession consistent functions in terms of a blurred relationship, which together amount to the notion of consistent functions in the sense of [12]. Some properties of preceding and succession consistent functions have been studied. Based on the classification of consistent functions, we have significantly improved some of the characterizations of blurred relation mappings presented in [12]. The results obtained in this paper may help us establish a homomorphism between two blurred information systems and further compare their properties."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants 60821001, 60873191 and 60903152."}], "references": [{"title": "Entropies and co-entropies of coverings with application to incomplete information systems", "author": ["D.
