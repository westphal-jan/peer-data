Linguistics, however, tells us that different syntactic categories have different semantic characteristics, often reserved for members of this category [LP91]. This raises two different but equally important questions: how are such categories found syntactically and how are their characteristics expressed semantically? The famous linguist Sir Randolph Quirk notes that \"a preposition expresses a relationship between two entities, one of which is represented by the prepositional complement\" [Qui85]. In this essay we describe the development of a heuristic system."}, {"heading": "2 Theoretical Foundations", "text": "Through a literature review, it becomes clear that the study of prepositions is becoming more and more complicated and is divided into a few focussed areas. Therefore, our work is motivated to create a sequential system of increasingly complex levels, each of which is representative of one of these focussed areas. The system is organized in such a way that the product of one level becomes a dependence of the next, as outlined in the following sequence: Level 0: From the part of the speech commented text, minimal prepositional sentences are found at the syntactic level using context-free grammar (CFG) rather than categorised. Level 1: Minimal prepositional sentences are supplemented by a series of labels indicating classes of semantic roles using rule-based heuristics. Level 2: Correct attachment of the prepositional phrase is attempted with flat heuristics based on the results of levels 0 and 1, in the case of ambiguity Level 3: Semantic Phrases are described in more detail as Level 1 and Level 4:"}, {"heading": "2.1 Discovery of Minimal PPs - Syntactic Analysis", "text": "The first step is to localize prepositional phrases within a text grammatically, independently of semantic function. To this end, we turn to linguistics, which examines PPs by their production and extension, as described below."}, {"heading": "2.1.1 Production of PPs", "text": "Prepositional phrases generally adhere to noun phrases and verb phrases that are usually adjective for the former and adjective for the latter [Hud03], as in the example (S (NP (DET the) (Pin (NP (DET the) (HEAD shop)))))) (VP waits (PPat (NP (DET the) (HEAD corner)))))))))) At first glance, we should be able to expand grammatical nouns and verb phrases by simply adding rules of the form NP NP NP PP and V P (DET the), but this can lead to over-generation, especially in cases where there is ambiguity about the section of a potential preposition. In \"Disable / RB the light,\" for example, \"off\" is used as an adversion, but if we are not careful with our extension rules for V P, we could easily avoid \"(VP / PP IN ADmar) errors in the PPP project framework if the existing marker rules are executed incorrectly."}, {"heading": "2.1.2 Expansion of PPs", "text": "Although there is some discussion about the semantic function of preposition philosophy [FS03], the syntactic nature of a preposition philosophy is relatively generally accepted. It is very safe to define the preposition philosophy specifically so that it has a preposition as its head, followed by a noun phrase or entity that is always the direct object [Hud03]. For a complete listing of the rules for PP extensions, see Appendix A and B."}, {"heading": "2.1.3 Non-minimal PPs", "text": "We will often come across sequences of related preposition philosophies, such as in \"I saw the fool on / IN the hill with / IN the telescope.\" In such circumstances, we mainly deal with PP binding, which presents a significant grammatical challenge, but also includes semantic analysis, so its discussion is delayed until Section 2.3. Suffice it to say that we will encounter with some regularity such a sequence of PPs, where each PP changes the same predicative, and therefore we add the PP-PP-PP production rule to deal with such a circumstance."}, {"heading": "2.1.4 The Mechanism of Discovery", "text": "The mechanism for detecting prepositional phrases is an implementation of the Earley parser in Scheme. Although it provides a simple interface to grammatical tree extensions based on purely syntactic, context-free rules - the algorithm lacks any stochastic or global knowledge, and therefore cannot be used for more complex grammatical or semantic analysis - the instantiated grammar is an example of a partial parser PP-chunker that searches only for prepositional phrases."}, {"heading": "2.2 Semantic Role Annotations & Categorization", "text": "Prepositions convey significant semantic relationships in the text and constitute \"the main means of conveying semantic roles for the supporting units named in a prediction\" [OW02]. However, they are highly ambiguous - with closely related meanings and a relatively high degree of internal polysemy. In addition, definitions as two are conveyed as semantic roles, and the relationship between supporting units is varied and often inaccurate. Currently, it is not possible for automatic systems to achieve a degree of semantic granularity comparable to that of collectible dictionaries, but we can at least categorize various uses of the prepositional phrase by broad semantic features."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 Semantic Role Annotations", "text": "Penn Treebank described the prepositional phrase as a semantic sub-categorization of the semantic relationships within a text. Although these sub-categorizations do not in any way provide a thorough description of the semantic relationships within a text, they allow an appropriate indication of the way in which a prepositional phrase is used, and therefore of how they change the semantics of the phrase to which they are attached. These semantic relationships can be attached to any verb supplement, but more often they occur with noun phrases and their clauses. \"[sei03] The University of Pennsylvania presents online commented texts from SIGLEX '99 [sei03] [tru03] with parsed examples showing each of these categories: PP-LOC:...\" a federal grand jury (PP-LOC in (NP Newark)... \"[sei03] PP-TMP:\" The People Who Suffer (PP-TMP in (NP of Short-Term) PRPP-PRPP-03-PRP-PRP-03-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-03-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-03-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-03-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-03-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-03-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-03-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-03-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-03-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-PRP-03-PRP-PRP-PRP-LOC-LOC-LOC-PRP-LOC-PRP-LOC-PRP-LOC-PRP-LOC-LOC-PRP-LOC-PRP-LOC-LOC-LOC-A-A-PRP-PRP-LOC-PRP-LOC-A-LOC-LOC-A-PRP-PRP-A-A-"}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Alternative classifications", "text": "Alternative classifications of prepositional phrases have been discussed in the field of semantic coding in lexicographies [EAG96], where terms are associated with prepositions but describe whole phrases, depending on whether they apply to PPs that modify predictive heads (verbs and predictive nouns) or to PPs that modify non-predictive heads (non-predictive nouns).1 This distinction is semantically and syntactically justifiable1, and most of the terms associated with predictive head modifiers coincide directly with the semantic role notes in Section 2.1.The subtlety of such a distinction is more evident for modifiers of non-predictive heads that describe all quality changes. For example, consider the difference between a place-position modifier (locative) in \"the report is the prediction of prediatives rather than the predictive of prediatives in.\""}, {"heading": "2.2.3 Temporal PPs (TPPs)", "text": "Ian Pratt et al. [PF97] show that temporal prepositional phrases with NP additions and also with PP additions (to validate our non-minimal grammar decision!) and even sentence additions with quantification constraints and structural ambiguities can be grouped into a unified theory of generalized temporal quantifiers, which serve as meaning for temporal PPs specifically, but also for NPs and sentences. Their theory differs from normal categorization theory in that their semantics are strongly based on \u03bb calculation and distortion functions and are therefore only used as a theoretical marker. In response to Pratt et. al, it should be noted that Nissim Frances et al. [FS03] 2 argues that the unorthodox semantic operations and lack of syntactic terms make such an approach impracticable for practical purposes and a better synpositive approach (closer to our synthetic approach)."}, {"heading": "2.2.4 Categorization Heuristics", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "2.3 PP Attachment", "text": "Although prepositional phrases... \"can occur in all other major phrase types\" [MS02], the task of achieving automatic PP binding syntactically traditionally requires attachment either to a verb phrase or to a noun phrase, historically achieved by a specific binary choice between two specific methods: Right Association: A voter tends to attach himself immediately to another. This approach prefers attachment to the noun [Kim73]. (ex.) \"I (VP saw (NP saw (NP the dog) (PP with his puppies)\") Minimal attachment: A voter tends to attach to existing nonterminals by using the most feverb nodes. This approach prefers attachment to the verb [Frz78]. (VP saw (NP the dog) (PP with his puppies) Minimal attachment: A constituent tends to attach to existing nonterminals by using the most feverb nodes. \"This approach favors attachment to the verb (NP saw) with the dog (78)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Consideration of Semantics", "text": "Determining semantics (level 4) is beyond the scope of this paper due to time constraints. However, we present a few general ideas on how this might be possible. A (more superficial) possibility is to form sub-categories of the 7 classes we use. Locative PPs can, for example, have lexical entries with semantic relationships, such as \"part-to-whole,\" \"nuances\" and \"relative distance relationships,\" the \"path\" and \"orientation structures\" for \"motion-oriented\" and \"stativ-locational\" interpretations according to [Nam95]. Similar to VPs, we need to look at the (semantic) argument structure of such PPs. Generally, a hierarchy of sub-categories of the original classes of PPs needs to be established, which may require more than two overruns of the parses we currently have. Argument structure tests can be conducted as in [Ver]."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments & Analysis", "text": "To measure the effectiveness of our heuristic approach, we need to evaluate our system by corpora and then analyze it experimentally. Such an experiment includes a \"training phase,\" in which the syntactic and semantic properties of the prepositional phrases are analyzed and represented by heuristics, and a \"testing phase,\" in which the effectiveness of this heuristic is statistically measured. The process is described in the following sections."}, {"heading": "3.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Corpora", "text": "For experimental purposes, a collection of texts from the Wall Street Journal's (WSJ) corpus is randomly selected to be representative of the available corpses and divided into two groups: the first consists of 20 texts (~ 74%) that are used to \"train\" the system - that is, our heuristics are modified to best match these documents; the second set consists of 7 texts (~ 26%) that are used to \"test\" the system - from which our empirical measures of performance are derived; the breakdown is shown in Tables 2 and 3."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Human Annotation", "text": "This task was facilitated by two factors: \u2022 Only prepositional phrases (and their components) were annotated, saving commentators the trouble of analyzing a full sentence. \u2022 As a result of the first point, the PP appendage was not taken into account. Subsequently, the excerpts were supplemented with the semantic role annotations from Section 2.2.1. In cases where the prepositional phrase did not fall into one of the 7 semantic categories, the tag was simply left as PP, without additional marking. The annotations of the 20 training documents guided the creation of rules for grammatical expansion and heuristics for semantic role markers. The annotations of the 7 test documents allowed numerical performance measures and statistical evaluations."}, {"heading": "3.1.3 Measures of Performance", "text": "Two essential parameters for performance are precision and callback, defined by [Qui85]: precision: P =] of the correct answers given by the system [recall: R =] of the correct answers given by the system sum] of the possible answers in the textFor each of these parameters, a \"response\" can be defined with respect to the present task and is specified in Section 3.2. For example, when measuring the mere PP chunker grammar, the callback would be defined as the total number of correctly identified prepositional phrases among all actual prepositional phrases in a text. An additional statistical measure is the F measurement, which describes the combined measure of precision and callback and is described by F = (\u03b22 + 1) PR\u03b22P + R, taking \u03b2 = 1 (equal weight as precision and callback) into account."}, {"heading": "3.2 Results & Analysis", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Evaluation of PP-grammar", "text": "The discovery of minimal, uncharacterized PPs, which comprise the first level of the system, will initially be analyzed independently, as their performance will drastically affect the performance of later phrases.The first round of evaluation results in a recall of R = 302 369 \u2248 81.8% and an accuracy of P = 302 409 \u2248 73.8%. The relatively low precision is quickly detected as a result of poor pre-processing of WSJ texts, leading to errors in marking. Specifically, incorrect prepositional phrases are found in the headers of WSJ texts and at the end of sentences at points where punctuation causes difficulties for Brill's taggers, where errors are likely to be made during the transforming marking of phrases.Additional pre-processing steps for the circumstances listed improve memory to R = 302369 \u2212 81.8% and precision to P = 302381 \u2212 79.3%. Although a significant improvement is possible, additional improvements are possible."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Evaluation of Automatic Categorization", "text": "Using lexical knowledge first and then subsuming it with semantic knowledge leads to very encouraging results. Measuring retrieval, precision and F-measure, as previously defined for all 7 tests, we divide the analysis into the four most common categories, in which uncommented PPs are generally rated positively if they do not fit strictly into our seven categories, and in other negatives.4 This breakdown is immediately recognized in Table 4.It is immediately apparent that our heuristics seem exceptionally well suited for directional PPs, and overall Excep-4So fractions are not necessarily equivalent to the sum of their parts. Bad for sage PPs. Such a discrepancy cannot, of course, be linked only to the heuristics for these two categories, since the system is not independent and heuristics play a significant role for other categories. It should be noted that the more potential categories are considered, the more errors we can expect due to the relative higher perplexity."}, {"heading": "4 Future Work", "text": "Most of the future work would be devoted to the previously outlined levels 3 and 4, i.e. PP binding and semantic analysis of PPs. Both problems are quite difficult to solve and require a lot of experimental errors of the existing and new proposals. New, more robust tools are needed, such as stochastic methods in NLP and much more training and test data. For example, we could assign probabilities to our grammar rules and encode the binding information in the syntactic productions. Likewise, the recognition of semantic roles of PPs and their arguments can be done heuristically and statistically with two or more passes."}, {"heading": "5 Appendix", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Appendix A: PP Rule Set", "text": "The rule set is relatively small and simple, provided the rest of the grammar has a fairly precise idea of what NP and VP are. This basic rule set is used for level 0 of our work, which gives us a list of unclassified PPs from a corpus.
