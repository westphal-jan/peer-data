PN PREDICTIONS AND ACCURACY", "text": "When a PN model of offender behavior at the crime scene is learned from solved cases, it is implemented on the basis of a series of solved validation cases to test the performance of the trained model. Performance is tested by probabilistic conclusion. Consequence is the process of updating the probability distribution of a set of possible results based on the relationships represented by the PN model and the observations of one or more variables. With the updated probabilities, a prediction can be made from the most likely value of each derived variable. Thus, to test the trained model, only the crime scene evidence is inserted into the model, comparing the predicted offender profile with the actual offender characteristics. As it is a probabilistic model, a certain confidence accompanies the variable predictions of the offender."}, {"heading": "VIII. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This paper presents an approach to deriving a network model of criminal profiling based on knowledge-based systems and in fields of criminology and offender profiling. Implementation of probabilistic networks allows to present multidimensional interdependencies between all relevant variables identified in previous research as a role in determining or reflecting the behavior of offenders at the crime scene. Therefore, a validxi, 1 if 0 < v < v < p (xi, 1 | \u03c0i) is appropriate."}, {"heading": "AUTHORS PROFILE", "text": "Ramesh Kumar Gopala Pillai is a postgraduate in Information Technology at the University of Kuvempu.
