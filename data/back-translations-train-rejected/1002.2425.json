DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we provided a simple and qualitative methodology to compare the predictive power of the cluster algorithm and Euclidean distance as a measure of similarity distance. We demonstrated our technique using the Kmeans cluster algorithm [6] and combined it with the deterministic model in [7] on a dataset of private school outcomes with nine courses offered for each semester for a total of 79 students, and created the numerical interpretation of the results for performance evaluation. This model improved some of the limitations of existing methods, such as the model developed by [7] and [8]. These models applied a blurred model to predict the academic performance of students on only two datasets (English and mathematics) of secondary school outcomes. Also, the research of [9] provides only data mining frameworks for the academic performance of students. The research of [10] used rough set theory as a classification kit to analyze the student data used in the Rosendetta to evaluate the student data."}], "references": [{"title": "and K", "author": ["S.
