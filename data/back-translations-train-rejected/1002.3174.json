Classical methods of file type detection including considering file extensions and magic bytes can be easily spoofed. Content-based file type detection is a newer way that is taken into account recently. In this paper, a new content-based method for the purpose of file type detection and file type clustering is proposed that is based on the PCA and neural networks. The proposed method has a good accuracy and is fast enough.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Feb 2010 10:18:07 GMT  (463kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3174v1", "6 Pages, 5 Figure, 2 Tables"], ["v2", "Mon, 11 Jul 2011 14:02:13 GMT  (155kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3174v2", "6 Pages, 5 Figure, 2 Tables"], ["v3", "Fri, 16 Mar 2012 21:31:17 GMT  (348kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3174v3", "6 Pages, 5 Figure, 2 Tables"]], "COMMENTS": "6 Pages, 5 Figure, 2 Tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["m c amirani", "m toorani", "a a beheshti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.3174"}, "pdf": {"name": "1002.3174.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "A New Approach to Content-based File Type Detection", "authors": ["Mehdi Chehel Amirani", "Mohsen Toorani", "Ali Asghar Beheshti Shirazi"], "emails": ["permissions@ieee.org."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "\u2020 Copyright \u00a9 2008 IEEE.

Feature Extraction", "text": "The problem of the optimal selection of statistical features is known as feature selection and feature extraction. While feature extraction from linear or nonlinear combinations of the original features produces a smaller number of features, feature extraction selects a subset of the original features. Feature selection transforms a data space into a feature pace that theoretically has the same dimension as the original data space. Such a transformation is practically designed so that a reduced number of effective features represents the data set while most of the intrinsic information content of the data is retained. Reducing the dimension of the input space is generally associated with a loss of information. The goal of dimensional reduction is to preserve the relevant information as much as possible. In this section, the concepts of PCA and unattended neural networks that we use for feature extraction are briefly described."}, {"heading": "3.1.

A small number of principle components are usually sufficient to take into account most of the structure in the data. Let {} NnRdn,..., 1 | = x = xX represent a ddimensional dataset. PCA tries to find a lower dimensional subspace to describe the original dataset while preserving the information as much as possible so that a new k-dimensional dataset {} N1,..., n | Rkn = x = zZ is created, where k is smaller than d.

The used network has d input and d output nodes and a single hidden layer with k nodes and linear activations. During the training phase, the desired outputs are the same as the inputs. This procedure corresponds to the linear PCA [10]) () (4) = j jji 1Such a network has a unique minimum and the hidden layer forms the input d-dimensional space on the output k-dimensional subspace. This procedure is equivalent to the linear PCA [10]. Much better compression can be achieved by utilizing the cybenko theorem.
