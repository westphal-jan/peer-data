In this paper, we developed an adaptive beamforming based on least mean squared error algorithm and null deepening to combat co-channel interference (CCI) for the space-time coded OFDM (STC-OFDM) system. To illustrate the performance of the presented approach, it is compared to the null steering beamformer which requires a prior knowledge of directions of arrival (DOAs).

A transmitter shown in Fig. 1 (a) begins by encoding a symbol block to generate a space-time codeword. In due course, the space-time encoder constructs a matrix of modulated symbols in which an element belongs to a constellation of Mary. The i-th line represents a data sequence emitted by the i-th transmitting antenna. At the i-th transmitting antenna, the serial-to-parallel converter enables parallel data to be obtained.
