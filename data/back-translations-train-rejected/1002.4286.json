An association rule is a form of partial implication between two sets of binary variables. In the most common approach, association rules are parameterized by a lower bound on their confidence, which is the empirical conditional probability of their consequent given the antecedent, and/or by some other parameter bounds such as \"support\" or deviation from independence. We study here notions of redundancy among association rules from a fundamental perspective. We see each transaction in a dataset as an interpretation (or model) in the propositional logic sense, and consider existing notions of redundancy, that is, of logical entailment, among association rules, of the form \"any dataset in which this first rule holds must obey also that second rule, therefore the second is redundant\". We discuss several existing alternative definitions of redundancy between association rules and provide new characterizations and relationships among them. We show that the main alternatives we discuss correspond actually to just two variants, which differ in the treatment of full-confidence implications. For each of these two notions of redundancy, we provide a sound and complete deduction calculus, and we show how to construct complete bases (that is, axiomatizations) of absolutely minimum size in terms of the number of rules. We explore finally an approach to redundancy with respect to several association rules, and fully characterize its simplest case of two partial premises.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Feb 2010 10:02:24 GMT  (93kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.4286v1", "LMCS accepted paper"], ["v2", "Sat, 26 Jun 2010 22:44:45 GMT  (96kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.4286v2", "LMCS accepted paper"]], "COMMENTS": "LMCS accepted paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["jose l balcazar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.4286"}, "pdf": {"name": "1002.4286.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "REDUNDANCY, DEDUCTION SCHEMES, AND MINIMUM-SIZE BASES FOR ASSOCIATION RULES", "authors": ["JOS\u00c9 L.

Closure-Based Redundancy", "text": "Theorem 3.20 in the previous section tells us that, for simple redundancy, the absolute limit of a base is reached at a certain confidence threshold (1). (Several studies, prominent [44], have presented a different notion of redundancy; namely, they give a separate role to the implications of full confidence, often through their associated closure operators. (Along this way, one gets a stronger idea of redundancy, and therefore a possibility that smaller bases can be constructed. In fact, implications can be better summarized because they allow transitivity and augmentation to find redundancies; furthermore, they can be combined with partial rules in certain forms of transitivity: as a simple example, if c (Y \u2192 Y) and c (Y \u2192 Z) = 1, that is, if a fraction or more of the support of transactions takes place, Y and all transactions containing Y."}, {"heading": "5. Towards General Entailment", "text": "We continue to move toward another contribution of this work: we propose a stronger concept of redundancy than progress toward a complete logical approach in which redundancy would play the role of the accompanying phenomenon and a solid and complete deductive calculation. In view of the redundancy concepts described so far, of course the following question arises: beyond all these redundancy concepts that relate a partial rule to another partial rule, possibly in the presence of implications, is it actually possible that a partial rule is jointly conditioned by two partial rules but not by one of them? And if so, when will this happen? We will fully answer this question. The failures of transitivity and augmentation might suggest the intuition of a negative arrangement: It looks like a combination of at least two partial rules of trust, but with a partial rule < 1, we require that we multiply trust by being as low as possible, but this intuition is wrong."}, {"heading": "6. Discussion", "text": "Our main contribution, at a glance, is a study of trust-limited association rules in relation to a family of terms of redundancy. < 1) We have provided characterizations of several existing terms of redundancy, and we have managed to prove the global optimality of an existing principle; in our simple conception of redundancy, and also to improve the constructions of the foundations for closure-based redundancy, up to global optimism as well. Many existing terms of redundancy we discuss about redundancy of a sub-rule only in relation to another sub-rule; in our Section 5 we have moved beyond the use of two sub-rules. For this approach to redundancy, we believe that this last step was taken for the first time; the only other reference we are aware of where several sub-rules are being taken into account is the early [33], very sophisticated terms were used."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The author is grateful to his research group at UPC and to the regular seminar participants; also for many observations, suggestions, comments, references and improvements, the author gratefully thanks Cristina T-\u0131rna \u0435uca, Vero'nica Dahl, Tijl de Bie, Jean-Franc ois Boulicaut, the seminar participants in whom the author presented this work, the reviewers of the conference papers in which most of the results of this paper were announced, and the reviewers of this paper."}], "references": [{"title": "A New Approach to Online Generation of Association Rules", "author": ["C C Aggarwal", "P S Yu"], "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2001}, {"title": "A Swami: Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Very Large Databases", "author": ["R Agrawal", "T Imielinski"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1993}, {"title": "A I Verkamo: Fast Discovery of Association Rules", "author": ["R Agrawal", "H Mannila", "R Srikant", "H Toivonen"], "venue": "Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, U Fayyad et al.

We study here notions of redundancy among association rules from a fundamental perspective. We see each transaction in a dataset as an interpretation (or model) in the propositional logic sense, and consider existing notions of redundancy, that is, of logical entailment, among association rules, of the form \u201cany dataset in which this first rule holds must obey also that second rule, therefore the second is redundant\u201d. We discuss several existing alternative definitions of redundancy between association rules and provide new characterizations and relationships among them. We show that the main alternatives we discuss correspond actually to just two variants, which differ in the treatment of full-confidence implications. For each of these two notions of redundancy, we provide a sound and complete deduction calculus, and we show how to construct complete bases (that is, axiomatizations) of absolutely minimum size in terms of the number of rules.
