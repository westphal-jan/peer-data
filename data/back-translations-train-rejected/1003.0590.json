The proposed model is called Controller-Agents for Constraints Solving (CACS). This model is intended to be used which is an emerged field from the integration between two paradigms of different nature: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Constraint Satisfaction Problem paradigm (CSP) where all constraints are treated in central manner as a black-box. This model allows grouping constraints to form a subset that will be treated together as a local problem inside the controller. Using this model allows also handling non-binary constraints easily and directly so that no translating of constraints into binary ones is needed. This paper presents the implementation outlines of a prototype of DCSP solver, its usage methodology and overview of the CACS application for timetabling problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Mar 2010 13:40:43 GMT  (396kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0590v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sami al-maqtari", "habib abdulrab", "eduard babkin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1003.0590"}, "pdf": {"name": "1003.0590.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Application of CACS approach for distributed logistic systems", "authors": ["Sami AL-MAQTARI", "Habib ABDULRAB", "Eduard BABKIN"], "emails": ["abdulrab}@insa-rouen.fr.", "eababkin@hse.ru."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Controller Agent for Constraints Satisfaction (CACS): This approach combines multi-agent architecture with constraint solvers in a unified framework that expresses key features of the Swarm Intelligence approach and replaces the traditional stochastic adaptation of the swarm of autonomous agents with constraint-driven adaptation.

Determine all constraints of the problem. 4. Classify constraints logically into separate groups. 5. Specify a set of controllers to monitor each group of constraints. To provide a developer with flexible practical methods of design, we offer two constraints of the general methodology: simple and complex. To prove the proposed methods of constraints, we are based on two types of agents that we have developed."}, {"heading": "DCSP p = new DCSP(\"example\");", "text": "This creates a distributed problem that generates agents, variables, and constraints.2.
