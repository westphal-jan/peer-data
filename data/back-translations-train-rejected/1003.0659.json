PHAT is a normalized cross-correlation technique that removes orders of amplitude information from the audio signals, focusing on the alignment of the phase components. If you define Rp (\u03c4) as the PHAT correlation between the microphone pair p during delayed viewing, then the TDOA is often estimated according to \u2206 p = argmax \u03c4 Rp (\u03c4) (1). However, in a reverberating environment, there are often fake Rp peaks either through line noise or multipath reflections. In these cases, the true TDOA may not be the largest peak in the PHAT correlation. By using particle filters, we are able to use this secondary peak information in formulating a probability function that includes the whole of the Rp observation."}, {"heading": "3 Modeling the Manifold", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "4 Particle Filters & Normal Hedge", "text": "In this section, we briefly describe a standard particle filter algorithm related to the TDOA traceability problem.

A final step is added after the rescanning of a particle to decode it so that it lies on the model of the manifold. In the following experiments, we examine several manifold models: 1. No manifold modeling: After the rescanning step, no projection is performed. 2. Manifold modeling of fixed depth: We plant the PD tree to a fixed depth and use the leaf nodes at that depth as the manifold model. 3. Randomized manifold modeling: We grow the tree to a fixed depth and examine the path from root to leaf node in the PD tree. Then, we select one of these leaf nodes as the most suitable model at present to bring the node into a uniform shape."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "The recordings were made at 16 kHz on a 7-microphone array, which is part of an interactive display located in a large public lobby, and the room measures approximately 10m x 13m x 5m. Four of the microphones are located at the corners of the display, which is mounted on one of the walls in the room, and the three remaining microphones are located on the ceiling of the room. For more details on the microphone set-up and the room see [4, 7]. To build a PD tree, we first collected a set of TDOA vectors from our microphone array. We did this by moving a white noise source around the room, near typical places where sitting or standing people would interact with the screen. This resulted in approximately 20,000 TDOA vectors, for which we erected a PD tree of depth 2. In each node of the PD tree, we store the mean value of the training data and the uppermost k = 3 main directions. Here are the parameter settings we use for each particle size, which we follow for each person."}, {"heading": "5.2 Usage of Manifold Modeling", "text": "Since TDOAs develop more slowly when the sound source is far from each microphone, we expect this to be well modelled by the root PCA of our PDtree. In this example, we compare the tracking results with the root PCA of our PD tree against no projection step at all for both SIR particle filters (PF) and the normal hedge particle filters (NH). Figure 2 shows such a comparison. Here, we show tracking results from two pairs of microphones typical of the remaining pairs. Zpt is shown in green, where their size is represented by the size of the circle marker. The sound source moves in a continuous and slow moving path, so we would expect each TDOA coordinate to follow a continuous and slowly changing track. Trackers with the PCA projection stage are able to follow the sound source, while versions without the projection lose the source."}, {"heading": "5.3 Testing Different Manifold Models", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to abide by the rules we have set ourselves in order to comply with them, \"he told the German Press Agency in an interview with\" Welt am Sonntag \":\" It is not the first time that we have been able to maneuver ourselves into a situation in which we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in. \""}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we examine particle filtering methods for tracking TDOA vectors for moving sound sources, a key problem that needs to be solved for audio localization and PA applications. We present a model of diversity based on spatial distribution trees that alleviates the problem of high-dimensional tracking with particle filters. We also present a new version of a particle filter based on results from online learning that competes with conventional particle filters in this task and exhibits properties that are attractive for many real-world problems."}], "references": [{"title": "A tutorial on particle filters for online nonlinear/non-Gaussian Bayesian tracking", "author": ["M.
