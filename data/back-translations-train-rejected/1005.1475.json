Such games are purely rational, as they do not involve an element of chance; they are also zero sums, because the interests of the players are two-fold: what \"wins,\" the other loses - which is the origin of the Min-Max rating mechanism. The two basic questions asked in a rational game are \"Who will win?\" and \"How much will she win?.\" Answering such questions involves searching for a strategy through a (typically large) game tree. Some optimized search techniques have been developed that, in the case of combinatorial two-player games, include the formal circumcision technique [1,2]. \u03b1-\u03b2 is not an approximate algorithm: its correctness is based on the reciprocal distribution properties of Min and Max. In this work, we examine the implications of the assumption that only one player is rational and break the symmetry of traditional \"double-sided\" rationality."}, {"heading": "2 Combinatorial game syntax and semantics", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Syntax", "text": "We are talking about the \"syntax,\" alluding to the formal grammar in which some starting positions of the game are given, along with some \"rules\" that allow to derive successive positions from it: in this way, a game can be regarded as a tree of all possibilities to play it - the tree of all possible matches. Definition 1 (syntax): A game syntax or arena is a triple S = (P, \u03bb, succ), where: - P is the set of all game positions reachable from there; succ: P \u2192 {P}, says whose move it is: P for \"player\" orO for \"opponent.\" - the successor function succ to take a game position and return all theories reachable from there; succ: P \u2192 P. Given S = (P, Succ), Succ: - the number of end positions we define: - succ: the end positions PT = {cc | succ \""}, {"heading": "2.2 Semantics", "text": "Let's assume a finite game with syntax S = (P, \u03bb, succ =) finite game (> Q = >). Traditionally, the two players have exactly opposite interests and we assume that player P will try to minimize the payout of the end position, while opponent O will try to maximize it. The usual method of evaluating such a finite game is to mark the end nodes with the functions min and max (depending on the turn) and end nodes with the payout of the end position p (\u03c0). Such values are then \"propagated\" by applying the function on each node to the values of his children. The final value at the root is called play value: it says who wins and how much, assuming both players accept rational.Hence p: PT \u2192 Z in accordance with tradition, the game value vp: P \u2192 Z in accordance with the game value vp \u2192 Z could simply be defined as a function of the starting position."}, {"heading": "3 \u03b1-\u03b2 pruning", "text": "The Alpha-\u03b2 algorithm [1,2] is a method for calculating the exact value of a minimum and maximum player; < \u03b2 > \u03b2 > \u03b2 > \u03b2 > \u03b2 > \u03b2 > \u03b2 > combination game without exhaustively visiting all game positions. The Alpha-\u03b2 algorithm is traditionally presented as a recursive function written in the imperative style (see Figure 1): The Alpha-Beta function analyzes a game position \u03c0 P with two additional parameters, alpha and \u03b2, each of which denotes a kind of threshold that must not be exceeded during the incremental calculation of the value of P. Whenever the threshold exceeds the valuation of an entire sub-tree, it is aborted because it can be proven that it does not contribute to the result.The correctness of Alpha-\u03b2 is based on the algebraic properties of the minimum and maximum functions, especially their mutual laws of distribution - something we cannot count on among our weaker hypotheses."}, {"heading": "4 Tropical games", "text": "Since we are dealing with a relatively recent research topic, it is not surprising that the formalization of tropical algebra has not yet crystallized into a standard form. And, since several details differ between the various representations, we must provide our own definition: Definition 6 (tropical algebra) = (a) tropical algebra (U) is called tropical algebra if it fulfills the following properties for all a, b and c in U: (i) association of trees: a) (a) (a) tropical algebra (a) is called tropical algebra (a) if it fulfills the following properties for all a, b and c in U: (a) association of trees: a (b) c (b) is called tropical algebra (a) as a minimum the properties of trees: a tropical algebra (b).U is called as a minimum the properties of trees: a tropical algebra (ii) is defined as a minimality of computers: (c) is called algebra (x) by trees: x (b)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Soundness of tropical pruning", "text": "Proposition 3 (insertion property) without total order [3,4].

In the traditional style of Divide and Conquer, one works with non-deterministic decisions in a solution space, using a quality criterion that can be optimized and not reversed. In contrast, we present an alternative model based on tropical games. In the style of Choose-How-To-Divide and Conquer, we work with non-deterministic decisions in a solution space, using a quality criterion that needs to be optimized and \"combining\" a way. Of course, many non-deterministic algorithms can be expressed in this way: the challenge is to find a suitable match to the tropical game concepts, both in terms of syntax and semantics (with the required properties)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Parsing as a tropical game", "text": "Let G be a given context-free grammar, defined by an alphabet of terminals A a and N'X. For simplicity, there should be no pupil production, nor productions with two consecutive nonterminals or a single nonterminal on the right alone. The right side will therefore be of the form [a1] X1a2X2... anXn [an + 1], with n \u2265 0 and at least one ai. In the face of a chain of terminals s, A + is our problem to find the \"best\" parse tree of s in G; if s contains some errors, our \"best\" solution simply ends up as the least wrong, according to a metric; just to keep things simple in this example, the total size of the substrings that cannot match the terminals is minimized. Sometimes we wish to have the set of all the best parses instead of being satisfied with just one optimal solution.8 Such constraints can be removed at the cost of a certain complexity that supports a larger function."}, {"heading": "E ::= n", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "E ::= v", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "E ::= ( E )", "text": "We use min-plus algebra for A = (U, VP, VP): we simply define U, N, min, as we want to make as few errors as possible; and finally: the number of total errors in the parse tree is equal to the sum of errors in all subranges. Payout p (\u03c0) is defined as the length of the input string for player positions (note that the payout is defined only on end positions, so such a length actually corresponds to the number of non-matching characters), and zero for opposing positions (if \u03c0O = < then there are no errors to accumulate: at the top level, the player corresponds to the entire string): p (s, X), p (< >), 0.Experiments We implemented a prototype system9 in ML that supports the grammar of Figure 2, which can be configured to perform a simple exhaustive search or perform tropic strategies."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and future work", "text": "As a practical example of the technique, we have shown how the problem of approximate analysis and error localization can be modelled as a game, and how our editing technique can dramatically improve its efficiency; nevertheless, an asymptotic measurement of the number of nodes visited would be a worthwhile development. We suspect that many more problems can be formalized as tropical games, and the problem of analysis itself can definitely be addressed in a more general way by removing our grammar limitations; tropical analyses could prove to be particularly suitable for natural language problems with their inherent ambiguities; the accuracy and efficiency of parallel tropical implementations of \u03b1 circumcisions would be of particular interest to the study.It is well known that Christophe Fouquer\u00e9 first recognized tropical algebras in the properties required by our formalization."}], "references": [{"title": "The tree prune (TP) algorithm", "author": ["T.P.
