Eminent creators and laymen alike claim that by engaging in creative activities they acquire a clearer sense of themselves as unique individuals. By making artistic decisions and observing how these decisions guide subsequent thoughts about the work, which culminate in an original, creative form, they acquire self-awareness, and often remain a sense of completeness. The transformation that takes place on the canvas or on the written page is supposed to be reflected in a sense of personal transformation and self-discovery that happens without. Artists often find a style that feels as if it is \"theirs\" only after phases of exploration with various media and established styles and art forms. Likewise, writers speak of the transition from a phase in which they merely imitate the styles of authors they admire to a phase in which they discover their own authentic \"voices.\""}, {"heading": "Theories of Creativity", "text": "This section briefly summarizes some of the leading theories on the workings of the creative process and then introduces a new theory of creativity called the Honor Theory."}, {"heading": "Creativity as Heuristic Search", "text": "Inspired by the metaphor of the mind as a computer (or computer program), it has been suggested that creativity involves a process of heuristic search, in which rules of thumb guide the inspection of various states within a given state space (set of possible solutions) until a satisfactory solution is found (Eysenck, 1993; Newell, Shaw & Simon 1957; Newell & Simon 1972).heuristic search defines the relevant variables from the front; therefore, the state space is generally defined.Examples of heuristics are the division of the problem into partial problems, mountaineering (repeated modification of the current state to look more like the target state) and backward work from the target state to the starting state.One deviation from this view is the view that creativity involves heuristics, which guide the search for not a possibility within a given state space, but for a new state space itself (e.g. soil, 1990; Kaplan & Simon, 1990; Ohlsson, 1992), sometimes called a change from the problem to a mount."}, {"heading": "The Expertise View of Creativity", "text": "Some argue that creativity encompasses everyday thought processes such as remembering, planning, arguing, and restructuring; no specific or unconscious thought processes need to be postulated (Perkins, 1981; Weisberg, 2006). This is sometimes called an expert view of creativity because it emphasizes the extent to which creative actions are based on familiarity with a particular area of knowledge. Thus, this view is particularly associated with the notion that creativity is highly domain-specific; expertise in one domain is not considered an enhancement of creativity in another domain; the expert view is also associated with the notion that the creative process produces products that are largely derivative or reproductive (as Weisberg puts it) and not really new or productive."}, {"heading": "The Darwinian Theory of Creativity", "text": "While some philosophers describe the growth of knowledge as Darwinian only in the sense that presumptions must be refutable, i.e. selectively selectable against them (Popper, 1963; Lorenz, 1971), Campbell (1960) goes further and argues that a stream of creative thinking is a Darwinian process, the basic idea being that we generate new ideas through \"blind\" variation and selective maintenance (abbreviated to BVSR): \"mutation\" of contemporary thinking in many ways, selection of the most appropriate variant (s) and repetition of this process until a satisfactory idea emerges; the variants are \"blind\" in the sense that the creator has no subjective certainty as to whether they are a step towards the final creative product.At present, the Darwinian view of creativity is most closely associated with Simonton (1998, 1999a, b, 2007a, b)."}, {"heading": "The Honing Theory of Creativity", "text": "The Honing theory postulates that creativity arises from the self-organizing, self-repairing nature of a world view, and that it sharpens (and resharpens) an integrated world view through the creative process of the individual. Honing theory places the same emphasis on the outwardly visible creative outcome and the internal cognitive restructuring induced by the creative process. Indeed, one factor that sets it apart from other theories of creativity is that it focuses not only on restructuring as it relates to the conception of the task, but also on the search for the outwardly visible creative outcome and the inner cognitive restructuring of the world view as a whole."}, {"heading": "The Recognizability of Creative Style", "text": "There is no reason to expect that the act of creation will lead to a clearer or more integrated self-image, or that the work of a particular creator will be limited in a particular area, especially when it comes to creating a global consciousness."}, {"heading": "Style", "text": "The first study tested the hypothesis that people who are very familiar with the art of a particular artist will recognize other works by that artist that they have not previously encountered."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "The study was conducted with 10 students from the University of British Columbia who specialized in art that was very familiar with five well-known artists and each other's art.

Prior to the study, the paintings were examined to ensure that signatures and other identifying features were concealed.
