In addition to conflict-driven learning, the method performs a backjumping (lines 10-11) determined by a decision level k added by conflict analysis. Via decision level dl, we count decision literals, i.e. letters in A that have been heuristically selected on line 15. The initial value of dl is 0 (line 3), and it is increased on line 16 before a decision literal is added to A (line 17).

Lines 3-9 describe the propagation of units (cf. Mitchell 2005). If a conflict is detected in line 4, the propagation of units must be stopped immediately (line 5). Otherwise, line 6 determines all nodes that result in line 8 as a unit, i.e. the addition of some phrases must be added to A, because all other dictionaries in line 5 are already true inA. If there is any unit that does not lead to a good unit (line 7), A is augmented with such a unit in line 8. Note that this type of commodity is not deterministically selected and could imply several different nodes A. This non-determinism leads to our study of heuristics for conflict resolution, the selection of a resolution among the emergency systems that imply."}, {"heading": "Conflict Analysis", "text": "Algorithm 3 shows our conflict analysis procedure based on resolution. Faced with a bad decision that cannot be applied directly to line A, we note in line 2 the literal sequence of what was last added to line A. If the First UIP scheme is the only word of its decision level dl (cf. line 3), it turns out to be the most efficient and robust strategy (Zhang et al. 2001). Our conflict analysis method follows the First UIP scheme by performing conflict resolution only when it is not a UIP (tested in line 4), and otherwise the return together with the smallest decision level k on which the decision is made may prove to be the most efficient and robust strategy (Zhang et al. 2001)."}, {"heading": "Implication Graphs and Conflict Graphs", "text": "In order to present the question of selection between several different antecedents, we modify the concept of an implicit graph (Beame, Kautz, & Sabharwal 2004), because there is only an implicit definition for each implicit literal approach.

Different conflict sections correspond to different resolution schemes, in which we are particularly interested in the FirstUIP scheme.

(Zhang et al. 2001)). In view of this alternative definition of a UIP, it becomes even more obvious than before that this path is actually a UIP, which is also called load-UIP. In contrast, a literal UIP is the literal UIP when it is literally most closely associated with the conflict, the conflict being a conflict, that the first UIP solution is all UIP conflicts that are the first UIP conflicts."}, {"heading": "Heuristics", "text": "In this section, we propose several heuristics for conflict resolution, which aim at different goals."}, {"heading": "Recording Short Nogoods", "text": "Assuming that short nogoods circumscribe larger portions of the search area than longer ones, the fewer dictionaries it contains, the more attractive a first-UIPNogood looks.

In the SAT field, it has been observed that the preference for short letters in conflict resolution can lead to resolution sequences consisting largely of binary and ternary letters, so that derivative letters are not much longer than the originally injured letters (Mitchell 2005). Therefore, our first heuristic, Hshort, selects a precursor that contains the smallest number of letters among the available letters of a letter. Given the same implication diagram as Figure 1 and 2, Hshort could yield the conflict diagram shown in Figure 3, preferring precursor n7 of Tx over n8 and precursor n4 of Fw over n6 during conflict resolution."}, {"heading": "Performing Long Backjumps", "text": "By jumping backwards, CDNL can skip the exhaustive exploration of regions of the search space and possibly escape replacement regions that do not contain a solution. Therefore, it seems reasonable to aim for first-UIP nogoods in such a way that their literals belong to small decision levels, since they are the determining factor for the length of the backwards jumps. Therefore, our second heuristics, Hlex, uses a lexicographic order to classify precursors according to the decision levels of their literals. In view of a preceding \u03b4 of a literal cycle, we arrange the literals in descending order of their decision levels. The order thus obtained (\u03c31,..., \u03c3m), in the GOP-1,.. \u03c3m), induces a descending list level (\u04211) = (\u04211),."}, {"heading": "Reason", "text": "is a prefix of the planes (\u03b5) and shorter than the planes (\u03b5). Due to the last condition, Hlex also prefers a precursor plane shorter than \u03b5, provided that literals of the same decision levels as in \u03b4 are found in \u03b5. If we look at the implication diagram in Figure 1 and 2, we get levels (n8) = (3, 1) < (3, 3) = levels (n7) for the precursor plane n7 and n8 of Tx, and we have levels (n4) = (3) < (3, 2) = levels (n6) for the precursor planes n4 and n6 of Fw. By selecting precursor planes that are lexicographically the smallest, Hlex leads us to the conflict diagram shown in Figure 4. In this example, the corresponding precursor plane of UIP-Nogood, {Fp,} the precursor plane {can be reached as a short one}."}, {"heading": "Shortening Conflict Resolution", "text": "Our fourth heuristic, Hres, aims to speed up conflict resolution itself by shortening the resolution sequences. To arrive at a UIP sooner, Hres prefers precursors, so the number of literals at the current decision level is lowest dl. In our current example, Hres prefers n8 over n7, as it contains fewer literals whose decision level is 3. However, precursors n4 and n6 of Fw are indifferent, so Hres can result in either one of the conflict diagrams in Figure 4 or 5."}, {"heading": "Search Space Pruning", "text": "The heuristics shown above only rank according to structural characteristics and thus ignore their contribution to solving the actual problem in the past, which is exacerbated by the noble deletion heuristics of SAT solvers (Goldberg &"}, {"heading": "Reason", "text": "Novikov 2002; Mahajan, Fu, & Malik 2005) and clasp (Gebser et al. 2007a). Our fifth heuristics, Hactive, uses them and classifies their predecessors according to their activities.Finally, we examine a heuristic, Hprop, which stores (and prefers) the smallest decision level on which a Nogut has been produced per unit. The underlying intuition is that the number of implicit letters at small decision levels can be considered a measure of CDNL's progress, since the certificate of dissatisfaction requires conflict at decision level 0. Therefore, it might be a good idea not to favor goods that have led to implications at small decision levels."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "We have proposed a number of heuristics for conflict resolution and carried out a systematic empirical study in the context of our ASP solution brackets, but it is too early to conclude a dominant approach or make general recommendations. As noted in Mitchell 2005, conflict resolution strategies are almost certainly important, but have so far received little attention in the literature. Dedicated approaches in the SAT field (Ryan 2004; Mahajan, Fu, & Malik 2005) only aim to reduce the size of the recorded nogoods.
