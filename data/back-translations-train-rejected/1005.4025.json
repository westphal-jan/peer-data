Relevant information that is so neglected or poorly modelled relates to variables that are inherently blurred but describe the patient's state of health."}, {"heading": "1.1 WHAT IS SOFT COMPUTING?", "text": "Soft computing differs from conventional (hard) computing in that (as opposed to hard computing etc.) it calculates the exploitation of tolerance for inaccuracy, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Basically, the model for soft computing is the human mind. The guiding principle of Soft Computing (SC) is: - Fuzzy Logic (FL), Rough Logic, Soft Set Logic, Neural Computing (NC), Genetic Computing, Evolutionary Computation (EC) Machine Learning (ML) and Probabilistic Reasoning (PR), the latter being faith networks, Fractal Oftness Theory, Probability Theory, Possibility Theory Qory and Learning Theory (ML) Machine Learning (PR). \""}, {"heading": "2 THE GENERAL DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS: A", "text": "SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION The diagnostic decision-making process is a sequence of decisions made by a physician in an attempt to identify and explain the symptoms, disorders and diseases of a particular patient. This process involves placing the patient in the care of a physician and collecting and evaluating relevant information at various intermittent stages. Such information, which is obtained through discussion, observation and testing, is important for the convergence of an effective pre- and final diagnosis. Figure I illustrates this process as well as the overall decision-making process in treatment. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Siddharta Sankar Biswas with the Gurgaon Institute of Tech-nology & Management, Gurgaon."}, {"heading": "3.

Let's N be the set of diseases that are eligible for diagnosis. There is a finite set of symptoms whose symptoms i N, there is a finite set of diseases that resemble the above-mentioned aspects. This sentence includes non-medical as well as medical aspects that are referred to by physicians as diseases or disorders. Let N be the set of diseases i N, there is a finite set of diseases that resemble the above-mentioned aspects. This sentence includes non-medical aspects that are referred to as diseases or disorders. Let the group of prominent historical aspects i = the set of all prominent aspects......

This sentence has all aspects of the medical history as its elements that are relevant to this or each of the aspects present."}, {"heading": "3.2 PRESENT SYMPTOMS", "text": "Classical models begin the decision-making process with symptoms that are already designated as problem or severity. Leave \u03c0i = \u03b2 q =.... q =.... q =.... q = possible problems that could be observed or experienced by a patient with disease, where i N. Further, leave \u03c0 = U \u03c0i, i =........................, n........ (8), where n is the cardinality of N. We note that \u03c0 includes patient-related problems that occur for all eligible diseases. Elements of this set are not medically designated symptoms, but are patient descriptions such as dizziness, chest pain and inability to breathe properly. Associated with each of these problems, q, (where q \u03c0), is a number of factors that are important for the medical designation and severity of the problem. Any problem profile set q may have the following subsets of discrete information: \u00b2 q1 = {Location of the problem q2 = {Longevity of the problem q3 = persistence} of the problem {q3}."}, {"heading": "4 CONCLUSION", "text": "The above models aim to develop more complete models that are useful for the development of a reliable diagnostic decision model. Important information networks that were normally taken away in earlier mathematical models are explicitly taken into account and modelled using fuzzy set theory."}, {"heading": "4 (1974) 183- 188.", "text": "[6] C.V.
