Basic symbols are recognized by neural classifier. We have used four feature extraction techniques namely, intersection, shadow feature, chain code histogram and straight line fitting features. Shadow features are computed globally for character image while intersection features, chain code histogram features and line fitting features are computed by dividing the character image into different segments. Weighted majority voting technique is used for combining the classification decision obtained from four Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP) based classifier. On experimentation with a dataset of 4900 samples the overall recognition rate observed is 92.80% as we considered top five choices results.

Shadow characteristics are extracted from a scaled bitmapped character image. Chain characteristics are extracted by chain encoding the contour points of the scaled character image. Shadow characteristics of the character characteristics are calculated in such a way that the rectangular boundary surrounding the character image is divided into eight octants, for each octave shadow of the character segment is calculated on two perpendicular pages, so that a total of 16 shadow characteristics are achieved. Shadow characteristics are displayed on the pages, as in Form 3. These characteristics are calculated on scaled images.

Classifier Combination", "text": "The ultimate goal of pattern recognition is to combine the best possible classification performance to achieve an accurate result, which has traditionally led to the development of different classification schemes for each pattern recognition problem to solve. The result of an experimental evaluation of the different designs would then be the basis for selecting one of the classification selections as the definitive solution to the problem. It had been observed in such design studies that although one of the designs would provide the best performance of the selected classification schemes, the sets of patterns would be misclassified, which would not necessarily overlap by the different classifiers, suggesting that different classification designs would provide potentially complementary information about the pattern to be classified, which could be used to improve the performance of the selected classifier. Instead of relying on a single decision scheme, we can combine classification schemes."}, {"heading": "Tamil, Bengali, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Oriya.", "text": "In fact, it is a purely reactionary project, which is a reactionary project, which is a reactionary project, which is a reactionary project, which is reactionary, reactionary, reactionary and reactionary project."}], "references": [{"title": "Experiment with various neural Network Architecture for Handwritten Character Recognition", "author": ["Cris Koutosougeras", "akhtar Jameel"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1995}, {"title": "A Handwritten Character Recognition System Using Directional Element Feature and Asymmetric Mahalanobis Distance", "author": ["Nei Kato", "Shin\u2019ichiro Omachi", "Hirotomo Aso", "Yoshiaki Nemoto"], "venue": "IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1999}, {"title": "A Study of Zernike Moments and its use in Devnagari Handwritten Character Recognition", "author": ["Satish Kumar", "Chandan Singh"], "venue": "Intl.Conf. on Cognition and Recognition,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Recognition of Off-Line Handwritten Devnagari Characters Using Quadratic Classifier", "author": ["N.
