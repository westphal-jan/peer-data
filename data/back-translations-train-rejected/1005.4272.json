INTRODUCTIONForecasting activities play an important role in our daily life. During the last two decades, various approaches for predicting time series have been developed. Among them, ARMA models and Box Jenkins approaches are very famous. However, the classical time series predictions cannot be used to bypass the predictions of time series."}, {"heading": "Dr. S.K.Srivatsa", "text": "Senior Professor, St. Joseph's College of Engg, Jeppiaar Nagar, Chennai-600 064 Dr.S.K.Srivatsa was born on July 21, 1945 in Bangalore.
