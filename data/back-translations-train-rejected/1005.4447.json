What might its architecture look like from the position of the EA? A user communicates with the system using texts written in a high formal input language similar to the natural one. He or she presents a problem such as \"verify whether the given text is correct\" or \"how to prove the following statement,\" or \"what the given text is about,\" etc. The text, if it is syntactically correct, is dealt with by the part of the system we call \"more reasonable.\" The sensible one analyzes the problem and formulates a series of tasks that he submits to the inference machine, a tester. If the tester succeeds, the resulting conclusion (e.g., human readable evidence) is given to the user and the game is over. If it fails, a kind of \"morbid anatom\" makes a diagnosis and delivers it to the tester who tries to fix the situation. Specifically, the reasonable one can decide whether the problem can be addressed by an internal lexicon and the system can answer it."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgements", "text": "We are grateful for our teachers.
