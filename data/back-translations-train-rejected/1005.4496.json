NETWORKING AND INTRUSION DETECTION OVERVIEW", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Networking Overview", "text": "In networks, TCP / IP is widely used for network communication, which consists of four layers: application layer, transport layer, network layer and hardware layer that work together [19]. When data is transmitted through networks, the data is transferred from the top layer through intermediate layers to the bottom layer. The bottom layer sends the collected data via the physical network to its destination. The application layer sends and receives data for specific applications such as DNS, HTTP, FTP, SMTP and SNMP. It allows applications to transfer data between server and client and forwards application data to the transport layer. The transport layer is responsible for packaging data using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) so that it can be transmitted between hosts. Each TCP or UDP packet has a source port and a destination port number. The network layer or Internet protocol (the routing of the IP and the Internet protocol) is responsible for addressing and UDP data."}, {"heading": "2.2. Intrusion Detection Overview", "text": "Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring and analyzing events in computer systems or networks to detect the signals of possible incidents that attempt to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer resources. Generally, IDS uses misusebased and anomaly-based detection model for detection intrusions. Misuse-based IDS are very effective for detecting known attacks, but largely ineffective for detecting new attacks whose pattern is not yet stored in the database. It maintains a pattern that corresponds to a known attack pattern in the database. Anomaly-based IDS identifies new attacks by analyzing anomalous behavior of normal behaviors. It has a relatively high detection rate for new attacks, but produces many false Positive Positive Positives. It uses profiles that are developed by monitoring typical activities over a period of time and compares the characteristics of the current activity with thresholds related to the profile."}, {"heading": "2.3. Related Work", "text": "In the 1980s, the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) developed an Intrusion Detection Expert System (IDES) that monitors user behavior and detects suspicious events.

BASIC PROBLEMS OF LEARNING", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. Handling Noise in Dataset", "text": "This is because the performance of the learning algorithms depends on the quality of the dataset. The basic idea of dealing with noisy data during the learning period is to avoid overmatching the dataset. Noise can be handled at different stages of rule induction and interpretation, and the following examples show some typical noises that exist in the datasets.1) Missing attribute values: The easiest way to deal with missing or unknown attribute values is to replace the missing attribute value with the most common attribute value in the dataset group, while the most sophisticated method is to calculate the probability of attribute values and assign the probability value to each missing attribute value. 2) Conflicting examples appear more than once in the datasets with different class identifiers. Conflicting examples confuse the learning algorithms, so problems should be avoided or referred to as a problem before there are multiple examples."}, {"heading": "3.2. Dealing with Continuous Attribute", "text": "The aim of dealing with continuous attributes is to discretise the continuous attribute, which contains continuous values (i.e. real numbers or integers), into a number of intervals. Discretised intervals can be treated in a similar way to nominal values during learning and classification. To discretise continuous attributes, it is very important to find the right places to set interval boundaries. The simplest technique is to place the interval boundaries of continuous attribute values between each adjacent pair of attribute values that are not assigned to the same class. Suppose that the pair of adjacent values on attribute Ai are Ai1 and Ai2, \"A = (Ai1 + Ai2) / 2\" can be taken as the interval boundary. The information technology used in the ID3 algorithm is another very efficient technique for finding the most informative values on attribute Ai point to divide the values of the continuous attribute."}, {"heading": "3.3. Input Attribute Selection from Dataset", "text": "Effective selection of attributes from the dataset before learning is very important, as irrelevant and redundant attributes of the dataset can lead to complex classification models and reduce classification accuracy [29] - [36]. In complex classification domains, input attributes of the dataset may contain incorrect correlations that impede the classification process. Some attributes in the dataset may be redundant because the information they add is contained in other attributes. In addition, some additional attributes may increase computation time and have an impact on classification accuracy. Selecting attributes by data mining involves selecting a subset of attributes d from a total of D original attributes of the dataset, based on a given optimization principle that improves the performance of the classifier. Finding a useful subset of attributes is a form of searching. Ideally, search for attributes to select the best subset of attributes and sub-attributes among the candidates."}, {"heading": "4.

In this paper, we focused on developing the performance of naive Bayesian classifiers and ID3 algorithms. It was successfully tested that this hybrid algorithm minimizes false alarms and maximizes balance recognition rates on the 5 classes of the KDD99 benchmark dataset. Attacks of the KDD99 dataset were detected with 99% accuracy from proposed algorithms. Future work will focus on improving the misalignment of remote-to-user (R2L) attacks and applying this detection model to real IDS."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This research was supported by the ERIC laboratory, the University of Lumi\u00e8re Lyon 2 - France, and the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh."}], "references": [{"title": "An investigation of a compromised host on a honeynet being used to increase the security of a large enterprise network", "author": ["T.

complex. The proposed algorithm also addresses some difficulties of data mining such as handling continuous attribute, dealing with missing attribute values, and reducing noise in training data. Due to the large volumes of security audit data as well as the complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviours, several data miningbased intrusion detection techniques have been applied to network-based traffic data and host-based data in the last decades. However, there remain various issues needed to be examined towards current intrusion detection systems (IDS). We tested the performance of our proposed algorithm with existing learning algorithms by employing on the KDD99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. The experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm achieved high detection rates (DR) and significant reduce false positives (FP) for different types of network intrusions using limited computational resources.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
