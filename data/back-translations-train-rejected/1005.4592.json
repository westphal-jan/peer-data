The explanation field can provide clues to prove the Mizar proposal by using the link \"Suggest hints\" that will be inserted into the field if the EP does not find proof (see Figure 3). The button \"Suggest hints\" is linked to a Bayesian consultant trained on the entire MML (i.e. on all the evidence contained therein). (See [34] for details on how machine learning is organized in the context of a large deductive repository, such as MML. Other axiom selection systems could be used as a sugion server trained in a manner similar to the Web)."}, {"heading": "4 Future Work and Conclusions", "text": "This paper has introduced the MizAR web service, which allows Mizar users to use automated reasoning tools for their Mizar articles. MizAR is, to a certain extent, on and similar to the SystemOnTPTP service for solving first-order problems. The main differences to SystemOnTPTP are evidently the use of the Mizar language, which is oriented toward human mathematicians (and not the pure first-order logic used in SystemOnTPTP), and the discontinuation of the service in the context of the large Mizar Mathematical Library of earlier theorems, definitions, and proofs. There are obvious differences to these systems, which are provided by the large theory implementation in which Mizar formalization is usually carried out. There are several use cases described above, ranging from the use of HTMLization to the disambiguation of complicated Mizar syntax, use of ATP systems to explain Mizar examples, use of counter-examples, and provide counter-evidence for Mizar services."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2010, "abstractText": "This paper presents a combination of several automated reasoning and proof presentation tools with the Mizar system for formalization of mathematics.
