Turing in his paper [4] as follows: An interrogator questions both Turing machine and second participant of the test (a person), each of which tries to appear human. The interrogator does not know from whom exactly he receives answers and has the objective to tell the Turing machine from the person (for more details, see, for example, [3]). In this paper, we consider a formalization of the Turing test and obtain the following results (Figure 1.1):", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}}
