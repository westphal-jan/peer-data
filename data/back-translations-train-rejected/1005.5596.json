LexiconGrammar tables (Gross 1975, 1994), carefully developed by linguists since the 1970s, represent such a syntactic resource. Each table briefly represents a class of predicates that share some syntactic characteristics. However, each line corresponds to a lexical entry (verb, predictive noun, predictive adjective, adverb, fixed expression) and each column corresponds to a syntactic feature (construction, argument distribution, etc.) They are not directly usable for NLP applications because portions of the information are not formally encoded, although their informal descriptions are available in 2007 dictionaries, 2006 lexictionaries like HLP classes, 1998 lexicographs."}, {"heading": "1. Classes in the Lexicon-Grammar", "text": "While modern linguistics, under the generative influence, has tried to model human language on the basis of a rather small number of Matthieu Constant and Elsa Tolone samples, the scientists working within the framework of lexicon grammar have focused for more than thirty years on the construction of syntactic and lexical databases (Gross 1975, Boons et al. 1976, Guillet et Lecl\u00e8re 1992, Gross 1994).The lexicon-grammar methodology consists in establishing a taxonomy of syntactic semantic classes whose lexical elements share some syntactic characteristics. For example, the class 33 contains verbs that enter the construction with an indirect addition represented by preposition \u00e0. Each class encompasses all lexical elements of the class. If a verb has two meanings, it is divided into two lexical terms: the verb class 33 (see figure 1), which therefore has two xical meanings:"}, {"heading": "2. Table of classes", "text": "Some basic information in the Lexicon-Grammar classification is implicitly contained in the current version of the Lexicon-Grammar and therefore cannot be exploited by NLP tools. For example, a feature is often explicitly included in the entries of a class if its value varies from entry to entry. In particular, classes are defined on the basis of characteristics that are not explicitly included in the lexicon. These definitions are only described in the literature. To address this problem, the concept of the class table was defined as follows (Paumier 2003). Their role is to assign characteristics as far as possible to classes, i.e. if their value is constant above a class (e.g. class definition characteristics). Each row represents a class and each column represents a feature. Each cell corresponds to the validity of a feature in a class. Two cases can occur: The values depend on the entries of the class and must be assigned for each entry."}, {"heading": "3.

Discussions", "text": "The construction of the above mentioned dictionary allowed us to clearly identify the practical advantages and disadvantages of our tool. Its main advantage is the use of the class table. In practice, all the missing information is collected in a single file, rather than in as many files as possible, in order to find the definition features of each class and make them explicit. Now, one can investigate whether a particular feature is of interest to a particular class. Some new linguistic questions may arise within the dictionary grammar box."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions and future work", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced a tool for generating NLP lexicon from Lexicon Grammar tables called LGExtract. A class table is used to provide information that is missing from the classes: it makes explicit all the implicit information underlying these classes. An extraction script associates each feature with a series of reformatory operations that are enabled for each entry if the attribute value is correct. It shows that it can be used for other than verbal lexicon tables in French. We plan to use it for extracting a lexicon of frozen expressions. In the near future, we plan to convert our lexicon into a format that allows its integration within a parser on Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG)."}], "references": [{"title": "La structure des phrases simples en fran\u00e7ais : Constructions intransitives, Geneva, Switzerland: Droz", "author": ["Jean-Paul BOONS", "Alain GUILLET", "Christian.

LexiconGrammar tables (Gross 1975, 1994), carefully developed by linguists since the 70s, constitute such a syntactic resource. Each table represents a class of predicates sharing some syntactic features. Each row corresponds to a lexical entry (verb, predicative noun, predicative adjective, adverb, fixed expression) and each column corresponds to a syntactic feature (construction, argument distribution, and so on). However, they are not directly exploitable for NLP applications because pieces of information are not formally encoded although their informal descriptions are available in the literature. Some projects such as (Hathout et Namer 1998, Gardent et al. 2006, Sagot et Fort 2007, Danlos et Sagot 2009) attempted to reformat LexiconGrammar tables in a lexicon for NLP. In these projects, each class is assigned a specific configuration which encodes missing information and defines restructuration operations. For instance, each configuration in (Gardent et al. 2006) is represented by a graph that makes the class structure explicit and translates each column header into a feature structure. Nevertheless, Lexicon-Grammar tables are continually updated to be improved (e.g., addition and renaming of features) and this approach can be tedious to maintain. For example, if a same feature is added to several classes, all corresponding configurations have to be modified. In this paper, we describe LGExtract, a tool that uses a global approach. First, it relies on the so-called table of classes, which encodes pieces of information that are undefined in the original classes, especially features that are constant over a whole class. Next, as a syntactic feature has exactly one interpretation over the set of classes, our extraction script assigns to each feature a set of reformatting operations once. This paper is organized as follows. First, we briefly describe the LexiconGrammar classes and the table of classes, and their relevance to our work. Then, we present LGExtract in detail, illustrate it with a concrete example for French and discuss its main advantages and drawbacks.", "creator": "Writer"}}}
