GAME FRAMEWORK DESIGN", "text": "When the game is developed, it must be determined. The focus of the game is focused on 4, as shown in Figure 14, they consist of: The focus of the game can be only one focus or more than one focus. These are the examples of the focus of the game: 1) Game where the game can be played by more than one player. 2) Simulation, where the game can be played by more than one player. 3) Story, where each company chooses each of its stories or themes for its game, is according to the vision and mission of the company. For charming reasons, the company can make the story more than boring. 4) Simulation, by running simulations with virtual people and virtual places."}, {"heading": "5. BENCHMARKING", "text": "After discussing the architecture of the game system and the design of the game framework, we have to answer some questions, such as what the game information system is, and of course we have assumed that the information system acts as a framework for the presentation of information systems with a gaming atmosphere, in which the player can experience joy and joy and consider his transaction as fun things. This game information system can be implemented in other information systems. Other questions are what the distinction between game information systems and other information systems has to do with, and how to design the game information system differently. This answer has also answered the question of how to deal with the game information system and the game framework system itself as a differentiation with common information systems. Usual information has been conceived as serious things to do, but game information system as a happy and joyful way to get access to information systems. This answer has also answered the question of how to combine fun and entertainment with the information system."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "Since the game is different from the game information system, we need to help the player create documents or FAQs (frequently asked questions) to guide the lost player. It's a bit difficult for the first time because our culture thinks that game is associated with play and fun and is more extreme than time wasting, violence, bad habits and other negative thinking. We need time and help the player as much as we can to train the player and change old game concepts that are identical to negative habits when it comes to transactions with play and fun. A mirror game framework can be created to train the player and prepare him in the real game for real transactions with play and fun. The concept of linking game and information system will bring a new career for experts who have knowledge of game and information system. The methodology for building the game information system as a framework can be used.Implementation in a traditional information system like the new school information system shows the ability and disadvantages of the game information system itself."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "Thanks to Dr. Edmond Prakash and Dr. Nicholas Costen, who gave me inspiration for this research idea."}, {"heading": "Authors", "text": "Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from the University of Budi Luhur.
