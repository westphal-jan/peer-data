We showed that this logic can be decided in EXPSPACE and is complete for this class. The significance of this result is based on the fact that this logic is the maximum for the interpretations considered in terms of decidability. Furthermore, these results represent a non-trivial contribution to the complete classification of all fragments of Halpern and Shoham's modal interval logic. We plan to complete the study of this particular language when interpreted using other classes of orders, such as the class of all densely linearly ordered propositions or the class of all linear orders, and to refine these results also on point intervals."}], "references": [{"title": "Maintaining Knowledge About Temporal Intervals", "author": ["J.F.

We consider different combinations of the interval relations begins (B), after (A), later (L) and their inverses A, B and L. We know from previous works that the combinationABBA is decidable only when finite domains are considered (and undecidable elsewhere), and thatABB is decidable over the natural numbers. We extend these results by showing that decidability of ABB can be further extended to capture the language ABBL, which lies in between ABB and ABBA, and that turns out to be maximal w.r.t decidability over strongly discrete linear orders (e.g. finite orders, the naturals, the integers).
