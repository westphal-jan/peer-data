The algorithm performs multi-sensor data fusion and correlation which results in a 'context aware' detection system. Previous applications of the DCA have included the detection of potentially malicious port scanning activity, where it has produced high rates of true positives and low rates of false positives. In this work we aim to compare the performance of the DCA and of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) when applied to the detection of SYN port scans, through experimental analysis. A SOM is an ideal candidate for comparison as it shares similarities with the DCA in terms of the data fusion method employed. It is shown that the results of the two systems are comparable, and both produce false positives for the same processes. This shows that the DCA can produce anomaly detection results to the same standard as an established technique.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jun 2010 10:41:56 GMT  (1598kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1518v1", "38 pages, 29 figures, 10 tables, Evolutionary Intelligence"]], "COMMENTS": "38 pages, 29 figures, 10 tables, Evolutionary Intelligence", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CR cs.NE", "authors": ["julie greensmith", "jan feyereisl", "uwe aickelin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.1518"}, "pdf": {"name": "1006.1518.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Julie Greensmith", "Jan Feyereisl"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is a comparative study between two biologically inspired algorithms developed for the 21-fold purpose of anomaly detection, which results in multiple sensor data and correlation, 22 results in a \"context that perceives the detection system.\" Previous applications of the DCA have included the 23 detection methods of potentially malicious porting systems that contain scanning activities that have resulted in high rates of true 24 positives and low rates of false positives.

21 purpose of anomaly detection. The algorithm performs multi-sensor data fusion and correlation which 22 results in a \u2018context aware\u2019 detection system. Previous applications of the DCA have included the 23 detection of potentially malicious port scanning activity, where it has produced high rates of true 24 positives and low rates of false positives. In this work we aim to compare the performance of the 25 DCA and of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) when applied to the detection of SYN port scans, through 26 experimental analysis. A SOM is an ideal candidate for comparison as it shares similarities with the 27 DCA in terms of the data fusion method employed. It is shown that the results of the two systems are 28 comparable, and both produce false positives for the same processes. This shows that the DCA can 29 produce anomaly detection results to the same standard as an established technique. 30 31", "creator": "PrimoPDF http://www.primopdf.com/"}}}
