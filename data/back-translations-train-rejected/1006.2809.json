INTRODUCTION", "text": "The goal of a character recognition system is to transform a text document typed on paper into a digital format that can be manipulated by word processing software. [1] This system is required to identify a given input data / character shape by mapping it to a single character in a given character set. [2] This process may well be involved as there are several valid forms that can accept a character, largely due to the many fonts and font styles (bold, italic, etc.) that can be used. [3] The motivation behind the development of character recognition systems is inspired by its wide range of applications, including archiving documents, auto-reading checks, and reading number plates [3]. The area of handwriting recognition can be divided into two distinct approaches. The first, online, deals with the recognition of handwriting that has been captured by a touch-sensitive device or tablet-like symbol [4] and used to track it."}, {"heading": "2.

PROBLEM STATEMENT", "text": "Unlike other languages, Arabic has unique features, while other languages do not. Seven or eight languages come from this language, such as ordo, jewie and Persian script, Arabic has 28 characters, each of which can be connected in three different ways or separated depending on the case [16]. Therefore, each character can have up to four different shapes depending on its position. Furthermore, Arabic characters have different heights, which hinders noise detection."}, {"heading": "4. METHODOLOGY", "text": "Machine Learning: This approach includes Machine Learning (ML) techniques, where classification rules are automatically created by using information from labeled (already classified) texts. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Neural Network is an artificial intelligence technique that simulates the way the human brain learns to recognize different patterns. ANNs were introduced in 1943 by McCulloch and Pitts. ANN is trainable algorithms that can \"learn\" from training data to solve complex problems that consist of a series of pairs. \u00a9 2010 JCSEhttp: / / sites.google.com / site / jcseuk / of inputs and desired outputs (targets). ANN has been successfully applied in many areas, including speech recognition, image processing and adaptive control. You can be trained to perform a specific task such as prediction and classification. ANN consists of interconnected processing elements that are called neurons that work together to create algorithms that are a large output."}, {"heading": "5.
