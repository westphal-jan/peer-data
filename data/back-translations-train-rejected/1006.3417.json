In a regular fictitious play process, each player makes a maximum likelihood estimate of her opponent's mixed strategy, which results in a time-varying update based on the previous estimate and current action. In this paper, we explore an alternative scheme for frequency update, whose mean dynamic is instead time-invariant.

For the specific implementation shown in Algorithm 2, the step size is either fixed or halved based on the variance in empirical frequency in the previous time window."}, {"heading": "V. SIMULATION RESULTS", "text": "In this section we present some simulation results for TIFU-FP and AFP, where the payout matrices and entropy coefficients are set to the values M1 = (1 5 3 2), M2 = (4 1 3 5), \u03c41 = 0.5, \u03c42 = 0.3. The Nash equilibrium of static play is (0.79, 0.21) and (0.47, 0.53). The local stability threshold (the RHS of the equation (19) is \u03b70 = 0.2536.

Fictitious Play with Time Invariant Frequency Update", "text": "Some simulation results for the mean dynamics of TIFUFP (equations (14)) are given in Figures 2 and 3. If \u03b7 = 0.25 < \u03b70 = 0.2536, the estimated frequencies are shown in Figure 2. However, the simulation results show that both estimated frequencies and empirical frequencies (which are not shown here due to space constraints) approach the NE as expected. However, if \u03b7 = \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 0 the estimated frequencies do not converge any more. Thus, these simulations confirm the theoretical result in Theorem 1. It is also worth noting that the empirical frequencies in Figure 4 still approach the empirical frequencies in Figure E = 0.26. In contrast to the average dynamics, a stochastic TIFU-FP process (generated with algorithm 1) shows significant random fluctuations on Figure 1. The graph shown in Figure 1 shows the estimated frequencies in such frequencies at 4, the estimated frequencies in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "B. Adaptive Fictitious Play", "text": "Some simulation results for adaptive FP are shown in Figures 6 and 7. The payout matrices and entropy coefficients are the same as in V-A. The initial and minimum step sizes are chosen as \u03b70 = 0.1 and \u03b7min = 0.0005, respectively. The time window for updating the step size is T = 50 steps. The evolution of the empirical frequencies is shown in Figure 6, which shows that adaptive FP converges faster than stochastic FP with time-varying frequency update (TVFU-FP) (Figure 5). However, we note that it is possible to include a decreasing step size in TVFU-FP (which was originally 1 / k) in order to allow the TVFU-FP process to converge faster [11]. The update of the step size in adaptive FP is shown in Figure 7."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this thesis, we have introduced a time-invariant scheme to estimate the frequency of the opponent's actions in a fictitious two-tiered game process. We have demonstrated the local stability of the unique Nash balance for the middle version of this FP dynamics. This frequency update scheme, when used adaptively, allows players to move closer to the Nash balance more quickly. For this two-player FP with two actions, conditions for global stability, if they exist, have yet to be found. Also, it is a fascinating research extension to have more than two possible actions for each player."}], "references": [{"title": "A game theoretic approach to decision and analysis in network intrusion detection", "author": ["T.
