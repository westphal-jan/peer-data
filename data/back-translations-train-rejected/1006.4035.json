Alternatively, discrete event and agent-based models are approaches that allow the development of simulation models of heterogeneous imbalance systems to try out different scenarios.

It allows clarification of a theory and investigation of its effects. SD usually uses three different types of simulation models to understand the behavior of organizational systems, each of which has its own scope: system dynamics (SD), differentiated simulations (DES), and ABS. The analyst must identify the key variables variables that define the behavior of the system, and these are then determined by coupled, differentiated equations."}, {"heading": "2.2 COMPARING APPROACHES", "text": "In fact, it is that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able to change the world, and that we are able to change the world in order to change the world."}, {"heading": "2.3 RELATED RESEARCH", "text": "For example, Said et al (2002) developed an ABS composed of a virtual consumer population to examine the impact of marketing strategies in a competing market context; a similar approach was used by Baxter et al (2003), who developed an intelligent customer relationship management tool that takes into account the communication of customer experiences between members of a social network and incorporates the strong impact of word of mouth on the adoption of products and services; a very different facet of consumer behaviour is presented by Kitazawa and Batty (2004), who examine the retail movements of shoppers in a large shopping mall; there are many other examples where ABM was used to investigate consumer behaviour (e.g. Cao, 1999; Csik, 2003; Jager et al, 2000; Baydar et al, 2003) or whole consumer market behaviour (e.g. Vriend, 1995; Twomey and Cadman, 2002; Said and Bouron, 2001; Korarov, 2004; Jenk, 2001 and Jenk, 2007)."}, {"heading": "2.4 OUR CHOICE", "text": "When modeling personnel management practices in the OR, one is mainly interested in the relationships between employees and customers, but it is equally important to take into account parts of the operational structure of the system in order to allow a realistic assessment of system performance and customer satisfaction. Therefore, we have opted for our simulation approach for a mixed DEM and ABM approach. A queue system is used to model the operational structure of the system, while people within the system are modeled as autonomous units (agents) to take into account the chastity caused by human decision-making. This will also allow us to take into account the long-term effects of service quality on customer decision-making processes, both important components in designing a tool for the exploration of person-centered systems. The application of a mixed DEM and ABM approach has proven to be quite successful in areas such as manufacturing and supply chain modeling (e.g. Parunak et al, 1998; Darley et al, 2006, as well as modelling in the field of mass modeling, most of them are considered to be beyond the modelling of Cinnamon)."}, {"heading": "3 MODEL", "text": "When modeling people within a system, it is important to bear in mind that there are differences in the way ABM is applied in different fields of research with respect to its empirical embedding. Boero and Squazzoni (2005) distinguish between three different levels, characterized inter alia by the level of empirical data used for input modeling and model validation: case-based models (for the study of specific circumscribed empirical phenomena), typifications (for the study of certain classes of empirical phenomena), and theoretical abstractions (purely theoretical models) While case-based models generally use empirical data for input modeling as well as model-based simulation theoretical abstractions without empirical data at all. Social science simulation applications tend to be more oriented at the lower end of this scale (theoretical abstractions) OR applications are usually located at the upper end (case-based). This implies that there is a difference in knowledge and interest in the outcome of the researchers."}, {"heading": "3.1 KNOWLEDGE GATHERING", "text": "The case studies included extensive data collection techniques, which include participant observation, semi-structured interviews with team members, management and human resources, completing questionnaires about the effectiveness of retail management practices, and analyzing corporate data and reports. Research results were consolidated and returned (through reporting and presentation) to employees with extensive experience and knowledge of the four departments to confirm our understanding and conclusions. To ensure that our findings regarding the application of management practices are applicable to a variety of departments, we have selected two different types of case study departments that are substantially different, not only in terms of how they are served, but also in terms of their customer base and staffing. To ensure that our results regarding the application of management practices are applicable to a variety of departments, the choice of customers is two types of case studies that are substantially different from the purchase departments: the purchase departments are more likely to be the purchase departments, rather than the purchase departments."}, {"heading": "3.2 CONCEPTUAL MODELLING", "text": "Based on the results of our evaluation of alternative modeling techniques in the background and on what we have learned from our case studies, we have designed conceptual models of the system under investigation and the actors within the system."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Concept for the simulation model", "text": "The original idea for our ManPraSim and its components is in Figure 1. With regard to system inputs, we use different types of agents (customers, sales reps and managers), each with different relevant attributes. In addition, we define some global parameters that can affect every aspect of the system. At the core of our simulation model is a dynamic system representation, including visualization of system and agent states, to monitor both agent interactions and system performance at runtime. The simulation model also includes a user interface that enables a form of user interaction (changing parameters) before and during runtime. On the output side, we may observe some occurring behaviors at the macro level, although this is not our primary goal. What we are mainly interested in are the standard system services such as transactions, employee utilization and a certain degree of customer satisfaction. In addition, we want to use the simulation output to identify bottlenecks in the system and thus be helpful in modeling the system."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Concepts for the agents", "text": "We have used state diagrams for the conceptual design of our agents. State diagrams show the various states in which an entity may be located, and define the events that cause a transition from one state to another. This is exactly the information we need to represent our agents at a later stage within the simulation environment. We have found that this graphic representation is a useful part of the process of agent design, because it is easier for an expert in the real system (who is not an expert in ABM) to quickly take over the conceptualization of the model and provide a useful validation of the model component structures and contents. The design and construction of a model is to some extent subjective, and the model must selectively simplify and abstract from the real scenario in order to create a useful model (Shannon, 1975). A model is always a limited copy of the real world, and an effective model consists of only the key components of the system geared to our case, and the components of the system that are in our case."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 Concept for measure of service perception", "text": "This new metric is necessary because existing indices such as waiting times or service times are less useful than production activities in modeling services. Essentially, purely quantitative metrics disregard the quality of service, which is arguably the most important when looking at retail productivity. The inevitable trade-off between quality and quantity is particularly evident when customers and employees are facing each other, so we consider this metric of quality in conjunction with other quantities. Historically, customer satisfaction has been defined and measured in terms of customer satisfaction with a purchased product (Yi, 1990). The development of more refined metrics has evolved to take into account customers \"assessments of the overall relationship with the retail organization, and a central component of this is service interaction. In fact, empirical evidence suggests that quality is more important to customer satisfaction than price or value for money (Fornell et al, 1996), and extensive evidence indicates that customer satisfaction can be considered at a customer interaction and a customer level."}, {"heading": "3.3 EMPIRICAL DATA", "text": "However, as we explained in Section 3, we have taken a different approach, creating a population with individual differences between actors that reflect the variability of attitudes and behavior of their real human counterparts. Our frequency distributions are modeled as triangular distributions that provide the time that an event lasts. We have chosen triangular distributions here to reflect the variability of attitudes and behavior of their real human counterparts. Our frequency distributions are modeled as triangular distributions that use the time that an event lasts. We have chosen triangular distributions here because we have only a relatively small sample of empirical data and have a triangular distribution."}, {"heading": "3.4 IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "Our conceptual models were implemented in AnyLogic \u2122 v5.5. This is a Java \u2122 -based multi-paradigm simulation software (XJTEK, 2005) that supports the development of mixed D and AB models. It allows to replace passive objects from the DE model with active objects (agents), which in our case represent the actors of the real world system. As mentioned in Section 1, the simulation model was developed in two major steps, each of which is related to one of the research questions. However, in a first step, we have developed a relatively simple functional representation of the real system. In this simulation model, the agents are largely homogeneous and without memory, making it impossible to investigate the long-term effects of human resource management practices on the satisfaction of the individual customer. However, this simulation model proved useful for studying certain aspects of the industry and for conducting some experiments to study the effects of various human resource management practices at the strategic level, we have added some additional features to the second step of the simulation model."}, {"heading": "3.4.1 The main concept", "text": "The simulation model presented here is able to represent customers, service personnel (with different expertise) and managers. Figure 3 shows a screenshot of our customer and employee agent templates in AnyLogic \u2122. Boxes represent states, arrow crossings, arrows with a dot on top entry points, circles with a B inside the stores, and the numbers represent satisfaction weights. Service employees and managers use the same template, only their responsibilities and priorities differ. The system (i.e. the department) is implemented as a series of queues, each served by dedicated employees. At the beginning of each simulation run, a customer pool is created representing a population of potential customers who can visit the simulated department on an unspecified number of occasions. Once the simulation (i.e. the department) has been started, customers are selected at a specified price (customer arrival rate) and then released into the simulated department for shopping (the customer blocks are available to help them make the appropriate ones)."}, {"heading": "3.4.2 Special features", "text": "There are certain peak times when the pressure on employees is higher, which means higher work requirements and results in different service hours. For example, many more customers visit the store compared to the average weekday. In ManPraSim v2, we have recorded these real time fluctuations in customer requirements, from daily variations to opening hours. It includes the calculated hourly footprints for each of the four case departments for each hour of the day and each day of the week, based on the transaction data recorded by the company. Conversion rate is based on employee estimates and data from a leading UK retail database. The gaps between customer arrivals are based on exponential distributions that account for further variations in the weekly footprints. In real life, customers show certain shopping data that they have certain shopping habits."}, {"heading": "3.4.3 Testing the model", "text": "It turned out that conducting the experiments with the data we had gathered during our case study did not allow us to be satisfactorily consistent with the performance data of the real system. On paper, these real rotations suggested that all the employees were doing exactly the same work throughout the day, but we knew that working with and observing the employees in the case study involved a variety of activities, with the employees in the real organization splitting their time between competing tasks such as customer service, inventory renewal, and money taking. Our simulation model included only one type of work per employee that we were able to detect and evaluate."}, {"heading": "4 EXPERIMENTS", "text": "As mentioned above, our simulation model was developed in two major steps. After completing the first step, we conducted a series of experiments to examine the usefulness of the simulation model developed to investigate the impact of personnel management practices on productivity and customer satisfaction (Siebers et al, 2007a; 2007b). We examined the following scenarios: \u2022 Store operations: (1) varying the number of open checkouts and thus the roles of staff (as we kept overall staffing levels constant) to assess the impact on the performance of the department. (2) Testing the impact of staff availability on customer satisfaction. \u2022 Empowerment: (1) varying the extent to which a cashier can independently decide whether or not to make a customer refund. \u2022 Testing the impact of incompetent staff who decide whether or not to stay with his or her customer when the customer needs advice from an expert."}, {"heading": "4.1 TESTING THE CUSTOMER POOL IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "To test the customer pool implementation of ManPraSim v2, we repeated the first of the above experiments with our latest model, and our reasoning behind this experiment is that proper implementation should give us similar results as before with the older version, if we use an even mix of all five available customer types."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Experiment description", "text": "Our case study work helped us identify some differentiating characteristics of the two department types in the study (e.g. customer arrival rates and service times).In the experiment, we investigated the impact of these individual characteristics on the number of transactions and two customer satisfaction indices. During the experiment, we kept the total number of customer resources constant at ten, and we performed 20 replications for each model configuration to enable the application of rigorous statistical techniques."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Hypotheses", "text": "In general, we forecast a similar number of transactions for both simulation models as for a generic customer. However, we predict a change in the number of satisfied customers: we expect the results to shift from neutral to satisfied or dissatisfied. This polarization of customer satisfaction is expected because ManPraSim v2 allows the re-entry of the customer population into the system and each re-entry increases the likelihood of neutral customers shifting to satisfied or dissatisfied. Looking at the overall satisfaction level, we would expect similar trends for v1 and v2, but we predict that the magnitude of the results for v2 will be significantly higher, because it includes a cumulative history of satisfaction trends for customers who have returned to the department several times, as opposed to v1, where satisfaction levels are recorded only single, independent visits."}, {"heading": "4.1.3 Results", "text": "The descriptive statistics for ManPraSim v1 and v2 are shown in Table 4, and the graphs of the results in Figure 4. Looking at the number of transactions for both departments, it is clear that both simulation models produce a very similar pattern of results; the number of satisfied customers is higher across all conditions in both departments for ManPraSim v2. This is, as predicted, and interestingly, a very high level of satisfaction can be observed, particularly in the WW. We attribute this to the higher transaction volumes in WW together with our expectations for v2, which leads to a higher level of customer satisfaction as customers visit the branch several times and profess polarized opinions. Considering the overall level of satisfaction, our hypotheses hold; the results for both departments clearly follow the same trends regardless of the simulation model version. In summary, all results are as predicted."}, {"heading": "4.1.4 Required model improvement", "text": "With the introduction of a limited population (represented by our customer pool), we had to rethink the way in which we collect statistics on customer satisfaction. Previously, a customer's lifespan was a single visit to the department, and at the end of their visit, the customer's satisfaction value (direction and value) was recorded. Now, a customer's lifespan lasts the entire duration of the simulation, and he or she can be selected several times to visit the store during that period. Our previous customer satisfaction metrics now collect some other information: satisfaction taking into account the customer's cumulative satisfaction history. These metrics do not reflect the individual's satisfaction with the current service experience, but rather satisfaction with the overall service experience throughout the agent's lifespan. In addition, they are distorted to some extent, as an indifferent rating quickly turns into satisfaction or dissatisfaction (probably this is realistic because most people like to pass judgment on the entire service experience during the agent's lifespan)."}, {"heading": "4.2 TESTING THE CUSTOMER TYPE IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "The main purpose of this experiment is to test the sensitivity of the simulation results to our newly defined customer types. In addition, we are using this experiment to test the robustness of our new metrics per visit to show how useful these new metrics are."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Experiment description", "text": "In our second experiment, we used this real customer configuration among other variations to configure the customer population.A total of seven customer configurations are tested for both types of shop.The composition of each configuration is shown in Table 5. The first five configurations (a-e) are extreme customer configurations, which occur when 100% of the customer population behaves according to the same customer.Extreme configurations amplify the impact of differences between the behavior of different customer types. For the last two configurations, (f) an equal composition of each customer type and (g) uses a real customer split reported by managers of the case study department.The size of the customer pool is maintained at 10,000 for each model configuration, and 20 replications are performed for each model configuration to allow for more statistical application."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Hypotheses", "text": "For our sensitivity analysis, we are particularly interested in the comparisons between the individual departments and the individual departments."}, {"heading": "4.2.3 Results", "text": "In fact: It is not the first time that we are in a situation in which we are in a situation in which we are in a situation in which we are able to claim that we are in a position in which we are able to change the world, and in which we are able to change the world in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we live, that we"}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Dei eeisrcnlhEe\u00fccnlhsrteee\u00fccnlhsrrrlhsrtee\u00fccsrlhsrteee\u00fccnlhsrteeeeeiD rf\u00fc ide eeisrrrteeVnlrrrteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"}], "references": [{"title": "A queuing control model for retail services having back room operations and cross-trained workers", "author": ["O Berman", "C Larson R"], "venue": "J (eds.)

Furthermore, problems often occur through a lack of adequate empirical data; it has been questioned whether a model can be considered a scientific representation of a system when it has not been built with 100% objective, measurable data. However, many of the variables built into a system cannot be quantified objectively. In such cases, expertly-validated estimates offer a unique solution to the problem.

Alternatively, discrete event and agent-based modelling are approaches that allow the development of simulation models of heterogeneous non-equilibrium systems for testing out different scenarios. When developing simulation models one has to abstract and simplify from the real world, which means that one has to try and capture the \u2018essence\u2019 of the system required for developing a representation of the mechanisms that drive the progression in the real system. Simulation models can be developed at different levels of abstraction. To know the appropriate level of abstraction for a specific application is often more of an art than a science. We have developed a retail branch simulation model to investigate which level of model accuracy is required for such a model to obtain meaningful results for practitioners.", "creator": "PrimoPDF http://www.primopdf.com/"}}}
