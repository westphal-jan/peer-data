In this endeavor, many probabilistic logics have been developed. ProbLog is a recent probabilistic extension of Prolog motivated by the mining of large biological networks. In ProbLog, facts can be labeled with probabilities. These facts are treated as mutually independent random variables that indicate whether these facts belong to a randomly sampled program. Different kinds of queries can be posed to ProbLog programs. We introduce algorithms that allow the efficient execution of these queries, discuss their implementation on top of the YAP-Prolog system, and evaluate their performance in the context of large networks of biological entities.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jun 2010 08:05:34 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4442v1", "28 pages; To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]], "COMMENTS": "28 pages; To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.LG cs.LO", "authors": ["angelika kimmig", "bart demoen", "luc de raedt", "v\\'itor santos costa", "ricardo rocha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.4442"}, "pdf": {"name": "1006.4442.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the Implementation of the Probabilistic Logic Programming Language ProbLog", "authors": ["Angelika Kimmig", "Bart Demoen", "Luc De Raedt", "Ricardo Rocha"], "emails": ["Angelika.Kimmig@cs.kuleuven.be)", "Bart.Demoen@cs.kuleuven.be)", "Luc.DeRaedt@cs.kuleuven.be)", "vsc@dcc.fc.up.pt)", "ricroc@dcc.fc.up.pt)"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In recent years, it has been shown that people are able to survive on their own, and that they are able to survive on their own if they do not.

Grounding identifiers are based on the fact statement supplemented by an earthing number, i.e. 5 1 and 5 2 would refer to different earths of the ungrounded fact with the identifier 5. In our implementation, the queue is stored in a traceable global variable, which is updated by adding an identifier for the current ProbLog fact to the evidence. Therefore, we use Prolog's background tracking mechanism to avoid recalculation of common evidence for prefixes when we examine the space of evidence.

It receives a query q, an acceptance threshold \u03b4p =, and a constant m to determine the number of samples generated per iteration. At the end of each iteration, it estimates the probability p as a fraction of the programs sampled over all previous iterations that carried the query, and the confidence interval width to be used in the stop criterion, as explained in Section 3.2.3. Monte Carlo execution differs significantly from the previously discussed approaches, as the two main steps (a) are the generation of an example program and (b) the execution of the standard refutation on the sample. So, instead of combining a large number of proofs, we need a large number of different programs or samples. Our first approach was to generate a complete sample and verify for proof. To speed up the process, evidence f was cached in a trie to jump to a new sample."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "We conducted experiments with our implementation of ProbLog in the context of the biological network we have applied as we apply it (Sevon et al. 2006), using two subgraphs evaluated around three known genes to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (HGNC numbers 983, 620 and 582), as well as the complete network. The smaller graphs were used for the best paths of length 2 (resulting in a small network in which probabilities of success of length 3 can be calculated), starting from one of the three genes. Small contains 79 nodes and 144 edges, medium 5220 nodes and 11532 edges. We used Small for a first comparison of our algorithms on a small network in which probabilities of success can be calculated accurately. Scalability was assessed with both medium and with the entire biomine network with approximately 1,000,000 nodes and 6,000,000 edges. In all the experiments we evaluated the probabilities that are associated with each other, we found the two nodes above."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "ProbLog is a simple but elegant type of programming language that allows an explicit representation of uncertainties based on probability factors that prove to be inevitable. Language is a simple and natural extension of the Prolog logical programming language. We have an efficient implementation of the ProbLog language at the top of the ProbLog system, which is designed for major problems. We have shown that ProbLog can fall back on both explanations and approximations of probabilities of success in a large database. To the best of our knowledge, ProbLog is the first example of a likely programming language that can access such large databases."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank Hannu Toivonen, Bernd Gutmann and Kristian Kersting for their many contributions to ProbLog, the biomine team for the application and Theofrastos Mantadelis for the development of SimpleCUDD.
