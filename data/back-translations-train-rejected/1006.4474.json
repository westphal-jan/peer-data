CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We reported on a formalization case study in which we use the STEX format, a document formatting system and a specification platform for semantic mathematical vocabulary, on a document corpus of software engineering. In order to master the multidimensional semantic structure implicit in the document collection, we expanded STEX to a markup platform for semi-formal ontologies and linked data called STEX + (in our case semi-formal documents with RDFabased metadata annotations). The most important observation from our case study is that when we use STEX + as a human- and document-oriented frontend for linked data documents, we can approach the formalization of semi-formal document collections as a process of \"document and ontology development,\" where (in our case) documents are semantically preloaded with inter- and intra-documentary relationships whose meaning is given by project-specific, or metadology."}, {"heading": "8.
