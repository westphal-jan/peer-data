This research represents a novel method of online diagnosis, in which the expert system, based on the selection of the problem area / problem, indicates a symptom from which the user must choose symptoms. By selecting the symptoms, some questions are asked again to the user. Depending on the choice of answer, the expert blurred diagnosis of diseases based on his knowledge, adding the catalyst factor (if any), rank and give the result in a blurred form. As the blurred expert system deals with uncertainty and vague terms, it is generously accepted in various areas of life [1]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows - Section 2 highlights the background study."}, {"heading": "2 BACKGROUND STUDY", "text": "In other words, knowledge is the sum of what is currently known [2]. The diagnostic system is a system that can diagnose diseases by trying out the symptoms [3]. Uncertainty management is an intrinsically important problem in the design of expert systems, because much of the information in the knowledge base of a typical expert system is inaccurate, incomplete, or not entirely reliable. [4] An expert system that uses fuzzy logic instead of Boolean logic is known as the fuzzy expert system. A fuzzy expert system is a collection of unclear rules and member functions that are used for reason."}, {"heading": "3 PROPOSED FUZZY EXPERT SYSTEM FOR HUMAN DISEASE DIAGNOSIS", "text": "Different diagnostic strategies have been studied, various e-health websites have been searched, papers and articles on e-health management have been read and various diagnostic tools have been used, important information has been noted such as what information they collect from the user / patient and what approach they take in diagnosing them, information (symptoms, signs, etc.) has been collected about different diseases for a particular category as a sample [8, 9, 10]. Comparative analysis has been carried out to determine which symptoms are the most important symptoms for certain diseases, i.e. that the symptom must be present, its severity, etc. Then, few physicians with different expertise in their field have been asked about these diseases and their symptoms, what factors they take into account when diagnosing diseases, what approach they follow. After studying and comparing what is achieved through consultation with different physicians, what factors they look at while diagnosing diseases, what approach they take, it is determined that they are mathematically identical to the system (3.Then a uniform structure and a system is created)."}, {"heading": "4 EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM", "text": "A computer program that can be performed in a narrow problem area is referred to as an expert system = 1). Basic features of expert systems are [1]: Use knowledge instead of data Knowledge is encrypted and maintained as an entity separate from the control program Ability to explain how a certain diagnosis confidence range is achieved and why requested information is needed. Use symbolic representation and perform conclusions by symbolic computationNow, when the characteristics of the proposed system are observed, it is seen that it is performed in a narrow problem area (diagnostic diseases only) at human expert level (such as doctors). It uses knowledge to make diagnostic decisions; the knowledge is given by some expert physicians. It can also explain how a certain decision is made, which is an expert system. Since it uses knowledge base for decision making, so it is also knowledge base for decision making, so it is based on expert system. The proposed online knowledge base diagnostic system is similar to a blurred expert system as it is."}, {"heading": "4 CONCLUSION", "text": "E-applications play a dominant role in the field of overwhelming Internet technology. Knowledge-based applications are the characteristics of the latest online technology. Knowledge-based online diagnostic systems offered can play a crucial role for the users of the system. It makes it easier for users to quickly determine their likely diseases with the help of a knowledge-based expert system. As the knowledge base is based on feedback from experts and specialized doctors, users can also rely on it."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors would like to thank Prof. Dr. Md.
