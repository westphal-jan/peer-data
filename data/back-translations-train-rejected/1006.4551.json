The vague sets theory has arisen as the answer to an illegibility of language the reasonable subject speaks. Language of a reasonable subject is generated by vague events which are created by the reason and which are operated by the mind. The theory of vague sets represents an attempt to find such approximation of vague grouping which would be more convenient, than the classical theory of sets in situations where the natural language plays a significant role.

For each such generalization, one (or more) additional edge is added to the fuzzy theory with specialized type of goal and goal. Thus, a number of higher order elements are now in literature and are applied in the corres. While fuzzy sets are applicable to each of these applications, higher fuzzy sets cannot be applied."}, {"heading": "X\u00a0 \u2026\u00a0 ],[  ba \u00a0 \u2026\u00a0 ],[  ba \u00a0 \u2026\u00a0", "text": "In our example, we consider a set of elements of a matrix of selected events generated by the set X], {MxxM define vague events Mxx ~ and form the set of M-vague events generated by the set X, and the set of M-vague events generated by the set X, and form the set of M-vague events, {Mbax is the set of young men and women that is generated by the set of M-vague events generated by the set X.

CONCLUSION", "text": "The theory of vague events is one of the directions of uniformity [4] and convincingly demonstrates the efficiency of event theory in knowing the phenomena and processes in which the rational subject plays the leading role. Of course, the contingency theory of vague events mathematically proves and extends Gau and Buehrer's theory of vagrants as an approach to the mathematical description of uncertainty. In this paper, a very simple example of eventological formalizations of a linguistic variable is considered."}], "references": [{"title": "The concept of linguistic variable and its application to approximate reasoning", "author": ["L.A.
