To solve this problem, they have to be reconciled [3, 9]. For orientation, the semantic similarities between the concepts of ontologies are determined. As they determine similarities, the semantics, structural, taxonomic and contextual perspectives of concepts are taken into account [5]. The structure-level techniques of ontology compare similarities of concepts based on different criteria as listed in the previous section. According to [8], two concepts are similar when their direct superconcepts are similar. In [12], [14] it can be stated that two concepts are similar."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE", "text": "As already mentioned, our proposed technique calculates the similarity between concepts of two ontologies based on criteria. At least one superconcept from both concepts involved in the matching process must be similar. There is no need to find similarities between subconcepts, siblings and their interactions with other concepts in their respective ontologies. Here, we only include algorithms for extracting superconcepts and their agreement. Algorithms for concepts of sibling agreement, sub-concepts and other interacting objects of both concepts involved in the measurement of similarity are omitted here because, according to our proposed criteria, all of these are optional. To evaluate the level of similarity, we are also working on these aspects. Our proposed technique works in three steps: (i) concepts extraction (ii) superconcepts extraction (iii) superconcepts extraction (iii) matching. This technique works on the assumption that both ontologies are defined in the web ontology."}, {"heading": "4.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a very simple and generic technique to determine the similarity between concepts of two ontologies. All the superconcepts of each concept that was to be aligned and its interaction with other concepts of two ontologies were grouped into separate vectors. Then, the matching process was performed according to proposed algorithms and it was determined manually and by the logic of the algorithm that a concept of ontology A was similar to a concept of ontology B, although there were some differences in their respective superconcepts, sibling concepts, sub-concepts and their interaction with other objects. The proposed technique can be expanded to handle the granularity and level of similarities. Primitive features of concepts can also be included while their similarities are measured."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "This research was supported by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan and the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore."}], "references": [{"title": "Ontology matching, ", "author": ["J.Euzenat", "P.
