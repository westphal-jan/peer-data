[36] These are computer programs called \"applications\": self-descriptive, self-contained applications whose function is to automatically share information with other applications over the Internet. Some weaknesses, such as surfing information without regard to its meaning, have recently appeared in Web Services. This creates the need for a new Web with greater relevance to the user. Semantic Web is in fact an extension of the current one by making information more meaningful for people and computers alike. It allows the description of content and services in machine-readable form and allows the annotation, discovery, publication and composition of services that are to be automated. It was developed on the basis of ontology, which is considered the backbone of the semantic Web. In other words, the current Web is being transformed from machine-readable to machine-readable systems that are interactive."}, {"heading": "2. WEB SERVICE", "text": "A web service [36] is a self-descriptive software program that uses stand-alone applications and is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) used to exchange information between applications over the Internet. Access and retrieval of information from the Web is done via the HTTP protocol. One of the first languages used for the Internet is HTML, a markup language used to describe the document structure. The Web can be designed as a huge library containing a large amount of information or data - unfortunately without reasonable representation capabilities. The usual web service scenario [36] can be described by the three actions Publish, Tie, and Find, and three actors: the service requester, the service provider, and the register where services can be published, promoted, and sometimes localized. In other words, service providers describe and advertise their services in the register, while service requesters browse the registry for services that meet their needs."}, {"heading": "3 SEMANTIC WEB", "text": "There are two future scenarios in the development of the Internet, the first of which is to improve its usability as a collaborative medium, and the second is to ensure that its content can be understood by machines. Providing annotation data will facilitate this second goal. Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the WWW and worked on the Semantic Web, explains that the latter \"is not a separate Web, but an extension of the current one in which information has a well-defined meaning that makes it possible to work in cooperation.\" The Semantic Web [16] is characterized by an important representation of information for people and computers that provide a description of its content."}, {"heading": "4 ONTOLOGY", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive themselves are not able to survive themselves, \"he told the German Press Agency in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAZ)."}, {"heading": "4.2 STRUCTURE OF ONTOLOGY", "text": "Generally speaking, the structure of an ontology [28] is called 5 \u2010 tuple O: = (C, HC, R, HR, I), where C represents a set of concepts (instances of \"rdf: class\"). These concepts are arranged with a corresponding subsusumption hierarchy HC. R represents a set of relationships that correlate concepts (instances of \"rdf: property\"). Ri R and Ri C \u00d7 C. HC represents a hierarchy of concepts in the form of a relationship (a binary relationship that corresponds to \"rdfs: subClassOf\"). HC C \u00d7 C, where HC (C2) denotes that C2 is a subconcept of relationships. HR represents a relational hierarchy in the form of a relationship HR \u00d7 R, in which HR (R1, R2) denotes that R1 is a subrelation of R2."}, {"heading": "4.3 ONTOLOGY APPLICATIONS", "text": "Over the years, ontology has become a popular research topic in a number of disciplines with the aim of building consensus in a particular area of knowledge. Ontology also leads to the exchange of knowledge between systems and humans. The semantic web represents data in a machine form that is considered an extension of the current network. Semantic web discovery plays a key role in the area of information exchange in distributed environments."}, {"heading": "4.4 ONTOLOGY INTEROPERABILITY", "text": "This section describes different surgical sonontologies."}, {"heading": "4.4.1 ONTOLOGY TRANSFORMATION AND TRANSLATION", "text": "Ontology transformation [6, 9] is the process by which a new ontology is developed to meet the new requirements that an existing ontology sets for a new purpose by using a transformational function t. In this process, many changes are possible, including changes in the semantics of ontology and changes in representational formalism. Ontology translation is the function of translating the representational formalism of an ontology while maintaining the same semantics. In other words, it is the process of changing or modifying the structure of an ontology to make it suitable for purposes other than the original. There are two types of translation: the first is the translation from one formal language into another, e.g. from RDFS to OWL, syntactical translation; the second is the translation of vocabulary, called semantic translation [6]. The translation problem arises when two web-based agents attempt to exchange information by using different ontologies."}, {"heading": "4.4.2 ONTOLOGY MERGING", "text": "Ontology [20, 23, 30] is the process of creating a new coherent ontology consisting of two or more existing source ontologies related to the same domain. New ontology will replace source ontologies."}, {"heading": "4.4.3 ONTOLOGY INTEGRATION", "text": "Integration [23, 30] is the process of creating a new ontology consisting of two or more source ontologies from different areas. 4.4.4 ONTOLOGY MAPPING Ontology mapping [19, 22, 29, 32, 34] is a formal expression or process that defines the semantic relationships between entities from different ontologies. In other words, it is an important operator in many ontological fields of application, such as the semantic web and e-commerce, which are used to describe how to establish connections between entities across different ontologies and from correspondences. Ontology matching is the process of discovering similarities between two ontologies. An entity e is understood in an ontology O, which is referred to by e | O, is concept C, relation R, or instance I, i.e. e | O C R I. Mapping the two ontologies, O1 on O1 means that each entity in the ontology O is based on an ontology O, the equivalent function to the one O has to find in the other, the corresponding entity E on an E: the function."}, {"heading": "4.4.5 ONTOLOGY ALIGNMENT", "text": "Ontology alignment [12, 13, 14, 24] is the process or method of creating a consistent and coherent connection between two or more ontologies by bringing them into mutual agreement; this method is similar to artificial intelligence methods: since it represents a logical relationship, ontology alignments are used to clearly describe how the concepts in the different ontologies are logically related; this means that additional axioms describe the relationship between the concepts in different ontologies without changing the meaning in the original ontologies. In fact, ontology alignment is used as a preliminary process for both ontology fusion and ontology integration. There are many different definitions of ontology alignment depending on their application and intended outcome. Example definitions include the following: ontology alignment is used to \"establish correspondences between the original ontologies and to break down the number of overlapping concepts, ontologies, concepts, functions, or concepts that are different from each other, or concepts that are similar to each other in structure or manner."}, {"heading": "4.4.6 OTHER ONTOLOGY OPERATIONS", "text": "There are many operations that could be applied to ontology, such as changing [23], which is considered one of the most interesting and important operations that should be considered in dealing with ontology. Generally, most existing ontologies have large sizes and complex structures. In fact, several factors could be responsible for changing ontology, including a response to new needs or requirements, a change by the developer or publisher of ontology, an ontological translation from one language to another, and a change in the area of interest. On the other hand, the use of versioning could help reduce these problems by tracking the relationships between different revisions of ontology [23]."}, {"heading": "5. ONTOLOGY LANGUAGES, ONTOLOGY EDITORS AND DEVELOPMENT TOOLS", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSION", "text": "The goal of ontology is to achieve a common and shared knowledge that can be transmitted between people and between application systems. Ontologies therefore play an important role in achieving interoperability between organizations and on the semantic web, as they aim to capture domain knowledge and their role is to explicitly create semantics in a generic way, thereby laying the foundation for convergences within a domain. Ontologies have thus become a popular topic of research in many communities. Indeed, ontology is a key component of this research; therefore, the definition, structure, and most important operations and applications of ontology are provided."}, {"heading": "9.

It enables the description of contents and services in machine-readable form, and enables annotating, discovering, publishing, advertising and composing services to be automated. It was developed based on Ontology, which is considered as the backbone of the Semantic Web. In other words, the current Web is transformed from being machine-readable to machine-understandable. In fact, Ontology is a key technique with which to annotate semantics and provide a common, comprehensible foundation for resources on the Semantic Web. Moreover, Ontology can provide a common vocabulary, a grammar for publishing data, and can supply a semantic description of data which can be used to preserve the Ontologies and keep them ready for inference.
