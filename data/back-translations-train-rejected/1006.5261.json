GAPS", "text": "(The architectural aspects of data stream processing have received considerable attention, but most efforts focus on the mining and clustering aspects of the problem. Algorithms suffer from the ability to handle difficult clustering tasks without supervision. For example, there are no assumptions about the number of clusters in the data stream, but in most methods this parameter should be determined. The algorithms required expert wizards in the form of the number of expected partitions or the expected density of clusters. They are required to re-learn recurring patterns. Compactness and separation of the data are the most important problems in the quality of clustering. Accuracy in terms of detecting concept drift. Efficiency in terms of speed is a critical problem when data mining clusters clusters. Previous approaches lack precision in detecting outsiders.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we have identified some difficulties in clustering data streams. Most applications of data streams are large dimensions, and new methods need to be developed for this purpose. Furthermore, concept drift is the nature of the data stream and should be managed by new methods. On the other hand, the data stream is similar to a flow: data comes in and out, so we need to design efficient algorithms while we need to scan data once and extract hidden patterns from it. Data development, one-time visits to data, and space constraints are important problems when clustering data streams. There are some primitive methods that concretize the framework for processing data streams, but developing a new framework with different features than the previous one (e.g. using genetic algorithm, ant colony algorithm, and neural networks) can lead us to more effective structures."}], "references": [{"title": "The problem of concept drift: definitions and related work", "author": ["A.
