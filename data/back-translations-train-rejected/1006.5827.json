Related Work", "text": "In the last decade, some approaches to AMR maps and localization problems have been published [13, 5, 26, 8], but no definitive solutions have been found. Depending on the type of sensors used, different approaches are taken, for example: in the case of sonar sensors [18, 53], in the case of laser sensors [31, 36], in the case of video sensors [44, 17], or combinations of them as in [33, 7]. The three most important approaches to the construction of robots are: topological [45], function-based [31] and network-based [16], other approaches emerge with pointed matrices based on maps."}, {"heading": "3.

Antonyms-based Fuzzy Maps", "text": "Let us reflect on the nature of the terms occupied and empty in the context of the occupation grid cards for robot navigation. We consider occupied and empty cells to be antagonistic and not complementary to each other. Firstly, because if a room is not yet occupied, we cannot conclude that it is empty, it may be unknown or ambiguous, so that it cannot be assigned to any of them without introducing errors. Consequently, we propose to build a pair of blurred models, one of obstacles and another of empty spaces that check the properties of antagonyms. If we want occupied and empty cards to form a pair of antagonyms, they must meet certain conditions: involution and N contradiction; they have been explained in Section 3.3. In the following sections, we present the handling of these empty cards, which we can define by other rules in order to shape them properly."}, {"heading": "4.1.

Building the contradiction map and the integrated map", "text": "This situation violates the principle of coherence with the negation (the value of the cell in one card must be smaller than the value in the other card, see Section 3.3). To analyze the contradictions, we have constructed a contradiction card by conjunction of the obstacles and empty space cards. As all t-norms are lower than the minimum (see [40]), we have used a minimum to obtain the greatest degree of contradiction and to work in the worst cases. The integrated card is constructed by combining occupied and empty cards. In this case, to work in a very restrictive case, we have used the Lukasiewicz t-norm W (x, y) = max (0, x + y \u2212 1)."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments and results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1. System Description", "text": "The proposed model was validated by experiments with real data. In order to obtain data sets from real environments, the Sancho22 robot was used, an indoor mobile robot for research purposes. It is a 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm platform with motor and sensory capabilities, designed and built by Gracian Trivin o at the Universidad Polite \u00d3cnica de Madrid. [52] Laptop PC is placed and connected via a serial connection to control the robot. the wheels are arranged in tricycle configuration with two driven wheels and a passive wheel. Each driven wheel is controlled in a closed circuit using a coupled encoder disc. The resolution of these odometers projected over the ground is 1.2 cm. The sensor capability is determined by a ring of twelve ultrasonic or sonar sensors, Polaroid 6500 sensors distributed at an angle of 30cm around it, or by a detailed description of the polaroid within the 30 cm range of the object."}, {"heading": "5.2. Experiments setup", "text": "Several controlled experiments were carried out to validate the proposed mapping approach. Three real interiors were adopted: an office (see Figure 16), a medium-sized hall (see Figure 17) and a large corridor (see Figure 18) were selected. Sonar and position data were collected from real robotic faults.All of these experimental steps are detailed as follows: The first site selected (see Figure 16) was a 25 square meter office, reduced to an area of 2 by 2.5 meters navigation area due to the furniture. The obstacles, with the exception of the upper line, were made from polished surfaces that are prone to generate rebounding. Second place was a hall (see Figure 17) of about 6 by 8 meters in its central zone."}, {"heading": "5.3. Mapping Results", "text": "The results for the first place, the office, were explained in Section 4, so here we present the results for the other places: the hall and the corridor. The original integrated map is shown in Figure 19, where the wrong obstacles at the top (the small green spaces) correspond to the people. A significant improvement can be seen in the final integrated map in Figure 20, when contradictions were detected and corrected. Note that there are fewer outliers, more empty space is detected, and it is closer to the walls. If the rebounds were discarded, the positions of the walls could be estimated.A similar effect can be seen in Figure 21 and 22, where most of the obstacles were initially considered unknown, but were later recovered and displayed in the final integrated map.Looking at Figure 20, a good map of the hall with few rebounds and short echos.However, looking at Figure 22, it is more difficult to see some of the walls of the corridor, although the empty space represents the space."}, {"heading": "5.4. Comparison with other approaches", "text": "To compare this approach with previous approaches, we introduced the algorithms compared in [41]: a probabilistic approach based on [15] and a blurred approach based on [39]. We used the values of the parameters used in the corresponding papers: \u03c1v = 1.2 m, \u03b4r = 0.15 m, pO = 0.6 for the probability approach and kE = 0.45 and kO = 0.65 for the blurred approach. Appendix A presents the complete set of maps obtained through the three approaches (see Figures A.29 to A.37). It can be seen that due to rebound and short-term echoes, many obstacles (i.e. walls) are missing from the probabilistic and previous blurred methods. If you zoom in to the top of Figure A.32, you can see that although empty spaces are more or less well covered, most obstacles are overlooked by the probabilistic approach."}, {"heading": "5.5. Quantitative comparison", "text": "In order to perform a quantitative comparison, we had to define a series of measurements that allowed us to compare the results of the different solutions. First, we defined a reference occupation map obtained from the manual measurement of the positions of the walls. \u2212 In the reference map, obstacles, spaces and unknown fields were represented by 1, -1 and 0 values (as a ternary classification problem). Then, we quantified the accuracy of the maps we measured by comparing the resulting map of the three approaches with the reference map, using precision, recall and mean absolute error (MAE). To make comparison and discretization easier, we scaled all the obtained maps to [-1.1] with -1 meaning completely blank, 1 meaning completely occupied, and 0 meaning unnown.We discredited the integrated maps that we had obtained by assigning a value between 1 and 1 containing cells."}, {"heading": "5.6. Discussion", "text": "As can be seen in Appendix A, the maps obtained by the antonym-based method are better defined, capture better the shape of the walls and empty spaces, and contain fewer errors due to rebound and short echoes. Whereas in the probabilistic method and in the previous blurred method many obstacles (i.e. walls) are missing and many empty spaces are not clear enough, the quantitative measures of performance (see Tables 1 to 4) of the three different methods at the three locations confirm this qualitative assessment.For example, in Tables 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the probabilistic method has the highest precision but the lowest memory, while the antonym-based method has the highest memory and the best balance between precision and memory, which means that antonym-based method detects more obstacles and more empty spaces and has a solid compromise between precision and repetition."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to survive themselves if they do not see themselves able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves, \"he told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.\" But it is not the case that they feel able to survive themselves. \""}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank Claudio Moraga, Enric Trillas and David Pe'rez for their comments, corrections and fruitful discussions on the topic of the essay.

inspired by the idea of \u201cComputing with Words and Perceptions\u201d proposed by Zadeh in [57, 59], focuses on how to transform measurements into perceptions [22] for the problem of map building by Autonomous Mobile Robots. We propose to model the perceptions obtained from sonar-sensors as two grid maps: one for obstacles and another for empty spaces. The rules used to build and integrate these maps are expressed by linguistic descriptions and modeled by fuzzy rules. The main difference of this approach from other studies reported in the literature is that the method presented here is based on the hypothesis that the concepts \u201coccupied\u201d and \u201cempty\u201d are antonyms rather than complementary (as it happens in probabilistic approaches), or independent (as it happens in the previous fuzzy models). Controlled experimentation with a real robot in three representative indoor environments has been performed and the results presented. We offer a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the estimated maps obtained by the probabilistic approach, the previous fuzzy method and the new antonyms-based fuzzy approach. It is shown that the maps obtained with the antonyms-based approach are better defined, capture better the shape of the walls and of the empty-spaces, and contain less errors due to rebounds and short-echoes. Furthermore, in spite of noise and low resolution inherent to the sonar-sensors used, the maps obtained are accurate and tolerant to imprecision.
