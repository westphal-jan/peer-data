To calculate the nominator, we first determine whether an EDU is appended directly to the graph, and if not, we determine whether it is part of a larger complex segment attached to the RF graph. The results obtained are shown in the first two columns of Table 2.

Sometimes, experts judged that the commentators chose the wrong segment to add a new segment or the wrong type of relationship during the construction of the SDRT graph. For example, in the graph that follows the relationship between segments 74 and 75, it is not a comment, but an entity collaboration. As expected, there were also \"structural\" errors that resulted from a lack or misuse of complex segments. Here is a typical example (translated from the original French): [Around them,] _ 74 [we should Joseph Racaille] _ 75 [responsible for the splendid arrangements]."}, {"heading": "6 RFC and distances of attachment", "text": "Our empirical study confirms SDRT's RFC, but it also has computational implications. The use of RFC dramatically reduces the number of binding possibilities and thus significantly reduces the search space for each incremental discourse algorithm. [8] The mean value of the nodes open on the RF at any given time is 16.43% of all the nodes in the graph. Our data also enabled us to calculate the distance of the binding points of LAST, which could be an important limitation for machine learning in the construction of discourse structures. Given a pair of followers (Appendix I, Appendix J), the distance is calculated either textually (the number of intervening EDUs between Expi and ExpJ) or topologically (the length of the shortest path between Expi and ExpJ). However, the topological distance does not take into account the fact that a segment that is more distant textually cognitively less outstanding."}, {"heading": "7 Related Work", "text": "Several studies have shown that the RFC can be violated as an anaphorical constraint if there are other clues, contents, or linguistic traits that determine the precursor. (Poesio and di Eugenio, 2001; Holler and Irmen, 2007; Asher, 2008; Pr\u00e9vot and Vieu, 2008), for example, show that anaphores such as definitive descriptions and complex demonstrations, which often provide enough content on their own to make their ancestors or pronouns obey gender conventions in languages such as German, may remain successful, although the discourse relationships between them and their ancestors may violate the RFC. Normally, there are few linguistic clues that help to find the appropriate prehistory of a discourse relationship, as opposed to the anaphorical expressions mentioned above."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions", "text": "We have shown that the RFC of the SDRT has strong empirical support: the appendices of our three completely na\u00efve commentators agree with the RFC 91.7% of the time and partially adhere to it 96% of the time. As a limitation on the discourse when parsing the SDRT RFC, we argued, it is both empirically and mathematically motivated. Furthermore, we have shown that non-local appendices occur in about 40% of the cases, implying that direct attachments to the LAST will not produce good results. Furthermore, many of the non-local appendices do not respect the boundary condition of the RST. We need the SDRT RFC to get the right binding points for our corpus. We believe that empirical studies such as we have given here are essential in order to find robust and useful features that will greatly improve the discourse."}], "references": [{"title": "Logics of Conversation", "author": ["N.
