We will use the definition of a configuration problem as indicated in [11, Definition 1]: A configuration problem is a triple (V, D, E), where V is a set of variables x1, x2,..., xn, D is a set of their finite domains D1, D2,..., Dn and vice versa. A valid configuration is a set of statement formulas about atomic sentences xi = v, where v, conditions are specified that the variable mappings must meet. For each formula we have vars (VP) V. A valid configuration is an association \u03b1 with domain (\u03b1) = V, so that v, c, c, x, x, x, x, x, x, is the configuration. In this paper we will consider the specific case where we only have statement formulas V and hDi = propositions."}, {"heading": "3.1 Number of Valid Configurations", "text": "The first question that naturally arises is the total number of valid product configurations v = # SAT (BA). Obviously, 2 | V | is an upper limit for v, but in most cases, this number v can demonstrate the sheer complexity of a given product. Section 4.2 supports this assertion by calculating some of these numbers for Mercedes-Benz car lines. It is also possible to count valid configurations of a product under certain conditions. For example, we can force P-O options to be selected before performing # SAT (BA).This can be achieved by calculating # SAT (BA).This method can provide important information about the influence of certain options o on the number of valid configurations.This information in turn can be used for specific domain-specific variable heuristics for the SAT solving process of formulas of the present application."}, {"heading": "3.2 Rating Errors", "text": "Observations from formal methods of software validation [3] tell us that the more bugs you report, the less likely they are to eventually be fixed. Developers and product documentation engineers tend to be overwhelmed quite quickly with large-scale bug reports that leave them unsure where to start fixing bugs. Counting models could help classify bugs according to their severity. We consider scenarios in which the satisfaction of the input formula indicates error situations - so any satisfactory matching can be interpreted as a counterexample. In configuration problems, such situations usually occur when the mutually exclusive component inclusion is verified. Let c1, c2, the binary flags for the inclusion of two mutually exclusive components.Any assignment that is satisfactory, c1, c2, can be interpreted as a product that is mutually exclusive."}, {"heading": "3.3 Measuring Documentation Quality", "text": "This product documentation is either created automatically or maintained manually by experts. In complex products with thousands of options, this documentation develops over years. This fact can be seen in the development of the number of valid configurations of different versions of the documentation for the same product. We have made observations where the number of valid configurations for the same product has decreased from a size of 1034 to a size of 1010 due to better and more detailed documentation (see paragraph 4.2). Model counting can also be used interactively by the documentation engineer. It is immediately apparent the effects of adding or changing certain configurations with respect to valid configurations. For example, adding a new configuration does not change the number of valid configurations and can therefore be omitted."}, {"heading": "4 Example: Automotive Product Configuration", "text": "In this section, we give examples of how to apply the statement model counting to formulas used in the design testing of customer orders at Mercedes-Benz.

Since these formulas are not originally CNF compliant, we have developed a new exact statement model counter based directly on the raw formulas without prior normalization. It is based on a re-implementation of the non-CNF SAT solver introduced by Thiffault and others. [23] In order to use a CNF model counter, it is important to use a transformation method that maintains the number of models of model counting with recognition and caching. Note: When converting a non-CNF-compliant formula into a CNF formula, it is important to use a transformation method that maintains the number of models of model counting, i.e., when converting a non-CNF formula into a CNF formula, it is important to find a formula for transformation T."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Number of Valid Configurations", "text": "Counting pure PO formulas without extensions (i.e. the calculation of # SAT (POF), the number of different valid orders) shows the enormous number of constructible vehicles due to the customer's choice: we were able to calculate results from 5.9 \u00d7 1010 to 9.9 \u00d7 10103 constructible orders for the Mercedes-Benz E-Class line of cars (see Table 1). C212 A, C212 B and C212 C show different body shapes of the same car line. These impressive figures also provide invaluable support in arguing for formal methods used in large configuration settings. Our non-CNF model counter was applied directly to the non-normalized POFs, whereas Cachet and c2d were transformed with Tseitin (T \u2194) CNF versions as input. Our comparison states that maintaining the formula structure pays off by directly thinking about input without prior normalization."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Rating Errors", "text": "In practice, it is highly desirable to classify the results of an automated verifier. In the real world, nothing is perfect, and every corrective action comes at a price. If we have an error condition represented by a formula that is satisfactory, then # SAT (p1) can give an indication of how many cars are potentially affected by the bug. Take, for example, physically overlapping parts p1, p2: If there is a constructible order based on the POF that includes both p1 and p2, each assignment \u03b1 with \u03b1 | = POF-P (p1) \u0445 P (p2) will describe an incorrectly constructible order. Thus, the calculation of # SAT (POF-P (p1) and P (p1) yields the total number of incorrectly constructible jobs wr. p1 and p2."}, {"heading": "4.2.3 Measuring Documentation Quality", "text": "Accurate model counting also raises questions about the appropriate language and method of product documentation. We are currently implementing symbolic verification methods for detection and help2Environment: Mac OS X (10.5), 2 \u00d7 4 Core Intel Xeon (2.8 GHz each), 32 GB of memory, using 1 core to avoid documentation errors. Knowledge of the exact model counting indicates (at least at management decision level) the complexity of error detection, e.g. to prove that a part is no longer needed in a 2002 model series, it must be verified that none of the 1024 cars needs the part. Our results also suggest that the model counting of POFs could serve as a yardstick for the maturity of product documentation (see Section 3.3): Model counting of an early developer version of C212 A yielded 2.9 \u00d7 1034 models, whereas the version in production use with Mercedes-Benz only yields 5.9 \u00d7 1010."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion & Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we introduced new methods for quantitative analysis of configuration formulas using model counting. In addition, we described methods for obtaining additional information such as the total number of valid configurations, the relative frequency of options in valid configurations, or the severity of errors. This information can be used to accelerate future SAT-solving processes of similar formulas, to illustrate the complexity of the problem, or to measure the quality of documentation. Using our non-CNF model, we were able to calculate results for formulas whose CNF representations are too large for modern model counters to cope with. Our results demonstrate the applicability of our newly introduced analysis methods to configuration problems on an industrial scale. As our benchmarks show, model counting for large statement formulas is still a fairly time-consuming task. In d-DNNF composition of static hayristics based on hypergraph composition, the composition has been successfully applied to great problems."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgement", "text": "We thank Matthias Sauter (formerly STZ OIT) for his helpful advice and support."}], "references": [{"title": "Algorithms and Complexity Results for #SAT and Bayesian Inference", "author": ["Fahiem Bacchus", "Shannon Dalmao", "Toniann Pitassi"], "venue": "Proceedings of the FOCS \u201903,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Counting Models Using Connected Components", "author": ["Roberto J.
