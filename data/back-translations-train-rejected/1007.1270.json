With current network moving towards the Future Internet model, the problem is further intensified as network traffic demanding far from exceeds network bandwidth capability. Maintaining a certain user satisfaction degree therefore becomes a challenge research topic. In this paper, we deal with the problem by proposing BASMIN, a novel bandwidth allocation scheme that aims to maximize network user's happiness. We also defined a new metric for evaluating network user satisfaction degree: network worth. A three-step evaluation process is then conducted to compare BASMIN efficiency with other three popular bandwidth allocation schemes. Throughout the tests, we experienced BASMIN's advantages over the others; we even found out that one of the most widely used bandwidth allocation schemes, in fact, is not effective at all.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Jul 2010 00:47:16 GMT  (517kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1270v1", "Presented at The First Asia Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems April, 1-3, 2009, Dong Hoi City, Quang Binh province, Vietnam"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at The First Asia Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems April, 1-3, 2009, Dong Hoi City, Quang Binh province, Vietnam", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.AI", "authors": ["huy nguyen", "tam van nguyen", "deokjai choi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1007.1270"}, "pdf": {"name": "1007.1270.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "How to Maximize User Satisfaction Degree in Multi-service IP Networks", "authors": ["Huy Anh Nguyen", "Tam Van Nguyen", "Deokjai Choi"], "emails": ["anhhuy@gmail.com,", "vantam@gmail.com", "dchoi@chonnam.ac.kr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most people are able to decide for themselves what they want and what they don't want."}, {"heading": "A. Elastic application", "text": "Traditional data applications that transmit the lifetime of file transfers, e-mails, remote logins and peer-to-peer are relatively tolerant of delays. On an intuitive level, they seem to have a decreasing marginal improvement while gradually increasing bandwidth. Total U is always maximized when no user is denied access, so access control is irrelevant here. For this type of application, there is no minimum bandwidth required, as it can tolerate relatively large delays. Elastic Traffic Utility is modeled using the following function: max () 1 kbb eU b (1), where k is a tunable parameter that determines the shape of the usage function and ensures that when the maximum desired bandwidth is received, U 1. But as shown in Figure 1 (a), the user satisfaction of this application can barely reach 1 even at a very high bandwidth. Therefore, we believe that this application can never exceed the bandwidth allocated even if it is never available."}, {"heading": "B. Hard-Real Time application", "text": "Hard Real-Time (HRT) applications are the most delay-sensitive applications. These applications require their data to arrive within a specified delay limit, require strict end-to-end performance guarantees, and show no adaptive characteristics. A network flow belonging to this type of application must not enter the network if the minimum bandwidth requirement cannot be met; and once accepted, the allocated bandwidth is determined during the lifetime of the network session. Higher bandwidth allocation should not lead to an increase in performance, while degradation of bandwidth causes QoS (utility) to fall to zero. Examples of this are audio / video phones, video conferencing, and telemedicine. The utility function used to model HRT traffic is: max () 1 kbb eU b (2), with bmax being the bandwidth required. The general form of HRT traffic program is shown in Figure 1 (b)."}, {"heading": "C. Real-Time application", "text": "Real-time applications (RT) refer to multimedia applications that can adapt to different network loads. In the event of congestion, they can gracefully adjust their transmission rates so that QoS is still acceptable. However, this type of traffic requires a minimum of performance warranty. If the allocated bandwidth is reduced below a certain threshold, QoS becomes unacceptable. Typical examples are interactive multimedia services, video on demand online games. To model RT traffic, the following utility function is used: 2 12 () 1 k b rtU b e (3), where k1 and k2 are tunable parameters that determine the shape of the power function. Figure 1 (c) shows that the marginal benefit of additional bandwidth is very low at both high and low bandwidth.

Problem statement", "text": "Consider a network that consists of a set of L unidirectional links where a link lL has capacity cl. The network is shared by a set S of unicast sessions (users) - we assume that all end-user requirements are unicast here. Ls L denote the set of links used by the session sS. Let Sl S also denote the set of sessions that use Link l L. Each session has a minimum required transfer rate bmin \u2265 0, and a maximum required transfer rate bmax <. For HRT applications, we only take care of bmax, their bmin is actually bmax. For RT applications, both bmax and bmin mac must be defined. An RT flow is only accepted for the network with its assignment within [bmin, bmax].
