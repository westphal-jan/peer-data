Causal Discovery in Computer Science", "text": "Automatic detection of causal relationships between a number of variables has been an active field of research. More specifically, automated methods have been used to determine whether the value of a variable is caused by other variables or not. Input to a computational approach usually consists of data sets, each containing the values of the jointly observed variables. Bayesque's approach [13] to defining and discovering causality is currently receiving a great deal of attention and is introduced in Section 4.1. We also briefly present a method of minimum message length [43] of causal discovery in Section 4.2. Neither of these two methods takes into account any temporal information, so we are introducing an approach based on the explicit temporal sequence between variables in Section 4.3."}, {"heading": "4.1 The Bayesian Approach", "text": "A common approach to the discovery of causality is to view the problem as that of creating a graph in which the parent nodes denote causes, while the children denote effects. It can be argued that the variables set in a diagram in the form of mere temporal associations, so that interpreting a relationship as causal requires justification. The main trend in causality research involves the use of the statistical concept of conditional independence as a measure of control that one variable can have over another. In other words, x separates the three variables x, y, and z, if y is independent of z, that is, P (y, z) x, x, x, x and x, then we can conclude that y is not a direct cause of z."}, {"heading": "4.2 The Minimum Message Length Method", "text": "MML is introduced in [43] and is based on maximizing the posterior probability of a model. If we want a good model M that fits the data D, then we want to maximize the posterior probability P (M | D). According to Bayes \"rule, we should maximize P (D | M) \u00d7 P (M) / P (D). We remember that P (D | M) is the probability of D. Since D is given, we consider P (D) as a constant, so the model M must be chosen to maximize the numerator. One can use the method of information theory to take the negative state of the natural logarithms of probability values and turn the problem into that of minimizing the expression -ln (P (D | M) - ln (P (M)) - ln (M) - cognitive probability. In information theory, this formula expresses the causal probability necessary for coding the model M."}, {"heading": "4.3 Discovering Causality from Sequential Observations", "text": "The temporal sequence of operations is considered to be the sequence of records containing the values of a number of variables; the records are considered sequentially, for example, the collection of records by the problem domain; the assumption that the effects take time to manifest the constant records is incorrect; the number of records collectively containing the values of three variables is recorded by v2, v3 >; the interval between collection of records is determined by the problem domain; and the assumption that the effects take time to manifest the constant records is considered to be the sequence of events."}, {"heading": "5.

In this paper we present a number of past and present approaches to the definition of temporality and causality from philosophical, physical, and computational points of view. We note that time is an important ingredient in many relationships and phenomena. The topic is then divided into the two main areas of temporal discovery, which is concerned with finding relations that are stretched over time, and causal discovery, where a claim is made as to the causal influence of certain events on others. We present a number of computational tools used for attempting to automatically discover temporal and causal relations in data.", "creator": "PDFCreator Version 0.9.5"}}}
