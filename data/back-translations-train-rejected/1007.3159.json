This procedure is based on the so-called coaxial matrices that define dependencies between plan activities (infrastructures, plants, resource extractions, buildings, etc.) and positive and negative environmental impacts, and dependencies between these impacts and environmental receptors. Up to now, this procedure is manually implemented by environmental experts for checking the environmental effects of a given plan or program, but it is never applied during the plan/program construction. A decision support system, based on a clear logic semantics, would be an invaluable tool not only in assessing a single, already defined plan, but also during the planning process in order to produce an optimized, environmentally assessed plan and to study possible alternative scenarios. We propose two logic-based approaches to the problem, one based on Constraint Logic Programming and one on Probabilistic Logic Programming that could be, in the future, conveniently merged to exploit the advantages of both. We test the proposed approaches on a real energy plan and we discuss their limitations and advantages.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Jul 2010 14:36:54 GMT  (97kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3159v1", "17 pages, 1 figure, 26th Int'l.

A clause can be causally interpreted by the truth of the body causing the truth of one of the atoms in the head."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Causal Models", "text": "Determining when an event causes another event is very important in many areas, for example, science, medicine, pharmacology, or economics. Causality has been widely debated by philosophers and statisticians: often it has been confused with correlation, when in reality they are different concepts, since two events can be correlated without one causing the other. Recently, Pearl (2000) helped clarify the concept of causality by discussing how to present causal information and how to draw conclusions from it. He illustrates two types of causal models: causal Bayesian networks and structural equations. Bayesian causal networks differ from standard Bayesian networks because the edge from variable X to variable Y means that X is a cause for Y, while in standard Bayesian networks it simply means that there is a statistical dependence. Pearl (2000) proposed an approach for calculating the probability of effects of x and suggested by x to do the effect (say x)."}, {"heading": "4 Coaxial Matrices in CLP(R)", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of us are able to push ourselves to the limits of our power.

In particular, it provides the so-called reduced cost and the dual solution. These indicators provide valuable information about the sensitivity of the solution found to the parameters of the constraint model. The dual solution is a set of values corresponding to the constraints. It can be considered derivatives of the objective function in relation to the right-hand side (RHS) of the constraints. This means that in the dual solution we immediately see which of the constraints are narrow, i.e. which would change the value of the objective function if the RHS coefficient changes. For example, if we optimize the number of fMW of electrical energy, and we have a restriction of the CO2 restrictions limiting the corresponding dual value of fMW restrictions."}, {"heading": "5 A Causal Model for Coaxial Matrices", "text": "In this section, we will consider an interpretation of coaxial matrices that differs from those in Section 4. \"Instead of associating a real number of each activity, impact and receptor, we associate a Boolean random variable to each of them and we consider the levels of interaction expressed in the matrix as probable causal dependencies. In this approach, we assume that an activity is either performed or not, an impact is either present or not and a receptor is either achieved or not. In other words, we do not consider the size or level of the variables under analysis. We used this approach to get useful insights into the likely modeling of the problem. In the future, we plan more sophisticated approaches using multivalued random variables or even continuous random variables."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Experimental results of CLP(R)", "text": "The reason for this is that the two are a pure formation, able to decide for themselves how to behave."}, {"heading": "6.2 Causal Model", "text": "Given the fact that the causal model was presented in Section 5, we can ask various what-if questions. If these activities are performed, the probability of a particular effect is of interest. However, they are also more complex to calculate. In addition, the queries can be generalized to the case in which the activities are performed with a certain probability. We can answer the queries above by following the approach in 3.2.2. We add a fact that is performed for each activity, and we ask for the probability of the query from the modified program."}, {"heading": "6.3 Comparison", "text": "As indicated earlier, we developed two models with the final goal of integrating the two. Before such an ambitious goal can be achieved, we must identify the strengths and weaknesses of the two. In order to make a systematic comparison, we have created two tables (one for each approach) in which each cell contains the effect of a single activity on a single receptor, one table reports on the results of the linear model and the other on the results of the causal model. Therefore, the tables are of size Na \u00d7 no = 93 \u00d7 23 = 2139. In the scatter diagram of Figure 1, we plot the results of the causal model against the results of the linear model: the results of the linear model lie on the x-axis, while in the causal model the results are on the y-axis. As we can see, most points are grouped along a simple curve, which seems to indicate a close relationship between the two models that we will study in the near future."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "Environmental Impact Assessment is now becoming a systematic process imposed by law, and its importance will increase year after year. In this work, we have proposed how two computational technologies can successfully solve practical problems of environmental impact assessment, using the real data used in previous years for the environmental impact assessment of Emilia Romagna's plans. Constraint Logic Programming showed efficient management of large models and provides useful sensitivity analyses that can be used by planners and evaluators to evaluate several alternative scenarios, the downside being that contributions from different activities and different impacts are merely summarized, while in some cases more complex combinations are required. We plan to examine the use of other CLP languages that allow for more general restrictions."}], "references": [{"title": "Semiring-based constraint satisfaction and optimization", "author": ["S.
