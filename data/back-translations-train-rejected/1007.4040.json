In this paper, we generalize the notions of completion and loop formulas of logic programs to description logic programs and show that the answer sets of a dl-program can be precisely captured by the models of its completion and loop formulas. Furthermore, we propose a new, alternative semantics for dl-programs, called the {\\em canonical answer set semantics}, which is defined by the models of completion that satisfy what are called canonical loop formulas. A desirable property of canonical answer sets is that they are free of circular justifications. Some properties of canonical answer sets are also explored.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 23 Jul 2010 04:48:19 GMT  (73kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4040v1", "29 pages, 1 figures (in pdf), a short version appeared in ICLP'10"]], "COMMENTS": "29 pages, 1 figures (in pdf), a short version appeared in ICLP'10", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["yisong wang", "jia-huai you", "li yan yuan", "yi-dong shen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1007.4040"}, "pdf": {"name": "1007.4040.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Loop Formulas for Description Logic Programs\u2217", "authors": ["YISONG WANG", "JIA-HUAI YOU", "LI YAN YUAN"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Key concepts: Semantic Web, description logic programs, response sets, loop formulas"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Logical programming under the semantics of the ontology layer (W3C) is a non-monotonous argumentation paradigm for declarative problem solving (Marek and Truszczynski 1999; Niemela \ufffd 1999).

One of the main interests in this direction is the integration of ASP with ontological thinking for the semantic web.The semantic web is an evolving development of the World Wide Web in which the meaning of information and services on the web is defined so that the web content of agents can be precisely understood and used (Berners-Lee et al. 2001).To this end, a layer structure including the rule layer built on the ontology layer has been recognized as a basic framework.

Wang et al.", "text": "Although each of the above approaches has its own merits, the loose approach has some unique advantages. In many situations, we would like to combine existing knowledge bases, possibly under different logics; in this case, an idea of interface is natural and necessary; the loose approach seems particularly intuitive, since it is not based on the use of modal operators or on a multi-value logic; it is noticeable that dl programs share similar characteristics with another more recent interest, multi-context-based systems in which knowledge bases communicate arbitrary logic via bridge rules (Brewka and Eiter 2007).However, the relationships between these different approaches are not well understood at present. For example, we know how to translate a dl program into an MKNF theory without the non-monotonic operator, while maintaining the strong response theory semantics (Motik and Rosati 2010), if it is involved, no such translation is known."}, {"heading": "6 Concluding Remarks", "text": "In this paper, we characterized the weak and strong response sets of the dl programs with program supplements and loop formulas. Although these loop formulas also provide an alternative mechanism for calculating response sets, the construction of such a system presents itself as an interesting future work. We also proposed the canonical response sets for dl programs that are minimal and non-circular in the formal sense. From the perspective of the loop formulas, we see a remarkable distinction between the weak, strong and canonical response sets: the canonical response does not specify circular justifications, the strong response sets circular justifications that include non-monotonous dl atoms but not monotonous, while the weak response allows circular justifications that include all dl atoms but no atoms.We note that for a given dl program K = (O, P), the strong justification for a series M-HBP is a strong or canonical loop and the strong one for the loop construction."}, {"heading": "BAADER, F., CALVANESE, D., MCGUINNESS, D.
