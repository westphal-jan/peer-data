INTRODUCTION", "text": "The Web has significantly changed the way consumers express their opinions. Product reviews exist today in a variety of forms on the Web; however, lately, reading a representative selection of product reviews to make a good decision has often been a time-consuming process. It is also difficult for the manufacturer or seller of a product to use the reviews. Recently, there has been interest in the development and use of mining and summary tools specifically to determine opinion polarity [1]. The polarity of a word or opinion, also called semantic orientation, indicates the direction in which the word or opinion for its semantic group deviates from the norm. In other words, the polarity of words or phrases directly reflects the opinion of the writer. Polarity usually extends across an ordinary (i.e. discrete) scale. This scale can take the form of either an ordered set of numerical values (e.g. one to five \"stars\") or an ordered set of numerical algorithms."}, {"heading": "2. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE", "text": "In the next step, our algorithm calculates the polarity of each adjective based on a learned classifier. By aggregating the polarity of the adjectives of opinion (based on their frequency), the polarity of opinion is identified. To determine the polarity of an adjective, we use a naive Bayesian classifier, learned through a series of positive, negative and neutral adjectives. Input of this classifier consists of a tuple of values showing the similarity between the given adjective and the three fixed adjectives \"excellent,\" \"mediocre\" and \"poor\" as representatives of positive, neutral and negative adjectives. These similarity values are calculated based on two suggested similarity functions based on WordNet [3]. The first similarity function is based on the synonyms of the adjectives and the second is based on an explanation for the function of these adjectives and the following on the similarity of the individual adjectives."}, {"heading": "2.1 SIMILARITY COMPUTATION", "text": "At this stage, the similarity between the two adjectives and the adjectives, which are both capable of determining the similarity between the two words, becomes clear."}, {"heading": "2.2 POLARITY CLASSIFICATION", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "2.3 POLARITY IDENTIFICATION", "text": "The final phase of our technique involves determining the polarity of opinion. Polarity is determined by aggregating the polarity of the extracted adjectives based on their frequency. In other words, our method assigns the values of + 1, 0 and -1 to the positive, neutral and negative adjectives for each check. Each adjective also receives a weight corresponding to its frequency in this check. Polarity of the check is then determined by calculating the weighted average of the adjective values. We consider two methods, the first, SynPI, based on SynClassifier, and the second, StemPI, based on StemClassifier.Table 8 shows the accuracy, false-positive and false-negative percentages of the two polarity identification methods SynPI and StemPI. Since the test set was selected at random, the results may vary in different rounds."}, {"heading": "3. EVALUATION", "text": "In this section, we evaluate the accuracy of our proposed opinion polarity classifier, SynPI, by comparing it to a baseline classifier method (presented in Chapter 6 of the NLTK [4]). The baseline classifier method is based on a naive Bayesian classifier learned with a series of tagged ratings. To evaluate our system, we use a series of ratings available via movie _ reviews in nltk.corpus [4]. These ratings have been categorized into \"positive\" and \"negative\" classes. Our evaluation technique involves randomly selecting a set of 100 ratings, which are then made available to our system for polarity predictions. This baseline method first finds the most common words in the training set, and then uses them to learn the naive Bayean classifier. Each feature of this classifier shows that the review contains a specific word."}, {"heading": "4. RELATED WORK", "text": "One class consists of works that aim exclusively at determining effective metrics to represent the polarity and subjective content of words [5]; the other class consists of works that perform word polarity as part of a larger study of opinion classifications and related areas [6]. Our work is in the second class, so we focus on opinion classification in our related work environment. Turney in [1] introduces an unattended learning algorithm to rate an assessment as positive or negative (thumbs up or down); the algorithm extracts phrases that contain adjectives or adjectives, and also their parts of speech (POS) tags match the predefined patterns. This paper also suggests a method of using \"PMI-IR\" for the semantic orientation of phrases."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The algorithm consists of three phases: (1) extraction of adjectives and their frequency from the given review, (2) prediction of the polarity of each adjective using the learned classifier, and (3) classification of the review based on the weighted average polarity of the adjectives. The core of the technique is the second phase that WordNet uses to calculate similarity values between two adjectives, and then uses the similarity values to learn the classifier to predict the polarity of each adjective.In experiments with 100 reviews from the movie _ reviews corpus in NLTK, our algorithm achieves an accuracy of 73%, while the basic method can at best achieve an accuracy of 64%. The great advantage of our method is that it can achieve a high accuracy with a small training set.In addition, our proposed opinion polarity classifier is independent of the context and can be achieved with the other type of classification that we can fully apply."}], "references": [{"title": "Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down?
