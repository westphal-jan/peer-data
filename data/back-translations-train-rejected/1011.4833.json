LPODs are used to represent preferences in logic programming under the answer set semantics. Their semantics is defined by first translating the LPOD into a set of normal programs (called split programs) and then imposing a preference relation among the answer sets of these split programs. We concentrate on the first step and show how a suitable translation of the ordered disjunction as a derived operator into the logic of Here-and-There allows capturing the answer sets of the split programs in a direct way. We use this characterisation not only for providing an alternative implementation for LPODs, but also for checking several properties (under strongly equivalent transformations) of the 'x' operator, like for instance, its distributivity with respect to conjunction or regular disjunction. We also make a comparison to an extension proposed by K\\\"arger, Lopes, Olmedilla and Polleres, that combines 'x' with regular disjunction.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Nov 2010 14:57:53 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4833v1", "ASPOCP 2010"]], "COMMENTS": "ASPOCP 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["pedro cabalar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1011.4833"}, "pdf": {"name": "1011.4833.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Logical Characterisation of Ordered Disjunction", "authors": ["Pedro Cabalar"], "emails": ["cabalar@udc.es"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 101 1,48 33v1 [cs.LO] 2 2N ov"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to a different world in which they are able to escape than to another world in which they are able to escape."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "& & & & # 10; & & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & & & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & & & & # 10; & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & # 10; & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & &"}, {"heading": "2.1 Logic programs", "text": "Let A be a (possibly empty) list of (possibly repeated) formulas.

So the immediate question is whether our HT-based characterization and the original DLPOD semantics actually match. Unfortunately, the answer to this question is negative for two reasons. First, as we explained in Section 3 with a counter-example for (19), we saw that (28) is not a strong equivalent transformation. So, under our HT-based characterization, an arbitrary DLPOD is not always reducible to the ODNF rule (although, of course, a semantic for the DLPOD is still defined). Nevertheless, even if we limit ourselves to the study of DLPOD programs, we can find examples where the original DLPOD semantics provide more answers.

This characterization represents an alternative implementation of LPODs that does not rely on auxiliary predictions. It has also enabled us to analyze the behavior of the \u00d7 operator with respect to some typical characteristics such as associativity, distributivity, idempotence, etc., since \u00d7 is treated as regular logical connectivity, our characterization covers any arbitrary syntactical extension, in particular the so-called disjunctive LPOD (DLPOD). We have shown that the semantics of DLPODs exhibit some differences in terms of HT characterization and exhibit a formal comparison. Our result can also be viewed as a confirmation of the theory [6]."}], "references": [{"title": "CR-Prolog with ordered disjunction", "author": ["Marcello Balduccini", "Veena S.

Ordered Disjunctions (LPOD). LPODs are used to represent preferences in logic programming under the answer set semantics. Their semantics is defined by first translating the LPOD into a set of normal programs (called split programs) and then imposing a preference relation among the answer sets of these split programs. We concentrate on the first step and show how a suitable translation of the ordered disjunction as a derived operator into the logic of Here-and-There allows capturing the answer sets of the split programs in a direct way. We use this characterisation not only for providing an alternative implementation for LPODs, but also for checking several properties (under strongly equivalent transformations) of the \u00d7 operator, like for instance, its distributivity with respect to conjunction or regular disjunction. We also make a comparison to an extension proposed by K\u00e4rger, Lopes, Olmedilla and Polleres, that combines \u00d7 with regular disjunction.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
