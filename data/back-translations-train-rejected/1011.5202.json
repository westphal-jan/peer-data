This means that in practice, CCE can be done fairly quickly. In terms of the practical effectiveness of CCE, CCE (F) is roughly equal to BCE (F) in about half of the cases (the difference is less than 10 clauses). In the other half, however, the additional reduction is about 5% compared to BCE; in the best case, we observed a case where the additional reduction was up to 40%. As further work on this issue progresses, we will focus on continuing to investigate the effectiveness of CCE in practice, and also the possibilities of implementing HCCE and ACCE. In this context, it is important to note that even if a particular elimination technique is too costly for practical purposes to be carried out up to a fixed point, such a technique may only be of practical benefit for a long time."}], "references": [{"title": "Clause elimination procedures for CNF formulas", "author": ["M.
