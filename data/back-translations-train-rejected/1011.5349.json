The optimization version of the problem concerns the minimization of the number of used colors. In this paper we deal with the problem of finding valid colorings of graphs in a distributed way, that is, by means of an algorithm that only uses local information for deciding the color of the nodes. Such algorithms prescind from any central control. Due to the fact that quite a few practical applications require to find colorings in a distributed way, the interest in distributed algorithms for graph coloring has been growing during the last decade. As an example consider wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks, where tasks such as the assignment of frequencies or the assignment of TDMA slots are strongly related to graph coloring.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Nov 2010 11:47:59 GMT  (36kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5349v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hugo hern\\'andez", "christian blum"], "accepted": false, "id": "1011.5349"}, "pdf": {"name": "1011.5349.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Distributed Graph Coloring: An Approach Based on the Calling Behavior of Japanese Tree Frogs", "authors": [], "emails": ["hhernandez@lsi.upc.edu", "cblum@lsi.upc.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 101 1,53 49v1 [cs.AI] 2The algorithm proposed in this paper is inspired by the call behavior of Japanese tree frogs.

Based on the results of centralized algorithms, the literature offers both exact approaches, which guarantee that an optimal solution can be found in a limited time and (meta) heuristic approaches. [33] Due to the insoluble nature of GCP, major problem cases can only be efficiently addressed by nowadays distributed approaches. Particularly effective are the taboo search algorithms of [4], a hybrid approach that combines taboo search and evolutionary algorithms from [31] and a variable search technique in the neighborhood. These algorithms are nowadays the best centralized meta analyses for solving the GCP. When looking at distributed algorithms, it is very difficult (if not impossible) to limit the state of art to a small number of algorithms."}, {"heading": "1.3 Organization of the Paper", "text": "The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the behaviour of frogs in nature that inspired our algorithm; in addition, existing models are outlined; Section 3 introduces the algorithm; and a detailed experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm is presented in Section 4.

Firstly, the node i will examine its message queue Mi. If Mi contains more than one message from the same sender node, all of these messages except the last one will be deleted. Generally, a message m \u00b2 Mi sent at this stage is the following format: m = < thetam, colorm, relevant >, (9) where Thetam [0,1) contains the message from the emitter, color is the color currently used by the emitter, and relevance is a parameter that depends on the number of messages received by the emitter during the last round of communication. This parameter controls the weight given by the node i to the corresponding message."}, {"heading": "3.2 Phase II of FrogSim", "text": "After K > 0 rounds of communication, the sensor event of a node i is selected from the execution of lines 6-15 of algorithm 1. < As already mentioned, this phase is used for the refinement of the current coloring, similar to a distributed local search. Note that in this phase, the \u03b8 values of the nodes are no longer changed. Within the scope of phase II, each node additionally maintains a so-called power parameter pi. This parameter is selected in the first round of communication of phase II with a positive random integer for the nodes i with ci = 1 and 0 for the rest of the nodes. In addition, the values of these power parameters are used to resolve conflicts that may arise during the color changes that are executed in phase II. In particular, in the case of two adjacent nodes - that is, two nodes that can communicate with each other - have chosen the same color, which allows one with the higher power value to maintain them."}, {"heading": "3.3 Determining and Storing the Best Coloring Found", "text": "It is intuitively clear that the current coloring of our system - that is, the coloring defined by ci colors for all nodes i - is not only improved over time. In some rounds of communication, especially in the second phase of the algorithm, the new coloring after the choice of new colors will actually be worse than the coloring of the previous round of communication. This behavior is very natural because the search space of a combinatorial optimization problem is characterized by quite a lot of local minima. If we assume that the current solution corresponds to such a local minimum, the only way to find a better solution for some iterations is to accept worse solutions for some iterations. In the context of metaheuristic algorithms, such an action is known as escape from a local minimum. To store the best coloring found by our algorithm over the entire simulation time, the following mechanisms are applied:"}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to feel as if they are able to save themselves."}, {"heading": "4.1 Results for Random Geometric Graphs", "text": "The aforementioned persons are able to abide by the rules that they have made their own, to abide by the rules that they have attached to the rules and that they have taken care of."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results for DIMACS Graphs", "text": "One of the most popular sets of instances in the context of graph coloring is the one introduced for the second DIMACS challenge [14], which aimed, among other things, to establish the most advanced techniques for coloring centralized graphs, which are generally larger and more complex than random geometric graphs, for example, and come from very different contexts, ranging from industrial problems to handmade cases created to show the ineffectiveness of certain algorithms, which are often used as benchmarks to study the quality of new algorithms, even in the context of distributed graph coloring (see, for example, [13, 27, 33, 31]). Results are presented in Tables 2 and 3, in the same way as in the case of randomly geometric graphs."}, {"heading": "4.3 Results for Grid Topologies", "text": "They can all be painted as a chessboard that requires only two colors. For example, see Figure 8. The way in which optimal coloring can easily be achieved is to start the coloring process in a single knot with the first color, and then proceed step by step. The next step is to color all neighbors of the start knot in the second color. All neighbors of these knots must be painted again in the first color, and so on. However, when looking at distributed calculations, the knots only have local information, whereas information about the position in the grid is missing. Moreover, the incremental process described above is difficult to achieve without global control. So, when grids are colored in a distributed way, what usually happens is that the coloring process is initiated in several different knots. If the coloring of these knots does not follow the distribution of colors, additional colors are ultimately required."}, {"heading": "4.4 Results for Small Instances from [27]", "text": "Finally, we present the results obtained by the three algorithms for rather small cases used by S. Lee in [27] to evaluate a firefly-inspired, distributed graph staining algorithm. We do not directly compare them with the results presented in [27], because the algorithm suggests [27] that the number of colors required for coloring is a priori known, that is, the algorithm must be executed for a predetermined number of colors. If graphs are large and chromatic numbers are unknown, such an algorithm is impractical. In any case, FrogSim and the algorithm from [27] behave very similar behavior for most instances, with some exceptions: for hexagon-based instances, FrogSim is not quite able to surpass the average results obtained by the algorithm from [27]."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "Graph coloring is a classic problem of modern mathematics with more than 150 years of history. In addition, the problem has been extensively studied in theory and practice. However, its connection to problems arising with the proliferation of wireless networks has aroused a particular interest in solving the problem in a distributed way. In such algorithms - due to the lack of global knowledge - the nodes must base their color selection solely on information obtained from their immediate neighborhood.The algorithm we have presented in this paper is inspired by the behavior of a family of frogs native to Japan, namely the calling behavior of Japanese tree frogs. The results obtained by the proposed algorithm compare very favorably with current state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, improved performance has been measured for about 90% of the instances studied. The benchmark set we have selected for comparison includes random geometric graphs, most of the graphs of the DIMACS problem, and we need wireless grid results to be very conducive to the other graphs, in addition to the proposed diagrams."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "This work was supported by the Spanish Government's TIN2007-66523 (FORMALISM) and the EU project FRONTS (FP7-ICT-2007-1), C.

as vertex coloring\u2014considers the problem of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that adjacent nodes do not share the same color. The optimization version of the problem concerns the minimization of the number of used colors. In this paper we deal with the problem of finding valid colorings of graphs in a distributed way, that is, by means of an algorithm that only uses local information for deciding the color of the nodes. Such algorithms prescind from any central control. Due to the fact that quite a few practical applications require to find colorings in a distributed way, the interest in distributed algorithms for graph coloring has been growing during the last decade. As an example consider wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks, where tasks such as the assignment of frequencies or the assignment of TDMA slots are strongly related to graph coloring. The algorithm proposed in this paper is inspired by the calling behavior of Japanese tree frogs. Male frogs use their calls to attract females. Interestingly, groups of males that are located nearby each other desynchronize their calls. This is because female frogs are only able to correctly localize the male frogs when their calls are not too close in time. We experimentally show that our algorithm is very competitive with the current state of the art, using different sets of problem instances and comparing to one of the most competitive algorithms from the literature.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
