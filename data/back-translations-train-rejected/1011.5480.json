Bayesian programming (Diard, 2000 and Lebeltel, 2004) is a probabilistic framework that encompasses the expressivity of Bayesian networks. Initially, the basic approach to working with Bayesian programming is to translate the incompleteness of perceptible information into uncertainty, which can then be addressed by probability theory.The dependence between variables is now specified as conditional probability, e.g. \u20acA \u21d2 B can be called P (B = true | A = true) = 1. The structure of a Bayesian program is as follows: Description questions Variable decomposition Parametric forms Programming Our model is now explained according to this structure. Once the known common decomposition consisting of the P (All variables), one can ask the questions that can be solved with Bayesian (similar to P)."}, {"heading": "Description Of The Model", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Variables", "text": "A very simple set of variables is as follows: We have the n characters as possible targets; each of them several bound variables. Health / Hangouts (HP) are discredited in 10 levels, from the lower to the higher. Distance (D) is discredited in 4 zones around the robot character: Contact, where it can attack with a contact weapon and then 3 distances, which are further out of range even for the longest distance weapon / spell. Ally (A) is a Boolean variable, which is allied with the robot character. Delta Hangouts (D) is a 3-rated interpolated value from the previous few seconds of combat, which inform about the injury (or nothing). Imminent death (ID) is also an interpolated value, which encodes HP and incoming attacks."}, {"heading": "Decomposition", "text": "The probability of a distribution competition is so high that the probability of a distribution competition is very high.

However, some variables encode combinations of perceptions and passed states. We could learn such parameters through the EM algorithm, but we suggest something simpler for now, because our \"not directly observed variables\" are not complex to calculate, but we calculate them from perceptions at the same time we learn. In the following part of the result, we did not apply the learning, but set the probability tables manually instead."}, {"heading": "Questions", "text": "In any case, we ask our model: \u20acP (S-T-hp1: n-d1: n-d1: n-d1: n-hp1: n-d1: n-d1), which means that we want to know the distribution on S and T by knowing all available state variables. To decipher this question, we can ask: \u20acP (T-hp1: n-d1: n-d1: n-d1-d1-d1-d1-d1-d1-d1), followed by (with the recalculated distribution on T) \u20acP (S-hp1: n-d1-d1-d1), which means that we want to know the distribution on T by knowing all relevant state variables."}, {"heading": "Example", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of us are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

We foresee some difficulties in the future, for example, for many games there is a possibility that the skill variable will be very large and that it will cause too high a computing cost. Therefore, we propose to bundle the skills into Global Capabilities (GS), which is a general approach to break down the complexity of the computation and can be used with other variables."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We believe that modeling human behavior has two major advantages: learning from examples played by humans, so that it can generate a behavior (control the character) and predict what the other players will do. Learning game sequences using a human model allows for rapid development of realistic AI in video games. It also reduces complexity by giving many possible actions and possible behaviors. Applying the model to other players for prediction allows the robot to have these predictions as input variables, and to act accordingly (\"I think you think...\"). Human players do long-term planning, consciously or not. However, modeling high-level cognition is very difficult. We assume that by modeling a reactive robot in terms of observable variables and predicted variables, we can emulate human planning."}], "references": [{"title": "An Architecture for Game Behavior AI: Behavior Multi-Queues", "author": ["M.
