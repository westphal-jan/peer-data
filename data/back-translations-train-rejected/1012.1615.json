An argument is a reason to believe that something is true. It can be a formal proof or a piece of natural language: for example, a reason to wear an umbrella. An argument's defining attribute is its defecbility: an argument can provide a reason to believe that something is true, but it does not prove that it is definitive.Argumenting (commonly referred to as reasoning) is the process of using arguments to justify a viewpoint. This process can take place between multiple actors (human or software) within a debate, or it can be executed by a single actor: e.g. a political speech justifying the government's decision to raise taxes.The subfield of computerized reasoning includes the use of computers to construct and use arguments. There are a wide range of areas where reasoning has been used, including: Artificial Intelligence and Law [5], Ontology Matching [18], Medical Decision Support Systems [7] and Mediation by Agents."}, {"heading": "3 Arguing over gene expression information", "text": "In recent years, it has been shown that people are able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves by putting themselves in a position to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves.

To this end, two experts were asked to review the overall list of previously generated systems and assign them a score: 0 does not agree with the scheme;? do not know - scheme is very weak and is on the border between rejection and classification as a weak scheme; 1 weak scheme, i.e. low confidence, i.e. there is a high level of trust. Overall, the two experts were asked to assign a score to 68 schemes - this is entirely agreeable - that they gave exactly the same score to 16 schemes."}, {"heading": "4.2 Reducing information overload", "text": "For some questions, there were no comments and therefore no arguments.

Rather, access via a RESTFUL web service that provides limited functionality and did not allow access to the data needed for this work. For example, it was impossible to ask for all genes expressed in a healthy mouse because ArrayExpress did not compute multifactor statistics, which calculates which genes were expressed in the pancreas in Phase 24, because ArrayExpress did not compute multifactor statistics."}, {"heading": "5 Future work", "text": "This work aims to model expert knowledge and bring it to reason with information sources available on the Internet. However, in the current use case, this use case is relatively limited and therefore limited: it focuses on one type of gene expression information for a model organism. Extending the use case to various types of biological information, such as gene-regulating networks, makes the use case considerably more complex. As the complexity of biological investigation increases, the need for user support also increases. The reasoning is a possible support mechanism. Another possibility for future work refers to CUBIST, Combing and Uniting Business Intelligence with Semantic Technologies, an EU FP7 project, which aims to combine the essential features of Semantic Technologies, Business Intelligence and Visual Analytics. Although data from unstructured and structured sources can be combined within a concept of Business Intelligence with Semantic Technologies, three application techniques of the Expression 7 project are referred to as \"Visual Techniques One.\""}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "This paper describes the reasons for the creation of an argumentation tool (argudas) to tackle the inconsistency and incompleteness in situ hybridization of gene expression resources for the developmental mouse. Furthermore, it discusses the development of argudas, which still highlights some of the critical issues. Also, the presentation of a conclusion - they want to make this decision - is clear that biologists are not interested in the full power of reasoning; for them, the ability to generate and automatically evaluate many arguments is not of primary interest. Nor is the presentation of a conclusion - they want to make that decision. As such, there is no place in argudas for the version of reasoning that has been done in previous work. Instead, the concept of an argument is reason to believe that something can be used to present important attributes that provide a good indication of whether an annotation is trustworthy, and about implication of whether a gene is expressed."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The support of the Human Genetics Unit of the MRC is greatly appreciated, especially the support of Dr. S Venkataraman, Dr. I Overton and Dr. J Christensen.
