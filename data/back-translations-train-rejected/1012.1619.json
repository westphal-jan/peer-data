One effective way to advance ontology research in the life sciences in general and SNOMED CT in particular is to provide appropriate software for researchers and practitioners. In particular, visualization and browsing tools can provide researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the structure and complexity of biomedical terminology. There are lists of existing browsers, such as those from the National Library of Medicine of the United States1 and the National Health Service2 of the United Kingdom, to provide a reference for researchers and practitioners. However, these lists are not comprehensive, not up-to-date and have not been fully evaluated."}, {"heading": "2 Architecture Overview", "text": "MySNOM is a web application that takes a multi-layered approach to decouple orthogonal functionality such as access control, graphical user interface, business logic and persistence. It is based on the lightweight, standard HTTP digest protocol [5] for user authentication and SQLite4 for quick access to terminology, and is hosted on a CGI-enabled web server in Figure 1.MySNOM is accessed through a web browser."}, {"heading": "3 User Interface and Diagramming Support", "text": "MySNOM uses a clean user interface to examine all relationships related to a particular concept, including inverted relationships. It places the current concept in the center of the screen, with reference concepts on the left and reference concepts on the right. This structure follows the extended left-right direction of the flow and displays the natural directed graph structure of SNOMED CT. Every concept and relationship clicked on is clickable. Each concept or relationship clicked leads to a new screen and becomes the current term. The current concept is shown only once on the screen. Users can hover over any concept to further review the concept (see SNOMED CT code). A screenshot of MySNOM leafing through the term \"chronic disease\" is shown in Figure 2.MySNOM supports the generation of diagrams that clarify the context of a given concept or serve as a graphical resource that can be embedded in SNODqT documents."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We have introduced an access-controlled, web-based, lightweight browser to provide structural navigation and concise diagrams for SNOMED CT using an authorized standard distribution of SNOMED CT. The browser can be viewed and tested under [8] and is freely available by contacting the author. As a future work, we plan to improve the prototype and add modularization support. Modularization support allows a user to store and export selected parts of SNOMED CT using ontological modularization techniques [9]. A tool with these features allows an in-depth study of the structure and capabilities of SNOMED CT. Thanks to Arantza Illarramendi, Jesu's Bermu'dez and Idoia Berges for their support, requests and feedback on MySNOM. Thanks to Stefan Martin Schulz and Mace\u00f1io Mace\u00f1io for their feedback on INCielo 1991 MaceCIM6BI Freiburg and their feedback."}], "references": [{"title": "Survey of current terminologies and ontologies in biology and medicine: Elect", "author": ["F.
