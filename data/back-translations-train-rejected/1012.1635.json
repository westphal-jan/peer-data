Although most of them were not developed for natural language analysis, ontological resources provide the domain knowledge required by text mineral systems. In addition, they provide the framework for consistent semantic integration of the various resources used in a text mineral system, as well as the integration of knowledge from other resources such as databases. This is in line with the vision of the semantic web that we use to combine the two technologies."}, {"heading": "2 Method", "text": "To collect the semantic frames (Releases 1.3), which are largely valuable for the description and processing of text in molecular biology, we have used biomedical verbs available through the PASBio project (Releases 1.0). It represents 29 verbs (representing 34 predicates) that have been selected for their use in the description of gene expression and related events. Assigning an FN frame to a verb is based on the definition of PAS predicates and their arguments, FN frames has become a candidate framework for a verb if the verb is a LU in the FN frame. We discard FN frames that either have completely different meanings for the verb or are too specific for biological situations. If there was no entry for the verb or gives all available frames for a verb, synonyms or words in its definition are discarded."}, {"heading": "3 Result and Discussion", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}], "references": [{"title": "The Berkeley FrameNet project", "author": ["CF Baker", "CJ Fillmore", "JB Lowe"], "venue": "In 36th Annual Meeting of the ACL and the 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 1998}, {"title": "BioFrameNet: a FrameNet extension to the domain of molecular biology", "author": ["AE Dolbey"], "venue": "Univerity of California at Berkeley dissertation", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Selecting an Ontology for Biomedical Text Mining", "author": ["H Tan", "P Lambrix"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Workshop on BioNLP, Boulder, Colorado,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Bridging the Gap between Domain-Oriented and Linguistically-Oriented Semantics", "author": ["S Uematsu", "JD Kim", "J Tsujii"], "venue": "In the Proceedings of Natural Language Processing in Biomedicine (BioNLP) NAACL Workshop 2009:162\u2013170,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2009}, {"title": "CJO: Ontology Design for Biomedical Text Mining.
