An e-Science Use Case", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it is only half as much as it is half."}, {"heading": "3. Rules for Choreography Scientific Workflow Execution", "text": "The architecture of Makna includes the wiki engine JSPWiki (http: / / www.jspWiki.org /), enhanced with several components for manipulating semantic data and the underlying persistent storage mechanisms. For a more detailed description of the Makna kernel wiki and the user interfaces it supports, see [DPT06]. For this work, we integrated the semantic wiki Makna and the workflow engine jBPM (jboss.com / products / jbpm), as well as the RuleML rule responder ESB middleware (responder.ruleml.org /).The architecture of the distributed system with jBPM and Makna consists of a J2EE server, J2SE server (s), this and the triple graph server that we implemented for implementing Makna and the triple graph memory."}, {"heading": "3.1 Semantic Workflow Annotation and Rule Integration", "text": "The insertion of workflow concepts into the semantic runtime model has two prerequisites: firstly, a mechanism must be provided that assigns the URIs of the ontology concepts to the scientific workflow models and domain-specific workflow instances; secondly, these URIs must be made accessible in the definitions of the process execution; and this integration of ontologies has the advantage of allowing access to existing domain-specific glossaries, taxonomies and ontologies from within the processes. Different scientific vocabularies, e.g. from different fields of research, can be imparted via the semantic deduction capabilities, with which semantic decorations of workflow execution can be performed using standard jBPM procedures."}, {"heading": "3.2 Semantic Flow Conditions", "text": "Facilitating semantically improved flow conditions in the process execution phase is desirable, as inference allows transitions and control flow based on the description of a workflow in the semantic model. jPDL and BPEL already support the association of transitions with Boolean expressions (or simple rules in BPEL) based on workflow relevant data. Our rules-based extension provides adequate high expressiveness for complex declarative flow conditions. Process execution continues through the first transition, whose associated expression resolves to true, or via the default transition, when none of the expressions resolves to true, although this behavior can be adjusted rule-based. This method allows easy rule-based control of the process on semantic model state."}, {"heading": "3.3 Semantic Assignments", "text": "Semantic user descriptions can be based on customized formalizations such as DOAC (http: / / ramonantonio.net / doac /). Task descriptions and assignments of responsibilities are somewhat more complicated because not only the general description of a task that applies to all task instances, but also details of the current execution of a particular instance can be relevant for assignments. Descriptions of users and tasks can use common concepts, e.g. by sharing domain ontologies such as the assignment matrix (ruleresponder.ruleml.org).The actual assignment of tasks to users is realized by a jBPM AssignmentHandler implementation that can be configured with a SPARQL query that points to these concepts."}, {"heading": "3.4 Semantic Search and Presentation of Workflow Individuals", "text": "For structured representation of semantic resources, we also support the formatting of SPARQL XML responses with XSLT. This functionality is encapsulated as another JSPWiki plugin, which additionally supports expressions that are resolved when rendering (e.g. logged-in user and page URLs). Remote driplestores are also supported via an endpoint parameter. The plugin allows the structured representation of workflow individuals such as tasks and process instances in the wiki. It can be organized from the JSPWiki template level (called by a JSP) or from the wiki page level (called by the wiki syntax). Another use of this plugin when creating lists such as semantically extended task lists. Tasks assigned to the logged-in user can be arranged according to domain-specific structures, allowing semantically extended task lists to be called."}, {"heading": "3.5 Rule-based Workflow Execution", "text": "Currently, language descriptions of business processes and business logs in a machine-readable manner such as JPDL and BPEL are only very basic qualification requirements. Expressive rule sets that are able to represent complex conditional decisions, tasks / goals and responses (e.g., event-driven action rules) required in scientific workflows are not supported. We have implemented a rules-based extension of jPDL and BPEL, the Reaction RuleML (ruleml.org and Reaction RuleML) as a platform-independent web response standard, and the Rule Responder ESB middleware (respondent) with the Prova (prova.ws) Rule engine as a platform-specific execution environment. The conditional control flow of a business process is defined by the order of sending and receiving message constructions in Prova's message response rules."}, {"heading": "4.
