Particularly inexperienced learners need either a human teacher / tutor or a very intelligent, personalized artificial intelligence of the eLearning environment to be guided by an individual learning process and learning path. Even for experienced learners, a person's learning process can be optimized through personalized didactics, dynamic assembly of pages and units, and in a strong way through an appropriate and unique learning path. In order to differentiate the results of personalized, individual didactics, page content composition, and path generation from traditional eLearning content, we call the dynamically generated, individual learning paths \"dynamic eLearning Trajectories\" (DeLTs). In order to increase the acceptance of an education platform, this device should be able to provide user data."}, {"heading": "STATE OF THE ART", "text": "The established eLearning platform ChemgaPedia (http: / / www.chemgapedia.de) comprises approximately 18,000 websites organized into approximately 1,700 chapters. Fig. 2 shows a screenshot of the current version. The educational content is designed for higher education in chemistry, pharmacy, biochemistry and related sciences. Target groups are teachers, students, experienced students and apprentices. Due to the high content quality of the platform, the most commonly used students, teachers and apprentices rely on the constant availability of platform and content. Content within the platform consists of text and multimedia elements such as animations, applications and videos. Course paths and the provision of pages and units are statically created by domain experts. Authors are responsible for the creation of content and the associated chapters and pages. Content is presented in XML format that specializes in a schema that represents eLearning content. All pages and media elements are stored in an XL database."}, {"heading": "STRATEGY", "text": "The goal of the collaboration between FIZ and CHEMIE is to develop an ontological copy of the current Chinese platform.

Currently, all content and especially the educational paths are statically created by domain experts.
