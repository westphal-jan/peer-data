To study the problem, we have previously focused on data warehousing technologies and statistical data integration. In this paper, we present recent work on extending our analytical capabilities using Semantic Web technology. A key new component presented here is a SPARQL endpoint to our existing data warehouse. This endpoint allows the merging of observed quantitative data with existing data from semantic knowledge sources such as Gene Ontology (GO). We show how such variegated quantitative and functional data can be integrated and accessed in a universal manner using Semantic Web tools. We also demonstrate how Description Logic (DL) reasoning can be used to infer previously unstated conclusions from existing knowledge bases. As proof of concept, we illustrate the ability of our setup to answer complex queries on resistance of cancer cells to Decitabine, a demethylating agent.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Dec 2010 00:06:28 GMT  (1013kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1648v1", "in Adrian Paschke, Albert Burger, Andrea Splendiani, M.

We used values from two sets of data obtained from the Corvus SPARQL endpoint, relative methylation values prior to treatment and the ratio of gene expression to pretreatment. Apoptosis-related genes were found using the merged triples from the GO notes.

It also demonstrates the importance of adaptation in mapping non-semantic data to RDF. While generic tools have recently accessed RDF, our experience with d2rq has shown that there are still areas where direct mapping is significantly more efficient and flexible. Our work also speaks to the benefits of using linked data, such as using the Bio2RDF normalized URI for RefSeqs, integrating the two branches of our ontology into a breeze. The flexibility of the Corvus model will allow us to integrate quantitative Omics data from a variety of modalities, which in the future could include cancer data from caArray or caIntegrator, or data obtained directly from the CorrayExpress prophylaxis model, based on MAGE tables that we have access to data from 12sDF."}], "references": [{"title": "Gene ontology: tool for the unification of biology", "author": ["M.

state and its response to anti-cancer therapy. To study the problem, we have previously focused on data warehousing technologies and statistical data integration. In this paper, we present recent work on extending our analytical capabilities using Semantic Web technology. A key new component presented here is a SPARQL endpoint to our existing data warehouse. This endpoint allows the merging of observed quantitative data with existing data from semantic knowledge sources such as Gene Ontology (GO). We show how such variegated quantitative and functional data can be integrated and accessed in a universal manner using Semantic Web tools. We also demonstrate how Description Logic (DL) reasoning can be used to infer previously unstated conclusions from existing knowledge bases. As proof of concept, we illustrate the ability of our setup to answer complex queries on resistance of cancer cells to Decitabine, a demethylating agent.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
