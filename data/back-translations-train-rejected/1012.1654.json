We address these challenges by applying the work done in argumentation theory in the context of semantic wikis and aiming to build a large scale of structured health-related reasoning corpus. Our work implements the idea of an argumentative web, as provided in [1], by facilitating the semantic reasoning of large consumers through [2] a large social start-up engine."}, {"heading": "2 Argumentation in Semantic Wiki", "text": "The reasoning patterns of human reasoning are as follows: argument of yesterday, argument of yesterday, argument of the evidence, argument of the position of knowing, or argument of the expert opinion (Figure 1). Argumentation patterns are defined by a set of premises Ai, a conclusion C, and a set of critical questions CQi. When a CQ is conveyed the credibility of the conclusion, the role of the reasoning process is highlighted by providing a subset of the most encountered counter arguments.

The related arguments are exported by SMW into Protege, where the strength of the reasoning in Jess is calculated on the basis of SWRL rules."}, {"heading": "3 Running Scenario", "text": "Considering the debate on the subject of vaccination and whether it can cause autism in children, the hypothesis is challenged by a pediatrician who supports the argument on the basis of expert opinion patterns (see Figure 3).Another opinion is held by a mother who relates the MMR vaccine to autism by filling in the template for the cause-to-effect argumentation.In preparing the arguments, the parties can use standard terms and concepts provided by the imported ontologies in SMW, capabilities provided by the extension semantic gardening. In this case, the causer field of MMR vaccine is described with the concept \"VO 0000731\" in vaccine ontology (www.violinet.org) through the submission chain: V O 0000731 v V O 0000641 v V O 000000047 v OBI 0000047 v MaterialEntiv Independentant Continuv Entiv Entiv Entiv Entiv."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "Semantic wikis are used within a medical context for collaborative knowledge acquisition, annotation, and integration: WikiNeuron, WikiHit, WikiProteins, BOWiki, LexWiki, or the Hesperian Online Digital Library [3]. Our approach is consistent with [4], which advocates the benefits of semantic wikis for exploiting structured information. Convincing arguments in favor of consumer health are analyzed in [5] using reasoning programs. By improving drug users with the ability to comment on side effects, regulators or the pharmaceutical industry could help identify problems with newly marketed medicines. One goal is to build large-scale corporations of reasoning for health care. Based on hierarchical reasoning frameworks, users can navigate between medical arguments with varying levels of technical specificity to understand the language and chains of reasoning."}], "references": [{"title": "Laying the foundations for a world wide argument web", "author": ["I.
