Therefore, combining information from different ontologies is useful to create a new ontology. [6] Integration is illustrated with a case study on toll-like receptors. If we want to investigate what kind of information is available about toll-like receptors, then molecular role ontology (MoleculeRoleOntlogy), then we will see that toll-like receptors are defined as pattern recognition receptors."}, {"heading": "2 Modules from Enriched Signature", "text": "In our case study, we used the following biomedical ontologies obtained from OBO Foundry: National Cancer Institute Ontology (NCI Thesaurus), GO Ontology (GO), Protein Ontology (PRO), Dendritic Cell Ontology (dendritic cell), Pathway Ontology (pathway), Molecule Role Ontology (MoleculeRoleOntology), Gene Regulation Ontology (Gene Regulation Ontology), and finally, Medical Subject Heading Ontology (MeSH). All of these ontologies are in OBO format, with the exception of the NCI Thesaurus, which is in OWL format. One module covers knowledge of a portion of the domain dedicated to a set of user interests (MeSH). Let T1 = {Toll, TLR} be this set."}, {"heading": "3 Ontology Mapping", "text": "In this paper, we use a looser definition of the concept of mapping compared to the definition in [3], in which mapping is a morphism. In our approach mapping is a subfunction that maps from the subset S1 Sig (O1) to the subset S2 Sig (O2). We consciously reject the morphism requirement, so the structural dependencies after mapping will not be preserved, because we are interested in the consequences of this mapping on the original ontologies, namely whether and how the structural dependencies are broken. For our experimental prototype system, we use our own mappings based on syntactical similarity. It has already been shown [1] that in the case of biomedical ontologies, the simple mapping methods are sufficient and exceed more complex methods. We compare characteristics (id, label, description) for all classes from ontology O1 with the same properties for all classes from metonshonshonshonshology as the LevenshO2 comparison, which is also determined in the empty space."}, {"heading": "4 Integration Information from Ontologies", "text": "The last step of ontology creation is the integration of the modules into an ontology. If there is a mapping between two classes Ci and Cj from modules Mi and Mj, we add the equivalence relationship owl: equivalence class between these classes in the new ontology. In addition to the equivalence relations, the new ontology contains the OWL: import axioms into which all generated modules are imported.So far, this all seems quite simple. However, the problem with this integrated ontology O1... n is that it contains many unsatisfactory classes. To understand the reason for this dissatisfaction, we have applied various experiments. First, we have merged all the pairs of modules, namely \u0136i6 = jOi, j-Mi-Mj. For each merged ontology Oi, j, we have checked the dissatisfaction classes. Already at this stage of integration, various merged classes contain unsatisfying classes."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We have described a method for generating a new ontology based on the bioontologies, most of which are available in the OBO Foundry. We have shown how to create modules based on the conditions of interest. The signature of module extraction is enriched by the symbols of other modules with the fixed point as the stop criterion. We have created integrated modules based on mappings created using the Levenshtein distance similarity. In this study we have shown how to solve unsatisfactory classes that arise after the integration of the modules. Although the number of unsatisfactory classes was high, it was possible to solve inadequacies using explanations provided by the pellet argumentation.In this study, we have shown that modularity and simple mappings provide a good basis for creating a new ontology in a pseudo-automated way. This method can be applied if an ontology engineer wants to create a reason rather than a new knowledge based on another."}], "references": [{"title": "Creating mappings for ontologies in biomedicine: Simple methods work", "author": ["A.
