Therefore, a number of phenotypic descriptions can encompass different domains and granularities from the molecule level to the organism level. Phenotypic descriptions have recently been described using terminological resources, with the human phenotype ontology (HPO) [1] being a prominent example. HPO ontology is a so-called precomposed description: it does not provide explicit links between the phenotypic descriptions (e.g. increased calcium concentration in the blood) and the relevant units associated with it, such as the chemical element involved (\"calcium\"), the way in which it is involved (\"increased concentration\") and where it appears (\"blood\"). Post-composed phenotypic descriptions intend to provide a more formal representation of the phenotype in order to interact with the units involved [2] and enable a more powerful argumentation."}, {"heading": "2 Method and preliminary results", "text": "It is indeed the case that we are able to set out in search of new paths to follow."}, {"heading": "3 Conclusions and future work", "text": "The benefits of integrating phenotypic descriptions with domain ontologies have already been discussed in the literature [2, 3, 4]. However, the consequences of integrating domain experts should be evaluated in order to identify potential unintended consequences. In this paper, we have conducted a preliminary evaluation 6 in which the state of the art (e.g. ontology reasoning, ontology modularization, logical difference) was reused to extract the set of new consequences in integrating post-composed phenotypic descriptions, such as the one provided by HPOPC, with domain ontologies. In the near future, we intend to develop a system that will assist the expert in recognizing and repairing unintended consequences, as in our previous tool ContentMap [5], in which we evaluated the integration of ontologies by mapping. In addition, domain ontologies contain cross-references (i.e. mappings) that we will not consider for this preliminary evaluation [6] that these new consequences have been proposed."}], "references": [{"title": "The Human Phenotype Ontology", "author": ["P.
