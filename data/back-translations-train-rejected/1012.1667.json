Analysis workflows based on highly specific algorithms often available as web services follow. The amount of data produced and consumed by this process is enormous, but the sheer amount of resources available is a source of serious difficulty. Within this vast set of resources, one of the main problems for the user is finding the right web services for a particular research task. Web services in the life sciences are large and complex: there are thousands of resources [1], most of which are available in public repositories, such as BioCatalogue [3], but unfortunately few are described by adequate metadata, which are essentially textual in nature, making the discovery and integration of web requirements difficult. Furthermore, there are many versions of different services that seem to offer the same broad functionality, but not enough metadata to decide which tasks are most appropriate for this kind of information."}, {"heading": "2 Approach overview", "text": "The general approach we propose to support the selection of web services based on user requirements consists of three main phases: (i) request entry and specification, (ii) normalization, and (iii) web service selection phase. Here, we mainly focus on normalization and web service selection phases. More details about this phase can be found on [4]. Figure 1 shows a fragment of the requirement model specializing in a sub-target and the tasks to achieve that sub-target. In the requirement model, task descriptions are expressed in natural language and must therefore be normalized in order to be processed automatically. Normalization consists of a semantic annotation process in which the task description is processed and processed by reference."}, {"heading": "3 Conclusions and Future work", "text": "Due to the importance of semantic normalization, we have commented on the available information of the services listed in the BioCatalogue with a biomedical semantic annotator. In return, the user's requirements are also commented with the same ontologies, allowing the application of a semantic search method to find associations between requirements and services. As a result, the user is provided with a series of ranking lists of web services suitable for his stated information requirements.Some direct follow-up actions of this work are the refinement of some details of the semantic techniques, the use of other metadata sources (bibliographic information, referenced websites) and the creation of a GUI to facilitate their application."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (grant TIN2008-01825 / TIN) and the Universitat Jaume I - Fundacio \u0301 Bancaixa (grant P11B2008-43)."}], "references": [{"title": "Semantic annotation of biomedical texts through concept retrieval", "author": ["Rafael Berlanga", "Victoria Nebot", "Ernesto Jimenez"], "venue": "BioSEPLN", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2010}, {"title": "BioCatalogue: a universal catalogue of web services for the life sciences", "author": ["J.
