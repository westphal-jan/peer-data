For example, the Wikipedia encyclopedia contains human-readable articles with texts, images grouped into categories and accessible via a full-text search engine. Despite the power of wiki, it is difficult to answer a specific query based on purely textual information. As a result, automated tools cannot understand and therefore exploit knowledge. Semantic wikis provide an open environment that allows for aggregating knowledge gathered by different teams involved in different fields of research, and allow interoperability between corpus in the event of annotations defined by ontologies. Nevertheless, the presentation and management of life science data and related knowledge requires a deep understanding of life science concepts. Chen and Carlis in [2] have identified four challenging features that make modeling in the life sciences difficult: 1) complexity of multifaceted knowledge; and multifaceted knowledge; and multifaceted knowledge."}, {"heading": "2 State of art", "text": "Wikis are easy to use, flexible and do not impose a predefined workflow, but as the amount of content in wikis increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to find relevant information. In the traditional wiki, semantics is not explicit, but is implicitly described by linking between articles and by the context of the link (surrounding text): wiki engine does not interpret the knowledge contained in link diagrams. A semantic wiki is a wiki that has been expanded with semantic web technologies, making it a suitable system for community-built knowledge models by adding machine-readable semantics. In addition, a semantic wiki supports the gradual formalization of knowledge and provides improved navigation and query capabilities. Below, we get an insight into semantic wikis for the life sciences. A wiki page at wikipedia1 maintains a list of bioinformatic wikis and several semantic wiki projects dedicated to the life sciences."}, {"heading": "3 WikiBridge Design principles", "text": "In this case, we are able to find an interactive solution that is tailored to the needs of people, both the needs of people and the needs of their fellow human beings."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In this article we introduce WikiBridge, a feature-rich semantic wiki. The first experiment with the use of WikiBridge3 shows many interesting possibilities for the scientific community, especially the possibility to share and build commented knowledge together. We have shown that flexibility and data quality required for scientific applications can be achieved by using wikis with semantic web technologies."}], "references": [{"title": "Semantic Wikis: A Comprehensible Introduction with Examples from the Health Sciences", "author": ["Maged N.
