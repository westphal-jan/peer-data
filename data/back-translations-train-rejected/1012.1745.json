Although RDF is the reference syntax for the Web Ontology Language (OWL), its serialization is complex and not meant for humans, allowing them to define higher OWL patterns in patterns. However, ExcelImporter Plugin5 for Prote \"ge 4.0\" was a step away from these tools and allowed users to transform spreadsheets directly into OWL axioms, but it was limited to a small set of OWL constructs. Newer tools to support template data and patterns include Mapping Master [14], OPPL 2, and the Prote \"Matrix Plugin6.\""}, {"heading": "1.2 Requirements", "text": "All previous tools developed in this area tend to focus on the transformation from template to ontology, offering little or no support for filling and validating the content of the template. Furthermore, tools such as ExcelImporter, OPPL and MappingMaster are integrated into the ontology development tool, so they are aimed at users who are already familiar with ontology development. A table-based tool for ontology authoring should shield the user from the underlying ontology and help him fill the template. Providing validation at the time of authorship should significantly reduce the time taken to debug and process the data collected in the table. Here, we list some key requirements for an ontology-based table editor: 1. Concepts can be described in relation to other concepts from other ontologies. When setting up Populous, users must be able to browse the ontology and the content must be limited to the column."}, {"heading": "2 Populous", "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before."}, {"heading": "2.1 Building an Ontology with Populous", "text": "The pattern in ontology states that each cell must have a nucleation. We must create a template with two columns, column A is for cell type concepts, while column B is for nucleation concepts. Ontologies that already exist cells and their nucleation, which we can import into Populous. By connecting with BioPortal, we can load cell typontology (CTO) [4] and phenotype and trait ontology (PATO) [8]. To limit column A to terms from the CTO, we highlight all cells in column A and limit them to all subclasses of the root class. Column B is a limited subclass of the nucleation concept from PATO. The template is now ready to be colonized by the domain expert. Figure 2 shows a partially populated template. The terms in green show a valid term has been entered into the automatic cell pattern."}, {"heading": "3 Use case and evaluation", "text": "The kidney is a complex organ consisting of several different anatomical compartments that together allow the filtration of waste from the blood in the form of urine. Each of the kidney compartments is composed of a variety of cell types, and the specificity of the compartments is based on these specialized cell functions, which together allow the filtration of waste from the blood in the form of urine. [12] describes kidney cells, their function and their anatomical locations. KUPO is built to annotate and integrate a variety of KUP-related data held in the kidney and in the Urinal Pathway Knowledge Base (KUPKB). A simple template was designed for experts from the KUP domain to capture the relationships between cell types, their anatomical location and their biological functions."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "It is not the way in which we fill this niche and meet the requirements outlined in Section 1. The simple tabular user interface is familiar to users who have already used a spreadsheet to lower the entry requirements for domain experts to contribute to the development of ontological development projects. However, the release of Populous is an early version; there are still many possible additions, some of which are: 1. Popular can handle multiple values in a cell that maps to the properties of Populous maps. Extensions to Populous as some small syntax can be used to expand the ability to use OWL's syntax would be useful as they are able to specialize numbers for cardinality and numbers."}], "references": [{"title": "RDF123: From Spreadsheets to RDF", "author": ["L. ] Han", "T.W.
