Recently, a finer behavioral measure, bisimulation, has been introduced to fuzzy finite automata. However, the results obtained are applicable only to finite-state systems. In this paper, we consider bisimulation for general fuzzy systems which may be infinite-state or infinite-event, by modeling them as fuzzy transition systems. To help understand and check bisimulation, we characterize it in three ways by enumerating whole transitions, comparing individual transitions, and using a monotonic function. In addition, we address composition operations, subsystems, quotients, and homomorphisms of fuzzy transition systems and discuss their properties connected with bisimulation. The results presented here are useful for comparing the behavior of general fuzzy systems. In particular, this makes it possible to relate an infinite fuzzy system to a finite one, which is easier to analyze, with the same behavior.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Dec 2010 00:24:42 GMT  (260kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2148v1", "13 double column pages"]], "COMMENTS": "13 double column pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yongzhi cao", "guoqing chen", "etienne kerre"], "accepted": false, "id": "1012.2148"}, "pdf": {"name": "1012.2148.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Bisimulations for Fuzzy Transition Systems", "authors": ["Yongzhi Cao", "Guoqing Chen", "Etienne Kerre"], "emails": ["caoyz@pku.edu.cn).", "chengq@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn).", "etienne.kerre@ugent.be)."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own if they do not put themselves in a position to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "II.

BISIMULATION", "text": "In the literature [3], [32], [36], the concept of bisimulation (V = 11) has been extended to opaque finite automata (which is an equivalence relationship to the state of the underlying automata).In this section, we present a general definition of bisimulation for FTSs, which is not necessarily an equivalence relationship and can be applied to compare different classes of models.In order to specify the key definition, we need the following idea. Let Si = (Si, i, s0i), i = 1, 2, be an FTS relationship. For a binary relationship R S1 \u00b7 S2, we use two different types of S2, which refer to the canonical projections of R on S1 and S2, respectively, and S2. Specifically, it is a biological relationship of S1 (R) = {s-S1, 2, its an FTS relationship."}, {"heading": "IV. AN ALTERNATIVE DEFINITION OF BISIMILARITY", "text": "This section is dedicated to an equivalent definition of bisimilarity. Based on this definition, we can explore further properties of bisimulation. In particular, we show that bisimilarity can be preserved by a parallel composition, which means that the behavior comparison of FTSs can be performed compositively. Let's start with the following observation, which provides a sufficient condition for a relationship to exist between FTS1 and S2 if for all countries (s, t) there is a comparison of FTS1, s01) and S2 = (S2, s02) two FTSs. A relationship R S1 \u00d7 S2 is a bisimulation between S1 and S2, if for all countries (s, t) a comparison of A and a comparison of S2 = (s, a) a comparison of S2 = (s, A, s2, s2, s02) a comparison of two FTS2, a comparison of two FTS1 \u00d7 S2, a comparison of two states."}, {"heading": "V.

(For this purpose, let us recall some terms and Tarski's fixed point theorem for the following areas of application. (P,) An element x-P is then called a fixed point f = f (x). (The following important theorem is due to Tarski [37]. Theorem 2 (Tarski): Let (P,) be a complete lattice and f: P \u2212 P a monotonic function.

SUBSYSTEMS, QUOTIENTS, AND HOMOMORPHISMS", "text": "Recall that the composition of FTSs attempts to build more complex systems by combining simpler components in predetermined ways. On the contrary, the identification of subsystems and quotients is an analytical process in which the structure in a pre-existing FTS must be searched for. Both subsystems and quotients are a special relationship between FTSs. Generally, it is possible to relate two FTSs via a homomorphism 2. This section is devoted to the notions of subsystems, quotients and their properties, the bisimulations.Let us begin with the notion of a subsystem. It describes the restrictive behavior of an FTS in which a subset of states could be found that was concluded under Evolution 2. This means that states in the given subset would be included only in each other and not in any other systems.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced FTS as a semantic model of some (possibly infinite) fuzzy systems. To compare two fuzzy systems on a finer level of \"semantic equality,\" bisimulation for fuzzy finite automata has been defined [3], [32], [36] extended to general FTT. Some new characterizations of bisimulation and bisimilarity have also been provided. Following the standard study of algebraic structure, we have promised to compare the meaningfulness of the two formal computer models with words established in [6], [8] through the use of bisimulation. There are some limits and directions in which the present work can be expanded. In [6], we have promised to compare the meaningfulness of the two formal computer models with words created in [6], [8] through the use of bisimulation. In the study, we have found that it is necessary to consider the defects of the FTS as infinite systems for infinite systems we can reconstruct with the fuzzy systems mentioned above."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX A", "text": "Let us first prove Proposition 4 as it provides evidence for Proposition 1.

In this paper, we consider bisimulation for general fuzzy systems which may be infinite-state or infiniteevent, by modeling them as fuzzy transition systems. To help understand and check bisimulation, we characterize it in three ways by enumerating whole transitions, comparing individual transitions, and using a monotonic function. In addition, we address composition operations, subsystems, quotients, and homomorphisms of fuzzy transition systems and discuss their properties connected with bisimulation. The results presented here are useful for comparing the behavior of general fuzzy systems. In particular, this makes it possible to relate an infinite fuzzy system to a finite one, which is easier to analyze, with the same behavior.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
