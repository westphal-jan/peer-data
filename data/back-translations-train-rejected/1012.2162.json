Introduction", "text": "The finite automata (also referred to as finite state automata or finite state machines) are therefore probably best known as Q 101 computer-aided machines and are used for modeling many systems in practice. Automata theory is closely related to formal language theory, since the automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they are able to recognize [15]. Finite automation gives a finite representation of a regular language that can be a finite set. It is widely known that finite automata are significant in many different areas, including computer science, linguistics, electrical engineering, philosophy, and biology. To address the inaccuracy in modeling some systems, blurred automata, and blurred languages, a meaningful extension of classical automata and formal language theory has been proposed. The mathematical formulation of blurred automata was first proposed by Wee in 1967 [36]. The basic idea of the formulation of the state, as opposed to a classical state, is one that can be switched to a menstrual state."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we briefly recall a few basic facts about fuzzy sets, fuzzy automata, and fuzzy A languages. Let's start with the term fuzzy sets initiated by Zadeh [40]. Suppose X is a universal set A, or rather a fuzzy subset A of X, defined by a function assigned to each element x of a value A (x). In light of this fact, a fuzzy subset of X can be described as a generalization of the characteristic function associated with a crisp subset of X. The value A (x) characterizes the degree of membership of x in A. In light of this, a fuzzy subset of X can be described as a distribution of possibilities to X.We denote from F (X) the set of all fuzzy subsets of X, and from P (X) the power set of X."}, {"heading": "3.

As the relationship between deterministic finite automata, non-deterministic fuzzy automata with -moves and non-deterministic finite automata with -moves has shown, deterministic fuzzy automata, non-deterministic fuzzy automata and non-deterministic fuzzy automata with -moves are equivalent in that they accept the same class of fuzzy languages. As an application of non-deterministic fuzzy automata, we are currently using them to model and specify non-deterministic fuzzy systems for discrete events."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under funding programmes 60873061, 60973004 and 70890080 and by China's National Basic Research Programme (973 programme) under funding programmes 2007CB311003, 2009CB320701 and 2010CB328103."}], "references": [{"title": "Fuzzy automata with -moves compute fuzzy measures between strings", "author": ["J.J.
