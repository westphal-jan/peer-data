In the following, the analysis of lower and upper limits is based on the assumption that readers are familiar with the concepts of conformity planning problems, such as the exclusive operators, consistent operators, etc.5.1. The basic analysis of variable models and fixed models represents the distributions of compliant planning instances, and the fixed model.

In these experiments, we test a large collection of conform planning instances with 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 suggestions for each density (ratio of number of operators to number of suggestions).

If the number of operators is above lb, almost all plan-conforming problems can be solved with plan modifications. The results of the experiments show that there is an experimental density threshold c, which separates the region, where almost all plan-conforming problems cannot be solved with plan modifications, from the region, where almost all plan-conforming problems can be solved with plan modifications.
