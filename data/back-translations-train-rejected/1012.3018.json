There are many industrial applications. To improve performance, some tools allow pre-processing of the model and verify online a number of properties that reuse the same compiled model; we prove that the complexity of the model checking problem is the same without pre-processing or pre-processing of the model or formula in a polynomial data structure. As a result, pre-processing does not always exponentially improve performance. Symbolic model checking algorithms work by manipulating state sets, and these sets are often represented by BDDs. It has been observed that the size of BDDs can grow exponentially as the model and formula increases in size. As a side effect, we do not prove that DnoDs have the strongest growth characteristics, but only one of the most pronounced ones in terms of the DnoDs."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is so that most people who are able to determine themselves are not able to determine themselves, are able to determine themselves, \"he said.\" But it is not as if, \"he said.\" It is not as if. \"\" It is as if. \"\" It is as if. \"\". \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\". \"\". \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \".\" \"\" \".\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \".\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \".\". \"\". \".\" \"\" \".\". \"\" \".\" \".\" \".\". \".\" \".\". \"\" \".\". \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \".\" \"\". \"\". \"\" \".\" \".\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \"\". \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \".\" \".\" \"\". \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \".\". \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\". \"\" \"\". \".\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\" \".\" \".\". \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\". \"\""}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Model Checking", "text": "In this section we briefly remember the basic definitions of the model check, which are required in the rest of the paper.

Intuitively, everything is necessary to define the state variables, the possible output states, and the possible transitions, i.e., we must clearly say whether the transition from state s to state s is possible. The formal definition is as follows: [42, 20]. Definition 1 A finite transition system is a triple (V, I,), where V = {x1,.,. xn} is a set of Boolean variables, I is a formula above V, and V \u00b2 is a formula above V, where V \u2032."}, {"heading": "2.3 Complexity and Compilability", "text": "We assume that the reader knows the basic concepts of complexity theory. [48, 31] What we mainly use in this work are the concepts of polynomial reduction and the class PSPACE.The model checking problem is also PSPACE-complete problem, and is also intractable. On the other hand, as said in the introduction, it makes sense to pre-process only part of the problem (either the model or formula) if this reduces the remaining running time. However, the analysis of how much can be gained by such pre-processing cannot be done with the standard tools of polynomial classes and reductions. The compilation capability classes [15] must be instead.The way in which the complexity of the problem is identified in the theory of NP complexity is that giving a number of increasing classes of problems is given. If a problem lies in a class C, but not in an inner class C, then we can say that this problem is more complex to solve this problem in C."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "The problem with the simultaneous transition phase is PSPACEcomplete [37]. In Section 3.1 we prove that the following problems have been solved; PSPACEhard, which means that they remain PSPACE-hard even if pre-processing is allowed; 2. the same problem where the LTL formula is the fixed part; 3. a set of transition systems and a formula as a fixed part of the problem, a state like the variable part, which checks whether the state is a legal initial state; 3. the problem where the LTL formula is the variable part; 4. a set of transition systems and a formula like the fixed part, which checks whether the state is a legal initial state. 4. we can conclude that pre-processing of the model or formula does not result in a polynomial algorithm for verification."}, {"heading": "3.1 Preprocessing Model Checking", "text": "We now identify the complexity of the model verification problem when the pre-processing of the model (represented as a composition of transition systems) is allowed, both in the synchronous and in the interleaved case.Theorem 1: The model verification problem for k synchronous simultaneous process MCsyn = < (M1), as well as in the interleaved case.Theorem 1: (PSPACE-hard, and remains), poses the problem for k synchronous simultaneous process MCsyn = < (M1, X).Proof. It is similar to the proof of theorem 2. We perform a reduction from the PLANSAT-1 problem that meets the conditions of representative equivalence; the main difference is via the LTL formulas.

In order to improve performance, some tools allow preprocessing of the model, verifying on-line a set of properties reusing the same compiled model; we prove that the complexity of the Model Checking problem, without any preprocessing or preprocessing the model or the formula in a polynomial data structure, is the same. As a result preprocessing does not always exponentially improve performance. Symbolic Model Checking algorithms work by manipulating sets of states, and these sets are often represented by BDDs. It has been observed that the size of BDDs may grow exponentially as the model and formula increase in size. As a side result, we formally prove that a superpolynomial increase of the size of these BDDs is unavoidable in the worst case. While this exponential growth has been empirically observed, to the best of our knowledge it has never been proved so far in general terms.
