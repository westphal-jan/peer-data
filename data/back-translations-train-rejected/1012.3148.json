However, when it comes to abstractions from the usual instruction of bots / machines, it becomes difficult to give any form of reasonable results. Hence, we conclude that it is the conscientious measures that are more difficult to implement in artificial intelligence than those that logic.Citations / Referenceshttp: / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Rodney _ Brookshttp: / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Marvin _ Minskyhttp: / en.wikipedia.org / wikikiprokikia.org / wikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikiki"}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2010, "abstractText": "Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to survive in it.
