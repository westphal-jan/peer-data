Personalized recommendations have become a mandatory feature of websites to improve customer satisfaction and retention. Recommendation methods can be distinguished into two main approaches: content-based filtering (M Pazzani, D. Billsus, 2007) and collaborative filtering (D. Goldberg and al 1992). Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most successful and widely used technologies to design recommendation systems. CF analyzes users \"ratings to identify similarities between users based on their past ratings, and then generates new recommendations based on like-minded users\" preferences. This approach suffers from several disadvantages, such as cold start, latency, thrift (Gras D., this system is an interesting one that we consider as a basis for working in conjunction with the paper)."}, {"heading": "1. PRINCIPLES", "text": "In this part we will describe the main principles of our approach, from the main hypothesis to the theoretical background."}, {"heading": "1.1 Target Tracking in the Cyberspace", "text": "In this work, we assume that a user is a destination that moves in a particular space, defined by the main categories that describe the resources considered, and that this space, known as the referral space, will have as many dimensions as categories. Figure 1 shows what this path looks like: based on this assumption, we will explain in detail what Kalman filters, how we can apply it in this case, and what our main assumptions are."}, {"heading": "1.2 Kalman filter formulation", "text": "The basic task of the Kalman filter is to estimate as accurately as possible the position and velocity of a moving object. (In our case, the moving object will be a user described in the new space of the categories of resources. First, we must define the state vector of a user. (The user becomes a point in the space of categories) This state vector at the time k will look like this: kkxxxxX (1) Wherex is the vector with the position coordinates x is the vector with the velocity coordinates x is the vector containing the acceleration coordinates. In a first step, we will only use the position vector x, but the knowledge of x and x will give us more details about the properties of the trajectories in the receiver space. Then we can formulate the problem of tracking by the following state space representation: Xk 1 AX AX k k k k k k k k k k. \""}, {"heading": "2. APPLICATION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Description of the experiment", "text": "This experiment is based on television consumption. The data set is the television consumption of 6423 English households over a period of 6 months (from September 1, 2008 to March 1, 2009) (Broadcaster Audience Research Board), (Senot, C. and al, 2010). This data set contains information about the user, the household and the television program. Each television program is characterized by one or more genres. In the experiment, a user profile is created for each person. The user profile is the set of genres associated with the user's interest in each genre. This user profile is worked out depending on the quality of a user's television consumption: When a television program is watched in full, the genre associated with that TV program increases in the user profile. Several logical rules are applied to estimate the user's interest in a television program. The methodology of the experiment is as follows: Each user profile is calculated at different times (35) from the television data. \"The following user filter is applied to determine the position in the calculation room."}, {"heading": "3. Numerical results", "text": "The obtained results can be represented as follows: Kalman filter predicts the interest of a certain user in a gender that knows its past. With this prediction, we can suggest a new recommendation strategy: If the quantity of interest (QoI) of the user is predicted to be located in a certain region of the room, we can recommend something within that particular region: For example, if the specific region is defined by the dimensions documentary and drama, we can recommend content that is related to these two dimensions. If the predicted quantity of interest (QoI) changes to another dimension of the room, we can automatically recommend content from this new region of the room. In the following figures (3 to 6) we can see the assessment / prediction given by the Kalman filter. The green lines show the prediction that is made each time using knowledge of the degree of interest of each user. Figure 7 shows the results of the cosmic distance between the cosmic values and the cosmic values was calculated."}, {"heading": "4. RECOMMANDATION PROCEDURE", "text": "In this approach we can make a recommendation by analyzing the estimate through Kalman filters.The profile is built from the consumption of TV programs. Each TV program is defined by concepts such as entertainment, science fiction, talk show, etc.. Analyzing the way in which different TV programs are viewed allows to derive the interest of a user for each concept.This point moves at any other time in space and thus forms a path. With the Kalman filter we estimate the next position of the user profil.The estimate shows the evolution within the concepts (in our case, 44 dimensions).This point moves in the environment and forms a path."}, {"heading": "4 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this essay, the main idea is to take into account that the one who selects films as the target moves along a trajectory in the receiving space. The receiving space is considered as 44-dimensional space, based on the main concepts that describe the films. Then, the position of the target is measured by the interest index expressed for each concept. Then, the Kalman filter applied with the help of a tracking model predicts the \"positions\" in the receiving space.If the user then knows the user's previous positions in that space along the different axis of 44-dimensional space, our Kalman-based receiving system suggests: If the user is interested in contents of types x, y and z, and if he has already seen contents of type x and y on that day, the recommendation would essentially focus on contents of the type that knows the position in the space, the best prediction for his next positions in the receiving space, i.e. his best interest space is to follow the content of type x and y that day, the recommendation would focus on contents of the type that knows the position in the space, the best prediction for his next positions in the receiving space, i.e. his best interest space is to keep the focus on the specific content of the target in the index he is accustomed to."}], "references": [{"title": "Neuromancien.
