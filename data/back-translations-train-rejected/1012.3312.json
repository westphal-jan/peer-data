Collaborative Knowledge Management", "text": "Knowledge Management (KM) is defined as a global process in an enterprise that encompasses all processes that enable the capitalization and sharing of the company's knowledge resources (capital). Knowledge cannot be decoupled from the context in which it is produced. Individuals or groups of individuals (knowledge producers) and their associated socio-cultural environment constitute the context of knowledge production. Therefore, KM considers the organizational culture in its implementation. It enables people with shared vision and culture to innovate through effective working. KM is therefore collaborative in nature. There are other factors that lie outside the culture that should be injected into the implementation of KM in organizations. These factors are organizational goals, technology and legal protection of Knowledge Resources (KR), [13], [14]."}, {"heading": "D.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we explained a recursive dynamic capitalization or a KM approach to controlling actors. \"Information expressed in problem-solving decision-making was problematized as a framework for strategic decision-making. Recursive dynamic algorithm for capitalizing knowledge was implemented in the form of a web-based prototype called the EICKC system. We conclude that the approach of dynamic capitalization of knowledge supports the process of knowledge validation among cooperating actors, thereby increasing the reliability of capital knowledge. Visualization of knowledge is advanced in the form of navigation systems under related KR or knowledge taxonomy. We are currently working on optimizing the visualization aspect of EICC systems for graphing knowledge networks. REFERENCE [1] V. Odumuyiwa, and S. Okunoye, A.
