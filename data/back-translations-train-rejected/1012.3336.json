Interaction between stakeholders is continuously tracked and recorded.We proposed the process of declaration and commenting for this dynamic acquisition of KR. The declaration process allows stakeholders to declare KR in terms of their roles and context conditions. For example, a decision maker expresses a decision problem that can be externalized in the form of a document. The comment process is used to capture recurrent communication between stakeholders, which supports the need for proper understanding and validation of knowledge between them. Externalized knowledge is subjected to validation to ensure that a high degree of reliability is granted by stakeholders on the basis of the implementation of the RR."}, {"heading": null, "text": "Figure 4 illustrates this phase by showing the dynamic acquisition in a timestamp characterized by td for the declaration of the timestamp and ta for the timestamp of the annotation.Figure 4: Dynamic knowledge acquisition process 3.1.2 Knowledge representationWe represent knowledge resources using a conceptual knowledge model.

It encompasses the new problem and the assessment of the actor on the relevance of the kr being exploited. Thus, it is possible to evaluate such a KC system. Furthermore, the strategy leads to the knowledge repository developing while there is exploitation by actors. The method of realizing this approach is collaborative filtering. Thus, the DC approach facilitates actors to share knowledge gained during knowledge exploitation by capturing and storing generated feedback, as well as the generated kr.

This paper discussed the knowledge capitalization approach in economic intelligence. We noted that EI actors collaborate in solving decision-making problems. During collaboration, there is a need for each actor to express their knowledge in a form that can be shared and understood by other actors. We proposed an annotation model that makes it possible to identify knowledge as an attribute-value pair in EI. Distinct knowledge is capitalized using our dynamic capitalization method. The need to manage interactions between collaborators led to the position of three levels of group consciousness. Our proposals were translated into EICC and MECOCIR. System.7. Reference [1].
