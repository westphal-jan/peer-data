Formally, a fuzzy set is a pair (E, m) in which it is a set of objects and m, a membership in a group of objects and m is a function m: E \u2192 [0, 1]. Fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains where information is incomplete or imprecise, such as pattern recognition, decision theory. The concept of distance and similarity is important in the field of fuzzy logic and sets."}, {"heading": "2 Information based distances", "text": "A good distance is one that only picks out the \"true\" dissidents and ignores factors arising from irrelevant variables or from insignificant random fluctuations that go into the measurements. In most cases, designing a good distance requires designing different distance functions. It can therefore be an expensive process to formulate a good distance, as the words that appear more frequently are less informative."}, {"heading": "3 Distance function", "text": "Let's write w.p for \"with probability.\" Let's [N] = {1,., N} be a domain of interest. Let's A ([N]) be a set with a membership function mA: [N] \u2192 [0, 1]. We use x to denote a value in [N]. Faced with two unclear subsets A, B (x) and mA (x) with the member functions mA (x), mB (x) \u2212 p, as mentioned in section 1, we call B (x): = max {mA (x), mB (x) and mB (x): min {mA (x), mB (x).

The data1 consists of responses to a survey given to the general population of 28 European countries. There are ten questions in the survey where a valid answer is a number in the set. (..)

It turns out that the distance is a semimetrist that fulfills the triangular inequality. Compared to other existing distance functions for fuzzy sets, this new measurement is proportional to the additional amount of information needed to describe fuzzy sets A if you know fuzzy sets B or vice versa. Therefore, it has a natural information-based interpretation. Because of this distance, we have shown that fuzzy sets that are summarized tend to be more informative. This is an interesting new property that can be useful for analyzing other data sets."}], "references": [{"title": "Modern Information Retrieval", "author": ["R. Baeza-Yates", "B.
