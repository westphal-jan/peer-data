Traffic signals are installed at junctions in accordance with traffic volume and safety commands. Over the years, there has been considerable interest in improving signaled junctions to minimize delays and stops. It has become possible to develop traffic management strategies that can adapt to current traffic conditions in real time thanks to the evolution of sensors. However, not much is known about the impact on the safety of traffic control strategies, especially adaptive ones.The CRONOS strategy is a real-time adaptive traffic management strategy developed in the 1990s (Boillot et al., 2006), relying on video sensors that provide snake lengths and spatial occupancy rates every second (Aual et al, your total traffic delay algorithm, 1996)."}, {"heading": "2 The Exposure to Lateral Collision in Signalized Intersec-", "text": "The concept of collision was introduced to \"take into account the amount of chance of collisions experienced by the driver of the traffic system\" (Chapman, 1973). Archer (2004) defines exposure as \"a measure of spatial or temporal duration in the traffic system in relation to the number of dynamic system objects, road users, vehicles, etc.\" In its most general definition, any necessary situation for a collision to occur can be considered a risk for the collision. The presence of road users on the cross-traffic approach is a necessary condition for the occurrence of a lateral collision in the conflict zone: while there is no risk of a lateral collision when the cross-traffic approach is empty, this risk is not zero if there is at least one road user in the cross-traffic approach. This latter situation is referred to as a critical situation for lateral collisions. In signalled crossings, red-light running is a second necessary condition for a collision in the conflict zone that is not being investigated."}, {"heading": "3 Data Description", "text": "The system used in this work extracts from video sensors spatial occupancy measurements of the entire intersection and linear for each lane of access. Each network unit can assume one of six possible states, representing the dynamics over one second of the road users who have passed the corresponding part of the road (see Figure 3). The six possible states can be aggregated into four main states: Empty, moving presence, stationary presence and end of the present. Data is difficult to interpret at network unit level. As the spatial and time definition is limited, it is not possible to identify individual road users and it is difficult to estimate the distances between them. To make interpretations more robust to noise, components of neighbouring network units are taken into account. Accurately, the neighbours of a network unit are the four (or two for lanes) closest to these units, or the groups are related independently."}, {"heading": "4 A Rule-based Method for the Detection of Critical Situ-", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 Detecting Stop Line Crossings", "text": "The first step in identifying critical situations and measuring exposure to lateral collision is to identify the origin of mobile groups of road users in the conflict zone, achieved by identifying border crossings using a method previously developed by one of the authors downstream (Midenet, 1998), based on rules that count the number of network units in some states on either side of the stop line to determine the situations before and after the stop line. This is a generic method that makes it possible to detect border crossings from one side to the other. Two subsets of network units, each upstream and downstream of the stop line, i.e. in the storage and conflict zones, they are limited, and continuously are only \"upstream\" and \"downstream. The number of network units considered for each zone can be adjusted in the system. For each group of network units, the ratio between network units is defined as the number of network units in the total state, divided by the total number of network units in the system."}, {"heading": "4.2 The Exposure Detection Method", "text": "Every second, groups of road users are detected in each zone of the intersection, the origin of moving groups in conflict zones is identified, and the time periods Z, X, Y and Ym are updated according to the algorithm. 5. Algorithm 5. The method for detecting hazards. If at least one group of road users crosses the conflict zone of approach A (or B) Z (A) (or Z (B))), increments are made if at least one group of road users is incremented in approach B (or A) Y (A) (or Y (B)), if one of the narrow groups of road users in approach B (or A) increments Ym (or Ym (B)), while X (A) (or X (B)) is incremented. In each example in Figure 3, a group of moving traffic users in the conflict zone (corresponding to the connected components of 6 or 4 network units in the \"Movement of the Road\" state) is incremented."}, {"heading": "4.3 Evaluation", "text": "Since the duration of Ym is a small subset of Y, more time is needed to collect enough data for Ym. Using the video recordings, 10 and 20 minutes of data in peak traffic situations were commented manually for Ym and Ym for each strategy, respectively. Validation results are presented independently in Table 1 as a binary classification problem for the duration of Y and Ym. It seems that the automated detection of critical interactions is reliable. Results are better for Y, where the recall for three intersections / points of origin reaches more than 92%, than for Ym, where the recall is above 75%. Furthermore, the performance of the method is relatively similar for both traffic control strategies."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "The approach is precise enough to process large amounts of data automatically, and the result will be further analysed to estimate severity indicators related to road user speeds (Saunier et al., 2004; Saunier and Midenet, 2010) and to compare the impact of traffic management strategies on exposure to lateral collisions (Saunier, 2005; Midenet et et al., 2010).A fair question is the universality of the method. The model of exposure can be applied to all intersections, whether signalled or not, but was developed in the specific case of signalled intersections with protected left-hand turns. It is not as easy to replicate the respective system and the data on which the method is based, but the method has been described as fully as possible to serve as an inspiration for other work."}], "references": [{"title": "Methods for the Assessment and Prediction of Traffic Safety at Urban Intersections and their Application in Micro-simulation Modelling", "author": ["J.
