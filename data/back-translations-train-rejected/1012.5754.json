In this thesis, we use the method of dual variables RR proposed in [21], since it uses core functions to enable the construction of nonlinear regressions without having to perform expensive compressions in a high-dimensional feature space. In order to approximate a number of sample projects, the well-known RR procedure recommends a series of projects {(x1, y1) in which xi n is the vector of attributes (cost drivers) for the i and yi projects, the known RR procedure (the known RR-positive method) in the 12velw-1 (the preceding method)."}, {"heading": "4 Genetically Evolved Cost Driver Subsets", "text": "A group of individuals develops, each pursuing a specific goal."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments and Results", "text": "The proposed genetically engineered software cost driver algorithm was implemented using the MATLAB genetic algorithm (R2008b) and the Direct Search Toolbox [22] and had a twofold objective: firstly, to select the best subset of cost drivers from a larger pool of drivers, and secondly, to minimize the relative error rate of the RR technique. The ISBSG dataset used in the experiments contained a large number of project attributes relating to the application domain, the programming language used, the language type, the development technology, the resource level, the functional size of the software generated, etc. The dataset contained numerical, categorical, multi-category and zero values, and so we performed the following column and row filtering actions by: a) excluded attributes measured after the project was completed and therefore not feasible for the cost model for the remaining attributes, and we excluded the number of data."}, {"heading": "5.2 Results", "text": "The summary statistics of the output (depending on) of the variables used in the experiments are presented in Table 1. Figures show large differences between the actual data used for the estimate. To test the performance of the proposed approach, we randomly divided the data set into training and testing kits 10 times, with 80% of the projects each included in the training and the remaining 20% in the testing kits. Our DG was then applied to each of the resulting training sessions with a population of 100 generations producing the selected cost drivers for the corresponding partition. The selected cost drivers were then used as inputs for training the RTD technology and the evaluation of their cost estimates for the training. The attributes obtained are used in the developed subset of selected cost drivers for the corresponding partition."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "This work suggested the use of the dual variable Ridge Regression (RR) technique in conjunction with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to develop the selection of cost drivers to be used as input factors for estimating software expenditure. An important advantage of using a GA is that it can efficiently search the vast space of possible combinations of cost drivers and achieve a near-optimal result. Results from the evaluation phase of our experiments show that the proposed algorithm has not only reduced the number of cost drivers used to less than half, but has also led to an improvement in the performance of the dual variable RR technique. In the future, we plan to further investigate the impact that each cost driver has on the resulting predictions that allow for data sets other than coding decisions."}], "references": [{"title": "Applications of Fuzzy Logic to Software Metric Models for Development Effort Estimation", "author": ["A.R.
