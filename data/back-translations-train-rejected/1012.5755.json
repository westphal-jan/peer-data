Main objective of the method is to predict the effort (cost) of the project using estimate (target case) using historical information from completed projects with known efforts. Once the new project with attributes (or features) 1 is discontinued along with those of historical datasets (training), three basic steps must be followed."}, {"heading": "3 DD-EbA algorithm description", "text": "DD-EbA in this paper focuses on the limitation of the traditional method to choose a different number of neighbors for each target case. The traditional method has no criterion for what leads to the a priori choice of a fixed number of neighbors, without taking into account an optimal number for each target case. This means that when a new case needs to be estimated, the number of neighbors for the estimate is predefined and fixed. In this study, we are trying to take a first step towards a new approach that essentially determines the appropriate number of neighbors, separately for each specific new case that needs to be estimated. This is a way of dynamically calculating neighbors that are adapted to the specific characteristics of each project. To achieve this, we assume that there is a unique Pi project in education that is similar to the target case, that their distances from all other projects are distributed in a similar way."}, {"heading": "4 Methodology", "text": "Up to this point of work, we analyzed two approaches, LOOCV-EbA and DD-EbA, which can provide a cost estimate for new projects. We explained LOOCV-EbA in a nutshell in Section 2 and our approach, the main aspect of which is the dynamic choice of neighbors for EbA in Section 3.Our goal is now to investigate the predictive power of the two algorithms by applying the procedure Leave - One - Out. Three measurements of local accuracy (in the sense that the error is measured in one point) are calculated (Table 1) for each project i, i = 1, n: 1. The magnitude of the relative error (MRE) 2.

For each data set, we examined the accuracy measurements derived from the closest neighbours (analogies), which yielded the best (lower) MdAE results. In Table 3, we present the results of the two methods on the basis of global accuracy measurements. As we can see from the results, there is no significant difference (sig > 0.05) between the AE of LOOCV-EbA and DD-EbA. Generally, the methods provide the same performance in terms of global accuracy measurements. DD-EbA, however, performs much better in terms of compression costs.MMRE MdMRE MdMER MAE and DD-EbA Sig.MaxwellLOOCVEbA 1.29 0.650.19 D4570.60.54554633.5333.6930.6940.6930.59930.533.53D-EbA"}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we examine the problem of selecting a certain number of neighbors in order to estimate the cost of using EbA. In detail, we first analyzed a well-known from the bibliography method, the LOOCV-EbA. This is a combined technique, because apart from the traditional EbA, it uses the holiday - a cross validation method for any number of neighbors and results in a single optimal number of neighbors that can be used for new cost estimates. The LOOCV-EbA method works efficiently, but it has a large number of iterations, growing with the size of the record. In addition, once the number of neighbors is defined, all new projects must be estimated by the same fixed number. Due to this fact, the inability of LOOCV-EbA to adjust the results neighbors in any specific way."}], "references": [{"title": "Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis", "author": ["J.O.
