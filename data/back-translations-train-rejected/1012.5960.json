This method is similar to the concept of extending points with an internal reference direction to get oriented points which are the basic entities in the OPRAm calculus. Even if the spatial objects are from a geometrical point of view infinitesimal small points locally available reference measures are attached. In the case of OPRAm, a reference direction is attached.

Typically, in qualitative spatial studies, differences between configurations are made."}, {"heading": "2 Hidden Feature Attachment with Point Calculi and Elevation of Points", "text": "This motivation is necessary because qualitative calculations characterize central essential characteristics of objects or configurations (see section??). A simple featureless point would of course not have an internal reference direction. The conception that makes the internal reference direction plausible is a transition from a calculation based on straight line segments (dipoles) [9] of specific length to line segments of infinitely short length. In this conception, the length of the objects no longer matters. Thus, only the direction of the objects is modeled. O-points, our term for orientation points, are specified as a pair of a point and a direction at the 2D level [7]. In this method, a characteristic used as a local reference to an object at the 2D level, which geometrically is still a featureless point, is extended to other than directions."}, {"heading": "2.1 Qualitative o-point relations", "text": "In a rough representation, a single o-point induces the sectors shown in Fig.???, \"front,\" \"rear,\" \"left,\" and \"right\" are linear sectors; \"left-front,\" \"right-front,\" \"left-back,\" and \"right-back\" are quadrants. The position of the point itself is called \"equal.\" This qualitative granularity corresponds to Freksa's simple and double cross-calculation [4, 14]. In OPRA2, in the general case where the two points have different positions, we use the following relation symbols (the abbreviations lf, lb, rb, rb, rf-front, rf-front, \"right-back,\" and \"right-front,\" respectively): front-front, lf-front, lf-front, lf-front, lf-front, lb-front, rb-front, rf-front, lf-relationship."}, {"heading": "2.2 Elevated o-point relations", "text": "In this conception, the basic local perceptions of the cognitive agent are the basis for the agent's ability to distinguish relative distances. In this conception, the point representing the place is \"elevated\" via the 2D level (see Figure 3). From this observer perspective, Gibson's insights into the natural perspective [5] motivate the availability of depth points that allow the observer to distinguish local distances by height as reference distance. In the case of OPRAmal calculation, where the entities are oriented as o-points, the elevated entities are referred to as elevated o-points or eo-points.The granularity shown in Figure 3 corresponds to a granularity of m = 2 (for the concept of scalable granularity that we compare [10])."}, {"heading": "3 Conclusion", "text": "The method we have used is similar to the concept of extending points with an internal reference direction in order to obtain reference points that are the basic units in the OPRAM calculus. Local reference distances, called elevations, are appended to the basic units of the calculations. The principle of attaching reference marks to a point is called a hidden feature attachment."}], "references": [{"title": "Qualitative Represenation of Positional Information", "author": ["E.
