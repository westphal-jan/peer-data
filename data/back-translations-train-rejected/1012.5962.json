The annotations are defined and located in such a way that the original English text is not altered (not even a letter), thus allowing for a consistent reading and learning of the English language with and without annotations. The annotations are based on a set of general rules that make the frequency of annotations not dramatically high. This makes the reader easily associate annotations with exceptions, and makes it possible to shape, internalise and consolidate some rules for the English language which otherwise are weakened by the enormous amount of exceptions in English pronunciation. The advantages of this annotation system are manifold. Any existing text can be annotated without a significant increase in size. This means that we can get an annotated version of any document or book with the same number of pages and fontsize. Since no letter is affected, the text can be perfectly read by a person who does not know the annotation rules, since annotations can be simply ignored. The annotations are based on a set of rules which can be progressively learned and recognised, even in cases where the reader has no access or time to read the rules. This means that a reader can understand most of the annotations after reading a few pages of Annotated English, and can take advantage from that knowledge for any other annotated document she may read in the future.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 15:40:09 GMT  (72kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5962v1", "Keywords: English spelling, English pronunciation, Phonetic rules, Diacritics, Pronunciation without Respelling, Spelling Reform. 68 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 30 Dec 2010 10:21:09 GMT  (72kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5962v2", "Keywords: English spelling, English pronunciation, Phonetic rules, Diacritics, Pronunciation without Respelling, Spelling Reform. 68 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Keywords: English spelling, English pronunciation, Phonetic rules, Diacritics, Pronunciation without Respelling, Spelling Reform. 68 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jose hernandez-orallo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1012.5962"}, "pdf": {"name": "1012.5962.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["t\u0117d \u0116nglish", "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez-Orallo"], "emails": ["jorallo@dsic.upv.es"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The annotations are based on a set of general rules that do not dramatically increase the frequency of annotations (despite the chaotic orthography of English), allowing the reader to easily associate annotations with exceptions, and making it possible to shape, internalize and consolidate some rules that would otherwise be weakened by the enormous amount of exceptions in English pronunciation.

With our notation, \"flower\" [flaU @] and \"flour\" [flaU @ UK] are used. We use [\u00f4] to represent the particular sound of the \"r\" in English as opposed to other languages.

To avoid confusion, we must clarify this, which may be the case for words that have more than one possible pronunciation (and the commentator does not want to choose between them). Another case is if the commentator (which could be an automated system) does not know the annotation for a word. Finally, another case is for foreign words, especially for places and names.

Although we have to consider every possible case, most cases can be handled simply by a subset of the following rules and correspondences. We will first evaluate vowel units with one vowel (both stressed and unstressed, rhotic and non-rhotic) and then we will evaluate vowel units with two vowels (stressed and unstressed, rhotic and non-rhotic)."}, {"heading": "Vowel Units with One Vowel .", "text": "First, we will deal with vowel units with only one vowel (i.e., a, e, i, y, o, u, and w). We will distinguish three cases: uncommented, natural position, and simple position. Uncommented, unstressed vowel units with only one vowel are pronounced as shown in Table 4. Note that the sound is independent of whether it is followed by an \"r,\" because uncommented, unstressed vowels are always non-rhotic. This means that \"misleading vowels\" generate an [Ir-] sound for the first \"i\" (not [3r-] or [I @ r-]). This is handy in GA, since \"menhir\" would generate a letter [-Ir], while we must note it as \"menh-Ir\" for RP to do [-I @ r], which also works for GA."}, {"heading": "Vowel Units with Two Vowels .", "text": "The appearance of the symbol \"j\" in the pronunciation of the vowel \"u\" depends on the preceding consonant and the English accent, which is explained below. Here, the rule shown above, that a note that extends over two vowels equals the note of the first vowel and the deletion of the second vowel, is very useful. It is especially useful for diphthongs: \u00e2ae, \u00e2ay, \u00e0ow, \u00e0eu, etc., and other notes | oo that can be used to break the default note of the first vowel.

As discussed in the introduction to read a commented English, someone (or something) must comment on the text beforehand. As seen in the illustration, we may need two inputs for the introduction: the English word and its pronunciation to produce an output: the commented word. We can distinguish two topics that go from the English word + pronunciation to the commented word, which can be simple in other cases, but awkward in others, the problem is like the search for a transformation, with deletions, insertions and substitutions that make an approximation between the original English word and its pronunciation. The problem is simpler than the general problem that we find a transformation, with deletions and substitutions that bring the original English word into line with its pronunciation."}, {"heading": "4.1 Annotation Preference Criteria for a Standard Annotation", "text": "In order to define a norm that prefers a comment to others, we can consider the following types of criteria: - Efficiency.

We oppose this option in principle, as the good thing about annotations on common words is that they help to learn the pronunciation of other, less common words with the same annotation.The five most common words according to [5] are, for example: (the, from, to, and, a. If we omit annotations on the five of them, we have a significant reduction in the annotation ratio, as we discuss in the conclusions. Perhaps we can treat words that change from a strong of and a weak form differently. In fact, the first most common words have this property, as in Table 21.

For example, \"struck\" and \"bridges\" would remain uncommented on. We did not take this into account (though speakers are well aware of it) because we want to emphasize the distinction between \"loaves of bread\" and \"stuffed\" and \"struck\" and \"stuffed.\" Another problem might be to turn \"ed\" into \"t\" when preceded by a voiceless consonant group (to avoid the comment in \"stuffed\"), which would be consistent with what we do with the \"s,\" where we do not need comments on \"loaves\" and \"rats,\" although the \"s\" is pronounced and wordless \"is respectfully expressed, but we present the combination here is more consistent for the discussion."}, {"heading": "A.3 The Rules for Natural and Plain Positions", "text": "An interesting study would be to simplify the rule and consider all positions as simple, except when they are emphasized at the end of a segment. Words such as \"be\" and \"go\" would be considered natural positions, for example, but \"plane,\" \"code,\" etc. would be considered simple positions, which requires a note. Although this is contrary to traditional English spelling and pronunciation rules, it is competitive in terms of annotations. Thus, Table 22 shows a text with the annotation system that we have presented in this document on the left, and it shows the same text with the modification of the rule of natural position on the right.

Our rules try to accommodate the spoken sound between vowels in ordinary words (\"this,\" \"light,\" \"cause,\" \"music\" etc.) and also at the end of the word after a vowel or a spoken consonant (\"like,\" \"\" is \"and many plurals).

Another option we considered at an early stage was to make it non-rhotic when the vowel was commented on. For example, \"truck\" would become \"l\u0430orry\" and \"syr \u02da up\" would become \"s\u0442 yrup.\" However, there are problems distinguishing between launch and pirate (the first is rhotic and the second is not). The comment \"p-\u0131rate\" and not \"launch\" would be an opaque method of transferring the idea. So we finally decided to consider the r \u02da.

22}], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "This document presents _Annota \" t\u0117d \u0116nglish^, a system of diacritical symbols which turns English pronunciation into a precise and unambiguous process. The annotations are defined and located in such a way that the original English text is not altered (not even a letter), thus allowing for a consistent reading and learning of the English language with and without annotations. The annotations are based on a set of general rules that makes the frequency of annotations not dramatically high (despite the chaotic orthography of English). This makes the reader easily associate annotations with exceptions, and makes it possible to shape, internalise and consolidate some rules for the English language which otherwise are weakened by the enormous amount of exceptions in English pronunciation. The advantages of this annotation system are manifold. Any existing text can be annotated without a significant increase in size. This means that we can get an annotated version of any document or book with the same number of pages and fontsize. Since no letter is affected, the text can be perfectly read by a person who does not know the annotation rules, since annotations can be simply ignored. The annotations are based on a set of rules which can be progressively learned and recognised, even in cases where the reader has no access or time to read the rules. This means that a reader can understand most of the annotations after reading a few pages of _Annota \" t\u0117d \u0116nglish^, and can take advantage from that knowledge for any other annotated document she may read in the future. These features pave the way for multiple applications. _Annota \" t\u0117d \u0116nglish^ can be used as a tool for teachers and parents when English-speaking children learn English orthography or simply when they start reading. Annotated textbooks, tales, dictionaries and any other material can make English orthography less painful. _Annota \" t\u0117d \u0116nglish^ can also be very useful for students of English as a foreign language, since pronunciation is terribly troublesome for them, because they need to learn the meaning, the spelling and the pronunciation for each word they learn, and the pronunciation does not improve at all by reading. This is so because we can only see the spelling and infer the meaning, but books do not provide the correct pronunciation for each word. In fact, incorrect pronunciation (we are not referring here to a bad accent or intonation) persists in people who has lived in an English-speaking country for decades, because the true pronunciation is never shown (unless the IPA transcription is looked up in a dictionary), just heard in different contexts and situations. Finally, _Annota \" t\u0117d \u0116nglish^ can also be very practical for any regular user (native or not) of the English language, very especially when facing new (especially technical) words and they have doubts about their pronunciation. In this document we introduce the rules for annotations and its symbols. This document is not intended for a general audience, and the explanations are focussed to precisely understand how the annotation system works. It is obvious that if the system has to be explained to a final user, a shorter and simpler manual should be issued for that. In any case, for learning _Annota \" t\u0117d \u0116nglish^, the best thing is to take a look at the examples. There is a section in this document with some annotated texts. It is recommended to take a quick look at them before getting into details.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.98 Copyright 2009 Radical Eye Software"}}}
