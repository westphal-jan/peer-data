To achieve this, it is possible to use complex devices to enhance immersion, such as surround sound systems and stereoscopic screens. Another possibility is to create rich environments to increase the presence, which can be achieved, among other things, by having characters with credible behaviors (Bates 1994). To generate these behaviors, artificial intelligence models are used in the game industry. In order for these models to perceive the environment, game designers need to create a simplified representation of the environment, which is often defined as prioritized. Manually determining the representation of each new environment is a time-consuming work. We suggest that our characters will be able to learn these representations in order to be autonomous. This learning will be unattended and online: the character will learn while playing, judging the person."}, {"heading": "LEARNING A REPRESENTATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT", "text": "The problem with the latter solutions is that they use algorithms to find the optimal path between two points and not the most credible path. With diagrams it is possible to have more control over the paths used by the characters. Instead of creating diagrams a priori, we want them to be learned by imitating a human player. This work than done in (Thurau et al. 2004) where nodes and a potential field are learned by people playing a video game. The character is then using this representation to move around the game environment, following the field defined at each node. To learn the position of the nodes, we use an algorithm called Growing Neural Gas (GNG)."}, {"heading": "EVALUATION", "text": "rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"}, {"heading": "IMPROVEMENTS", "text": "The biggest difference between the GNG we implemented and the manually encoded navigation graphs is that the latter also provide information about the accessibility of one node from another. Edges in a GNG only give information about proximity, but there may be an obstacle between two nodes connected by an edge. An idea might be to store the previously enabled node and create an edge to the currently enabled node. Like the GNG edges, we should leave the edge channel age and disappear when it is too old. Whether these edges should replace the GNG edges could be an interesting experiment to share more information with the behavioral model, we can learn what kind of action is performed when the sign is near a node. The sign that knows its next node can select the best action to do."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Virtual environments, such as video games, need credible characters so that the user can feel in the environment. In order to improve the behavior of the characters, we have decided to use a growing neural gas to learn by mimicking the topology of the environment. We believe that it will lead the agent to use the environment more humanely. It also takes the burden off the map designers to place the navigation graphics manually. Our initial evaluations tend to show that the growing neural gas provides a good representation of the environment. Learning is fast, with a demonstrator taking up to 25 minutes to learn a representation of the entire environment. As it is possible to learn with several demonstrators, learning can be done very quickly. Therefore, the character can quickly adapt to changes in the use of the environment and develop during game.Although different runs provide different results, the representations are very similiar.With this ability to learn the environment, the agent can be deactivated in any simulation without prior knowledge of the gas and can still move very quickly through the gas."}], "references": [{"title": "The Role of Emotion in Believable Agents", "author": ["J Bates"], "venue": "Communications of the ACM", "citeRegEx": "Bates,? \\Q1994\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bates", "year": 1994}, {"title": "Learning Human Behavior from Analyzing Activities in Virtual Environments MMI-Interaktiv", "author": ["C Bauckhage", "B Gorman", "C Thurau", "M Humphrys"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Bauckhage et al\\.,? \\Q2007\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bauckhage et al\\.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Specification by-Example of Virtual Agents Behavior", "author": ["A.
