THE PROPOSED F-CONTEXT FRAMEWORK", "text": "In this section, we present the LAP-inspired framework used to position our proposed f-context in various layers of a service-based architecture, followed by our conceptual view of the context, which separates simple, raw quantitative parts of the context from richer, qualitative sources of context information. We also give a brief introduction to spatial, temporal, and psychological human need areas, which are considered to be three important roots of high-order uncertainty."}, {"heading": "3.1. The LAP-inspired framework and the position of f-Context", "text": "There is a trend from the static, informational view of the context to a more dynamic, interactive view. LAP theory, which was introduced in this context, is based on the theory of language activity and can help to create such a view. LAP-inspired structure consists of 11 layers grouped into three main levels. The first subordinate level of communication is that communicative actions are performed, and consists of 3 layers dealing with basic channel operations, the layers are not able to be distributed across three main levels."}, {"heading": "3.2. Realizing the LAP using CWW based on type-2 fuzzy logic", "text": "A major obstacle to the use of the LAP theory is the lack of an implementation method. In LAP, communication between people is performed with words from a context-dependent vocabulary. Since humans are engaged in this communication, there are high order uncertainties associated with words. Therefore, the method chosen should be mathematically powerful to cope with the high-order uncertainty of group communication. On the other hand, it should be simple enough to be used by group members who communicate with natural languages. In other words, we have two different worlds with a large gap between them. Fuzzy sets have a long history of solving this problem [27, 28] by playing the role of a bridge between the two worlds by using the concept of linguistic variables. For each linguistic variable, such as near and far in spatial relationships, a membership function can be defined and used when thinking about distances. However, in [29] Mendel uses the falsification theory of Karl's populations to prove that the types are better based on fuzzy-2 types (that are exactly type W)."}, {"heading": "3.3. A conceptual view of context", "text": "Our conceptual view of the context is presented in Figure 2. It consists of simple, raw, sensor-assisted numerical pieces of data on the left and more complex pieces of information on the right. The simple numerical pieces of data in the context can represent well-defined categorical data, such as vehicle type and device type. There is no reasonable uncertainty associated with this type of data. They can also represent quantitative data, which are continuous variables such as network bandwidth, luminous intensity, temperature, etc. They can contain simple uncertainties, due to randomness, measurement errors, etc. However, dealing with this type of uncertainty is quite simple by applying fuzzy logical and probabilistic methods and is already discussed in many sources, including, but not limited to [20, 30-33]. In this section, we will focus on complex parts, which are shown in the right hand side of Figure 2. For a humance-centric context model, for example, we stand with methods of modeling and their contextual information, i.e., we will select the more detailed contextual data based on their reasoning, i.e., three of them."}, {"heading": "3.3.1. The spatial part of context", "text": "The spatial part of the context reflects information about the location of the user or the service. This part of the context is dealt with in the literature with various approaches ranging from quantitative approaches based on the Global Positioning System (GPS) to more complex spatial and spatio-temporal approximations, which are computationally complex and require multiple spatial connections even for the simplest uncertain questions. What we need is a qualitative approach to insecure perceptions by people and actors. Perception of spatial configurations involves identifying topological relationships such as overlaps and touches between regions [34]. In order to give a better understanding of spatial uncertainty for qualitative thinking tasks, we give an example that is also used in our scenario in section 0. As shown in Figure 3, we assume that we have to decide whether a mobile user or service provider located near the \"Eiffel Tower\" lies next to the river or not."}, {"heading": "3.3.2. The temporal part of context", "text": "Everything related to past, present and future situations of a user or service can be modeled by the temporal part of the context. In combination with the spatial context, the resulting spatial and temporal context is useful in many reasoning algorithms about the context. Context reasoning services of this kind are also important for the relationship management layer in LAP, which deals with the long-term past and future of the context. It should be noted that qualitative thinking over time is also uncertain and complex in some cases. The results of temporal thinking by humans are not always formally verifiable. If, for example, you ask a taxi driver to take you to a particular place in the shortest time, there is no formal method to verify the optimality of the chosen path, but he will decide on the basis of hayristics and based on his experience and knowledge of different paths and their traffic and waiting times in different time periods. [However, this type of selection can be verified by the approximation of the spatial logics and metricity]."}, {"heading": "3.3.3. The human part of context", "text": "There are several psychological models for human needs. One of the well-known models is Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which is used in [36] to determine the needs of users in service-oriented informatics. ERG theory [37] is another model that has expanded and simplified Maslow's hierarchy into a shorter series of three types of human needs: existence (physical needs such as thirst and hunger), reliability (our social and friendly needs) and growth (the need to grow, be creative for ourselves and for our environment, and achieve wholeness). Unlike Maslow's model, human needs in ERG theory do not constitute a hierarchy, but rather a continuum in which multiple needs can co-exist. In empirical studies, ERG theory has yielded better results than Maslow's."}, {"heading": "4. A LAYERED DESIGN FOR F-CONTEXT", "text": "Based on the holistic LAP theory and our conceptual context model, this section presents a multi-layered architectural design for f-Context, using the perceptual computer reasoning engine [38] that enables type 2 fuzzy agents to perform complex qualitative reasoning tasks about the context. [16] Assumptions for our design and scope of the problem are as follows: \u2022 A group or community of users with something in common, e.g.: a group of tourists, participants in a mobile auction, or members of a location-based social network [16]. They must use a common word set, e.g. near, far, very wide for contextual perceptions, with possible differences in the definition of boundaries, e.g. blurred membership functions. \u2022 A knowledge base for personal and group rules based on type 2 fuzzy sets. \u2022 Perceptions as words are entered into our system."}, {"heading": "4.1. Meta-rules for our design", "text": "[41] proposes a high-level foundation for the perfect design of human-centered and communication-based software, whose framework does not recommend a specific design, but motivates the designer to ask a series of appropriate design questions that help address the \"complex mix of human needs embodied in a web of physical and social interactions.\" \"The idea is to... design spaces for human communication and interaction to expand those aspects of computer technology that focus on humans, not machines.\" [41] Specifically, we should observe the following meta rules: \u2022 In order to apply the LAP approach to service-based context-aware access to information, we must provide a mapping between human-initiated insecure communication and existing crisp protocols for services [8]. \u2022 We need methods to handle an interactive form of context, rather than the informational form of context [17], so our design should provide support for human-initiated interaction through group communication and the perception of the part of context."}, {"heading": "4.2. The f-Context architecture", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "4.3. Using the f-Context architecture", "text": "As mentioned in Section 0, any input or output of the argumentation process is a word defined by its type 2 fuzzy membership function accepted by the group and stored in a code book. In this section, we present some common sentences for each of the three domains of our conceptual context model in Section 3. We then show how to build a type 2 fuzzy knowledge base to manage the high level of uncertainty of such domains in a context-sensitive application."}, {"heading": "4.3.1. Common vocabularies for contextual domains", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to decide for themselves what they want."}, {"heading": "4.3.2. The CWW knowledge-base in f-Context", "text": "The constructed code books are used by the CWW engine for context-sensitive reasoning tasks. However, the internal mathematics of the interval type 2 fuzzy argument is not discussed here and can be found in [42]. However, we will give an overview to show the strength of the type 2 fuzzy argument to solve some important context problems. Perception logic is performed in two steps: First, the firing interval of each rule is calculated so that one or more rules, depending on the input and FOUs in code books, can fire up to a certain degree. Then, the consequences of the fired rules are combined with a linguistic weighted average (LWA) method so that each rule can affect the end result to a certain extent. To clarify the overall format of the type 2 fuzzy rules that the code books use for arguing, two sample applications for different mobile services are summarized in Table 1."}, {"heading": "4.4. Verification of the design", "text": "In this section we review our design from several aspects and then show how it can be applied in a real scenario. Since the design is based on perceptions and calculation with words, it enables the context to be understood and manageable at a higher and more expressive level. Different ways of handling words are possible, as they result from perceptions. Examples of such perceptions are semantically enriched information about mobility from GPS raw data, perception of spatial and temporal information from messages, events, user interactions, etc. This can be considered a step towards a real interactive context."}, {"heading": "4.4.1. Relationship between context parts", "text": "The integration of CWW and agent orientation in f-Context provides a solid basis for multi-criterion contextual thinking. Examples of such uncertain contextual perceptions, ways of thinking and actions in f-Context are: 1. Perception by Mobility perceptor that mobility _ speed is slow, suggesting that the vehicle context is walkable 2. Perception by Mobility perceptor that mobility _ speed is medium, suggesting that the vehicle context is bike3. Conclusions from a long walk or long cycling (perceived by Mobility preceptor) that some e-needs may have increased in the user, e.g. hunger 4. Spatial search for nearby providers (e.g. restaurants, news feeds, travel agencies) that can meet these needs 5. From entering or approaching a new urban area, conclude that some R-needs may have increased in the user, e.g. when looking for new providers in the vicinity (people who may be a part of a similar service) that may not be needed to fulfill a similar type of service."}, {"heading": "4.4.2. Checking f-Context against the ERG theory", "text": "As can be seen from the architecture, personal agents continuously perceive users \"contextual information and monitor how services are used to meet needs. Continuing important interactional contextual operations will also support decision-making in long-term patterns of contextual use based on the history of contextual information."}, {"heading": "4.4.3. Checking f-Context against LAP", "text": "Based on LAP, type 2 fuzzy sets defined by group members as FOUs can be seen as the realization of a conversation for clarification [7]. Using an example from the patient and health field, he stressed: \"You can never guarantee that everything is absolutely precise. Precision is relative to the implicit expectation of each party that the other party has a sufficiently common background to perform the action satisfactorily.\" In fact, the proposed type 2 fuzzy management context will provide strong support for such a common background between the parties, allowing them to share preferences in an uncertain but formally defined manner."}, {"heading": "4.4.4. Security and privacy of contextual information in f-Context", "text": "The f-context potentially provides multiple security and privacy mechanisms, a vital necessity in today's mobile and service-oriented systems [47, 48]. The agent-based architecture, also proposed in [49], means keeping information out of direct access by other users. Sensitive context information can only be provided after verifying the degree of proximity of the context of the request to the current user, ensuring a reasonable compromise between sharing context information and privacy."}, {"heading": "4.5. Implementation of applications using f-Context", "text": "Our effort in this section was to present the f-context architecture at the conceptual level, without any dependence on a specific implementation platform. However, we propose an example configuration that can be used for implementation. A good candidate for implementing the autonomy layer is JADE Multi-Agent Platform. JADE uses FIPA-ACL compliant messages and is supported by several add-ons, including JADE-LEAP for the lightweight deployment of agents on Java-enabled mobile phones. In JADE, S, T, H agents can be designed by assigning spatial, temporal and other codebook monitoring tasks to cyclical agent behavior. Coordination between agents in the f-context autonomy layer is initiated and directed by the GroupManager agent, who has his own one-shot behavior for creating code books, and cyclical behaviors for coordination tasks."}, {"heading": "5. A REAL-WORLD SCENARIO: THE TOURIST GROUP GUIDE", "text": "In this section, we present a tourist group scenario in detail to show the feasibility of our proposed f-context architecture, in addition to the use of examples already presented in Table 1. Information about POI and the search for location-based services (LBS) are two of the most popular mobile information services for tourists [50] and we will also show the usefulness of f-context for the use of such services by a group. Let's consider a tourist group that is hosted in its group context on specific servers around the world, keeping and improving its standards (actually stored in codebooks)."}, {"heading": "6. RELATED WORK", "text": "In this section we will present some important related works, categorized in several subsections, in addition to those previously referenced in the text. For comparison with our work, we have selected a number of well-known architectures with different theoretical and architectural designs. However, this is not an exhaustive list of all context-sensitive frameworks, and the interested reader is referred to other references. A general definition of the different architectures for the context and the role of communication in the context was initiated by Winograd in. It classifies the architectures for context-based systems, which are based on widget, and blackboard systems. It argues that the general definition of the context of Dey [51] must be more specific, which contains uncertainty."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION", "text": "To make this possible, we presented the idea in a step-by-step approach, as summarized below: 1. We positioned context awareness in a broader holistic view based on LAP theory to make it usable for as many other service-based work as possible; 2. Because LAP focuses on communication and communication contains uncertainties arising from human performance; 3. We defined a conceptual context model that differentiates between clear or simple insecure parts with more complex spatial, temporal and psychological parts used in describing events, conducting communication between members of a group and defining group knowledge; 3. We defined a conceptual context model that distinguishes between clear or insecure parts with more complex spatial, temporal and psychological parts."}], "references": [{"title": "The computer for the 21st century", "author": ["M.

Therefore, their real-world application and extendibility remains limited. In this paper, we present f-Context as a service-based contextawareness framework, based on language-action perspective (LAP) theory for modelling. Then we identify some of the complex, informational parts of context which contain high-order uncertainties due to differences between members of the group in defining them. An agent-based perceptual computer architecture is proposed for implementing f-Context that uses computing with words (CWW) for handling uncertainty. The feasibility of f-Context is analyzed using a realistic scenario involving a group of mobile users. We believe that the proposed approach can open the door to future research on context-awareness by offering a theoretical foundation based on human communication, and a service-based layered architecture which exploits CWW for context-aware, group-based and platform-independent access to information systems.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
