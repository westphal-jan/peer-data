Introduction", "text": "Today, the Arabic language faces many challenges: the first major challenge is the requirement to analyze the Arabic morphology with high quality because it is considered an essential stage in many NLP applications such as information retrieval and machine translation; the second challenge concerns the use of morphology in machine translation systems; Koehn and Hoang (2007) have shown that factorial translation models that contain morphological information lead to better translation performance; the morphological analysis of each word becomes more important when it is translated into or from morphologically rich languages such as Arabic; and the third challenge is that morphological analysis is considered as the first step before syntactical analysis. Arabic is a morphologically complex language; the morphological analysis of each word consists in determining the values of a large number of characteristics, such as basic parts of the speech (i.e., noun, verb, etc.)."}, {"heading": "2.

The most referenced systems are works by Habash et al., Smrz, Buckwalter and Beesley. They are available for research and evaluation and are well documented. In this section we discuss these works to clarify their functioning and approach in Arabic morphological analysis."}, {"heading": "3.1 MAGEAD: A Morphological Analyzer and Generator for Arabic Dialects", "text": "MAGEAD is one of the existing morphological analyzers for the Arabic language available for research. It is a functional morphology system compared to Buckwalter's morphological analyzer, which models form-based morphology (M. Altantawy et al., 2010). To develop MAGEAD, they use a morphological representation for all morphemes and explicitly define morphophone and orthographic rules to derive the allomorphoses. The lexicon is developed by extending the lexicon of Elixir-FM. The advantage of this analyzer is that it uses words from the morphology of the dialects, which they considered a novel work in this area, but unfortunately this analyzer needs a complete dialect lexicon to make the evaluation more interesting and convincing and to verify these claims."}, {"heading": "3.2 ElixirFM: an Arabic Morphological Analyzer by Otakar Smrz", "text": "ElixirFM is a well-documented online morphological analyzer for modern written Arabic developed by Otakar Smrz. This morphological analyzer was written in Haskell, while the interfaces in Perl. ElixirFM are inspired by the methodology of functional morphology (Forsberg and Ranta, 2004) and initially relied on the revised Buckwalter lexicon (Buckwalter, 2002). It contains two main components: a multi-purpose programming library and a linguistic-morphological lexicon (Smrz, 2007). The advantage of this analyzer is that it provides the user with four different operating modes (Resolve, Inflect, Derive and Lookup) for analyzing an Arabic word or text."}, {"heading": "3.3 Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer", "text": "This analyzer is considered one of the most widely used, well documented and available analyzers in literature. It is also used by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) for POS labeling of Arabic texts, Penn Arabic Treebank and Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank (Atwell et al., 2004). It takes the strain as the basic form and strain information. This analyzer contains over 77800 stem entries representing 45,000 lexical elements. However, the number of lexical elements and strains makes the lexicon voluminous, and as a result, the analysis process of an Arabic text becomes long."}, {"heading": "3.4 Xerox Arabic Morphological Analysis and Generation", "text": "Xerox Arabic morphological Analyzer is well known in the literature and is available for evaluation and documentation. This analyzer was designed using the Finite State Technology (FST) (Beesley, 1996 and 2000) and uses the root and pattern approach. It also includes 4930 roots and 400 patterns, effectively generating 90,000 stems. On the one hand, the advantages of this analyzer are the ability to cover a large area, on the other hand, it is based on rules and also provides an English glossary for each word. However, the system fails due to some problems such as over-generation in word derivation, the production of words that do not exist in traditional Arabic dictionaries (Darwish, 2002), and we can consider the scope of the lexicon as another drawback of this analyzer, which could affect the analysis process."}, {"heading": "4. Lexicon", "text": "The first aspect concerns the number of lexicon entries contained in the lexicon. The second aspect concerns the wealth of linguistic information contained in the lexicon entries. We mention that large Arabic morphological analyzers have used the BAMA lexicon. It was used in the creation of Elixir FM. MAGEAD also used it by extending elixir entries. A lot of work has been done to construct an Arabic lexicon with the optimal way."}, {"heading": "4.1 Morphological component class", "text": "It allows the presentation of all the Arabic morphological components, it also allows the collection of a series of morphological components that have the same texture, the same morphological characteristics and the same semantic actions. On the basis of the concept of the scheme \"ealwazn\" / \"\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0441\u0430!,\" this class enables a better optimization and thus a considerable reduction of morphological entries. Figure 1 shows a morphological component class that represents four schemes (\"facala,\" \"facila,\" \"facula\" and faclala \"), which are referred to as original schemes. In this morphological component class they are considered as morphological components."}, {"heading": "4.2 Morphological properties class", "text": "It allows the characterization of the various morphological components represented by the morphological class: A morphological property class contains a set of morphological descriptors or morphological values of traits that would be assigned to different morphological components. We mention, for example, the characteristic \"gender,\" which will distinguish between male and female components; the morphological characteristics are not related to a specific morphological class that makes it necessary to define them outside the morphological classes. Figure 2 shows an example of morphological characteristics that contain two morphological characteristics (person and gender); each morphological characteristic contains a set of descriptors; we have added the attribute \"type\" to highlight the problem of semantics of the morphological descriptors that could be exclusive (the morphological component cannot be characterized by the morphological component, since the morphological descriptors have the same characteristic as in the case of the \"person\" or the \"characteristic\" can be characterized by the \")."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Components property", "text": "A morphological class can use a list of morphological descriptors to define its components. Generally, each morphological component can have its own morphological descriptors. As for the \"gender\" characteristic, some components of this class can be male, while the others can be female. This type of characteristic is called a component characteristic. To put it into practice, we introduced the \"uses\" tag. This means that the various morphological descriptors defined by component characteristics can be used by the various morphological components of the morphological class. Figure 3 shows an example of three component characteristics (gender, number and location): They are used to characterize the two morphological components \"hAvA\" / \"and\" vAlika \"/\" $. \""}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Classes property", "text": "To specify the use of the class property, we introduce the \"is\" tag. Figure 4 shows an example of two class properties (\"Number.NSg\" and \"Gender.GMa\"), which means that all five schemes are singular and have a masculine gender. We mention that the same morphological component class can use both the \"uses\" and \"is\" tags."}, {"heading": "4.2.3 Reference property", "text": "Another strength of the XMODEL language is the introduction of the concept of the reference property, which plays an important role in taking advantage of the specificities of the Arabic morphology. As for the Arabic language, some morphological components may be conjugated forms of other components, which we refer to as original components. An example of these forms are the following components: \"afcalu,\" \"afcilu,\" \"afculu\" (see Figure 6) These components are all conjugated forms of the component \"facala\" (see Figure 5).We have specified the reference between components using the \"ref\" tag. To specify this reference between components, we have used the attribute \"id\" on the original component (see Figure 5).This attribute is specified in the \"Component.\" Components that are conjugated forms use this code as the attribute of this tag (the \"key\") to display this reference (see Figure 6)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Morphological rules class", "text": "First of all, it should be noted that we have developed 455 morphological rules for the Arabic language, which help us to combine some morphological components (morphemes) to create correct language words, using the different morphological component classes as well as the morphological property classes. The morphological rule classes allow us to add new morphological descriptors that do not belong to the union of morphological descriptors of rule components. Consequently, they are considered to be generators of speech words. Implementation of the class of morphological rules allows us to put into practice all possible concatenations between components. Figure 7 shows a morphological rule class called \"Prefixes Suffixes,\" which contains two rules. The two rules allow the generation of words that start with the prefix \"la\" and \"bi.\" Structuring our morphological database using the language XMODEL allows us to generate the Arabic morphological automata."}, {"heading": "5. Our approach", "text": "\"There is a lot of work on Arabic morphological analysis, where many approaches are implemented to satisfy this area of research.\" It provides an overview of the approaches of Arabic morphological analysis, see (Al-Sughaiyer and AlKharashi, 2004).The method presented is based on Arabic morphological automatons (AMAUT).It is considered to be one of the most efficient methods of how AMAUT is responsible for both analyses and generational tasks. An AMAUT accepts a word when it belongs to a correct word in Arabic. Generally, an Arabic morphological automaton is used as < Q, q0, F, D >. Where: Q is a finite series of states of the control unit representing the states of an AMAUT. \u2022 It is a finite input band containing symbols. For an AMAUT, it is constituted of Arabic characters. \u2022 q0 is the initial state of AMAUT."}, {"heading": "6. Application in Arabic Morphological Analysis", "text": "In this section we will operate our approach in Arabic morphological analysis. It is based on the Arabic morphological principle, which is very useful. (AMAUT) method, which was presented in the previous section. (AMAUT technology makes our system usable as a generator as well as an analyzer, unlike some morphological analyzers, which cannot easily be converted into generators (Sforza, 2000; Buckwalter, 2004; Habash, 2004). To develop an Arabic morphological analysis and analysis system, we used a lexiconic word suitable for Arabic language. It groups three packages: morphological components, which include verbs, particles and affixes; the second package includes the morphological rules and the last package covers morphological characteristics."}, {"heading": "7. Evaluation", "text": "First, we mention that a standard commented corpus for the Arabic language is not yet available, so the evaluation process will be difficult. To evaluate the presented approach to morphological analysis, we use a corpus from a standard entry text by ALECSO, who organized a competition in April 2009 of the Arabic Morphological Analyzers in Damascus. In this section, we evaluate Xerox Arabic Morphological Analyzers, the Arabic Morphological Analyzers by Otakar Smrz and our approach. We have chosen Xerox Morphological Analyzers and the Morphological Analyzers by Otakar Smrz because they are one of the best morphological analyzers for MSA and they are available and well documented. On the one hand, the first comment when we compare the three morphological analyzers is the wealth of information given by each."}, {"heading": "8. Discussion", "text": "In order to compare the proposed technique for Arabic morphological analysis with the other existing approaches, the task becomes difficult because, on the one hand, there is no standard to make the comparison. On the other hand, each system has its own goal. Therefore, each approach has some advantages and disadvantages compared to the others. The proposed technique has some advantages compared to the other approaches. These advantages are: \u2022 Our approach can be used both in the analysis and in the generation. \u2022 The use of the morphological automaton approach makes the system efficient and very fast. \u2022 Our new and innovative language (XMODELL), which is used to represent the morphological knowledge, and the use of morphological automats allows to avoid a huge problem of ambiguity in Arabic, which most approaches cannot solve. \u2022 The use of the language XMODELL allows to reduce the number of entries in the lexicon, which are a major problem."}, {"heading": "9. Conclusion", "text": "We have described an approach to Arabic morphological analysis called Arabic Morphological Automaton (AMAUT). We evaluated the presented approach with Xerox Arabic Morphological Analyzer and Arabic Morphological Analyzer by Otakar Smrz because they are considered to be the most frequently referenced approaches to Arabic morphological analysis and are available for research and evaluation. Using the Arabic morphological automaton makes the morphological analyzer efficient and very fast. In terms of developing the lexicon, we have used the XMODEL language to represent, design and implement the lexical resource. Our approach has another advantage because it was developed using Java language and XML technology, which makes the system portable and reusable."}, {"heading": "876, Prague, Czech Republic.", "text": "Otakar Smrz \"(2007),\" ElixirF \"(2007),\" ElixirF \"(2007),\" JEP-TALN 2004, \"Traitement Automatique de l'Arabe, Fez\" (2004), \"Maroc.Appendix\" (2004), \"A.\" (2007), \"A.\" (2007), \"A.\" (2007), \"A.\" (2007), \"A.\" (2007), \"A.\" (2007), \"A.\" (2007), \"A.\" (2007), \"A.\" (2008), \"A.\" (2008), \"A.\" (2008), \"A.\" (2008), \"D.\" (2007), \"A.\" (2008), \"A.\" (2008), \"D.\" (2007), \"A.\" (2007), \"A.\" (2007), \"D.\" (2007), \"(2007),\" A. \"(2007)."}], "references": [{"title": "Arabic morphological analysis techniques: A comprehensive survey", "author": ["I.A.
