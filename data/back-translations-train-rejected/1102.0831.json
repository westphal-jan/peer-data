As the amount of information grows billions of databases, we need to look for the information to find tools commonly known as search engines. Today, there are many search engines, retrieving meaningful information is difficult.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "The Semantic Web is an extension of the current Web [1], which enables the meaning of information to be precisely described in terms of well-defined vocabulary understood by people and computers. In the Semantic Web, information is described using a new W3C standard called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). However, Semantic Web Search is a search engine for the Semantic Web. Current Web sites can be used by people and computers to accurately locate and collect information published on the Semantic Web. Ontology [2] is one of the most important concepts used in the semantic Web infrastructure, and RDF (Resource Description Framework / Scheme) and OWL (Web Ontology Languages) are two W3C-recommended data representation models that are used to represent ontologies. The Semantic Web supports more efficient discovery, automation, integration and reuse of data and provide support for interoperability that cannot be solved with current Web technologies."}, {"heading": "2. BACKGROUND", "text": "Gathering information by searching for information on the web is not a new idea, but presents different challenges compared to general information gathering. Different search engines provide different search results due to the variation in indexing and the search process. Google, Yahoo and Bing are already on the spot where the requests for the processing of keywords are processed. They only search for information provided on the website, recently some research groups started providing results from their semantic search engines, and yet most of them are in their initial stages. Until none of the search engines comes close to indexing the entire web content, let alone the entire Internet. The current web is the largest global database in which there is a semantic structure lacking, and therefore it is difficult for the machine to understand the information provided by the user. If the information has been distributed on the web, we have two types of research problems in the search engine i.e.e.How can a search engine map a query on documents in which information is available, but not available through search engines that are more intelligently distributed and that are more intelligently distributed?"}, {"heading": "2.1 Current Web & Limitations", "text": "The current World Wide Web is the longest global database that lacks a semantic structure, making it difficult for the machine to understand the information provided by the user in the form of search strings. In terms of results, search engines return the ambiguous or partially ambiguous result set; a semantic web is developed to overcome the following problems for the current Web. \u2022 The web content lacks an adequate structure for the presentation of information. \u2022 Ambiguity of information resulting from a poor linkage of information. \u2022 Lack of automatic information transmission. \u2022 Lack of the ability to deal with a huge number of users and content that ensures trust at all levels. \u2022 Inability of machines to provide the information provided due to the lack of a universal format.Hakia [7] is a universal semantic search engine that searches structured text such as Wikipedia. Hakia describes itself as a \"sense-based (search) search engine based on and not on the conceptual meaning of search results.\""}, {"heading": "3. INTELLIGENT SEMANTIC WEB", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Intelligent Search Engines", "text": "Currently, a few smart search engines are designed and implemented for different work environments, and the mechanisms that realize this search engine differ from each other. Fu-Ming Hung and Jenn-Hwa Yang present an intelligent search engine using semantic technologies. This research has solved a combination of descriptive logic and digital library sontology to complete a smart search engine. [10] According to the search engine mechanism, demands and a formula for evaluating the current related technology are solved thereby, promoting the efficiency of the search engine, and formulating the requirements of the wisdom search engine ontology, to integrate the digital library ontology, to proceed with the conclusion of the user requirement, and combining the content search mechanism and knowledge inference to perform the study. Intuition and Shinde [11] discusses agents intelligent intelligent search engines that use intelligent information for the Web minimum system. Most text search engines on the Web use only one web site."}, {"heading": "4. TYPES OF SEMANTIC SEARCH ENGINES", "text": "Semantics is the process of communication important enough to lead to an action. A sequence of symbols can be used to communicate meaning, and that communication can then influence behavior. Semantics has propelled the next generation of the Web as a semantic Web, where the emphasis is on the role of semantics for automated approaches to exploiting Web resources. \"Semantics\" also suggests that the meaning of data on the Web can be discovered not only by humans, but also by computers. Then, the Semantic Web was created to expand the Web and make data readily reusable anywhere. Semantic Web is designed to overcome the following main limitations of the current Web [17]: Web content lacks an adequate structure in terms of the representation of information. Ambiguity of the information resulting from a bad linkage of information. It lacks automatic information transfer. Unable to deal with an enormous number of users and content, the reliance on all levels of information provided by machines due to an inability to understand."}, {"heading": "4.1 Semantic search engines", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have established in the past, and they will be able to play by the rules they have established in the past."}, {"heading": "4.2 Ontology search engines", "text": "Maedche et al. developed an integrated approach for ontology search, reuse and updating [23]. In its architecture, an ontology register is designed so that the metadata is stored via ontologies and ontology servers store the ontologies. Ontologies in distributed ontology servers can be created, replicated and further developed. Ontology metadata in ontology registers can be queried and registered when a new ontology is created. Ontology search in ontology registers is executed under two conditions - query-by-example is intended to restrict search fields and search terms, and query-by-term is intended to restrict the hyponyms of search terms. Georges Gardarin et al. discussed a SEWISE [24] is an ontology-based web information system for supporting web information and retrieving search terms. According to domain ontology web queries, text sequences can be used to automatically generate texttext sequences from various Xtina structures."}, {"heading": "5. SOME COMMON ISSUES", "text": "We have discussed a preliminary overview of the existing and dynamic range of intelligent semantic search engines and methods. Although we have not claimed that this survey is comprehensive, some common problems in current semantic search engines and methods can be derived as follows: a) Low precision and high recall Some intelligent semantic search engines cannot demonstrate their significant performance to improve accuracy and reduce recall. In Ding's Flash semantic search engine, the search engine resource is based on the top 50 results provided by Google, which are not semantic search engines, which could be low precision and high recall [25]. b) Identity intent of the user plays an important role in the intelligent semantic search engine. In chiung-Hon lee, for example, a method has been introduced to analyze terms that correspond to user intentions, so that the service offered will be more suitable for the user's intentions [26] rather than global search engines."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we give a brief overview of the available literature on intelligent semantic search technologies. We review their characteristics. In addition, the questions within the reviewed intelligent semantic search methods and engines are completed on the basis of four different perspectives between the perceptions of designers and users, static knowledge structure, low precision and high recall, and lack of experimental testing. In the future, we will focus on in-depth and more comprehensive research in the field of intelligent semantic search, with the aim of completing the current situation in this field and promoting the further development of intelligent semantic search engine technologies."}], "references": [{"title": "The Semantic Web", "author": ["T.
