Introduction", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it can only take one year to move on to the next round."}, {"heading": "2. Problem Definition", "text": "Searching for information that the user needs in order to find information is fine, but in the case where the user needs certain information, he is able to find information that he cannot find with the help of the provided options, the result will be limited. In addition, it also takes time that the user needs first to read the given search options, then to provide the required information by filling in forms and then performing the search. No doubt about the available search mechanisms of the PDM systems, which are able to search the search results with high probability, but it is time consuming, highly structured and limited. There are some serious problematic problems in the search mechanisms of existing PDM systems that need to be solved."}, {"heading": "3. Related Research Work - Language Technology", "text": "The aim of this research is to introduce and implement a new way of implementing a natural language in order to extract the desired results from the database by modelling the requirements of natural language. The objectives of this research are achieved by selecting and researching the language technology. Language technology is a linguistic field of informatics, also known as Human Language Technology or Natural Language Processing (NLP). Language technology is able to induce the machine to read, understand and analyze human (natural) language. The main objective of language technology is to teach machines how to communicate and help people by listening and speaking."}, {"heading": "3.1. Analyzing English Grammar[5]", "text": "The author has discussed an approach to analyze English grammar. The approach is divided into the following three steps, i.e., the division of grammar, tokenization of sentences with lexicographers, Seven Steps Structuring and Categorization.1. The grammar is divided into two related studies: morphology and syntax. Morphology is to form the words into smaller units called morphemes, for example, the word \"books\" here would have two morphemes (i) the root / stem \"book,\" and (ii) the inflexible morphemes {s} that show numbers. Syntax is to form string words together (partially) phrases, clauses and (fully) sentences. For example, as shown above, the determiner phrase phrase (DP) from the string D + N.2. tokenization of sentences with lexicers is divided into two categories."}, {"heading": "3.2.

Proposed Approach", "text": "Bearing in mind the major challenges of product data management systems discussed above, we can say that right now the PDM community needs a very convincing and strong approach to gain its trust in PDM systems. Furthermore, the PDM community also needs a new approach that can be very helpful in implementing the concepts of product data management in the form of a web-based software application that is able to provide a user-friendly graphical user interface that can also intelligently handle the structured and unstructured natural language requests of the user for fast, optimized and efficient information retrieval or search mechanism targeting of some existing product data management problems. The proposed approach was first conceptually modeled, then implemented in implementation designs and then developed in the form of a prototypical application. The proposed approach consists of four different modules, i.e. the flexible GUI, NLP search, the data manager and the data administrator's ability to manage the results of a structured PDM system, which is mainly a structured system based on the PDM interface."}, {"heading": "5. NLP Search", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "6. Implementation Designs of Proposed Approach", "text": "In order to implement the proposed approach as a prototype (software) application, the benefits from the observed information are used as a result of the research carried out in the field of PDM system development. I have designed a classical animal architecture consisting of three layers, i.e., the representation layer, the business logic and the database, as represented in Figure 8.Presentation layer, is the graphical user interface of the prototype. Business Logic is the information processing module of the prototype, which performs the jobs of transferring the user database and the database through the implementation of a communication system. Third layer is the Database, the main repository of the prototype, proposed to store, secure and manage data. This layer is the back-end database system used to store and manage the product data, as well as the relationships between the data and the data."}, {"heading": "7. NLP Search Prototype", "text": "This is the search module of the developed web application. It can be accessed via search link from the links on the main page. This prototype version is NLP Search, residing in a limited extent, and provides a search mechanism that is able to process natural language user requests in order to extract desired information. The overall task of this module is explained in Table 1 and presented in Figures 11 and 12."}, {"heading": "8. Comparison with CIM and Windchill", "text": "As part of this research and to evaluate the effectiveness of the NLP Search Module, several comparisons were made between the developed prototypes, Windchill and CIM. During the comparison, four types of search instructions in natural language were previously discussed, i.e., Keyword based Instructions, Short Conditional Objective Statements, Simple Conditional Objective Statements and Multiple Conditions Based Objective Statements, compared with the existing search module of the CIM Database."}, {"heading": "8.1. CIM and Prototype Comparison", "text": "In this section, the search module of the CIM database was compared with the search module of the implemented prototype version. During the comparison, four types of search statements in natural language, i.e. keyword-based statements, short conditional objective statements, simple conditional objective statements and several conditional objective statements, were compared with the existing search module of the CIM database."}, {"heading": "8.1.1. Keyword based instruction based comparison", "text": "A search was performed with just one keyword \"PDM,\" with both the search module of the CIM database as shown in Fig. 13 and the prototype as shown in Fig. 14. The result was that both applications ran correctly and the resulting information was presented by both systems, proving that both systems are equally efficient while performing a keyword-based search."}, {"heading": "8.1.2. Short Objective Statement based comparison", "text": "The resulting Figure 15 of the CIM database clearly shows that the CIM database could not find any results even if the result was available, and the CIM database search does not allow the user to enter small alphabets because it is case sensitive. While the resulting Figure 16 of the Prototype NLP Search module presents the results obtained, this comparison clearly shows that the text-based search mechanism of the CIM database cannot compile a short objective statement, while the Prototype NLP Search module has successfully compiled a short objective statement and presented the results."}, {"heading": "8.1.3. Simple Objective Statement based comparison", "text": "A search was carried out with simple objectification, \"I am looking for PDM\" using both the search module of the CIM database as shown in Fig. 17 and the prototype as shown in Fig. 18. The resulting Fig. 17 of the CIM database clearly shows that the CIM database could not find any results even if the result was present, while the resulting module Fig. 18 of the prototype NLP search module presents the results. This comparison clearly proves that the text-based search mechanism of the CIM database cannot compile a simple objective statement, while the Prototype NLP search module has successfully compiled a simple objective statement and presented the results."}, {"heading": "8.1.4. 4. Multiple Conditions based Objective Statement based comparison", "text": "A corresponding search was performed with several conditions objective statement with both the search module of the CIM database as in Fig. 19 and Prototype NLP Search as in Fig. 20. This time the search module of the two applications was compared with the same type of search method (natural language based full text search) as in previous comparisons. Since we have already concluded from previous comparisons that the natural language based full text search module of the CIM database is not able to compile short and simple objective statements to search for the information, it would be unwise to expect CIM database search module to compile natural conditions based on objective states. So this time the provided search forms were used to find some results by filling in options with relevant information (conditional information). As shown in Fig. 19 that there are several different options on the document search form of the CIM database to find out the information about the database CIM."}, {"heading": "8.2. Windchill and Prototype Comparison", "text": "In this section, the Windchill search module was compared with the search module of the implemented prototype version of Prototype NLP Search. Likewise, in comparison of the CIM database with the developed prototype, I compared four types of natural language-based search statements, i.e., keyword-based statements, short conditional objective statements, simple conditional objective statements and several conditional objective statements, with the existing Windchill search module and Prototype NLP Search."}, {"heading": "8.2.1. 1. Keyword based instruction based comparison", "text": "A search was carried out with just one keyword, \"CAD\" both with the Windchill search module as shown in Fig. 22 and Fig. 23, and with prototype NLP Search as shown in Fig. 24. As shown in Fig. 22, when the keyword CAD is entered and searched in the search field of Windchill's main page, a new page \"Advanced Search\" as shown in Fig. 23 appears. The following result, shown in Fig. 23, is obtained when the keyword CAD is searched with the help of the extended search page. Just as shown in Fig. 24, when the keyword CAD is searched with the Prototype NLP Search module, the CAD information is obtained. As a result, both applications were executed precisely and the resulting information was presented by both systems, proving that both systems are equally efficient while performing a keyword-based search."}, {"heading": "8.2.2. Short Objective Statement based comparison", "text": "A search was carried out with short objectification, using both the Windchill search module as in Fig. 25 and the Prototype NLP Search as in Fig. 26. The resulting Fig. 25 of Windchill clearly shows that the Windchill CIM database cannot find any results, even if the result was available. While Fig. 26 of the Prototype NLP Search module presents the results, this comparison clearly proves that the Windchill text-based search mechanism cannot generate a short objective statement, while the Prototype NLP Search module successfully compiles short objective statements and delivers the results."}, {"heading": "8.2.3. Simple Objective Statement based comparison", "text": "Using the Windchill search module as in Fig. 27 and Prototype NLP Search as in Fig. 28, the resulting Fig. 27 of Windchill clearly shows that Windchill again cannot find an output that uses a simple objective statement with both text options, i.e. with all these criteria and with each of these criteria, even if the result exists, while the resulting module Fig. 28 of Prototype NLP Search presents the results. This comparison clearly proves that Windchill's text-based search mechanism cannot compile a simple objective statement, while the Prototype NLP Search module successfully compiles simple objective statements and presents the results."}, {"heading": "8.2.4. Multiple Conditions based Objective Statement based comparison", "text": "A search was carried out with several conditions based on objective statements, using both the Windchill search modules and the prototype NLP Search. Furthermore, once again, I am not comparing both applications with the same type of search methodology as in previous comparisons. As we have concluded from previous comparisons that the Windchill search module is not able to collect short and simple objective statements to search the information, this time I am not comparing the search results with the same type of search methodology as I do. However, I am using search form options to find some results by filling in options with relevant information (conditional information). As shown in Figure 29, there are some options on the advanced search form of Windchill to find out the information. To obtain information based on the search for multiple conditions, it is necessary to first fill in some form-based options of user interest."}, {"heading": "9. Limitations", "text": "We have proposed and written a new grammar for the implementation of natural language processors for PDM systems, but due to the limited scope of this research and development work, the word length of the proposed dictionary for lexers is small and the number of rules designed for parsers is also small. Currently, only seven different token sets are defined for lexers, i.e. digits, numbers, subject, verb, objects, spaces and conditions, and five rules are defined for parser implementation."}, {"heading": "10. Conclusion", "text": "With the help of observations from research in the respective field and using research and development experience, I have proposed an approach. We have designed concepts and implementation concepts of the proposed approach and implemented it using some software tools and technologies of the present, i.e. Flex, Java, Antlr, MySQL, and developed prototype solutions. At the end of the research and development efforts, I can say that the proposed approach can bring some values into the development process of the PDM system. Including the newly proposed idea into the development of the PDM system can set some values in increasing the market value of PDM systems by increasing its acceptance in the industry by improving its use among managers, technicians and office workers."}, {"heading": "11.
