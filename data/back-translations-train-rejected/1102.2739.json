We propose a general framework, which consists of three hierarchical levels (modules). These modules functionally correspond to the V1, V4 and IT areas. Both bottom-up and top-down connections between the hierarchical levels V4 and IT are employed. The higher the degree of matching between the input and the preferred stimulus, the shorter the response time of the neuron. Therefore information about a single stimulus is distributed in time and is transmitted by the waves of spikes. The reciprocal connections and waves of spikes implement predictive coding: an initial hypothesis is generated on the basis of information delivered by the first wave of spikes and is tested with the information carried by the consecutive waves. The development is considered as extraction and accumulation of features in V4 and objects in IT. Once stored a feature can be disposed, if rarely activated. This cause update of feature repository. Consequently, objects in IT are also updated. This illustrates the growing process and dynamical change of topological structures of V4, IT and connections between these areas.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Feb 2011 11:40:08 GMT  (359kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2739v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["sergey s tarasenko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.2739"}, "pdf": {"name": "1102.2739.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A General Framework for Development of the Cortex-like Visual Object Recognition System: Waves of Spikes, Predictive Coding and Universal Dictionary of Features", "authors": ["Sergey S.

FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE SYSTEM", "text": "This framework consists of three processing levels (modules), which correspond to the V1, V4, and IT areas of the VVS. The V4 level also has an integrating layer. Each layer is a single neural network. The schematic representation of the entire system, including the connections between the layers (cortical areas) and layers (networks within the cortical areas), is shown in Fig. 1. The V1 level contains four different groups of neurons (filter cards), which are mutually connected with inhibitory connections (round-head lines) and layers (networks within the cortical areas)."}, {"heading": "A. Processing in the V1 area", "text": "In this study we use gabor filters as described by eq. (1) to model simple cells of group V1: F (x, y) = exp (\u2212 (x 2 o + \u03b32y2o) 2\u03c32) \u00b7 cos (2\u03c0 \u03bb xo) xo = x cos \u03b8 + y sin \u03b8 yo = \u2212 x sin \u03b8 + y cos \u03b8 (1), where \u03b8 is an orientation parameter, \u03c3 is a scale parameter and \u03bb a wavelength parameter. Equations for the gabor filter in our study are taken from [11]. We use a single value for the scale parameter: \u03c3 = 2.8, which corresponds to 7 x 7 pixels RFs. The relationship between scale and wavelength parameters is represented in [10] (p. 69). The input (retina image) is processed with gabor filters of the four different orientations (0 \u0445, 45 \u04457 \u04457 pixels RFs)."}, {"heading": "B. Processing in the V4 area", "text": "This year, the time has come for such a process to take place in the first half of the year, in which such a process takes place."}, {"heading": "C. Waves of Spikes: Information Transfer from the V4 area to the IT area", "text": "The neurons whose preferred stimulus is closer to the actual visual input fire faster [18]. Therefore, the neurons with an activated unit (the response is 1 on the normalized scale) fire first. Then, the neurons fire with an activation greater or equal to 1- (= 0.1), without previously fired neurons, etc. Thus, the neurons with the same activation stage form \"spikes waves.\" Consequently, the original retinal image unfolds over a period of time. Thus, the information about the stimulus is carried by the sequence of spikes waves. To extract the first wave of spikes, we eliminate from the feature map the features that led to neural activation levels less than 1 on the normalized scale. The resulting map is referred to as the First Wave Feature Map (fig. 6). This map consists only of features that correspond identically to the visual stimuli in the first wave."}, {"heading": "D. Processing in the IT area", "text": "Some of the inferior temporal cortex neurons can be considered as RBF units. [12] The IT area is also addressed as the location of various objects and it is suggested to have a function of object recognition and classification [15]. The objects in the IT area are obtained through everyday visual experience. However, the activity of the gSOM network is similar to the structure of the IT network [15]. To model this change, we have used gSOM to simulate the development activity of the IT area. The type II neurons are ITRBF neurons. \u2212 The ITgSOM neurons store the objects themselves, while ITRBF neurons perform a matching between the object stored by the corresponding ITgSOM network."}, {"heading": "E. Predictive Coding: Interaction between V4 and IT", "text": "There are two stages: First, based on some preliminary data about the stimulus, the initial hypothesis is generated. Then, additional information about the stimulus is used to either confirm the initial hypothesis or reject the initial hypothesis through the process of iterative refinement. So, the formation of the initial hypothesis and its iterative refinement are two key points of the predictive coding.Selection of the initial hypothesis is based on the information that is stored by the first wave of spikes and the iterative refinement. In this study, the system stores 10 identical objects in IT (Fig. 2).The steps of the initial mortgage generation are the following: 1) the response elements i of the ITRBF (i), i = 1, K, K, K, K is a total number of objects that are stored, neurons are calculated; 2) maximum activation values for each type of ITRF (identified)."}, {"heading": "III. DEVELOPMENT: COLLECTING NEW FEATURES AND STORING NEW OBJECTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Towards universal dictionary of features", "text": "The development is characterized by the dynamic change in the topology of the intra- and inter-level connection. This change involves not only the extraction of new characteristics through growth, but also the disposal of existing, rarely used characteristics. In this section we will discuss a mechanism of disposal of existing characteristics. The characteristics are extracted on the basis of distance. On the other hand, during the processing of a certain stimulus some characteristics can be found more frequently than the others.In order to distinguish frequently used characteristics, the counting variable \u03c4 is used. Each time, characteristic i is the best matching characteristic, the counting value \u03c4i is calculated by 1. Then, the relative frequency fri of activation for each characteristic is calculated: fri = \u03c4i F \u0445 i = 1 \u03c4i, (8) where i is a number of characteristics, i = 1,..., F and F is a total number of characteristics [5]. Finally, we dispose the characteristics that exhibit a relative frequency of characteristics, which show less random or equal to the remaining 1 / 1 of living characteristics, which are represented as the remaining characteristics."}, {"heading": "B. Dynamic structure of the inter-level connections between the V4 and IT areas", "text": "The development process implies two major changes: 1) the growth of the number of features (in V4) and the objects (in IT) together; and 2) the emergence of new connections between the new neurons and the existing ones. Right from the start, the networks in the V4 and IT levels of the system are empty. During development, these networks grow, causing the installation of new intra- and inter-level connections; the new features are extracted and disposed of in V4. In the IT module, the new object is added when the maX value is below the threshold \u03b1 according to predictive encoding. If an accelerated effect occurs, the predictive encoding is stopped immediately. Therefore, the emergence of both intra- and inter-level connections in our system includes both the V4 and IT areas. The process of feature availability takes place after the information about the feature map is sent through the waves of spikes into the IT area."}, {"heading": "IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "text": "We have a framework for the development of Cortex-like visual object recognition system. This system is based on the neurophysiological principles of information processing along the VVS. These are hierarchical organization of the visual object recognition system, propagation of waves of peaks, reciprocal interaction of different hierarchical levels, predictable coding and dynamic structure of the visual feature repository. Our model also inherits important features of the RBF units as a model of a single neuron in V4 [8] and IT [12].The novelty of our model is the application of growing SOMs to model the processes of feature and object extraction and storage in the areas V4 and IT. We have also implemented the processes of feature extraction and feature disposal. The interaction of these processes allows to simulate dynamic changes in the structure of the system to model the processes of feature and object extraction."}, {"heading": "V.
