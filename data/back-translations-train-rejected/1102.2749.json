The GLOH feature descriptor, one of the state-of-the-art feature descriptor, is used to capture the age-related local and spatial information of face image. As the exacted GLOH features are often redundant, MTL is designed to select the most informative feature bins for age estimation problem, while the corresponding weights are determined by ridge regression. This approach largely reduces the dimensions of feature, which can not only improve performance but also decrease the computational burden. Experiments on the public available FG-NET database show that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance over previous approaches while using much fewer features.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Feb 2011 12:12:56 GMT  (68kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2749v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 6 May 2011 17:19:24 GMT  (116kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2749v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["yixiong liang", "lingbo liu", "ying xu", "yao xiang", "beiji zou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.2749"}, "pdf": {"name": "1102.2749.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "MULTI-TASK GLOH FEATURE SELECTION FOR HUMAN AGE ESTIMATION", "authors": ["Yixiong Liang", "Lingbo Liu", "Ying Xu", "Yao Xiang", "Beiji Zou"], "emails": ["bjzou}@mail.csu.edu.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Index Terms - Age Assessment, GLOH Feature, Multitask Learning, Burr Regression"}, {"heading": "1.

GLOH REPRESENTATION", "text": "The local GLOH descriptor, originally introduced by Mikolajczyk et al.

Simi-ar Xiv: 110 2.27 49v2 [cs.CV] 6 May 201 1lar to the SIFT descriptor, or HOG descriptor, is also based on the evaluation of well-normalized local histograms of image progression orientations in a dense grid. Specifically, the original GLOH descriptor can be achieved by calculating the SIFT or HOG descriptor for a log-polar position grid with three radii and eight angles. Gradient orientations are then quantified into 16 parts, and the resulting descriptor gives a 272-bins histogram that splits the GLOH intersection."}, {"heading": "3.

During the GLOH feature extraction step, the size of the image patch is set to 10 \u00d7 10. For each image patch, we use 3 radius {2, 3} and the 8 gradient directions used in each image patch, so that the dimension of the resulting histogram vector is 136. By concatenating all patches histogram vector, we obtain a 48,960-dimensional original GLOH feature vector. It contains both the local texture and the space information of the face image.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a novel framework for age assessment based on the GLOH feature and the MTL. By using the GLOH feature to visualize the face image and by multi-task learning to select features, we can select some informative feature bins for age assessment.

(GLOH) descriptor and multi-task learning (MTL). The GLOH, one of the state-of-the-art local descriptor, is used to capture the agerelated local and spatial information of face image. As the extracted GLOH features are often redundant, MTL is designed to select the most informative GLOH bins for age estimation problem, while the corresponding weights are determined by ridge regression. This approach largely reduces the dimensions of feature, which can not only improve performance but also decrease the computational burden. Experiments on the public available FG-NET database show that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance over previous approaches while using much fewer features.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
