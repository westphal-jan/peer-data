We look at four levels of random occurrences (from less to more constraints): 1. RANDOC words were randomly permutated within each sentence. Two indentations are linked when the corresponding words in the permutated text are next to each other. Sentence boundaries were respected. That is, the length of the original sentences was kept constant. RANSEN Words were randomly permutated within each sentence. Two indentations are linked when the corresponding words in the permutated text are next to each other. 3. PLAIN Two indentations are linked when the corresponding words in the original text are adjacent. We assume that the corresponding words are adjacent. We assume that two indentations are linked when the corresponding indentations form a highly associative bigram."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Degree Distribution", "text": "The degree distributions for all four networks ENG-COLL, ENG, ENG-RANSEN and ENG-RANDOC are shown in Figure 2 = 2.0. It is worth noting that all numbers are based on a 10 log-log scale. All four distributions exhibit characteristics of a power law. The tails of the corresponding cumulative degree7891011distributions are shown in Figure 4 and provided with lines. The current law coefficient is equipped with the method of maximum probability recommended in [18]. The coefficients thus obtained from the diagrams are shown in Figure ENG \u2212 COLL = 2.0, gge ENG \u2212 ENG \u2212 ST \u2212 ST \u2212 STANSEN = 2.1 and \u03b3ANG \u2212 ST \u2212 STANSEN = 2.0. These values are all very similar and are also close to the values obtained for co-occurrence and frequent bigRFREMRs (for both Spanish, Chinese and French grades)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Link density", "text": "As expected, the more random constraints there are, the lower the density of the linkages. Formally, we have a perfect negative rank correlation between the mean degree of vertices and the level of constraints for all networks of the same language and the same type of vertex. Formally, we have that the mean degree k is the same for the same language and the same type of vertex, the probability that the expected order is generated randomly, at 1 / 4! 0.041! Thus, the perfect correlation between the level of constraints is statistically significant at a level of significance of 05.Since the number of network vertices is the same for all networks of the same language (corpus), this perfect negative correlation is also the same at a level of significance of 05.Since the number of vertices of the network is the same, the number of vertices of the same network (corpus) and the same type of vertices is the same."}, {"heading": "4.3 Small-worldness", "text": "The average shortest path is the average of all such distances. The diameter of a network is the number of connections on the shortest path between the most distant node pairs. The diameter and average shortest path for all networks are shown in Table 8 and Table??. The diameters of all four networks are small, as shown in Table 8. These networks are small worlds. Surprisingly, the diameters for RANSEN and RANDOC are smaller than those for ENG. This can be attributed to the randomization that creates connections between words that are not otherwise connected in ENG. This results in a network that is even faster to navigate. The mean shortest vertex vertex distance, d'obeyed, 1. d > d'STEMMED for all languages and constraints."}, {"heading": "4.4 Clustering", "text": "We examined two cluster coefficients for all networks. Local clustering is defined as the mean value of clustering in the vertex, C = 1n n n \u2211 i = 1 Ci, (5) where Ci is clustering in the i-vertex and n is the number of vertices in the network. Ci is the proportion of pairs of adjacent vertices connected to each other at the vertex i. The global cluster coefficient is based on triplets of nodes. A triplet can be either open or closed. In an open triplet, the three nodes are connected by two edges, with three edges as in a closed triplet. The global cluster coefficient is calculated from the ratio between the number of closed triplets and the total number of triplets. Both local and global cluster coefficients ignore the loops and the isolated vertices. Consider the networks as undirected. The local and global cluster coefficients for all networks are represented in tables of 10 and 11 respectively."}, {"heading": "4.5 Degree correlations", "text": "In other words, the higher the degree of a vertex, the higher the degree of its neighbors. Figures 13,14,15,16,17,18 and 19 show the correlation between the degree of a vertex k and the normalized mean degree of the closest neighbors of vertexes k. We note that the normalized mean degree of the closest neighbors of vertexes k. (Figures 13,14,15,16,17,18 and 19 show the correlation between the degree of a vertex k and the normalized mean degree of the closest neighbors of vertexes k. We note that the normalized mean degree of the closest neighbors of vertexes k. (Figures) shrinks as k grows for all networks (deviations with large degrees tend to connect to vertexes with low degrees).

To investigate the relationship between the vertex frequency and degree, we use linear regression after excluding some outliers with frequency > 105. The result of linear regression for the real network shows a strong correlation between degree and frequency. The slope is 2.86, the p-value is less than 2% 10 \u2212 16, R2 is 0.89. Furthermore, we have averaged the degree of words of a certain frequency and then create a graph for all frequency ranges (Fig. 20, Fig. 21, Fig. 22, Fig. 23, Fig. 4, the frequency of the words we notice most frequently)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We investigated the topological properties of linguistic networks at different levels of linguistic constraints. We found that the networks that emerge from randomly generated data have small worlds and scale-free characteristics. One possible explanation would be that degree distributions are functions of word frequencies. However, human language is a very complex \"system,\" and there is no easy way to explain this observation. We also found that the degree distribution of a co-event diagram changes under randomization. Furthermore, network statistics such as diameter and cluster coefficient also seem to depend on the degree distributions of the underlying network.1920212223242526272829"}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors thank Ramon Ferrer i Cancho for his valuable comments and contributions."}], "references": [{"title": "Topology of evolving networks: local events and universality", "author": ["Reka Albert", "Albert L.
