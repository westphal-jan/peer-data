Finally, for the first individual type we will also use a shorter alias e = \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 e1. To ensure better visibility and compactness, we combine the complete syntax of Tyn from the syntax of Ty2 of (Gallin, 1975) and Q0 of (Andrew, 1986) and expand it as follows. Derived types (i) If alpha and \u03b2 types are types, then (\u03b1\u03b2) or simply a functional type of Tyn interpreted as a function type of alpha to \u03b2 \u03b2. Parenthesis is necessarily only in complex types to express association elements other than from right to left, for example: Alpha Alpha types and \u03b2 types are types of Alpha types of Alpha types (\u03b2), which are equivalent to (\u03b2) types of Alpha types (\u03b2)."}, {"heading": "3 Logically closed languages", "text": "The two basic formalizations of the concept of language that we deal with in this work - \u03b2 \u03b2-\u03b2 and logically closed \u03b1-language have been introduced and informally discussed (Gluzberg, 2009). We reproduce the formal definitions here with current notations for more convenient reference terms. Definition 3.1. Let A be a finite alphabet {a1, a2,... aN}, let A-word denote the set of all words above this alphabet and let T\u03b1 denote the set of all alpha terms of Tyn. An alpha language is a relation L-language is a relation L-A-language. References to words above the alphabet A as \"expressions\" and alpha terms as \"language.\" It can be said that an alpha language is a set of pairs of expressions and their alpha meanings. A number of words L-A-language can then be considered a language for the unit type of meaning."}, {"heading": "6 Lexicons and canonic representation", "text": "Definition 6.1 is a logically closed definition 6.2.
