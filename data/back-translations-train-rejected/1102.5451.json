In that paper we have also studied reductions by means of those solutions which are fuzzy equivalences. In this paper we will see that in some cases better reductions can be obtained using the solutions of this system that are fuzzy quasi-orders. Generally, fuzzy quasi-orders and fuzzy equivalences are equally good in the state reduction, but we show that right and left invariant fuzzy quasi-orders give better reductions than right and left invariant fuzzy equivalences. We also show that alternate reductions by means of fuzzy quasi-orders give better results than alternate reductions by means of fuzzy equivalences. Furthermore we study a more general type of fuzzy quasi-orders, weakly right and left invariant ones, and we show that they are closely related to determinization of fuzzy recognizers. We also demonstrate some applications of weakly left invariant fuzzy quasi-orders in conflict analysis of fuzzy discrete event systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Feb 2011 21:37:24 GMT  (51kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5451v1", "42 pages, submitted to Information Sciences"]], "COMMENTS": "42 pages, submitted to Information Sciences", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.FL cs.AI", "authors": ["aleksandar stamenkovi\\'c", "miroslav \\'ciri\\'c", "jelena ignjatovi\\'c"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.5451"}, "pdf": {"name": "1102.5451.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Aleksandar Stamenkovi\u0107", "Miroslav \u0106iri\u0107", "Jelena Ignjatovi\u0107"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 110 2.54 51v1 [cs.FL] 2 6Fe b20 11In our most recent paper, we have established close relationships between the state reduction of a fuzzy recognizer and the resolution of a particular system of fuzzy relations equations.

Introduction", "text": "Unlike deterministic finite automata (DFA), whose efficient minimization is possible, the state minimization problem for non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) is a relatively simple (PSPACE-complete, [41, 77]) and well-known procedure as in [16, 42, 55, 56, 76] not applicable in practice. Therefore, many researchers have turned their attention to NFA state reduction methods, which do not necessarily provide a minimum, but they indicate \"reasonably\" that can be efficiently constructed. The basic idea of reducing the number of NFA states by calculating and merging indistinguishable states is similar to the minimization algorithm for DFAs, but is more complicated, which led to the concept of legal equivalence on an NFA, which was investigated by Ilie and Yu, who showed that they can be used to construct NFA smalls."}, {"heading": "2.

Such systems have significant applications in many areas of computer science and technology, such as simultaneous and distributed software systems, computer and communication networks, manufacturing, transportation, and traffic control systems, etc. Usually, a discrete event system is modeled by a finite state automation (deterministic or non-deterministic), with events modeled by input letters, and the behavior of a discrete event system is described by the language generated by automation."}, {"heading": "9.

In that paper we have also studied reductions by means of those solutions which are fuzzy equivalences. In this paper we will see that in some cases better reductions can be obtained using the solutions of this system that are fuzzy quasiorders. Generally, fuzzy quasi-orders and fuzzy equivalences are equally good in the state reduction, but we show that right and left invariant fuzzy quasi-orders give better reductions than right and left invariant fuzzy equivalences. We also show that alternate reductions by means of fuzzy quasi-orders give better results than alternate reductions by means of fuzzy equivalences. Furthermore we study a more general type of fuzzy quasi-orders, weakly right and left invariant ones, and we show that they are closely related to determinization of fuzzy recognizers. We also demonstrate some applications of weakly left invariant fuzzy quasi-orders in conflict analysis of fuzzy discrete event systems.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
