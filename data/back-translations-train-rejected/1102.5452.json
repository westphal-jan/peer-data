Here we use the conjunction of these two concepts as a powerful tool in the study of equivalence between fuzzy automata. We prove that a uniform fuzzy relation between fuzzy automata $\\cal A$ and $\\cal B$ is a forward bisimulation if and only if its kernel and co-kernel are forward bisimulation fuzzy equivalences on $\\cal A$ and $\\cal B$ and there is a special isomorphism between factor fuzzy automata with respect to these fuzzy equivalences. As a consequence we get that fuzzy automata $\\cal A$ and $\\cal B$ are UFB-equivalent, i.e., there is a uniform forward bisimulation between them, if and only if there is a special isomorphism between the factor fuzzy automata of $\\cal A$ and $\\cal B$ with respect to their greatest forward bisimulation fuzzy equivalences. This result reduces the problem of testing UFB-equivalence to the problem of testing isomorphism of fuzzy automata, which is closely related to the well-known graph isomorphism problem. We prove some similar results for backward-forward bisimulations, and we point to fundamental differences. Because of the duality with the studied concepts, backward and forward-backward bisimulations are not considered separately. Finally, we give a comprehensive overview of various concepts on deterministic, nondeterministic, fuzzy, and weighted automata, which are related to bisimulations.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Feb 2011 21:37:51 GMT  (52kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5452v1", "38 pages, submitted to Fuzzy Sets and Systems"], ["v2", "Thu, 5 May 2011 20:11:04 GMT  (54kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5452v2", "41 pages, submitted to a journal"]], "COMMENTS": "38 pages, submitted to Fuzzy Sets and Systems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.FL cs.AI", "authors": ["miroslav \\'ciri\\'c", "jelena ignjatovi\\'c", "nada damljanovi\\'c", "milan ba\\v{s}i\\'c"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.5452"}, "pdf": {"name": "1102.5452.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Bisimulations for fuzzy automata", "authors": ["Miroslav \u0106iri\u0107", "Jelena Ignjatovi\u0107", "Nada Damljanovi\u0107", "Milan Ba\u0161i\u0107"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In many areas of computer science, the equivalence of these two concepts is used as a powerful tool in the study of equivalence between fuzzy automata.

Introduction", "text": "The study of fuzzy automatons and languages was initiated in the 1960s by Santos [95-97], Wee [103], Wee and Fu [104], and Lee and Zadeh [58]. From the late 1960s to the early 2000s, mostly fuzzy automatons and languages with belonging values in the Go-del structure were studied (see for example [25, 33, 74]). The idea of investigating fuzzy automatons with belonging values in some structured abstract categories comes back to W. Wechler [102], and in recent years, researchers have focused mainly on fuzzy automatons with belonging values in fully residued languages, lattices, and other types of lattices. Fuzzy automatons were first investigated by D.W. Qiu in [83, 84] where some basic concepts were discussed, and later D. W. Qiu and his collaborators have conducted extensive research on these fuzzy automatons."}, {"heading": "2.

equivalence between various systems, and to reduce the number of states of these systems, whereas uniform fuzzy relations have recently been introduced as a means to model the fuzzy equivalence between elements of two possible different sets. Here we use the conjunction of these two concepts as a powerful tool in the study of equivalence between fuzzy automata. We prove that a uniform fuzzy relation between fuzzy automata A and B is a forward bisimulation if and only if its kernel and co-kernel are forward bisimulation fuzzy equivalence relations on A and B and there is a special isomorphism between factor fuzzy automata with respect to these fuzzy equivalence relations. As a consequence we get that fuzzy automata A and B are UFB-equivalent, i.e., there is a uniform forward bisimulation between them, if and only if there is a special isomorphism between the factor fuzzy automata ofA and Bwith respect to their greatest forward bisimulation fuzzy equivalence relations. This result reduces the problemof testingUFB-equivalence to the problemof testing isomorphism of fuzzy automata, which is closely related to the well-known graph isomorphism problem. We prove some similar results for backward-forward bisimulations, and we point to fundamental differences. Because of the duality with the studied concepts, backward and forward-backward bisimulations are not considered separately. Finally, we give a comprehensive overview of various concepts on deterministic, nondeterministic, fuzzy, and weighted automata, which are related to bisimulations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
