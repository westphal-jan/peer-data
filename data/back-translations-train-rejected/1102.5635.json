In such applications, we find a combination of quantity decisions, such as the amount of goods shipped (inventory management), and routing decisions, such as those tackled in the field of vehicle routing. Obviously, the two areas overlap considerably, making it difficult to solve such problems. In this context, intensive research has recently been conducted, often referred to as inventory routing problems [2, 3] (IRP). Several variants of the IRP can be found, ranging from deterministic demand differentials to stochastic modeling. From a practical point of view, the reality for companies is much more complex than a known demand and much more uncertain than a stochastic law. In fact, companies often have partial knowledge of demand over the planning horizon. Our observation of this phenomenon can be transformed into a new type of data that we propose for further experimental studies."}, {"heading": "2 Problem definition", "text": "Since our problem is somewhat similar to [1], we keep some of their notations in common. We consider a distribution network (usually a complete graph or a distance matrix) in which a single product is shipped from a depot (designated with 0) of unlimited capacity to a specified clientele C = {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, n} over a time-limited horizon H of p periods. Customers are served by a homogeneous fleet of trucks of capacity K (the number of trucks that can be used at any time is unlimited). Alternatively, a single truck can be used. Corresponding author: marc.sevaux @ univ-ubs.frto performs several tours within the same period. Each customer i has a maximum capacity Ui and an initial inventory level Ii0. The goal is to minimize two cost functions, namely the total route cost (the sum of route costs in each period) and the total inventory cost (the sum of each customer's inventory period)."}, {"heading": "3 Proposed methodology", "text": "Since this work is carried out in order to be applied in practice, we have decided to develop various strategies that can be understood and applied by companies in everyday life. Of course, the order-to-level policy is available as an option, as is the day-to-day policy. In between, there are many strategies. To make it simple, we intend to use a frequency policy that serves a customer for several consecutive periods of time. Each customer will have its own frequency of delivery. Therefore, we will have to look for the best frequency vector that proposes non-dominated solutions to our two objectives. Initial route planning will be determined by storing heuristics and the latter will be improved by using the record-to-record travel algorithm [5]."}, {"heading": "4 Preliminary results", "text": "The final goal of this work is to be able to solve instances of up to 250 customers over a long-term horizon (240 time periods). Instances were generated on the basis of geographical data from [4] and with three types of demand development (constant, rising and sinusoidal). Files are available on Web1 and the file format is described in [6]. Figure 1 presents typical results of frequency policy. The black dot at the top left is the daily delivery policy, which significantly minimizes inventory costs but has an important route price. Black dot at the bottom right represents the other alternative that applies the current policy. A large cloud of small crosses in the middle results from a completely random frequency strategy. The black dot represents the solutions when all customers are served with the same frequency. To fill the gaps, a controlled random frequency (but between two consecutive frequency values) is used and leads to the results that can be improved by logistic circles."}, {"heading": "5 Future work", "text": "The perspectives of our work now follow several directions. Firstly, we are now improving our routing solver to avoid the use of external software and creating more complex and embedded delivery strategies. Using the visual tool, we have already identified some side effects that we could improve in our future research. One possible approach could be to change the synchronization of customers at the beginning of delivery or to group customers by geographic location."}], "references": [{"title": "A hybrid heuristic for an inventory-routing problem", "author": ["C.

In fact, companies often have a partial knowledge of the demand over the planning horizon. Our observation of this phenomenon can be transformed in a new type of data, which we propose for further experimental investigations. We here assume that demand of the current period is known at the beginning of the period. Besides, we have an approximate overview of the demand over the 5 next periods, the 20 next periods and the 60 next periods. This overview is rather good (e.g. it does not differ from reality by more that \u00b110%) but of course, we cannot predict with certainty what will happen the next periods. The global objective of this work is to provide practical optimization methods to companies involved in inventory routing problems, taking into account this new type of data. Also, companies are sometimes not able to deal with changing plans every period and would like to adopt regular structures for serving customers. As our work is a long term project, we are gradually going to develop our solution approach. In a first phase, we will focus on the Inventory Routing problem with a single product, deterministic known demand over a finite horizon. Contrary to [1], we assume that the routing costs and the inventory costs are not comparable and therefore should be handled as two different objectives. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a bi-objective approach is considered for this problem.", "creator": "gnuplot 4.2 patchlevel 6 "}}}
