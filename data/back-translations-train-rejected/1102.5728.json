Likewise, a word preceded by the string \"footballer\" induces that this is the name of a footballer. NE recognition may be viewed as a classification method, where every word is assigned to a NE class, regarding the context. The aim of this study is then to identify and classify the contexts that are most relevant to recognize a NE, those which are frequently found with the NE.

Introduction", "text": "Named Entity Recognition is complex in various areas of automatic natural language processing (NLP), document indexing, document annotation, translation, etc. [2]. It is a fundamental step in various tasks of information extraction (IE). It has been an essential task in several research teams such as the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC), the Conferences on Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), etc. Named Entities (NE) are formulations that contain names of people, places, etc. They are particularly important for access to document content as they form the building blocks upon which the analysis of documents is based. In this essay, the application of the learning approach to the problem of NE detection is discussed. The aim is to uncover contextual NE in a body of documents. A context considers words that surround the NE in the sentence in which they appear, it is a sequence of the left of the E or the right of the words."}, {"heading": "2.

Conclusion", "text": "This paper proposes the application of the learning approach to the problem of NE recognition. The aim is to uncover in a document corpus NE contexts that are often associated with contexts: sequences of words that lie to the left or right of the NE. Contexts that occur with given examples of learning were initially extracted from the corpus of web documents. To classify the contexts, various criteria for characteristic weighting were examined in order to identify the most appropriate contexts for the recognition of a NE. This classification makes it possible to derive a model for the recognition of a NE. The same strategy can be applied to personal names, company names and many other types of named entities in each language. Although we should mention that we have successfully applied this technique to several name identity types, in French and in English. One of the future works we recommend is to try to identify similarities between contexts and to measure the additional contexts we may have applied to this problem."}], "references": [{"title": "Unsupervised models for named entity classification", "author": ["M.
