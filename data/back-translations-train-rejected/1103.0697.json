Such work fits into the layers of XML to ontology in Figure 1. It may be useful to think of this as \"data semantics,\" or \"semantics1.\" In the diagram there are boxes called Rule, Unifying Logic and Trust, User Interface and Applications in Figure 1. This paper describes a way to meet some of the requirements, using an online system that combines Semantics1 with two other types of meaning."}, {"heading": "A Semantic Resolution Example", "text": "The paper (Peng et al 2002) describes an example of name resolution for e-commerce using three namespaces: retailer, manufacturer and shared. In the example, a retailer orders computers from a manufacturer. However, in the terminology of the retailer, a computer is referred to as PC for Gamers, while in the terminology of the manufacturer it is referred to as Prof Desktop.3The rule states that if the two premises above the line are true, the conclusion also applies. As a rule, \"some-item1,\" \"that-class,\" etc. are placeholders or variables filled with actual values, e.g. \"PC for Gamers\" and \"Computer,\" when the rule is executed. Apart from the placeholders, the remaining words are usually in open vocabulary, open syntax, English. Thus, the rule defines the meaning of the last sentence in relation to the meaning of the first two. To avoid infinite regression, this process sticks to the headings of the 2006 resolutions, where the number of headings can be selected in the table of the headings and the number of the headings in the table."}, {"heading": "An RDF Query Example", "text": "4On the other hand, if we ask if Adrian Walker is the author of the essay, we get a \"no\" answer, and one step in the explanation is similar to Figure 4, except that the last two premises are marked as \"missing\" and the conclusion is marked as \"not shown.\" An explanation always starts with the general justification of an answer and includes hyperlinks, so you can go into more detail if necessary. In particular, we could write additional rules so that a more technical, RDF-based explanation step is preceded by something that is more readable to the end user.

Although we include some rules from the oil industry in the system, we do not want the user to ask for bioinformatics. The current system leads a user by showing generalized versions of the sentences used when writing the rules for a particular task. At the top of the menu, the system displays a group of sentences that are not used as a premise in any rules, which correspond to generalizations of the most important questions the application can answer. Furthermore, the system displays sentences that are used as a premise for the top group, and so on. A user can select a sentence directly from the menu."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "There is an online system - a kind of wiki for rules in open vocabulary, executable English. When the rules are executed, the system can explain its results (and also why expected results are missing) in hypertext-based English at the business or scientific level. It can also automatically generate and execute SQL via networked databases. SQL generated can be too complex to write reliably by hand, but its results can also be explained in English. The system's author and user interface is simply a browser, and sharing the system is free. As the rules are in English, they are indexed by Google and other search engines. This is useful when looking for rules for a task you have in mind. 9 The approach used in the system has the potential to address some of the rules, logic, proof and trust requirements outlined in the upper levels of the semantic layer pie."}], "references": [{"title": "Towards a theory of declarative knowledge", "author": ["Krzysztof R.

The system accepts rules, and small numbers of facts, typed or copy-pasted directly into a browser. One can then run the rules, again using a browser. For larger amounts of data, the system uses information in the rules to automatically generate and run SQL over networked databases. From a few highly declarative rules, the system typically generates SQL that would be too complicated to write reliably by hand.
