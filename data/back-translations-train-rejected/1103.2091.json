INTRODUCTION", "text": "In recent years, there has been considerable interest in researching and exploiting the potential of biological systems for applications in computer science and engineering. These systems are inspired by various aspects of the immune system of mammals. Artificial immune systems mimic the natural immune system, which has sophisticated methods and capabilities to develop computer-aided algorithms that efficiently solve technical problems [2]. The main goal of the human immune system is to protect the internal components of the human body by fighting foreign bodies such as fungi, viruses and bacteria [1]. In addition, natural immune system research suggests the existence of learning characteristics that can be used to advantage in machine learning systems [5]. Similarly, if there is an environment divided into subenvironments, then each subenvironment is traversed by a single robot. Each robot is tasked to perform a set job in its environment. Considering an environment that can be used in subenvironments with the entire robot, each of these environments can only be divided into one use of a single robot, and each of these environments can be used in the entire one."}, {"heading": "2. IMMUNE SYSTEM", "text": "The immune system defends the body against harmful diseases and infections. It is able to recognize virtually any foreign cell or molecule and remove it from the body. To do this, it must perform pattern recognition tasks to distinguish between molecules and cells in the body that react to a specific type of antigen, such as bacteria, viruses or toxins, that contain a special section at the top of the Y that is sensitive to a specific antigen and to which it binds. If an antibody binds to a toxin, it will reduce the chemical action of the toxin."}, {"heading": "3. ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM", "text": "The immune system is highly complex and seems to be precisely attuned to the problem of infection detection and elimination. It is also thought to provide a compelling example of a distributed information processing system that we can study for the purpose of developing better artificial adaptive systems [3], [4]. AIS uses the concepts of the natural immune system to improve computer techniques, and in this paper attempts to provide mechanisms to prevent failure in a multi-robot environment. Any autonomous robot works with limited performance and is emptied while the robot is working on its course. When using the AIS concept, the energy or power loss of the robot is considered antigen, and immune concepts are built in to ensure that such antigen does not disrupt the normal function of a robot. Then, when more than one robot works autonomously in an environment, it is ensured that none of the robots loses its power completely, causing it to stop functioning."}, {"heading": "4. ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTION", "text": "Each bot traverses its surroundings to complete a specified task. If you look at an environment (E) that is divided into n subenvironments g (En), where n is the no of the environment (n = 1, 2, 3, 4.... n).The work done by each bot is w (En).So if you add up the work done by a bot on a subenvironment, you get the work done on an environment. W (E) = w (E1) g (E1) + w (E2) g (E2) + w (E3) g (E3) + w (E4) g (E4) +... + w (En) g (En)"}, {"heading": "4.1 Working Description", "text": "The following algorithm is the normal FCFS. If many variables are waiting in a queue, an algorithm follows, where the first variable that has joined the queue is the first that comes out of the queue. If the battery is empty, the bot stores its current position and moves towards its docking point. When it reaches its docking point, the bot checks the charger. If the charger is empty, it moves to the charger, otherwise it enters the queue while it waits for its turn to use the charger. In this case, it follows the FCFS. If the boat is running very low and is on the back of the queue, it jumps to the top of the queue and is thus the first to use the charger in the queue. In this way, the bots are saved from complete failure due to the lack of battery charge."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Simulation Workspace", "text": "Once the bot has reached the red mark, it moves in a straight line back to the green mark. There is only one charger shared by all four bot. Each bot has a unique docking (waiting) station in case the charger is used.

CONCLUSION", "text": "This research attempts to model a simulation environment based on an artificial immune system applicable to intelligent multi-agents [3], simulating an application for the model. No bot is allowed to die by implementing an artificial immune system, and a unique FCFS is implemented that is rescheduled when a bot's battery strength falls below the threshold, placing the bot whose strength drops to this level at the top of the queue, increasing the consistency and efficiency of the entire system."}, {"heading": "6.
