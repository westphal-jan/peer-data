INTRODUCTIONScientific progress over the last 150 years, particularly in the medical field, has made it possible to extend life expectancy in Western countries, and this trend appears to be increasing in the coming years.Conservative estimates suggest that the share of people over 60 in EU countries will be around 50% by 2030, meaning that we will see a gradual increase in the number of people with chronic diseases (i.e. diseases that do not involve a cure), which will therefore increase the cost and effort towards healthcare facilities [1]. As a result of the exponential growth of hardware and software infrastructure, it is possible to rethink the entire approach to treating complex chronic diseases by limiting hospitalisation to a severe deterioration of the condition of the patient. This was the original idea behind the CHRONIOUS project: Building a generic platform for monitoring onerous disease quality in a non-intrusive way with two IOs:"}, {"heading": "II.

THE PDA CHRONIOUS PREPROCESSING PHASE", "text": "As already mentioned, the Personal Digital Assistant is a smartphone with WINDOWS MOBILE 6.5 operating system, an SQL SERVER 2005 COMPACT database and a.NET FRAMEWORK 3.5. Data collected by the PDA is as follows \u2022 data from the valuable jacket. \u2022 Responses to questionnaires on dietary habits, medication intake and lifestyle of the patient. \u2022 Data from the home patient monitor such as blood pressure, glucometer measurements and body weight. Once this data is collected, it is stored in the PDA database and a set of algorithms is triggered to analyze this data. As the PDA analyzes data for two different diseases, two sets of different algorithms are used. The basic data required for COPD treatment are ECG signals and respiratory data, so in the case of a COPD patient, we provide a first set of algorithms to process the electrocardioase pre-processing system at the end of the extraction phase, and then a specific feature is required to determine the extraction phase of the patient."}, {"heading": "A. Preprocessing of COPD signals", "text": "The aim of the pre-processing phase is to improve the overall quality of the ECG in order to enable more accurate analysis and measurements, as there is the possibility of having some sounds on the signals. \u2022 Possible noises in the signal include \u2022 Low frequency Base Line Wandering (BW) caused by breathing and body movements. \u2022 High frequency random noises caused by power interference (50 or 60Hz). \u2022 Muscle activity and random shifts in the ECG signal amplitude caused by poor electrode contacts and body movements. \u2022 Pre-processing includes: \u2022 Removal of ground line migrations (50 or 60Hz) signals that cause high frequency noise. \u2022 QRS detection, which is an extragenic low frequency activity that can disrupt signal analysis, making its clinical interpretation inaccurate and misleading."}, {"heading": "B. Features Extraction for COPD patients", "text": "From the Inter-beat (RR) interval and the Heart Rate Variability, several features can be extracted, either in time or in1The reconstructed ECG signal after denoising contains only spikes with non-zero values at the location of QRS complexes. From this signal, the PQ junction and J point can be located as the limits of the spike. The next stage is to capture the T wave, and the P wave in the PQ interval. The peaks of the Q, R and S waves are annotated part of the ECG signal from the PQ junction to J point.2 The algorithms include a number of filters and methods that perform low pass, derived, integration, adaptive linking, and search procedures."}, {"heading": "IV.

CONCLUSIONS AN IMPROVEMENTS", "text": "In this paper, we presented a set of machine learning algorithms storing in a smartphone that can be used in combination with some external devices and patients entered data for an initial monitoring / warning system to treat patients affected by chronic diseases. Dealing with telemedicine applications, this type of software could help improve the quality of life of the patient and could also be a valid help for the physician to enable more accurate monitoring of patient conditions without requiring the physical presence of the clinician. Apart from these potential benefits, a PDA equipped with this type of application may suffer some limitations. During the development phase, we face these problems: \u2022 Heavy resource consumption of pre-processing algorithms. \u2022 Updating a trained supervised algorithm can lead to a pre-processing algorithm for COPD parameters denoising is the most memory / CPU consumption. This can potentially become a problem if we go unaware of life risk situations, because the DA signal that the patient knew of during the time can be lost."}], "references": [{"title": "Chronic kidney disease and endstage renal diseasea review produced to contribute to the report the status of health in the european union: towards a healthier europe", "author": ["C.
