Acting as a complement to confidence and support, the confidence boost helps to obtain small and crisp sets of mined association rules, and solves the well-known problem that, in certain cases, rules of negative correlation may pass the confidence bound. We analyze the properties of two versions of the notion of confidence boost, one of them a natural generalization of the other. We develop efficient algorithmics to filter rules according to their confidence boost, compare the concept to some similar notions in the bibliography, and describe the results of some experimentation employing the new notions on standard benchmark datasets.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "Since the task of the Rule Mining Association was defined here, the problems we faced were twofold: firstly, the quantity of candidate item sets for antecedent X and consequent Y of the Association Articles X \u2192 Y are exponential with the often already large universe of elements. However, the introduction of a support threshold parameter was an important advance that is allowed for the design of efficient frequent miners and for the calculation of association sets in large datasets: the second difficulty is that the rule sets that appear \"often enough\" as subsets of transactions, that is, their relative frequency exceeds a certain ratio of transactions; see [Agrawal et al] and the references there. Then, the second problem is that the number of rules provided is too large, especially when we consider that their purpose is to be read and understood by a human being."}, {"heading": "2. PRELIMINARIES", "text": "A given set of available items U is assumed; its subsets are referred to as item sets. We will identify item sets by uppercase letters from the end of the alphabet, and a comparison is used to denote union, as in XY. Rather, the inclusion sign as in X-Y denotes the correct subset, while inappropriate inclusion is referred to as X-Y. For a given dataset D, consisting of n transactions, each of which is an item with a unique transaction identifier, we can count the support sD (X) of an item X, which is the cardinality of transactions, the X.

Confidence Width", "text": "Along most of the discussions in this paper, we assume that a dataset D and a support threshold are not equivalent \u2192 \u2192 Y threshold have been fixed: All our rules are assumed to be strictly above that support threshold. In accordance with the definition of redundancy in Lemma 2.4, all rules in the representative base provide some irredundant information. However, it is often the case that the representative base contains even more rules than are reasonable for human inspection. In [Balca \"zar 2009], the intuition of redundancy is further advanced to gain a perspective of the novelty of association rules. An irredundant rule of a given trust c is part of the basis for this trust threshold = c: no rule of that trust or higher makes it redundant; equivalent are all rules that make it redundant to have a lower trust. Then one can ask:\" how much lower? \"This can be evaluated by the following definition: Definition \u2192 X\""}, {"heading": "2.2. Blocking Rules", "text": "Based on the clear, simple intuition described in many papers (e.g. [Bayardo et al. 1999; Liu et al. 1999; Padmanabhan and Tuzhilin 2000; Shah et al. 1999; Toivonen et al. 1995] to name a few, [Balca \u0301 zar 2009] also suggests an idea of \"rule blocking,\" whereby a subset of the antecedent rule can be \"blocked,\" that is, prohibits it from being made available in the issue if the trust of the rule is higher with the smaller history and the same consequence. The main question behind this option is the following: Consider an association rule X \u2192 XY, and reduce the antecedent relationship to a smaller XY. Whereas, intuitively, the rule should be subsumed with larger processes by the other, this is due to the human intuitive habit, where this is actually the case."}, {"heading": "2.3. Support Ratio", "text": "We will relate our values of trust breadth and trust enhancement to an expression that is essentially used first, to our knowledge, in [Kryszkiewicz 2001], where no particular name was assigned to it.

It turns out that this approach is efficient and useful in practice, but carries the risk of providing an incomplete output, as actual representative rules may not be adhered to. The same reference provides further analysis, including almost equally efficient alternatives, the output of which is completed. Here, we introduce this notion because it is related to all of our three parameters of trust breadth, blocking and trust enhancement, which we support; it will allow us to explain their reciprocal relationships more carefully, and allow restrictions of trust to be \"pushed\" into a process."}, {"heading": "3.

CLOSURE-BASED CONFIDENCE BOOST", "text": "The representative rules are a minimum size basis for redundancy, defined under Lemma 2.4; however, they often constitute a large group. Before adopting the option of information loss in a quantifiable way, as we do via confidence enhancement, one could consider the option of using stronger terms of redundancy. Several previous papers, e.g.: [Luxenburger 1991; Pasquier et al. 2005; Zaki 2004], propose to treat the implications, which allow a complete basis for more compact foundations, separately from the partial provisions of trust.] In addition to another more complicated alternative, we follow this proposal as well and employ an idea of closure-based redundancy, which can also provide a complete basis for demonstrably minimal size, denoted B?. This option has clear advantages: while it offers bases that are comparable in size, and often significantly smaller than the set of representative rules, it has the desirable property that the proportion of refuses to share associations (of trust) below 1."}, {"heading": "4.1. Double-Threshold Confidence Revisited", "text": "Next, we develop an algorithm to calculate a confidence increase based on closure. We just need to make a number of adjustments to the number that is given for a clear increase in confidence: first, we need to examine the rules of the B? basis for trust, rather than the representative rules for that trust, as this is the appropriate basis for a redundancy based on closure; and second, we need to consider the closure operator when checking whether a specific B? rule can essentially lead to a low increase in the input basis. Theorem 4.5. Let X \u2192 XY at least be a confidence rule. Algorithm 2 accepts it if and only if it applies (X \u2192 XY) > b.Proof. We are essentially following the same steps as in Theorem 3.11, although we need to argue more carefully about the places where the closure operator plays a role.

Inequalities", "text": "Compared to the confidence boost, the confidence boost loosens the alternative rules to which a particular rule is compared (\u03b2 = \u03b2 = 6), e.g. by allowing left pages that are not contained in X; on the other hand, however, it limits them by the condition that the rules are \"unequal\" in a closed sense and not just different. Therefore, we have to check what inequalities still exist; we have to check what inequalities still exist; we start with the (partial) analogies of Propositions 3.5 and 3.4.Proposition 4.6. The assumption that XY itself is higher than the other, and the relationship to other quantities such as width or support ratio becomes less clear. We have to check what inequalities still exist; we start with the (partial) analogies of Propositions 3.5 and 3.4.Proposition 4.6.

It pays the price of traversing all closed subsets of a given closed sentence, but saves exceeding the alternative base with lower confidence.

A noteworthy case is the elevator, which implicitly refers to a rule with the same right side and an empty left side as discussed in the Proposition 3.4 evidence. Compared to this family of measures, confidence boost is finer, as it can distinguish between many alternative antecedents in order to compare the price of being, which is potentially more costly to evaluate due to the search for smaller but arbitrary left sides, and larger but arbitrary right sides. We have shown several algorithms that attempt to circumscribe this search for smaller spaces.More sophisticated measures of interest are possible, for example, those that are based on the disparity between the jargon and the probability given by the rule."}, {"heading": "7.2.

The fact that a rule X \u2192 XY in relation to X \u2192 XY is \"redundant if Y\" (in the sense that it has at least the same trust threshold) is actually shown in many places (e.g. [Aggarwal and Yu 2001; Kryszkiewicz 1998b; Phan-Luong 2001; Shah et al. 1999]). Our starting point is the representative basis on which we would keep X \"XY\" only if its trust threshold is higher than that of X \"XY,\" by a factor indicated by the increase in trust; this quantification is an effective refinement of this well-known proposal. On the other hand, redundancy of X \"XY\" in relation to X \"X\" X \"Y\" Y \"is debatable."}, {"heading": "7.3.

We plan to continue working on this rather subjective problem, and intend to use further actual end-user evaluations from dataset providers, as we have begun to do in terms of partial aspects.

We develop efficient algorithmics to filter rules according to their confidence boost, compare the concept to some similar notions in the bibliography, and describe the results of some experimentation employing the new notions on standard benchmark datasets.
