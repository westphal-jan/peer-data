What is the mechanism of the mutual influences of a group of people in daily life? How? the ideas and thoughts are exchanged. Talking, reading and then understanding, then generating influences and then changing the infrastructure of the brain. Then, we start with an investigation of the understanding process of the human brain, and then proceed to examine the mutual influences of a group of people (like a society). In order to measure and study the neural processes of the brain, it must be grasped through the use of some appropriate neural networks of artificial intelligence. We propose that the mutual influences of a group of people (like a society) be investigated."}, {"heading": "2 The Self-Similar Neural Network Of Un-", "text": "Deregulation"}, {"heading": "2.1 The self-similar network for basic understanding", "text": "As a process of the brain, not as a logical program processing on a particular computer, understanding is difficult to be or cannot be translated into a logical computational process. However, by using all possible appropriate artificial intelligence neural networks, such as self-similar neural networks or any kind of complex networks, one can tomograph the entire state of origin, eruption and destruction of neural circuits of the human brain. One can translate a neural thought process into a logical computational process. Self-similar neural networks can be the most natural choice to tomograph all appropriate basic understanding processes concerning the understanding of basic concepts and the relationships between them, since the basic understanding is natural and universal for everyone. And, of course, the network (for basic understanding) should be scaled according to the power of the awarding.To a certain extent, all these assertions can be confirmed by the observations and explanations of the neurocognitive sciences."}, {"heading": "2.2 The Self-Similar Network For Understanding At", "text": "Let's take into account the optimal knowledge management of an individual. The conclusion is clear, it is a self-like network, scaled according to the vision of values of the individual (with Jia). The optimal thought process of an individual is a search process on the self-like network, according to the meaning of values. In the vision of values of each individual, one can scale the values of different disciplines anew, e.g. in my reflection, the value of pure theoretical physics weights 1, the value of poetry weights 0.85, and other subjects take small weights, say, weights 0.6, 0.5 e.t.c. In other words, in the vision of values of me, to count the values of multidisciplines, I will pass different factors of weights to different subjects. Different people maintain different systems of values."}, {"heading": "3 The Theory of Self-Similar Neural-Network", "text": "for ideally sufficient language"}, {"heading": "3.1 The Idealy Sufficient Languages For Knowledge", "text": "This language, in addition to being complete and consistent, must also be sufficient for all expressions, communication, with sufficient accuracy, and can be used for conceptualization to any given extent, which we will essentially discuss further in subsection 3 of this section. Obviously, the network for our ideally adequate language is larger than the semantic network of words, and a most natural assumption about this is that there is a self-similar network with many glomerate words structured like Mandelblot sentences. Or in other words, the network looks like the true neural network of words."}, {"heading": "3.2 Sentance And Text", "text": "We now turn to the characterization of a sentence and an O (n) sentence text on the self-resembling network defined in the above paragraphs.1. Sentance on the network of words. In our network, a sentance is a string of words connected by relationships, it is a simple pattern of the track in the network that proceeds from or passes on at least a small glomeration of words, but not many glomerations on its track. The track of the sentance may or may not intersect itself, but must be meaningless to some extent, because sentance must be meaningful. Are there certain logical algorithms to create an arbitrary such track? and how to distinguish two such tracks (ie two sentances)? 2. O (n) Sentances text on the network of words. For an O (n) Sentances text, the corresponding pattern on the network must be much more complicated."}, {"heading": "3.3 Stories and Inspirations", "text": "From the point of view of brain science, it is because a story emerges as a significant and fruitful structure in the true neural network of the brain. Have these structures or patterns been generated by the ant algorithm or by the bee algorithm? (suggested by Jia) or are they generated by some types of more complicated algorithms? We now turn to another problem that was partially discussed by the brain researcher and myself (some time ago): the logical expansions of inspiration. In the inspired state of the brain, the problem to be solved, the key elements and the complete resolution of the phenomenon that has manifested in the logical generations of them can be a neographic process."}, {"heading": "3.4 For living languages", "text": "Living languages are obviously not so imaginative and sufficient, but since they are used in ordinary life, we can consider each one as an approximation of the ideally adequate language defined by its self-like network. Therefore, what we have said can be useful for the natural languages of ordinary life, such as Chinese."}, {"heading": "3.5 To Construct The Network Mathematically", "text": "We know that the logical or mathematical construction of the neural word network is important for the language that is ideally sufficient, this network that we have previously obtained through the translation of the neural circuits. To construct the network (for the language that is ideally sufficient, or in other words, to construct the self-similar neural network of understanding at the fundamental level), one needs concepts and its properties, such as the objects and their contributions to the network, and then one also needs to examine the relationships between these concepts (such as the relations of the objects). Typical relationships include cooperative relations and basic logical relationships, such as iterations and decisions. Also, the consideration of weight and probability thinking are improtant.It is obvious that blurred mathematics is an appropriate consistent framework to include all these elements. What elements are important for the construction of a self-similar network? It looks as if objects, weights of objects and relations of corporations, and Iteralations are important."}, {"heading": "4 Picture Understanding and Familiarity", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Picture Understanding", "text": "Let us now turn to the principle of understanding images! First, I think that there has to be a very ordinary process, just like the ordinary operations of image processing, like compressed scanning. In some details, the brain will cut the whole image into small pieces, each piece is a simple unit, which is characterized by some simple properties, a zoo factor, a fairly simple color property and its intensity and texture of pixels, etc. As with compressed scanning with a fixed precision, a zoo factor is needed to reduce the amount of data, since one only has to zoom out the more complicated part of the image to see it more clearly. In understanding of image, the brain effectively applies the self-similar networks of basic understanding to these simple units to structure them. Then, one has the self-similar network of the image, which is scaled according to the power of avarensis."}, {"heading": "4.2 Familiarity", "text": "We are addressing another problem, namely familiarity with the environment to which people are accustomed, namely a whole series of details that remain static or change only slowly - such as the trees, the colour of the leaves - which are recorded in a \"register\" of the brain."}, {"heading": "5 From Understanding to Influence", "text": "According to the understanding, the understood texts or stories or knowledge influence the thinking of the human brain. We now turn to the quantification of influences and influences that influence the network of a group of people - society. The power of the influences of the individual consists of the nodes of the network of influence. The interactions between two peoples give us the relationship necessary for building the network."}, {"heading": "5.1 The Power of Influence Is Amount of Computa-", "text": "First, the power of the influences of an individual in a society is the amount of calculations influenced by that person. The amount of calculations is a measurement of the thinking of the affected peoples. It is obvious that in order to measure the amount of influences, one has to tomograph the true neural processes through some appropriate AI networks. Afterwards, the power of the influences can be measured as the amount of logical calculations of thinking measured by the tomographic AI networks, see Section 2. From this we can conclude that the power of the influences of an individual in an asocial way is the total amount of calculations influenced by this method. One point that needs clarification is that the social processes themselves select calculation processes that require appropriate tomography, since the complexity of influences is typically in NP order. In the present work, all we have to consider and take into account are the interlogical influences of people."}, {"heading": "5.2 Stories And Inspirations", "text": "In Section 4 we discussed the presentation and understanding of stories and inspirations, and now we turn to group effects. According to the patterns on the self-similar network of understanding, stories, especially stories read and transmitted by society, or stories generated by groups, such as the mud game, will also create structures on the network of influences. It is a mirror image of group effects! But the social correspondence of inspirations cannot be found. Because: First, the high level inspirations, as we have discussed, are hidden in the infinite correlations of infinite neural networks of artificial intelligence and cannot be tomographed and measured, and so they have no equivalent in the network of influence of a society. Influences cannot be limited to this moment and place, it belongs to infinity! In fact, even more ordinary creative inspirations, which can logically be extended, belong in the network of influence of a society."}, {"heading": "6 On Machine Understanding", "text": "Now imagine an application of our understanding principle - to machine understanding! How do you understand a man for a machine? For example, how do you understand the natural language of man? and how do you translate these words into the logical computer program? How do you understand a human guard for a machine? The first step is very similar to the natural understanding discussed in Section 3. The machine will break the guard into parts of words and terms and the relations between them, according to the network for understanding. -That is, the guard on the self-like neural network of the ideally adequate language (with the natural language contained in it). The second step is to translate the parts into computer orders, for example according to a logical algorithm, a kind of search algorithms appropriate to the entire network (its objects, encrypted relationships, etc.) This algorithm must be as we have addressed it, but we do not know a concrete algorithm as an example."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2013, "abstractText": "In the present paper, we try to propose a self-similar network theory for the basic understanding.
