U-SEM: PEOPLE MODELING SERVICE", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take one year to move on to the next round."}, {"heading": "3. APPLICATION SCENARIO", "text": "Given the architecture described in the previous section, U-Sem coordinates input from various sources to enrich user profiles and domain knowledge to improve personalization. In this section, we present an example scenario within ImREAL where the U-Sem framework is used with a medical training simulator. Data flow will proceed as follows: This simulator collects a set of basic user characteristics and click data that are fed into the U-Sem framework along with domain information; U-Sem performs semantic enrichment and user modeling through a series of modules to provide enriched user profiles and domain knowledge that are fed back to the simulator for improved customization."}, {"heading": "3.1 Semantic Enrichment", "text": "In this context, it has to be said that this is a way of putting the interests of users first."}, {"heading": "3.2 User Modeling", "text": "U-Sem uses a variety of modules for reasoning, inferring, generating and aggregating user profiles from the available enriched usage and user data. For example, given the previous Twitter observation, the reasoning module takes into account all entities extracted from both the text of the Twitter message and the content of the URL mentioned in the tweet. It deduces that the user is interested in \"Frederic Chopin\" and reads about \"hallucinations\" and \"epilepsy.\" Based on the fact that both concepts, \"hallucinations\" and \"epilepsy,\" are in the category of \"diseases\" within the DBpedia hierarchy, this module can substantiate that this user has knowledge about diseases and can adjust the level of knowledge in these concepts accordingly. As U-Sem collects data from various sources, a special component is required to monitor data aggregation and possible conflict resolution."}, {"heading": "4. OUTLOOK", "text": "In this paper, we introduced U-Sem, a generic framework for enriching, modeling and extracting profile and usage data available on the Web. U-Sem supports web-based systems that require user profile information and aim at personalization. In particular, we have shown examples of how we envision this feature in the context of e-learning. Currently, we are investigating the extraction of user profiles from Twitter that model users \"interests and evaluate them in the context of messaging systems, a process that has already led to the development of entity extraction, entity identification and topic recognition modules. In addition, we have begun to conduct initial experiments to extract user profiles that model users\" level of knowledge, relying on social bookmarking services designed for scientific work, in particular CiteULike and Bibsonomy. Next steps of our work will focus on the use of pleasing profiles to model users \"knowledge levels, relying on these clicking data, as well as on tracking issues."}, {"heading": "5.
