We present a method to learn from a search log which types of query modifications have and have not been effective in the past. The method analyses query modifications along two dimensions: a traditional term-based dimension and a semantic dimension, for which queries are enriches with linked data entities. Applying the method to the search logs of two search engines, we identify six opportunities for a query modification assistant to improve search: modification strategies that are commonly used, but that often do not lead to satisfactory results.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Apr 2011 10:03:45 GMT  (453kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0128v1", "1st International Workshop on Usage Analysis and the Web of Data (USEWOD2011) in the 20th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2011), Hyderabad, India, March 28th, 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "1st International Workshop on Usage Analysis and the Web of Data (USEWOD2011) in the 20th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2011), Hyderabad, India, March 28th, 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["vera hollink", "arjen de vries"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.0128"}, "pdf": {"name": "1104.0128.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Towards an automated query modification assistant", "authors": ["Vera Hollink", "Arjen de Vries"], "emails": ["V.Hollink@cwi.nl", "arjen@acm.org"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Search engine users often type a number of queries in a row before they find everything they need, or before they are convinced that the collection they are looking for does not contain answers to their information needs. Search queries suggestions can help users formulate their search queries (e.g. [7, 17]). In addition to search query suggestions, users can potentially be helped by having more feedback on their search strategy. Successively, they enter Monet and Impressionism queries, but none of the search results is of their liking. Search query suggestions can include the names of Monet contemporaries and the titles of Monet images. These can be useful suggestions, but do not tell the user why their own modified search query (Impressionism) was unsuccessful. Search query strategies can be used for comparable information."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Research on query changes examines pairs of queries submitted one after the other in a search session (e.g. [5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 25]. Successive query pairs are classified into a series of modification classes and the use of these classes is analyzed."}, {"heading": "3. METHOD", "text": "In line with previous research, we examine query modifications by listing all pairs of queries that are entered one after the other in a search session. We refer to the first query in a pair as the original query and the second query as the modified query. Note that in sessions with more than two queries, the modified query in one pair as the original query in the next pair. We classify the relationship between the queries in each pair and count the number of pairs in each class. Two classifications are used: a traditional term-based classification and a novel semantic classification."}, {"heading": "3.1 Term-based classification of query modifications", "text": "For the term-based approach, queries are first executed using the Porter-Stemmer [19]. For each pair, we determine whether terms are added (specification), removed (generalization), or replaced (reformulation) in the second query compared to the first query. We also count how often the query has been identical to the previous query by stemming (lexical variation) 1. Query pairs without overlapping terms are classified as \"no relationship.\""}, {"heading": "3.2 Semantic classification of query modifications", "text": "For semantic classification, the queries are mapped to linked data units (see [4] for an overview of multiple linked data). We use the rdfs: label property of the entities that provides a human-readable description of the entities [6]. Queries are mapped to entities that have an rdfs: label that matches the query exactly. For example, the Andre Agassi query is mapped to the entity http: / / dbpedia.org / resource / Andre _ Agassi, as that entity is called \"Andre Agassi\" (see Figure 1, left). If no exact match can be found, the queries are mapped to entities with labels that contain all matched query terms. For some queries, no matching entities that contain queries that do not match entities are found, are found, and queries that do not include matching pairs of queries, are found in each pair of pairs that do not take into account the pairs of matched enquiries."}, {"heading": "3.3 Quantifying modification success", "text": "To quantify the average effectiveness of some kind of modification of a query, we measure the success of queries resulting from changes of this kind. Similar to [12], we define a successful query as a query that is followed by at least one click on a search result. Unsuccessful queries do not result in a click and are directly followed by another query or terminate the search session. The motivation of this definition is that a successful query responds at least partially to a user's information requirement.We define the success rate (srm) of a modification m as the percentage of cases in which the modification was successful. In other words, srm is the percentage of query pairs with modification type m, followed by a click on the modified query: srm = cmcm + nmHere cm is the number of times m followed by a click and nm the number of times m was not followed by a click. In order to calculate the success rates of different modification types with respect to this type of success, we will very increase compared to each type of use."}, {"heading": "4. DATA SETS", "text": "We analyze query changes in the logs of two image search engines. In image search, the change plays a greater role than in other types of search, because users who search for images, on average, need more queries to find what they need [14]. However, our analysis methods are by no means limited to image search. The first set of data consists of the search logs of the commercial image portal of a European news agency. The portal provides access to more than 2 million photographic images covering a wide range. Log files record the search interactions of professional users (mainly journalists) who access the image portal. We use 10-month search logs with 1,094,620 queries in 520,507 sessions. Search sessions are identified using a log-in and a browser cookie and a time span of 15 minutes.The linked data consists of various interlinked sources: the DBpedia Ontology [3], WordNet [9, Cornetto, the Lexical] as well as the data engine 24."}, {"heading": "5. RESULTS", "text": "First, we analyze the use of query modifications in general and determine the average success of modifications. In Section 5.2, we examine the use and success of certain date-based modification types and in Section 5.3, semantic modification types."}, {"heading": "5.1 Overall analysis", "text": "Table 1 (column 2) shows the overall success rate of query changes in the two sets of data. As shown, 34% of news photos and 40% of Rijksmuseum changes led to a click. If the original query was successful (third column), the success rate is higher than if the original query was unsuccessful (fourth column). It is possible that this difference is the result of differences between users in their ability to formulate effective queries or in their inclination to click on marginal interesting results. Another explanation could be that the successful queries arise from simpler information needs. In any case, these results indicate that the provision of feedback about the search strategy of a user is the most urgent when none of the search results is clicked on - 0.0000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00000,000,000,00000,000,000,00000,000,000,000,00000,000000000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00"}, {"heading": "5.2 Term-based modifications", "text": "Figure 2 shows that in the message photo data, the relative frequency of the four term-based modifications coincides with the majority of existing research: Reformulations are used most often, followed by specifications, followed by generalizations and lexical variations [16, 20, 25, 13, 5, 8, 18]. In the Rijksmuseum data set, more specifications are used than reformulations, which are also found in [10, 15]. Table 2 shows the relative frequency of modifications and their IR values when the original query was successful and when the original query was unsuccessful. From this data, we identify three cases in which feedback on the user's modification strategies can improve the search: feedback possibility 1. Generations are mostly used after unsuccessful queries. Apparently, users often believe that their queries are unsuccessful because they retrieve too few interesting results (low memory), because too many uninteresting results are retrieved."}, {"heading": "5.3 Semantic modifications", "text": "Many different types of modification emerged from semantic query modification analysis. The ten types found most frequently in the news photo data are in Table 3. The most common type was the same entity relationship ([]): two different queries associated with the same company, usually variant names for the same company, such as Ghent and Gand (the Dutch and French names of a Belgian city). Types 2, 6, and 10 indicate that many users searched2As do not use the search engine itself, but lexical variations result in different search results, first on the name of a person and then on the name of their spouse or partner. Types 3, 9, and 4 respectively show us that many users have searched for relatives who play for the same national team, who belong to the same sports club, or who play the stars in the same movie."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Our analysis found that users are not always able to make effective query changes. We identified six situations in which feedback on a user's query change strategy can improve the search. Based on our results, a feedback wizard can advise a user in a particular situation to use or not to use certain term-based or semantic query changes. When comparing the semantic and term-based analyses, we found that the insights they provide are complementary. Both approaches created unique feedback opportunities. As far as the results of the two analyses overlap, their results exist. In this paper, we examined the relationship between clicks on search results and the way users modify their queries. So far, we have not considered why a set of search results was (un-) satisfactory to a user. Did it contain too few results? Did it contain results that will not correlate to the next step of the user's need for information?"}, {"heading": "7.

The method analyses query modifications along two dimensions: a traditional term-based dimension and a semantic dimension, for which queries are enriches with linked data entities. Applying the method to the search logs of two search engines, we identify six opportunities for a query modification assistant to improve search: modification strategies that are commonly used, but that often do not lead to satisfactory results.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
