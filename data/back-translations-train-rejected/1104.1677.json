Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA)", "text": "The intelligent agent system described in this paper, called the Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA), consists of 5 agents, management agent, internal agent, external agent, watcher agent and report agent. Before showing the design / conceptual model of VCA, we will examine some of the requirements of VCA. On which the overall functionality of VCA will depend. Requirement of Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA) The features of the intelligence required by Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA) depend on many factors. It depends on where it should be operated. ii. What sensors are used that should be available. iii. It also detects and corrects the problem that occurred in the vehicle. iv. How is it controlled? vii. What costs, risks and benefits are required? vii. What types of roads are suitable?"}, {"heading": "III. Design of Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA)", "text": "The conceptual model of the Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA) is illustrated in Fig.1. The user interacts with the management agent and interacts with various agents, i.e. Internal Agent, External Agent, Watcher Agent and Report Agent, and each agent is activated with a corresponding message. All agents work with collaboration and coordination, each agent has its own assigned role."}, {"heading": "A. Management Agent", "text": "The management agent works in a way that is very user-friendly. He keeps the agent list, memorizes the role of each agent and controls all agents. When the user first turns to the system, he explains the necessary operating procedures. He allows the entry of the user's personal profile and stores it in the database of the personal profile. Interactions between the user and the management agent are shown in the figure. This agent has general control over the other agents. If he receives a message from another agent, he selects a suitable agent for the message and activates this agent. B. Internal agent This agent works when the management agent sends a message for the internal inspection of the vehicle. He checks petrol, spark plugs, lights, fuel tank problems. The problem with the battery brake and this agent is called up and sends a suitable message to the management agent via sensors, as different types of sensors are also used."}, {"heading": "C. External Agent", "text": "This agent works when the management agent sends a message for external vehicle inspection. He checks tires, lights, door, speed control. When the agent reverses the speed of the vehicle and this agent is called, he sends a suitable message via sensors to the management agent."}, {"heading": "D. Watcher Agent", "text": "This agent monitors messages between agents and tracks which agent is currently activated. If there is a conflict between agents or events do not occur in the correct order, it sends a warning message. If a fatal error occurs, it stops the operation of the currently activated agent and returns to the previous step."}, {"heading": "E. Report Agent", "text": "Report Agent delivers the end results to the user in a user-friendly manner that enables the user to fulfill his / her duties. IV"}, {"heading": "A. Pseudo code for Internal Agent", "text": "The most important steps of the pseudo-code for internal agents are listed in the following box Checking by Internal Agent i. If the engine gets gasoline and the engine switches, then the problem is with the spark plugs ii. if the engine does not switch and the light does not turn on, then the problem is with the battery. iii. if the engine does not switch and the light turns on, then the problem is with the starter. iv. If the gasoline is not in the tank, then the gasoline is finished v. If the bell rings, then someone stole the vehicle."}, {"heading": "B. Checking by External Agent", "text": "i. Checks the speed of the vehicle ii. reversing and forwarding the vehicle i.e. forward and backward word. iii. damage or leakage of oil."}, {"heading": "V. Applications related to Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA)", "text": "Automatic vehicle inspection agent is used to organize each vehicle in each car vehicle. The history of each vehicle is also stored in the device that gives all the details of the vehicle and each and every part of the vehicle. There are many problems in each car organization about different parts of a car vehicle inspection i.e. gasoline problem, light problem, battery problem, lock problem, engine problem etc. In addition, in this automatic vehicle inspection equipment different sensors are used and each is adapted in the vehicle to perform its job as an agent and the user is directly connected to a database of the vehicle as well as the management agent. If a problem exists, then the user activates the management agent then this agent checks if it is an internal problem or an external problem, then he activates the agent about sensors that can be adapted in the vehicle for each and every part of the vehicle, then a corresponding message is displayed by Watcher agent i.e. problem with engine, fuel is stopped, battery is not working properly, speed of the vehicle is damaged in the vehicle etc., user can take appropriate action according to the vehicle's report by the appropriate agent."}, {"heading": "VI. Conclusion", "text": "In this thesis, we have described the modeling and working functions of Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA), using different types of agents, each of which has intelligent properties. In the future, we will have to develop a detailed description of each agent."}, {"heading": "VII. References", "text": "[1] J. W. Sullivan and S. W.
