KNOWLEDGE BASE REPRESENTAION", "text": "The most important sources of knowledge for the development of this DSS / ES are the human academic experts of Gomal University (= > admission criteria of Gomal University, the admission criteria of Gomal University (slot), the previous records of the students and their future results. We have collected all the required criteria, skills and abilities per faculty / subject at Gomal University and converted the knowledge into facts and rules in the CLIPS syntax and stored it in the knowledge base of the CLIPS language. CLIPS is suitable for type type type type type type thinking and can easily be used to build the rules and facts, therefore we have selected the CLIPS academic language. In addition, we have collected all the general important background information about the student in the CLIPS fact templates, which are type type type type type type type type type type type type type in the C language.

We used the English language for test modules. CLIPS language does not support graphical interfaces; but can be easily integrated with other high-level languages such as visual basics. We developed the test modules using Microsoft basic data and then the student's results are converted into a text file at the end of the test, which is then opened by the CLIPS DSS to read the data. Figure (1): Sample question screen from a Competence & Competence Module test. First, we provide some important background information about the student's skills such as his name, academic rating, academic data type, age, etc. A time-limited module test consisting of 100 questions each, starting with 20 questions in English, mathematics, physics, physics, computer science / biology. \"Figure 1 shows a sample screen from a competence module."}, {"heading": "4.2 INTELLIGENCE TEST", "text": "This test starts shortly after the end of the academic test. It evaluates the intelligence of the students. We developed the intelligence test in the same way we developed the competence test discussed in Section 4. After the completion of the competence test, the intelligence test begins without a break. It consists of a time-limited module test consisting of 50 questions. Figure 2 shows a sample question screen from an intelligence module test. When the student has completed the intelligence test, our DSS has captured all information about the intelligence of the students. This information is then converted into facts in our CLIPS DSS system. Figure (2): Sample question screen from an intelligence module test."}, {"heading": "5. RESULT OF THE EXPERT SYSTEM/DSS", "text": "In the end, our decision support system makes recommendations to the student. The recommendation is based on the background information, academic performance, intelligence test results and performance module test results. Our DSS identifies the most appropriate faculty or focus for the student based on the skills and abilities derived from the test results. These results may not be 100% accurate, as there may be several factors that affect the student outside of the scientific level, such as the mental state and health situation during the evaluation test, which have a negative impact on results."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK", "text": "Our DSS is a rules-based system, and we used CLIPS language to store our knowledge base. On the basis of skills and intelligence tests and their academic performance to date, we can measure some students \"abilities and skills and determine which faculty / major subject is suitable for them. The fact is that measuring students\" abilities and abilities is a complex process, but as more students are evaluated as part of the competence test, the more likely realistic results are withdrawn. Our DSS definition rules can be customized and additional criteria added to achieve more data-based results. It can be extended to other faculties and major subjects of universities to be able to mentor more students who wish to enroll at other universities, and tailor the criterion for that university."}, {"heading": "7.
