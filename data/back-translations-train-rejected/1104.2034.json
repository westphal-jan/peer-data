Main features of the new web-based comparative dictionary are placed, the principles of its formation are shown, primary links between the word-matches are classified. The principal difference between translation dictionaries and the model of double comparison is also shown. The classification scheme of the pages is proposed. New concepts and keywords have been introduced. The real prototype of the dictionary with a few key pages is published. The broad debate about the possibility of this prototype to become a version of Russian-Bulgarian comparative dictionary of a new generation is available.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2011 19:50:50 GMT  (706kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2034v1", "Bulgarian Rusistics; Vol. 1 (2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Bulgarian Rusistics; Vol. 1 (2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yavor angelov parvanov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.2034"}, "pdf": {"name": "1104.2034.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "\u042f.\u0410. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 (\u0418\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u044f) \u041c\u0410\u0422\u0415\u0420\u0418\u0410\u041b\u042b K \u0420\u0423\u0421\u0421\u041a\u041e-\u0411\u041e\u041b\u0413\u0410\u0420\u0421\u041a\u041e\u041c\u0423 \u0421\u041e\u041f\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0410\u0412\u0418\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c\u041d\u041e\u041c\u0423 \u0421\u041b\u041e\u0412\u0410\u0420\u042e \u00ab\u0421\u042d\u0414\u00bb", "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) and the US Federal Reserve Bank (Fed)."}, {"heading": "6. ------ \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440: \u043b\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043b\u044a\u0436\u0430", "text": "The US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) have agreed that the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will be able to raise policy rates.
