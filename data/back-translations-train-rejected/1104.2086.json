As a result, when combined with the original treebank data, this universal tagset and mapping produce a dataset consisting of common parts-of-speech for 22 different languages. We highlight the use of this resource via two experiments, including one that reports competitive accuracies for unsupervised grammar induction without gold standard part-of-speech tags.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2011 23:06:54 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2086v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["slav petrov", "dipanjan das", "ryan mcdonald"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.2086"}, "pdf": {"name": "1104.2086.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["slav@google.com", "dipanjan@cs.cmu.edu", "ryanmcd@google.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 110 4.20 86v1 [cs.CL] 1 1A pr"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The fact is that most of them will be able to go to another world, in which they can go to another world, in which they will not find themselves, in which they will not find themselves, in which they will not find themselves, in which they will not find themselves, in which they will not find themselves, in which they will not find themselves, in which they will not find themselves, in which they will not find themselves, in which they will not find themselves."}, {"heading": "2 Tagset", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them are in a position to survive themselves, if they do not go into another world, in which they do not live in another world, but in another world in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live, in which they do not live,"}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed universal POS tagset, we conducted two experiments: First, we trained the same supervised POS tagging model for language comparison on all of the above tree trunks and evaluated the accuracy of marking on the universal POS tagset.
