However, the theorem is only valid under special assumptions of measurability of the class, in which case the PAC learnability even becomes consistent. Otherwise, there is a classical example, constructed under the Continuum Hypothesis by Dudley and Durst and further adapted by Blumer, Ehrenfeucht, Haussler, and Warmuth, of a concept class of VC dimension one which is neither uniform Glivenko-Cantelli nor consistently PAC learnable. We show that, rather surprisingly, under an additional set-theoretic hypothesis which is much milder than the Continuum Hypothesis (Martin's Axiom), PAC learnability is equivalent to finite VC dimension for every concept class.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Apr 2011 01:15:03 GMT  (70kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2097v1", "Revised submission to IJCNN'2011"]], "COMMENTS": "Revised submission to IJCNN'2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["vladimir pestov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.2097"}, "pdf": {"name": "1104.2097.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Vladimir Pestov"], "emails": ["vpest283@uottawa.ca)."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x,"}, {"heading": "II.

The domain (instance room) is a standard Borel space, that is, a fully divisible metric space equipped with the sigma algebra of the Borel subsets (the smallest family of sets that contain all open balls and are closed). We will not distinguish between a measurement quantity and its Lebesgue completion, that is, an extension of the \u00b5 by a larger sigma algebra of the Lebesgue subsets of the Lebesgue class. Furthermore, remember that a subset of the A group is universally measurable when it is Lebesgue-Measure-Measure-Measure-Measure-Measure class."}, {"heading": "III. REVISITING AN EXAMPLE OF DURST AND DUDLEY", "text": "The proof of the implication (3) \u00b2 (2) in Theorem 1 essentially depends on the Fubini theory, which is why some measurability limitations of Class C. Without them, the conclusion is not generally applicable. Here is a classic example of a concept class with a finite VC dimension that is not uniform. Example 3 (Durst and Dudley [5], statement 2.2): Let us assume the validity of the Continuum Hypothesis (CH). Let us be an invaluable standard Borel space up to an isomorphistic space, the space associated with the unit C [0, 1]. The statement of CH is equivalent to the existence of a total order on the property that each semi-open initial segment Iy = {x), y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y is countable."}, {"heading": "IV.

CONCLUSION", "text": "As a footnote to the basic theorem of statistical learning, we have demonstrated that the PAC learning ability of a concept class C, in the presence of a mild set theoretical axiom (Martin's axiom), equals the finiteness of the VC dimension of C, without additional assumptions about the measurability of class C. The price to be paid is the abandonment of a consistent PAC learning ability and the constructive choice of a learning rule. It would be interesting to know to what extent the results are accurate in the usual ZFC model of set theory. In particular, can an example of a concept class C on a standard Borel domain, which has a finite VC dimension and is still not cost-effective for PAC learning, be constructed without additional set theory axioms?"}], "references": [{"title": "Chervonenkis, On the uniform convergence of relative frequencies of events to their probabilities", "author": ["V.N.
