This article presents a general mathematical framework to efficiently allocate the available computational resources to process the parts of the input that are relevant to solve a given perceptual problem. By this we mean to find the hypothesis H (i.e., the state of the world) that maximizes a function L(H), representing how well each hypothesis \"explains\" the input. Given the large bandwidth of the sensory input, fully evaluating L(H) for each hypothesis H is computationally infeasible (e.g., because it would imply checking a large number of pixels). To address this problem we propose a mathematical framework with two key ingredients. The first one is a Bounding Mechanism (BM) to compute lower and upper bounds of L(H), for a given computational budget. These bounds are much cheaper to compute than L(H) itself, can be refined at any time by increasing the budget allocated to a hypothesis, and are frequently enough to discard a hypothesis. To compute these bounds, we develop a novel theory of shapes and shape priors. The second ingredient is a Focus of Attention Mechanism (FoAM) to select which hypothesis' bounds should be refined next, with the goal of discarding non-optimal hypotheses with the least amount of computation. The proposed framework: 1) is very efficient since most hypotheses are discarded with minimal computation; 2) is parallelizable; 3) is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis; and 4) its running time depends on the problem at hand, not on the bandwidth of the input. We instantiate the proposed framework for the problem of simultaneously estimating the class, pose, and a noiseless version of a 2D shape in a 2D image.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Apr 2011 18:59:52 GMT  (1943kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2580v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 15 Aug 2011 19:31:24 GMT  (1943kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2580v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CG cs.GR cs.LG", "authors": ["diego rother", "simon sch\\\"utz", "ren\\'e vidal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.2580"}, "pdf": {"name": "1104.2580.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Computational Focus of Attention Mechanism to Process Shapes Efficiently: Theory", "authors": ["Diego Rother", "Simon Sch\u00fctz", "Ren\u00e9 Vidal"], "emails": ["diroth@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This article provides a general mathematical framework for efficiently allocating available computational resources to process the parts of the input that are relevant to solving a perception problem of interest.

In this section, we describe in detail the first of these two parts, the FoAM. Let me give some input and let H = {H1,.) a set of NH hypotheses that are proposed to \"explain\" these input hypotheses. In our problem of interest (formally described in Section 4), the Input I is an image, and each of the hypotheses corresponds to the 2D pose and class of a 2D form in this input image.

automatic systems, it is becoming essential to endow them with a sense of what is worthwhile their attention and what can be safely disregarded. This article presents a general mathematical framework to efficiently allocate the available computational resources to process the parts of the input that are relevant to solve a perceptual problem of interest. By solving a perceptual problem we mean to find the hypothesis H (i.e., the state of the world) that maximizes a function L(H), referred to as the evidence, representing how well each hypothesis \u201cexplains\u201d the input. However, given the large bandwidth of the sensory input, fully evaluating the evidence for each hypothesis is computationally infeasible (e.g., because it would imply checking a large number of pixels). To address this problem we propose a mathematical framework with two key ingredients. The first one is a Bounding Mechanism (BM) to compute lower and upper bounds of the evidence of a hypothesis, for a given computational budget. These bounds are much cheaper to compute than the evidence itself, can be refined at any time by increasing the budget allocated to a hypothesis, and are frequently sufficient to discard a hypothesis. The second ingredient is a Focus of Attention Mechanism (FoAM) to select which hypothesis\u2019 bounds should be refined next, with the goal of discarding non-optimal hypotheses with the least amount of computation.

Sch\u00fctz University of G\u00f6ttingen The proposed framework has the following desirable characteristics: 1) it is very efficient since most hypotheses are discarded with minimal computation; 2) it is parallelizable; 3) it is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis or hypotheses; and 4) its running time depends on the problem at hand, not on the bandwidth of the input. In order to illustrate the general framework, in this article we instantiate it for the problem of simultaneously estimating the class, pose and a noiseless version of a 2D shape in a 2D image. To do this, we develop a novel theory of semidiscrete shapes that allows us to compute the bounds required by the BM. We believe that the theory presented in this article (i.e., the algorithmic paradigm and the theory of shapes) has multiple potential applications well beyond the application demonstrated in this article.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
