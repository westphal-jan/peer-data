One of the outcomes of these papers is that the result of updating a knowledge base K is generally not expressible in the Description Logic used to express K. In this paper we introduce a formula-based approach to this problem, by revisiting some research work on formula-based updates developed in the '80s, in particular the WIDTIO (When In Doubt, Throw It Out) approach. We show that our operator enjoys desirable properties, including that both insertions and deletions according to such operator can be expressed in the DL used for the original KB. Also, we present polynomial time algorithms for the evolution of the instance level knowledge bases expressed in the most expressive Description Logics of the DL-lite family.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Apr 2011 15:19:14 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4053v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["maurizio lenzerini", "domenico fabio savo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.4053"}, "pdf": {"name": "1104.4053.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the evolution of the instance level of DL-Lite knowledge bases", "authors": ["Maurizio Lenzerini", "Domenico Fabio Savo"], "emails": ["@dis.uniroma1.it"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 110 4.40 53v1 [cs.AI] 20 Apr 2"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The descriptions of Logics (DLs) [3] are logic for expressing knowledge bases (KBs) defined by two KB components, namely the TBox, the assertion of general properties of concepts and roles (binary relationships), and the ABox, which represents a series of assertions about individuals who are instances of concepts and roles. It is generally accepted that such logic is well suited to expressing ontologies, with the TBox capturing intensive knowledge of the domain of interest, and the ABox expressing knowledge of the instance level of predicates defined in the TBox. Following this idea, several knowledge representation systems called DL systems have recently been built, methods and tools for managing ontologies expressed in DLs 1 are provided. Notice that numerous DLs have been studied in recent decades with the aim of analyzing the expressiveness of DL language to the complexity of argumentation."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "If L is a DL, then an L-KB K over S is a pair < T > [3], where T, called TBox, is a finite set of intense assertions about S, expressed in L, and A, called ABox, is a finite set of instance assertions, i.e, assertions about individuals, about S. Different DLs allow different types of TBox and / or ABox assertions. In this paper we2 it is not to be confused with the set of DLs examined in [2] that make up the DL-Litebool assertions. It is assumed that ABox assertions are always atomic, i.e. they correspond to soil atoms, and therefore we refrain from referring to L when we talk about ABox assertions."}, {"heading": "3 WIDTIO approach to KB evolution in DLs", "text": "< < < < < < < < < < <"}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We have illustrated a WIDTIO approach to instance-level evolution in DL, and we have presented algorithms in the case of DL-LiteA, id. We plan to continue our work in several directions. First, we will extend the algorithms to the case where the KB contains denial constraints, i.e. restrictions that can be added to DL-LiteA without changing the complexity of all argumentation tasks. The extension is based on the fact that denial constraints behave in a similar way to identification claims regarding KB evolution. Furthermore, we aim to extend our approach to the problem of the evolution of the entire KB, as opposed to the ABox alone. Finally, we will add the concept of the protected part to our approach to model situations in which changes to certain parts of the KB are to be prevented in the application of insertions or deletions."}], "references": [{"title": "Consistent query answers in inconsistent databases", "author": ["Marcelo Arenas", "Leopoldo E.
