A main issue for abstract argumentation systems is the selection of acceptable sets of arguments. Value-based argumentation, as introduced by Bench-Capon (J. Logic Comput. 13, 2003), extends Dung's framework. It takes into account the relative strength of arguments with respect to some ranking representing an audience: an argument is subjectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to some audience, it is objectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to all audiences. Deciding whether an argument is subjectively or objectively accepted, respectively, are computationally intractable problems. In fact, the problems remain intractable under structural restrictions that render the main computational problems for non-value-based argumentation systems tractable. In this paper we identify nontrivial classes of value-based argumentation systems for which the acceptance problems are polynomial-time tractable. The classes are defined by means of structural restrictions in terms of the underlying graphical structure of the value-based system. Furthermore we show that the acceptance problems are intractable for two classes of value-based systems that where conjectured to be tractable by Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 171, 2007).", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Apr 2011 15:22:36 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4290v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["eun jung kim", "sebastian ordyniak", "stefan szeider"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.4290"}, "pdf": {"name": "1104.4290.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Eun Jung Kim", "Sebastian Ordyniak", "Stefan Szeider"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 110 4.42 90v1 [cs.AI] 21 Apr 2Deciding whether an argument is accepted subjectively or objectively are mathematically insoluble problems.

Therefore, we suggest to consider the extended graph structure of the value-based system (recall definition 6 in Section 2.4), which takes such linkages into account.

We have noted the intractability of deciding on subjective or objective acceptance for value-based systems with width of value 2 and width of attack 1, thereby refuting the assumptions indicated by Dunne. It might be interesting to note that our reductions apply even if the attack relationship of the value-based system under consideration forms a directed acyclic graph. On the positive side, we have shown that value-based systems with width of value 2, whose graph structure is split in two, can be solved in polynomial time. These results form a sharp boundary between traceability and revocability of convincing arguments for value-based systems with width of value 2. Furthermore, we have introduced the idea of the extended graph structure of a value-based system and demonstrated that subjective and objective acceptance can be decided in linear time if the construction range structure is limited by graph-based on the structure of the expanded graphs."}, {"heading": "Appendix: Technical proofs", "text": "We assume that such a path (1) is smaller than such a path (1).

Intelligence 177, 1995) has become one of the most active research branches within Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning. A main issue for abstract argumentation systems is the selection of acceptable sets of arguments. Value-based argumentation, as introduced by Bench-Capon (J. Logic Comput. 13, 2003), extends Dung\u2019s framework. It takes into account the relative strength of arguments with respect to some ranking representing an audience: an argument is subjectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to some audience, it is objectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to all audiences. Deciding whether an argument is subjectively or objectively accepted, respectively, are computationally intractable problems. In fact, the problems remain intractable under structural restrictions that render the main computational problems for non-value-based argumentation systems tractable. In this paper we identify nontrivial classes of value-based argumentation systems for which the acceptance problems are polynomial-time tractable. The classes are defined by means of structural restrictions in terms of the underlying graphical structure of the value-based system. Furthermore we show that the acceptance problems are intractable for two classes of value-based systems that where conjectured to be tractable by Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 171, 2007).", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.98 Copyright 2009 Radical Eye Software"}}}
