Such sets of symbols would require superhuman skills to memorize if there were no internal structure that allows the reader to grasp at least approximately the meaning of the character, which is based on radicals and strokes."}, {"heading": "1.1 Radicals", "text": "The CHISE project [8] offers a decomposition of letters to radicals plus some calligraphic strokes. In addition to letters that are exact copies of letters, individual letters can also be radically translated into the word, making this word potentially confusing. Firstly, there are about 214 units called b\u00f9sh\u0435u, which are used to look up a character in a dictionary. For horizontally structured letters, these are often found on the left.Secondly, although there is a larger group of components called b\u00f9ji\u00e0n, which encompass all components, no matter where in the letter they occur. \"Later, they add that they have found 541 such radical letters in a Chinese dictionary. Unicode has encoded the previous 214 in a special character table (see Figure. 1). In the Unihan database provided by the Unicode Consortium, each of the 75.000 characters is encoded as a radical one in this 75,000."}, {"heading": "1.2 Strokes", "text": "Chinese characters are drawn based on a specific repertoire of strokes. < < p = > Stroke = > Points = > Points = > The two tables agree on most of the strokes, with only a few exceptions, which are always combinations of the basic strokes. < p \"Character Description Language [1] is a Wenlin Institute project that aims to graphically describe all Chinese characters by their strokes. < p\" Font Type \"is an XML element with a recursive structure whose leaves are basic calligraphic strokes. < p\" To place a stroke exactly in the ideographic square, the coordinates of the boundary stroke are used, as in the following example: < cdl char = \"4eac\" > < p \"Points = > 128 points = > Points = > Points = > Points = & ltp.\""}, {"heading": "1.3 Going from strokes to radicals to characters", "text": "But there are also \"phonetic\" radicals that purport to have no meaning but indicate pronunciation, and there are also other components in signs that are always derived from graphic elements from the same set of calligraphic strokes. This leads us to the question: \"When we move from the stroke to radicals, components and signs, when does meaning arise?\" In other words, do certain combinations of strokes, with the exception of b\u00f9sh\u00f4u radicals, carry meaning or do they contribute to conveying meaning?"}, {"heading": "1.4 Compound words", "text": "In terms of meaning, there is another semantic layer in the Chinese writing system, namely that of connections. A connection is a group of usually two (but sometimes more) Chinese characters, in which a new meaning emerges that differs from the sequence of individual meanings. A typical example of this is that there is a connection of \"one hundred\" and \"one hundred\" (last name) and means \"farmer.\" Japanese WordNet [6] contains more than 40,000 compound word entries (written as two or more kanji letters).In fact, there are four structural levels of the Chinese writing system: 1. Line; 2. Radical, be it b\u00f9sh\u014du, phonetic or just a graphic component; 3. Characters; 4. Composite words.We can compare this layering with matter: strokes can be compared with elementary particles that form atoms (radicals). Atoms combine in different ways to form molecules (signs) and molecules form composite words ()."}, {"heading": "2 Our model", "text": "To study the Chinese writing system, we use the following model: Let K be the set of all Chinese characters encoded in Unicode, and G be a graph with vertices K. Each k-K contains the following information: 1. the main radio b\u00f9sh\u0171u (information from the Unihan database); 2. characters (information from CDL); 3. one or more meanings in Chinese or Japanese (information from Japanese and Chinese WordNets). Points 1 and 2 are mandatory; point 3 is optional (and depends on the use of a certain character in one of the two languages and on the completeness of the two WordNet databases). In the rest of this section, we describe various marginal schemes that can be added to G, as well as induced weights at edges and vertices."}, {"heading": "2.1 Modeling strokes", "text": "In fact, it is the case that it is a matter of a way in which people move in the most diverse areas of life.

These use special characters Operators can be combined as operators to designate specific geometric assemblies of character pairs or triples () () () and \"DS\" and \"(\"). \""}, {"heading": "2.4 Common components and heaviest characters", "text": "If we call the elements c \u00b2 of the B \u00b2 A components, we can use an approach described in \u00a7 2.2 and say that k \u00b2 K is the common components c1, c2 \u00b2,.., cm \u00b2 B \u00b2 A, always c1 \u00b2, c2 \u00b2,.., cm \u00b2 R (k) \u00b2 R (k \u00b2). Our second edge structure GR on G is the following: two Chinese characters k \u00b2 and k \u00b2 are connected by an edge r (k \u00b2) of the weighted R (k \u00b2), if and only if they contain exactly lywR (k \u00b2), > 0 common components, as defined above. Around each edge r corresponds to a set of common strokes R (r) = {c1,., cwR (k \u00b2). The unit of weight wR is a unit for each common component k \u00b2 and k \u00b2 the common component: wR (k \u00b2)."}, {"heading": "2.5 Components vs. Strokes", "text": "Experiment 3. If (GS, wS) the graph G with edges and weight is derived from strokes and (GR, wgR) from components with generalized weight, measure the similarity of the two graphs. Question 1. Which of the two offers a better decoding of Chinese characters? If we cluster them, do we get the same clusters? Does the additional complexity of GS provide useful information that is not available in GR?"}, {"heading": "2.6 Characters, Compounds and Meaning", "text": "It's not the first time the actress has been linked to a number of high-profile men, with the former TOWIE star recently gushing about her beau in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: 'He's a really nice guy, he's a nice guy, he's a nice guy, he's a nice guy'."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The author thanks: (1) Aizu University and in particular Prof. Michael Cohen for inviting him to spend three months in his laboratory and (2) Richard Cook and Tom Bishop from the Wenlin Institute for the tremendous work they have done in describing Chinese characters and enabling him to use CDL XML data in this paper."}], "references": [{"title": "Wenlin CDL: Character Description Language, Multi- Lingual Computing", "author": ["Bishop", "Tom", "Cook", "Richard"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Chinese character recognition: history, status and prospects", "author": ["Dai", "Ru-Wei", "Liu", "Cheng-Lin", "Xiao", "Bai-Hua"], "venue": "Front.
