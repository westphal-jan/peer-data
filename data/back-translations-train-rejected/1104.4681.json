INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year, the time has come for an agreement to be reached in just a few days."}, {"heading": "2. SPEAKER CHARACTERISTICS IN THE LP RESIDUAL", "text": "Speech signals, like all other signals in the real world, are generated by excitation of a system with source. A simple block diagram (representation of the speech production mechanism) is shown in Figure 1. Vibrations of vocal folds driven by air from the lungs during exhalation are the sound source for speech. As shown in Figure 1, glottal excitation forms the source, and the voice tract forms the system. The philosophy of linear prediction is closely related to the basic language production model. Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) analyzes spectral analysis on short segments of speech with an all-pole modelling restriction [14]. Since language can be modelled as an output of a linear, time-varying system stimulated by a source, LPC analysis captures the information of the voice tract system in relation to the coefficients of the resistor filter that senses the voice tract signal."}, {"heading": "2.1 Computing LP Residual from Speech Signal", "text": "The linear prediction models the output () ns as a linear function of past output and current and past inputs. Since the prediction is made by a linear function, the name linear prediction. Assuming an all-pole model for the vocal tract, the signal () ns can be expressed as a linear combination of past values and some inputs () nu, as shown below. () () nGuknsns p1k + \u2212 = [6) Where G has an amplification factorNow, assuming that the input () nU is unknown, the signal () nS can only be predicted approximately from a linearly weighted sum of past samples. Let us leave this approximation of () nS () n (s) n (s) n (s) n (s) (s) (\u2212 = p 1k) kn (sa) n (s (s (s) n (7) Then the error between the actual value () ns and the predicted value (s) Ds (s) n (situal) (n) signal (8) = n (P)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Feature extraction of LP residual signal", "text": "The MFCC technique uses two types of filters, namely linear filters and logarithmic filters. To capture the phonetically important characteristics of speech, the signal is expressed in the Mel frequency scale, which has a linear frequency response of less than 1000 Hz and a logarithmic response of more than 1000 Hz. Normal speech waveforms can vary from time to time depending on the physical state of the speaker's vocal cords. MFCs are less susceptible to these variations [15]."}, {"heading": "2.3 Motivation to use Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs):", "text": "Since it is our interest to capture global characteristics that correspond to the excitation by God, the low frequency components should be emphasized. To meet this requirement, MFCC is best suited as it emphasizes low frequencies and degrades high frequencies."}, {"heading": "3. PARAMETRIC APPROACHES", "text": "Parametric approaches are model-based approaches. The parameters of the model are estimated using the training feature vectors. It is assumed that the model is suitable to represent the distribution. The most commonly used parametric approaches are GMM and HMM-based approaches."}, {"heading": "3.1 Gaussian Mixture Models", "text": "GMM is a classical parametric method best used to model loudspeaker identities, since Gaussian components have the ability to represent some general loudspeaker-dependent spectral shapes. Gaussian classifiers have therefore been successfully used in several text-independent loudspeaker identification applications, since the approach used by this classifier is similar to the long-term average of spectral characteristics used to represent the average loudspeaker shape. As shown in Figure 3 in a GMM model, the probability distribution of observed data assumes the form given by the following equation [17]. [= M1i ii) x (bp) | x (p \u00b2) Where M is the number of component densities x, x (random vector) x (bi are the component densities and pi are the mixing weights for iiix iiiiiiiii = 1... \u2212 \u2212 iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii2 iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii"}, {"heading": "3.2 Continuous Ergodic Hidden Markov Model for Speaker Recognition", "text": "As shown in Figure 4 in the training phase, one HMM (i.e., the parameters of the model are estimated) is determined for each speaker by means of vectors for training characteristics.The parameters of the HMM are [8] probability distribution for the transition from state i to j at the time.

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Database Used for the Study", "text": "In general, loudspeaker recognition refers to both loudspeaker recognition and loudspeaker verification. Loudspeaker identification is the task of identifying a specific loudspeaker from a series of loudspeakers. The result of loudspeaker verification is either to accept or reject the speaker's claim. In this essay, we consider the identification task for the TIMIT Speaker databases. The TIMIT body of language is designed to provide loudspeaker data for acoustic-phonetic knowledge acquisition and for the development and evaluation of automatic loudspeaker recognition systems. TIMIT contains a total of 6300 sets, 10 sets spoken by each of 630 speakers from eight major dialect regions of the United States. We consider 200 speakers from 630 speakers for speaker recognition. A maximum of 30 seconds of speech data is used for training and at least 1 second of data for the test. In all cases, the voice queries were pre-tested by 16 speakers to demonstrate loudspeaker recognition."}, {"heading": "4.2 Experimental Setup", "text": "The system was implemented in Matlab7 on the Windows XP platform. We used the LP sequence 12 for all experiments. We trained the GMM and HMM models using Gaussian total components such as 4, 8, 16 and 32 for each training, the language duration of 30 seconds is tested using different language durations such as 1 second, 3 seconds and 5 seconds. The same setting was implemented for both GMM and Ergodic HMM."}, {"heading": "5. PERFORMANCE EVALAUATION", "text": "There is no theoretical way to evaluate the performance of the statistical approaches. To evaluate the loudspeaker recognition system, the experiment is performed with a GMM and a 2-state HMM for different numbers of Gaussian components such as 4, 8, 16 and 32. Here, the model is performed with 30 seconds speech duration, LP sequence of 12 and tested at 1 second, 3 seconds and 5 seconds, as shown in Figures 5, 6 and 7, the ergodic HMM for loudspeaker recognition system has exceeded GMM. Experimental results are shown in Table 1. Percentage detection of 2-state ergodic HMM for different Gaussian components such as 4, 8, 16 and 32 appears to increase evenly. The minimum number of Gaussian components to achieve good detection performance appears to be 16, and thereafter the detection performance is minimal."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "The performance of the system for different HMM states shows that it can effectively capture the speaker-specific excitation information. The main objective of this paper was to demonstrate that the excitation information present in the linear prediction for loudspeaker detection can be captured more effectively than GMM. We have made no attempt to optimize the parameters of the feature extraction model and also the decision-making phase. Therefore, the performance of loudspeaker detection can be improved by optimizing the various design parameters."}], "references": [{"title": "Acoustic Phonetics", "author": ["K.N.
