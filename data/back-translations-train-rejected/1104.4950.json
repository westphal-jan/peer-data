SEMANTIC ANNOTATION", "text": "In general, the annotation is defined as the process of adding notes and comments to documents, images, or other resources. In the Web domain, the annotation means that information such as notes, comments, links to source material, and so on must be added to existing Web accessories without altering the originals. This annotation means that it can also be distributed over the network, although it cannot be shared. The annotation process can be manual, automatic, and semi-automatic. Semantic annotation means that machines append understandable metadata to resources. We consider the semantic annotation as an idea of mapping to the entities in the semantic descriptions."}, {"heading": "3. RELATED WORKS", "text": "These tools and systems, called semantic annotation platforms, can be classified based on the type of annotation method they use [12]. There are two primary categories, pattern-based and machine learning, as shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, platforms can use methods from both types of categories, called multi-strategy, to take advantage of the strengths and weaknesses of the methods in each category. Pattern-based approaches can perform pattern inventions or have patterns defined manually. Most of these methods follow the process in which an initial group of units is defined at the beginning and the corpus is scanned to find the patterns that contain the units. New units are discovered, along with new patterns. This process continues recursively until no more units are discovered or the user stops the process. Annotation can also be generated by manual rules to find entities in text models."}, {"heading": "4.

ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "In this section, we present the analytical framework that demonstrates the efficiency of various machine learning applications in accomplishing some of the semantic annotation tasks, which is introduced in Table 1. It attempts to show the relationship between effective machine learning techniques for accomplishing some semantic annotation tasks and the development of the annotation systems.The classification of semantic annotation systems within this framework is based on machine learning approaches, so that there are five classes: \u2022 Supervised Learning \u2022 Unsupervised Learning \u2022 Semi-Supervised Learning \u2022 Active Learning \u2022 Hybrid of semi-supervised Learning and Active LearningIn an extensive and rapidly changing field of research such as semantic annotation, which is itself a cornerstone of the semantic web, it is not possible to review all approaches and tools that are continuously introduced every day."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we present a comprehensive, multi-layered classification of semantic annotation systems. This classification represents almost all of the challenges mentioned in various research. Due to the wide range of areas and dynamic environments in which semantic annotation systems must be performed, we discussed that automation of the annotation process is a critical prerequisite for semantic annotation systems. From this perspective, we presented an analytical framework in relation to these applications. Subsequently, we reviewed and analyzed machine learning applications to solve semantic annotation challenges such as ontology development, scalability, and in particular the automation problem. In this context, some of the annotation systems based on the important characteristics in this area will be reviewed. Results show that different learning approaches have a major impact on solving semantic annotation tasks. While most systems use monitored and unmonitored annotation systems in their methods, further research seems to be needed to reduce the costs of individual systems so that they can be considered partially overlaid."}], "references": [{"title": "The Semantic Web\", The Scientific American", "author": ["T.
