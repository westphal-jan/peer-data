This research presents a case study combining an ontology building methodology and two state-of-the-art Semantic Web platforms namely Protege and Java Jena ontology API for semantic ontology development in e-government. Firstly, a framework adopted from the Uschold and King ontology building methodology is employed to build a domain ontology describing the semantic content of a government service domain. Thereafter, UML is used to semi-formally represent the domain ontology. Finally, Protege and Jena API are employed to create the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) representations of the domain ontology respectively to enable its computer processing. The study aims at: (1) providing e-government developers, particularly those from the developing world with detailed guidelines for practicing semantic content development in their e-government projects and (2), strengthening the adoption of semantic technologies in e-government. The study would also be of interest to novice Semantic Web developers who might used it as a starting point for further investigations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 Apr 2011 16:55:42 GMT  (832kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4966v1", "14 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["jean vincent fonou dombeu", "magda huisman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.4966"}, "pdf": {"name": "1104.4966.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Combining Ontology Development Methodologies and Semantic Web Platforms for E-government Domain Ontology Development", "authors": ["Jean Vincent Fonou-Dombeu", "Magda Huisman"], "emails": ["fonoudombeu@gmail.com", "Magda.Huisman@nwu.ac.za"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "DOI: 10.5121 / ijwest.2011.2202 12One of the most important challenges in e-government is the development of systems that can be easily integrated and interacted to provide seamless services to citizens.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "For the past decade, e-government has been the subject of interest from governments around the world. Governments worldwide expect e-government to improve their internal processes and provide Internet and ICT-based service delivery to citizens, businesses and organizations, requiring the design, implementation and deployment of web-based systems that present current government structures and services online, provide mechanisms for online government interaction with citizens, and facilitate online civic participation in government processes and decisions. This raises the issue of developing heterogeneous government systems of government agencies and agencies that can be easily integrated. Although state-of-the-art engineering techniques, including objective and agile methods, provide adequate solutions for reformized technical integration and interoperability in e-government."}, {"heading": "2. ONTOLOGY LANGUAGES FOR THE SEMANTIC WEB", "text": "The Semantic Web [18] is an evolution of the current Web, which gives meaning to Web content in order to enable its intelligent processing by computers. [19] The meanings of Web content are represented by ontology and formally described in logic-based syntaxes to facilitate its integration and accessibility over the Web. [19] The logic-based description of ontology is done using ontology languages of the Semantic Web such as XML, XML Schema (XMLS), RDF, RDF Schema (RDFS), and OWL. The work presented in this paper uses RDF (S) and OWL, the leading ontology languages of the Semantic Web [6], [19], [20], [21]."}, {"heading": "2.1 RDF(S)", "text": "RDF and RDFS are the first standardized web-based languages [19], [20]. RDF is a data model for describing resources on the Web, whereas RDFS is an improved version of RDF that provides ways to define basic ontological elements such as classes and hierarchy of classes, properties, domains and properties [19], [20]. RDF uses statements in the form of < S, P, O > to represent an ontology. The meaning of an RDF statement is that subject S has the property P with the value O. In an RDF statement, S and P are unified resource identifiers (URIs), while O is either a URI or a literal value [6]."}, {"heading": "2.2 OWL", "text": "OWL is designed to overcome the weak expressiveness of RDF (S) [19], [20], [21]. The expressiveness of RDF (S) is enhanced by OWL with tools for: Description of relationships between classes, definition of properties, cardinality and value constraints of properties, etc. [19], [20]. In practice, semantic web developers do not need to write RDF (S) and / or OWL codes manually; there are several software platforms for the automatic development of RDF (S) and OWL codes. In the next section, more will be devoted to existing software platforms for the ontology of the semantic web."}, {"heading": "3. SOFTWARE PLATFORMS FOR SEMANTIC WEB ONTOLOGY DEVELOPMENT", "text": "To support the vision of the Semantic Web, which makes machine-readable content available on the Web, several software platforms and Application Interfaces (APIs) have been developed that enable the automatic creation and use of RDF (S) and OWL ontologies. Current comparative studies of some of the existing RDF (S) and OWL editing platforms can be found in [21], [22], [23], [27]; these include Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, WebODE, OntoEdit, KAON1, etc. In addition to the software platforms used for issuing RDF (S) and OWL ontologies, there are APIs such as OWL-API [23], Jenaer API [6], Sesame [5], etc., which provide opportunities for persistence storage and query of RDF (S) and OWL ontologies. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and Jena], these are the platforms [5] and Semi-Platforms for both [5]."}, {"heading": "3.1 Prot\u00e9g\u00e9", "text": "Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is an open source platform developed at Stanford Medical Informatics. It provides an internal structure called model [23] for displaying ontologies and an interface for displaying and manipulating the underlying model. The Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 model is used to represent ontological elements such as classes, properties or slots, property features such as facets and constraints and instances, and the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 graphical user interface can be used to display classes and instances as well as properties and constraints of property facets. In addition, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 has a library of different tabs for accessing, visualizing graphically and quering ontologies. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 can currently be used to load, edit and store ontologies in various formats such as XML, RDF, UML and OWL [23]."}, {"heading": "3.2 Jena API", "text": "The Jena platform supports various database management systems such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and so on; it also provides various tools, including RDQL query language, a parser for RDF / XML, I / O modules for output of RDF / XML, etc. [6].

BACKGROUND ON THE USE OF SEMANTIC WEB", "text": "In recent years, the number of those able to reform has multiplied."}, {"heading": "5. ONTOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Ontology Development Methodologies", "text": "Currently, there is no universal definition of ontology in the literature. Ontology is generally defined as an explicit specification of conceptualization [24], i.e. as a model of the realm of the real world such as medicine, geographical information system, physics, e-government, and so on; explicitly represented by existing objects, concepts, entities, and relationships between them. [23] The above definition of ontology shows that the development of an ontology for a particular realm of knowledge could be a complex and challenging task [23], especially for a complex realm such as the public administration system. Therefore, ontology developers need suitable methods to guide them in building an ontology that characterizes a particular realm of knowledge. To this end, a considerable amount of research has been conducted in the field of ontology engineering to develop appropriate methods for ontology development. Detailed comparative studies of these methodologies are provided in ontology [25] [27]."}, {"heading": "5.2 Phases of Ontology Development", "text": "A rigorous development process for ontology buildings requires the use of its development methods and platforms. A methodology mainly establishes guidelines for specifying, conceptualizing, formalizing, and implementing ontology [27]. The specification phase defines the goals and roles of the intended ontology and the people who will use it. During the conceptualization phase, a conceptual or domain ontology is built. In its simple presentation, a conceptual or domain ontology is a graph in which the vertices are objects, concepts, and entities of the domain, and the edges are lines that connect pairs of vertices with each other and represent the relationships between the constituents of the domain. The formalization phase Javain or domain ontology is transformed into its semi-formal representation; this can be done either in the description logic [29] or in the UML formalisms."}, {"heading": "6. APPLICATION", "text": "This section presents a case study on the development of the ontology of government domains."}, {"heading": "6.1 Presentation of the Government Service Domain", "text": "The area of government services used in this study is the area of monitoring development projects in developing countries. In fact, in developing countries as well as in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), almost every government department is somehow involved in the implementation of a programme aimed at improving the well-being of its population. These programmes are commonly referred to as development projects and include infrastructure development, water supply and sanitation, education, rural development, health care, development of ICT infrastructure, etc. Therefore, an application linking all activities related to the implementation of development projects in an SSA country could bring huge benefits. For example, such a web application would improve project monitoring and evaluation, and provide transparency, efficiency and better provision to the population. In a previous study [28] we have developed a domain OntoDPM for such an application. In the following sections, the methods and platforms used are described."}, {"heading": "6.2 OWL Representation of the OntoDPM Domain Ontology", "text": "In fact, it is a way in which people are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "6.3 RDF Representation of the OntoDPM Domain Ontology", "text": "We remember that RDF is a semantic Web language for displaying resources on the Web. < f = > Resource is any information that can be accessed over the Web. < f = > Resource is a property that describes the resource and an object is a value of the property. / A subject is a resource that can be referenced on the Web; a predicate is a property that describes the resource and an object is a value of the property. Therefore, the Arc is the property that describes the resource and the nodes on both sides of the Arc. / O > describes the same information and shapes of an RDF chart or statement [6]. An RDF diagram or statement is graphically represented with two nodes and an Arc; where the Arc is the property that describes the resource and the value of the property on both sides of the Arc. \"In the light of the above, the RDF syntax represents each class of an ontology as a resource that represents properties with Wsenity."}, {"heading": "7. DISCUSSION", "text": "The study discussed semantic web ontology languages and software platforms for ontology development; a domain ontology was built using a framework adopted by Uschold and King [17] ontology building methodology [28]; a semi-formal representation of domain ontology was performed using UML formalism; and two state-of-the-art semantic web platforms for ontology development, including Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and Java Jena API, were used to generate the machine-readable version of domain ontology in OWL and RDF, respectively. It should be noted that Jenas API provides some useful features for ontology use; in fact, the Jena API provides the RDQL language for storage and query with various database management systems such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle [6] etc., with database storage and query being at the center of this research and the RDF's future work."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSION", "text": "The study reviews the literature and points out that the current research, which focuses on semantic web development in e-government, does not refer to an existing ontology development methodology when reporting on the e-government specific ontology models they develop, nor to an ontology-based solution for the integration and interoperability of e-government services they propose. Furthermore, the study points out that the current research does not provide detailed guidelines for the development of ontology models for the government sector using available open-source semantic web platforms. All these factors do not facilitate the repeatability of the various specific ontology models being developed in the e-government sector, nor do they strengthen the adoption of semantic technologies in the e-government sector. As a solution, the study has developed a state ontology that uses a framework borrowed from the ontology of Uschold and King, and this ontology building methodology and two leading ontology semantic web development platforms, namely the Java framework and the Java PI, are clear steps to promote the development of these ontology building platforms."}], "references": [{"title": "XML Schema Design and Management for E-government Data Interoperability", "author": ["T.

In recent years, Semantic Web technologies based on ontology have emerged as promising solutions to the above engineering problems. However, current research practicing semantic development in e-government does not focus on the application of available methodologies and platforms for developing government domain ontologies. Furthermore, only a few of these researches provide detailed guidelines for developing semantic ontology models from a government service domain. This research presents a case study combining an ontology building methodology and two state-of-the-art Semantic Web platforms namely Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and Java Jena ontology API for semantic ontology development in e-government. Firstly, a framework adopted from the Uschold and King ontology building methodology is employed to build a domain ontology describing the semantic content of a government service domain. Thereafter, UML is used to semi-formally represent the domain ontology. Finally, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and Jena API are employed to create the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) representations of the domain ontology respectively to enable its computer processing. The study aims at: (1) providing egovernment developers, particularly those from the developing world with detailed guidelines for practicing semantic content development in their e-government projects and (2), strengthening the adoption of semantic technologies in e-government. The study would also be of interest to novice Semantic Web developers who might used it as a starting point for further investigations.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
