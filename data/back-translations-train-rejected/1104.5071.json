The main new result is our demonstration of how to use a behavior's or process' $k$-order statistics to build a stochastic process that has those same $k$-order stationary statistics but possesses different, deliberately designed, $(k+1)$-order statistics if desired. Such a model realizes a \"complexification\" of the process or behavior which a defender can use to monitor whether an attacker is shaping the behavior. By deliberately introducing designed $(k+1)$-order behaviors, the defender can check to see if those behaviors are present in the data. We also develop constructs for source codes that respect the $k$-order statistics of a process while encoding covert information. One fundamental consequence of these results is that certain types of behavior analyses techniques come down to an {\\em arms race} in the sense that the advantage goes to the party that has more computing resources applied to the problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Apr 2011 04:12:47 GMT  (441kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5071v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["valentino crespi", "george cybenko", "annarita giani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.5071"}, "pdf": {"name": "1104.5071.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Attacking and Defending Covert Channels and Behavioral Models", "authors": ["Valentino Crespi", "George Cybenko", "Annarita Giani"], "emails": ["vcrespi@calstatela.edu.", "gvc@dartmouth.edu.", "agiani@eecs.berkeley.edu."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In this case, there is only one case in which the perpetrators are able to kill themselves."}, {"heading": "A.

A SIMPLE ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE", "text": "To illustrate these concepts, let us consider a simple binary observability with values of 0 and 1. It is assumed that these observables are irrelevant to the normal operation of the underlying system and its semantics (01 = 01 = 01 = 01 = 01 = 01 statistics). For example, the observables between arrival times or unused packet heads could be quantified. Suppose that the 1-order statistics of these observables are r0 > 0 and r1 > 0 with r0 + r1 = 1. This means that the relative frequency of 0's and 1's in behavior is respectively r0 and r1. Let's assume that an attacker has estimated these probabilities and tries to exfiltrate messages while respecting these probabilities. This is possible and, later in this paper, we will verify standard source coding ideas that allow the attacker to efficiently create such codes. In fact, if the messages to be sent are binary and Bernoulli messages with encrypted H (like prip = 1 and then there are)."}, {"heading": "R \u2217 P = R and P \u2217 1 = 1", "text": "In this simple case, there are two easy-to-identify solutions, namely PB = 1 \u0445 R and PD = I (3), where I is the 13 x 13 identity matrix; the reader can easily verify that these two matrices meet the two required matrix equations; this construct is simple for 1 gram, but becomes more complex for general k-grams, as shown below. Furthermore, P\u03b1 = \u03b1PB + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) PD is also a solution for each 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1. While PB defines a Bernoulli process and PD describes a completely detached Markov chain with an infinite number of fixed distributions, P\u03b1 defines a Markov chain that is irreducible, aperiodic and not a Bernoulli process for each 0 < \u03b1 < < < 1.

in network traffic analysis and covert channel detection. The main new result is our demonstration of how to use a behavior\u2019s or process\u2019 k-order statistics to build a stochastic process that has those same k-order stationary statistics but possesses different, deliberately designed, (k + 1)order statistics if desired. Such a model realizes a \u201ccomplexification\u201d of the process or behavior which a defender can use to monitor whether an attacker is shaping the behavior. By deliberately introducing designed (k + 1)-order behaviors, the defender can check to see if those behaviors are present in the data. We also develop constructs for source codes that respect the k-order statistics of a process while encoding covert information. One fundamental consequence of these results is that certain types of behavior analyses techniques come down to an arms race in the sense that the advantage goes to the party that has more computing resources applied to the problem.
