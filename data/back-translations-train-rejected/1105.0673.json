Linguistic Style Accommodation in Social Media", "abstract": "The psycholinguistic theory of communication accommodation accounts for the general observation that participants in conversations tend to converge to one another's communicative behavior: they coordinate in a variety of dimensions including choice of words, syntax, utterance length, pitch and gestures. In its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported exclusively through small-scale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus, challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also from the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length restriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design that was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to occur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we develop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its effects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset specifically developed for this task. This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic style accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale, real world setting. Furthermore, when investigating concepts such as stylistic influence and symmetry of accommodation, we discover a complexity of the phenomenon which was never observed before. We also explore the potential relation between stylistic influence and network features commonly associated with social status.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 May 2011 20:00:05 GMT  (609kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0673v1", "Talk slides available atthis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "Talk slides available atthis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["cristian danescu-niculescu-mizil", "michael gamon", "susan dumais"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.0673"}, "pdf": {"name": "1105.0673.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Mark My Words!

CONVERSATIONAL DATA", "text": "As discussed in Section 1, Twitter is a good environment for our study, not only because of its fertility in dyadic interactions, but also because it presents new challenges to the theory of communication accommodation in terms of robustness. On the basis of this resource, Ritter et al. [36] builds the largest conversation corpus available to Twitter, which consists of 1.3 million conversations between 300,000 users. We refer to this corpus as conversation catalog A. Despite its size, this corpus represents some major drawbacks in terms of the purpose of this paper. First, it has low conversation density per pair of converting users: on average only 4.3 conversations per user; this is not enough to model the linguistic style of each couple individually (as proposed by the accommodation framework in this paper and described in detail in Section 5). Also, more than half of the conversations of the pairs of users in this dataset have only unidirectional interaction, i.e. one of the users never writes on the other."}, {"heading": "4. MEASURING LINGUISTIC STYLE", "text": "Miller [28] shows that style and theme are processed differently in the brain. Distinction between the two is important in our study of linguistic style accommodation. To measure style and avoid confusion with topic, we follow a psycholinguistic methodology used in a variety of applications, known as the LIWC Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) method.LIWC [34] measures word usage in psychologically significant categories (e.g. articles, auxiliary verbs, positive emotions) using over 60 such categories and dictionaries of words that relate to each category. This method has been used in a variety of applications (summarized in [38]), including the identification of social relationships, mental health and individual traits such as gender, age and relative status. More importantly, LIWC is the basis of all recent work on linguistic style accommodation [32, 39, 14] to which we want to establish a connection."}, {"heading": "5. PROBABILISTIC FRAMEWORK", "text": "This section introduces a probabilistic framework that can model the phenomenon of accommodation, and defines such a framework taking into account the desirable characteristics discussed in Section 1: comparability, expressivity and purity. Although it is suitable for any type of conversation data and style dimensions, we use the term \"tweet\" to match the rest of the paper."}, {"heading": "5.1 Stylistic cohesion", "text": "We start by addressing the more general phenomenon of stylistic cohesion. It reflects the intuition that tweets that belong to the same conversation are stylistically closer than tweets that are not. Cohesion is defined by comparing the probability that a stylistic dimension in tweets that are part of a conversation is more likely to be shown in tweets. If the former corresponds to the stylistic dimension, it means that the distribution of the stylistic dimension is the same whether tweets are part of a conversation or not. If the former is larger than the latter, it means that tweets in a conversation tend to \"match\" in terms of the stylistic dimension. If the former corresponds to the stylistic dimension, it means that tweets in a conversation tend to be \"at odds\" with respect to the stylistic dimension. Formally, this means that tweets in a certain dimension C are the measure of stylistic cohesion that is likely to be expressed by the following probable expression Coverse (TC): > (C), where \u2212 P is the R, where R is likely to be expressed by the following probable expression Coverse (TC)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Stylistic accommodation", "text": "When defining a probabilistic framework for linguistic-style accommodation, it is important to control the effects of the accommodation in the background (and to fulfil the purity requirements introduced in Section 1), by measuring the accommodation separately for each user pair and taking into account the distinctive temporal character of the accommodation: a user can only accommodate his interlocutor after receiving his input, eliminating the concern that confusion with similarity effects in the background, such as homophily, would not be expected to result in differences within a single pair depending on whether one or the other user initiates a conversational turn in a pair. Therefore, for a given5The rehearsal room to be considered during this work, the goal is to measure a number of possible ordered tweet pairs. A pair of users a and b engaging in a conversation, whether the use of a stylistic dimension C in the original tweet (of the user a) increases the probability of this stylistic dimension in the response."}, {"heading": "5.3 Stylistic influence and symmetry", "text": "An important property of the way Acc is defined is its asymmetry: the adaptation of user b to user a in the stylistic dimension C potentially differs from the adaptation of user a to user b in the same stylistic dimension C. The concept of stylistic influence is self-evident: I (a, b) (C), Acc (a, b) (c) \u2212 Acc (b, a) (4) for a particular stylistic dimension C. If I assume (a, b) (C) > 0, we can say that b matches more with a on C than with b on a.A related concept is the adaptation symmetry (discussed in section 2), which is linked to the comfort scale in the following way. Since b matches with a (a, b) (A, b) (C) > 0, we have \u2022 symmetry if Acc (b, a) > 0, bits in the response to Defit < but not the Acetric (a), but the Acetric (if a), the Acetric (if a) > 0."}, {"heading": "6. EMPIRICAL VALIDATION", "text": "Equipped with the probabilistic framework presented in the previous section, we proceed here with an empirical validation of the accommodation phenomenon on the conversation data described in Section 3. As discussed earlier, this setting is fundamentally different from all other circumstances under which the theory of communication accommodation has been validated, and therefore calls into question its robustness."}, {"heading": "6.1 Validation of stylistic cohesion", "text": "The stylistic cohesion model described in Section 5.1 does not distinguish between users and can therefore be applied directly to conversation data set A (introduced in Section 3). To show that cohesion is reflected in our data, we estimate the two probabilities involved in (1) as follows: We estimate the first probability as a fraction of all phrases in which both tweets have a C: P dimension. To estimate the second probability, we first construct a series of \"fake phrases\" by randomly matching tweets from the entire conversation data."}, {"heading": "6.2 Validation of stylistic accommodation", "text": "In fact, it is that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able, that we are able to achieve our goals, and that we are able to achieve our goals."}, {"heading": "6.3 Stylistic influence and symmetry", "text": "In fact, it is a purely reactionary project, with the interests of the people at the heart of it."}, {"heading": "6.4 Relation to social status", "text": "(c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c (c) (c (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c (c) (c (c) (c) (c (c (c) (c) (c) (c (c (c) c (c) c (c (c) c (c) c (c (c) c (c (c) c (c (c) c) c (c (c) c (c) c (c) c (c (c) c (c) c (c (c) c (c (c) c (c) c) c (c) c (c (c) c (c (c) c (c) c (c (c) c (c) (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c (c) (c (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) c (c) (c) (c (c) (c"}, {"heading": "7. RELATED WORK", "text": "Much of the research in the field of understanding social media focuses on the network relationships between users, and more recently, this mode of working has been complemented by a comprehensive analysis of the content of posts and structural relationships between posters. In an early study combing through these two dimensions of analysis, Paolillo [33] was confronted with linguistic variations associated with strong and weak connections in an early Internet chat relay system. Gilbert and Karahalios [10] linked the strength of friendship relationships on Facebook to various linguistic traits such as intimacy words, positive and negative emotions. Eisenstein et al. [8] investigated the role of geographical variations in language in Twitter and Kiciman to investigate the extent to which differences in language models of Twitter posts (measured by perplexity) were measured."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we have shown that the hypothesis of linguistic-style accommodation can be confirmed in real life, large sets of data sets of Twitter conversations. We have developed a probabilistic framework that allows us to measure accommodation and, importantly, to distinguish between the effects of homophily-style accommodation and thematic accommodation. We have also shown how this framework allows us to formalize and investigate the notions of stylistic influence and asymmetrical adaptation. It is important to stress that our results are far from obvious, as Twitter is a medium in which the phenomenon was previously observed. Its novelty stems not only from its size, but also from the wide variety of social relationship types, from the unreal nature of conversations, from the limitation of the 140-character length and from a design that was originally not aimed at conversations at all. This work shows that accommodation is robust enough to emerge under these new constraints, from the fact that we believe this line of research is profoundly embedded in human behavior."}, {"heading": "9.

observation that participants in conversations tend to converge to one another\u2019s communicative behavior: they coordinate in a variety of dimensions including choice of words, syntax, utterance length, pitch and gestures. In its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported exclusively through smallscale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus, challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also from the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length restriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design that was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to occur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we develop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its effects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset specifically developed for this task. This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic style accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale, real world setting. Furthermore, when investigating concepts such as stylistic influence and symmetry of accommodation, we discover a complexity of the phenomenon which was never observed before. We also explore the potential relation between stylistic influence and network features commonly associated with social status.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
