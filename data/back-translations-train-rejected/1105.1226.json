Introduction", "text": "The design and development of English-Lithuanian-English (ELE) dictionary lexicontool and lexicon database management system (DMS) for MT is designed to support two main requirements: to be open to the user and to describe many more attributes of language parts than regular dictionaries required for MT. Currently, the lexicon is designed to support all parts of the language for Lithuanian and English languages. In this way, it is possible to extend the same database for other language pairs as well. The problem of polysemy is the addition of an additional table between two tables linking different translations of the word in the target language. Translations for the same words are listed in descending priority in both directions. In this way, it is possible to ensure that even if the translation will not be very accurate, the user will be able to choose the appropriate words themselves. An opportunity to include additional contexts for the vocabulary to be translated first, according to the vocabulary to the highest priority to be chosen."}, {"heading": "2.

Conceptual linguistic structure of lexicological database model", "text": "There is no theoretical background information regarding the conceptual structure of the lexical data model (Melamed 1998). The basic requirements associated with the functionality of the CBT system are not sufficient; we must maintain the conjugations, the declarations, the numbers and the other attributes."}, {"heading": "4. Multilingual Lexicon design and database management tools", "text": "We have chosen a very flexible way of implementing our lexicon (Barisevi ius, ernys2004). Since we define our queries to the data with SQL (Standard Query Language), so that the exact DMS is not essential (we use MySql). Using DMS makes the lexicon easy to change: add new attributes, delete or change names or types, etc. It is possible to extend the same database to other human languages as well. Since MySql can store up to 2 GB of data, we no longer need to worry about volumes. An ongoing test with a database of 20 million words and retrieval of the first word took 0.03 seconds, which was longer due to the connection to the database. The retrieval time of the following searches was less than 0.01 seconds. We considered the domain option for nouns, so the user can select the priority of searching for words in a particular domain."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "The English-Lithuanian-English Dictionary Dictionary Dictionary Tool and the Dictionary Database Management System for the MT are geared towards two main requirements: openness to the user and description of many more attributes of the language parts than a normal dictionary required for the MT. Java and MySql are used as programming languages to implement the design tool and / or the lexicon database, which makes it easy to use this system on the Internet. The system can be run on various operating systems supporting Java Virtual Machine. Currently, only one lexicographer can work on the system at the same time, but the import (merging two dictionaries into one) is underway. Research work is being carried out in accordance with the national program \"Lithuanian Language in the Information Society for the years 2005-2006 for the development of Lithuanian language technologies, including computer-assisted translation.\" The tool was dismantled in the DWS Dictionary Writing System on September 2004, on the 6th of October 2004, and at the University of Brno on the 6th of October 2004."}], "references": [{"title": "Language processing and Multilingual communication: Lithuanian case", "author": ["Tamulynas", "Bronius"], "venue": "In: Proceedings of the first Baltic Conf.
