Introduction", "text": "Cell formation has established itself as a production strategy in the implementation of cellular manufacturing and consists of the division of the business into different manufacturing cells, each dedicated to processing a family of similar sub-types. Group Technology (GT), as defined by Burbidge, is the management philosophy that believes that similar processes should be handled similarly (CM), is the application of cell formations as a problem of cell formation (CF), so that one or more sub-families can be processed within a single machine group and dedicate themselves to the production of a family of parts. CM has proven to be a methodology to reduce production time in processes while maintaining flexibility for new products. Potential benefits include reductions in material handling, setup times, throughput times and an increase in productivity and quality."}, {"heading": "2. Performance Measure", "text": "Grouping efficiency was first proposed by Chandrasekharan and Rajagopolan (1989). It includes both machine utilization and movement between cells and is defined as the weighted sum of the two functions \u03b71 and \u03b72. Grouping efficiency (\u03b7) is a weighted average of two functions \u03b71 and \u03b72.) 5...

(blocks diagonally-off in the elements of the number of total blocks diagonally-off in the zeros of the number 2 and \u03b72.) r is a weighting factor ranging from zero to one (0 < r < 1) and its value is determined depending on the size of the matrix. A higher value of grouping efficiency is intended to indicate a better grouping."}, {"heading": "3. Overview of Self Organizing Map Learning Algorithm", "text": "Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computer algorithms inspired by the functioning of the nervous system of the human brain that are able to learn and generalize from data. This learning process can be described as supervised or unsupervised learning. In the supervised learning process, ANN is shown several input-output patterns during the training, which allow the trained ANN to generalize based on the training data and correctly classify the output patterns based on new inputs (Jain et al., 1996). The SOMalgorithm is based on unsupervised learning, which means that the desired output is not a priori known. The goal of the learning process is not to make predictions, but to classify data according to their similarity. In the neural network architecture Kohonen proposed, 1998), the classification is carried out by plotting the data into n dimensions."}, {"heading": "4. Visual Decipherable Clustering Approach using Self Organizing Map Method-An", "text": "Example A 1010 Size Matrix was artificially created by us (Problem No. 1 of Table 1) to demonstrate the cell formation of machine parts by means of visual decryptable clustering using our proposed SOM methodology. SOM methodology was implemented by means of Matlab programming using Somtoolbox and obtained the results of Umatrix, component layers (Figure 1), PC projection (Figure 2) as well as histograms and scatter diagrams (Figure 3). Results for problem No. 1 of Table 1 are discussed below to generate the cell formation of machine parts. The block diagonal shape (Table 2) of cell formation for problem No. 1 resulted from the output information of clustering of SOM. Details of clustering machine parts for machine parts matrix of problem No. 1 are discussed below."}, {"heading": "4.1 Unified distance matrix (Umatrix)", "text": "The U-matrix enables 2D visualization of multivariate data using code vectors of the SOM as the data source. At the end of the learning process, it is derived by using properties of topological relationships between neurons. This algorithm generates a matrix in which each component is a distance measure between two adjacent neurons, so we can visualize any multilayered datasets in a two-dimensional representation. Figure 1 shows a representation of a U-matrix calculation for a 1012 2D hexagonal SOM. Through the U-matrix, we can detect topological relationships between neurons and input data structure. High values in the U-matrix represent a boundary region between clusters, and low values represent a high degree of similarities between neurons in that region, clusters. This can be a visual task when we use a color scheme."}, {"heading": "4.2 Component Planes (CP)", "text": "For this work, we have taken a gray-scaled SOM color for each variable (Fig. 1). The emerging patterns of data distribution on the SOM grid (Kohonen, 2001) can be realized through this CP. This can also detect correlations between variables. By looking only at the colored pattern for each CP, the contribution of each individual to SOM differentiation can be easily recognized."}, {"heading": "4.3 Visual Inspection of SOM", "text": "The visual inspection of the SOM uses the U matrix in the upper left corner, then the component layers and the unit label in the lower right as in Figure 1. The maps are connected to adjacent hexagonal nodes of size 1012 by adjusting the observed machine operations ('1').The CP is used to visualize the various input variables representing the machine operations ('1') that are identified from the density of color shadings in the node network for each CP card. '1' and '0' correspond to a darker shading and lighter shading, and even a partial correlation of the CP can be identified by inspecting the grayscale representation from the grid nodes. Each figure in Figure 1, the hexagon in a specific position, corresponds to the same card unit, but in the U matrix there are additional hexagons between all pairs of adjacent card units. Thus, the map unit in the upper left corner has low values for 1, the hexagon in a specified position, m3, m5, m3, m3, and m3."}, {"heading": "4.4 Principle Component Projection in SOM Map", "text": "In Figure 2, a principal component projection is projected onto the binary machine part dataset and applied to the map. SOM grid is projected onto the same subspace. Adjacent map units are linked with lines. Color chart is created by scattering a grayscale color map onto the projection. Distance matrix information is extracted from the U matrix and modified by knowledge of zero hit units (interpolative units). Finally, three sualizations are displayed: the color code with cluster information and the number of hits in each unit, the projection and the labels. Blue, green and red, orange correspond to the top and bottom of the Umatrix of the map, thus extracting two cluster informations.Where p1 (blue color) was extracted with two hits, p2 is similar to p1 and in reality p1. Part p3 (red color) is extracted with 6 hits and p4, p6, p7, p8, p8 and p8 are a color (single)."}, {"heading": "4.5 Scatter Plots and Histograms", "text": "Figure 3 shows the scatter plots and histograms of all variables in the machine part incidence matrix. The original data points are located in the upper triangle, the prototype values of the map in the lower triangle and the histograms in the diagonal: black for the dataset and red for the prototype values of the map. The color coding of the parts has been copied from the map (from the BMU of each part), the variable values have been denoralized."}, {"heading": "4.6 Machine-Part Cell formation", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to put itself at the top of the list."}, {"heading": "4.7 Analysis of Visual decipherable Clustering of cell formation using SOM", "text": "For problem # 1 dataset (Table 1), Figure 1 shows the U-matrix at the top left, then component layers and map labels at the bottom right. Twelve figures are connected by the position: in each figure, the hexagon corresponds to the same card unit at a certain position. In the U-matrix, there are additional hexagons between all pairs of adjacent card units. For example, the card unit in the upper left corner has low values for m1, m3, m9, m10 and relatively high values for m2, m4, m7, m8. The label with the card unit is part and from the U-matrix you can see that the unit is very close to its neighbors."}, {"heading": "5. Computational Result", "text": "The selected matrices range from 75 to 3520 and include both well-structured and unstructured matrices. Matrix sizes and their sources are presented in Table 3. We compare the grouping efficiency achieved by our SOM algorithm with the best grouping effects achieved by the seven different approaches (Goncalves and Resende, 2004), which provide the best results found in the literature for the ten problems used for comparison. The experimental test was performed on a PC running a Windows XP with Intel \u00ae dual-core 3.0 GHz processor, the algorithm was coded in Matlab programming, the test results are presented in Table 3. In Annex B (Figure 4) we present the block diagonal matrices found in Table 3 after executing the SOM algorithm for the proposed problems. (The test results are presented in Table 3) are the best values for the suggested SOM-3 algorithms."}, {"heading": "6. Concluding Remarks", "text": "A new and novel approach to the extraction of machine cells and sub-families was presented, proposing a visual decoding of the industrial cell formation aiming at an industrial cell formation using self-organizing map algorithms. (The algorithms achieved solutions at least as good as those found in the literature. For 70% of the problems, the algorithm improved the previous solutions in some cases by up to 11%. Work can be expanded further in the future by improving production data such as operating sequence, uptime, arrangements and dynamic manufacturing etc. in relation to a generalized manufacturing environment.
