INTRODUCTION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "1.1 Background and Motivation", "text": "The Web has revolutionized the way we search for information, covering areas as diverse as education, entertainment, business, and even health. It has become a publishing medium, a global information repository, and a global electronic market. From a user's perspective, the Internet is primarily a source of web pages. Nevertheless, there is much more to the Web than HTML pages. Much of its content lies in databases behind the Web. This content, the hidden Web, is accessible only through Web forms or through specific Web services. It is estimated that the hidden Web contains orders of magnitude more data than the visible Web. However, despite its provision of structured data, it is not obvious how to access this data through a machine that uses this wealth of information, Web forms need to be found and filled in, and the answers requested need to be analyzed and understood. Through the medium of this medium, we show the latest research trends in the field of the hidden Web and tell the story of various early successes."}, {"heading": "1.2 Goals", "text": "The overarching objective of this tutorial is to show how all these different trends can be used for data management. As an example, let us take the scientific field. Interdisciplinary research has aroused enormous interest in recent years, as there is a growing need for computer scientists to work across disciplines, which has led to a significant development of techniques and standards that use computational principles to solve challenging real-world problems in specific areas, proposing new theories as needed. In the last ten years, a large part of this research has taken place in the scientific field. Accordingly, the management of scientific data has become an exciting interdisciplinary field of study. Furthermore, in this age of globalization, it is essential to share information with communities of scientists and related professionals from around the world via the Web. Therefore, we illuminate new methods of scientific data management on the Web. Along the way, we illustrate the various research questions in these areas that have not yet been answered."}, {"heading": "1.3 Outline", "text": "This tutorial is divided into three parts, each focusing on one aspect of scientific data management: the first part focuses on the hidden web (also known as the deep web or invisible web) and explains how it can be used to store and retrieve scientific information; the second part focuses on XML data management along with domain-specific markup languages (DSMLs), especially with regard to modeling and extracting scientific data; and the third part presents the details of the semantic web with a focus on its usefulness for managing scientific data."}, {"heading": "2. SCIENTIFIC DATA MANAGEMENT", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 The Hidden Web", "text": "These forms are typically interfaces to databases stored on web servers that are not normally directly accessible, one reason being that the site owner wishes to retain control over access to the information. Some hidden websites are \"yellow pages,\" services, and other types of directories; others are library catalogs, weather forecasting services, geo-localization services, commercial product catalogs, or administrative sources such as the U.S. Census bureaucracy database. As an example in the field of scientific data management, let us consider the following task: Retrieve all articles published by C\u00e9dric Villani. This information is most likely available from the interface network, but a classic web crawler would need to research a large number of documents and then use some heuristics or classification techniques to determine the relevant ones."}, {"heading": "2.2 XML and DSMLs", "text": "With the continued growth of XML-based data sources, especially in scientific applications, the ability to manage collections of XML documents is becoming more and more important [7]. In such applications, it is useful to understand the reasoning process of domain experts, especially when modeling and considering data. Modeling XML documents that are semi-structured requires finer details than unstructured (text) documents and fully structured documents. XML allows the presentation of semi-structured and hierarchical data that not only contain the values of individual elements, but also the relationships between data elements. Due to the inherent flexibility of XML, in structure and semantics, XML documents are significantly different from structured data and text mining."}, {"heading": "2.3 Semantic Web Technologies", "text": "To this end, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed the knowledge representation formalisms RDF [18] and OWL [17]. These formalisms are based on XML, but go beyond that by specifying semantic relationships between entities and even logical limitations for them. A collection of world knowledge in these formalisms is commonly referred to as ontology [12]. In this tutorial, we first give an introduction to semantic knowledge representations and ontologies in general. We also explain the knowledge representation formalisms RDFS and OWL, their syntax and semantics. We explain the vision and applications of the Semantic Web project. We then show how the Semantic Web can be used for scientific data management. We introduce various existing setic resources for scientific data."}, {"heading": "3. CHALLENGES", "text": "We highlight some of the challenging topics that give rise to current research questions in these areas. In the area of the hidden Internet, while there are techniques to derive the type of input parameters and output data of a web, it is still difficult to obtain the exact semantics of a service, especially when it comes to dependencies between the form fields."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This tutorial would show that developments in the areas of the hidden web, semantic web, XML and DSML have influenced the current state of the web by improving the way different computer applications and services communicate, and by identifying relevant information, especially in scientific fields. Most of the data on the web is so unstructured that only people can understand it. However, the volume of data is so large that only machines can process it. This paradox underlines the importance of techniques - between the extremes: semistructured languages such as XML, the semantic web and the hidden web. This tutorial is an invitation to researchers to use these technologies on the one hand - and to contribute to these developments on the other. We believe that there is exciting research potential to bridge the various new developments on the web."}, {"heading": "5.
