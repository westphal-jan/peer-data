The table calculated in [22] is complete, but its completeness is guaranteed by manual verification of all geometric configurations fulfilling the table. Besides these two works, very little attention has been paid to this natural approach in the literature on composition tables. We think that a systematic investigation is necessary to discover both the strong and weak points of this approach. We implemented the basic algorithm for several well-known qualitative calculations, including the interval algebra, INDU, OPRAm for m = 1-4 and RCC-8. Our experiments suggest that the proposed method for calculation of the Qi region is very good, but not based on Qi calculation."}], "references": [{"title": "An interval-based representation of temporal knowledge", "author": ["J.F.
