This means that after a certain initial capital, speculators never go into debt and get a profit if a sufficiently long sequence of projections like (23) exists. We modify the strategy given in section 3.1 to a defensive strategy. Let K0 > 0 be an initial capital of speculators. Define Mi = Ki \u2212 1 is the capital of speculators in step i \u2212 1 and it is a parameter like: 0 \u2264 1 \u2264 1. As usual, we assume that all prices are such a scaled capital that 0 \u2264 Si \u2212 1 = S0.Speculator's capital by step is equal to toKi = Ki \u2212 1 + Deni.

Using calibrated predictions to construct short-term trading strategies on the stock exchange looks very natural. In this essay, we construct such strategies and conduct numerical experiments.These experiments show a positive return on six major Russian stocks, and on two stocks we achieve a profit, even if transaction costs are subtracted.In order to construct trading strategies, we develop a more general concept of calibration and prove the convergence results for it. We also present some sufficient conditions under which our trading strategies receive a profit.Fig.2 Speculator capitals gambling on an increase of six Russian stocks (excluding transaction costs - on the left figure, with transaction costs 0.01% - on the right figure)."}, {"heading": "A Appendix", "text": "The following imbalances are used for some random variable strategies, where the random variable Vi column contains a function of X1,.., Xi and E (Vi + 1 | X1,.., Xi) = 0 random trading strategies in which the random variable Vi column contains a function of X1,., Xi and E (Vi + 1 | X1,.., Xi) = 0 random trading strategies of stocks in which the random variable strategy of Ai-Azuma inequality [2]: Lass V1, V2,. is a marginal difference in relation to X1, X2,.,., and Vi [Ai + 1] random variable strategies of stocks in which the random strategy of X1,.., Lass Sn = n = n column of 1 Vi,.
