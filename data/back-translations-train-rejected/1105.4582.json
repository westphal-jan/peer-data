As a result, even native speakers of a language use it in different dialects (e.g. African-American vernacular English and standard American English), genders (see, for example, Lakoff, 1973), and social conditions (e.g. Huspek, 1989), among others. Speakers of English as a second language exhibit differences in language usage that are consistent with their mother tongue and background. Nelson et al. (1996) reports, for example, that native Arabic speakers tend to apply different reaction strategies to compliments than Americans. Aguilar (1998) reviews types of pragmatic mistakes influenced by native language and culture. In particular, he cites Davies (1987) for a pragmatic failure due to a lack of equivalence of formulas: native speakers of Moroccan Arabic use different reaction strategies compared to Americans."}, {"heading": "2.2 Measuring pragmatic variation", "text": "Perception of pragmatic variations in spoken language and text has been shown to vary between cultures along personality dimensions (e.g. (e.g. (Scherer, 1972)), emotions (e.g. (Burkhardt et al., 2006)), deception (e.g. (Bond et al., 1990))), etc. Within a culture, personality traits such as extraversion have consistent markers in language (see overview in (Mairesse et al., 2007). For example, Furnham (1990) notes that extraverts are less formal in conversation and use more verbs, adverbs, and pronouns. However, the authors are not aware of quantitative studies comparing linguistic markers of personality between cultures. This study aims to fill this gap. A mapping between linguistic dimensions and personality was evaluated by gradation of essays and conversation extracts (Mairesse et al, 2007), and by gradation of expressions that were automatically generated with a random selection of these linguistic sections (the Note and the Note) generated with the participants in 2008."}, {"heading": "3 Experiment", "text": "In this section, we describe a study that evaluates the perception of personality traits and the naturalness of pronouncements by native speakers of American English and Arabic."}, {"heading": "3.1 Stimuli", "text": "The selection of stimuli tries to satisfy three objectives: first, our application: our dialog system is meant to be used at least on a robot receptionist. Therefore, the stimuli are snippets of dialogue that include four dialog acts typical of this type of embodied information dialogue (Makatchev et al., 2009): a greeting, a question-answer pair, a disagreement (with the user's assumption of an answer), and an apology (for the robot that does not know the answer to the question). Second, we would vary our stimuli along linguistic dimensions that are potentially strong personality traits. Extracts, for example, are reported to be more literal."}, {"heading": "3.2 Measures", "text": "In order to avoid possible interference between the scales, we conducted two versions of the study in parallel. In one version, participants were asked to rate the receptionist's expressions against the measures of the Big Five's personality traits (John and Srivastava, 1999), namely extraversion, convenience, conscientiousness, emotional stability and openness, using the ten-part personality questionnaire (TIPI, see (Gosling et al., 2003). In the other version, participants were asked to rate the receptionist's expressions in terms of their naturalness on a 7-point likert scale, answering the question: \"Do you agree that the receptionist's expressions were natural?\" The variants of such a natural scale were used by Burkhardt et al. (2006) and Mairesse and Walker (2008)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Experimental design", "text": "The experiment used a crossed design with the following factors: dimensions of linguistic variability (detail, assurance, orientation, or formality), value (negative, neutral, or positive), acts of dialogue (greeting, question-and-answer, disagreement, or apology), native language (American English or Arabic), and gender (male or female). In an attempt to balance the workload of the participants, depending on whether the study participant was assigned using personality or naturalness scales, the experimental sessions consisted of one or two linguistic variability conditions - 12 or 24 dialogues, respectively. Consequently, value and acts of dialogue were within the subject factors, while the dimension of linguistic variability was treated as an acrosssual factor, as well as native language and gender. Within each session, the objects were presented in a random order to minimize possible transmission effects."}, {"heading": "3.4 Participants", "text": "We used Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to recruit native speakers of American English from the United States and native Arabic speakers from all predominantly Arabic-speaking countries (according to the IP address), and upon completion of each task, participants will receive a financial reward credited to their MTurk account. Special measures were taken to prevent multiple participation by one person in the same study condition: Access to the study website would be denied to such a user based on the IP address, and MTurk logs were checked for repeated MTurk usernames to detect that the same MTurk account is logging in from different IP addresses. Hidden questions were planted in the study to verify the participants \"fluent mother tongue. The distribution of participants among countries is shown in Table 1. We observed a regional gender bias similar to that of Ross et al. (2010): There were 100 male and 55 female Arabic-state participants, as well as 63 male and female-American-English participants."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "We analyzed the data by adapting to linear mixing effects (LME) models (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000) and conducting the model selection with ANOVA. Comparing models that are capable of explaining personality and naturality values (control of language and gender) shows significant main effects of value and dialogue activities for all pairs of personality traits (and naturalness) and linguistic traits. The results also suggest that for each personality trait (and naturalities) there is a linguistic trait that leads to a significant interaction between its value, mother tongue and the dialogue act. These results suggest that (a) for both linguistic communities each linguistic dimension is associated with each personality trait, and naturalness for which dialogue activities, (b) there are differences in perception."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "The results suggest that the four dimensions of linguistic variability are recognized by both language communities as markers of all five personality traits. A comparison between language communities has revealed some qualitative differences in perceptions of openness, conscientiousness, convenience and naturalness. Results of the study can be used to adapt the generation and interpretation of natural language to native speakers of American English or Arabic. This explorative study also supports the feasibility of the crowdsourcing approach to validating the linguistic tools that realize rich points - behaviors that signal differences between languages and cultures."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This publication was made possible by the support of an NPRP grant from the Qatar National Research Fund.
