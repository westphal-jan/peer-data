It is designed to find paths in high-dimensional continuous spaces and applies to robots with many degrees of freedom in static, as well as dynamic environments - ones where obstacles may move. The Ariadne's clew algorithm comprises two sub-algorithms, called Search and Explore, applied in an interleaved manner. Explore builds a representation of the accessible space while Search looks for the target. Both are posed as optimization problems. We describe a real implementation of the algorithm to plan paths for a six degrees of freedom arm in a dynamic environment where another six degrees of freedom arm is used as a moving obstacle. Experimental results show that a path is found in about one second without any pre-processing.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2011 01:44:34 GMT  (198kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5440v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j m ahuactzin", "p bessiere", "e mazer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.5440"}, "pdf": {"name": "1105.5440.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Emmanuel Mazer", "Juan Manuel Ahuactzin"], "emails": ["Emmanuel.Mazer@imag.fr", "jmal@mail.udlap.mx", "Pierre.Bessiere@imag.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is not only a question of time, but also a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time, whether it is a question of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time of time of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time of time of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time, human beings, human beings, whether it is a question of time of time of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time of time of time of time is a question of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time, whether it is a question of time of time of time and time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time of time"}], "references": [{"title": "Manipulation Planning for Redundant", "author": ["J.

The main idea behind these algorithms is to build a graph in the con guration space. The graph is obtained incrementally as follows: a local planner is used to try to reach the goal. Should the motion stop at a local minimum, a new node (or landmark) is created by generating a random motion starting from that local minimum. The method iterates these two steps until the goal con guration has been reached from one of these intermediary positions by a gradient descent motion. These algorithms work with a discretized representation of the con guration space. They are known to be probabilistically complete because the probability of terminating with a solution (a path has been found or no path exists) converges to one as the allowed time increase towards in nity. As in the previous section, it is also possible to design simple deceptive environments that will make this kind of algorithm slower than a pure random approach. However, they have been tested for robots with a high number of dof and they have been shown to work quickly in relatively complex and natural environments. Other methods using landmarks have been devised. For example, sandros, introduced by Chen and Hwang(1992), makes use of landmarks to approximate the free space.", "startOffset": 113, "endOffset": 1410}, {"referenceID": 10, "context": "For example, in his method vdp, Ferbach (1996) starts by considering the straight line segment joining the initial and the nal con guration in C.", "startOffset": 32, "endOffset": 47}, {"referenceID": 10, "context": "For example, in his method vdp, Ferbach (1996) starts by considering the straight line segment joining the initial and the nal con guration in C. This path is progressively modi ed in such a manner that the forbidden regions it crosses are reduced. At each iteration, a sub-manifold of C containing the current path is randomly generated. It is then discretized and explored using a dynamic programming method that uses the length across the forbidden region as the cost function in order to minimize. The search results in a new trajectory whose intersection with the forbidden regions is smaller than the original trajectory. The process is repeated until an admissible trajectory is found. As in the previous sections, it is also possible to design simple deceptive environments that will make this kind of algorithm slower than a pure random approach.
