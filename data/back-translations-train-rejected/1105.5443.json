Instead all tested graphs of 100 to 1500 vertices are easily solved. When we artificially restrict the degree sequence with a bounded maximum degree, although there is some increase in difficulty, the frequency of hard graphs is still low. When we consider more regular graphs based on a generalization of knight's tours, we observe frequent instances of really hard graphs, but on these the average degree is bounded by a constant. We design a set of graphs with a feature our algorithm is unable to detect and so are very hard for our algorithm, but in these we can vary the average degree from O(1) to O(n). We have so far found no class of graphs correlated with the Gn,m phase transition which asymptotically produces a high frequency of hard instances.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2011 01:45:52 GMT  (127kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5443v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j culberson", "b vandegriend"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.5443"}, "pdf": {"name": "1105.5443.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["basil@cs.ualberta.ca", "joe@cs.ualberta.ca"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}], "references": [{"title": "Fast probabilistic algorithms for Hamiltonian circuits", "author": ["D.

For the algorithm to work, the average degree of a vertex needs only be a constant. They claim the result can be easily extended to the case that the average degree is a growing function of n. This is another indication that Hamiltonian graphs near the phase transition will be easy to solve by some algorithm. For a non-Hamiltonian graph to be hard for an algorithm it must contain a feature preventing the formation of a Hamiltonian cycle which the algorithm cannot easily detect. Suppose a backtrack algorithm does not check for vertices of degree one. The algorithm may then require exponential backtrack before determining the non-Hamiltonicity of the graph, since the only way it can detect this is by trying all possible paths and failing. However, degree one vertices are easily detectable, and so are not good indicators of hard instances. They also disappear at the phase transition. Similarly, an algorithm might not check for articulation points, and as a result waste exponential time on what should be easy instances. As n ! 1, the probability of an articulation point existing (in Gn;m) goes to zero as fast as the probability of the existence of a vertex of degree less than two. Other features can lead to non-Hamiltonicity of course, such as k-cuts that leave k+1 or more components (Bondy & Murty, 1976), and these could require time proportional to nk to detect. Under the assumption that NP6=CO-NP there must also exist a set of non-Hamiltonian instances which have no polynomial proof of their status. However, it seems that at the phase transition the larger the feature the less likely it is to occur. In fact, the theoretical results summarized above indicate this must happen. Although we know hard graphs exist, and we may expect these localized types of hard graphs to be more frequent near the phase transition than elsewhere when using Gn;m to generate instances, we also expect the probability of such instances to go to zero as n increases. 3. An Overview of our Backtrack Algorithm Our backtrack algorithm comes from Vandegriend (1998), and is based upon prior work on backtrack Hamiltonian cycle algorithms (Kocay, 1992; Martello, 1983; Shufelt & Berliner, 1994).", "startOffset": 139, "endOffset": 2233}, {"referenceID": 11, "context": "For example, Hogg andWilliams (1994) noticed a sparse set of very hard 3-coloring problems that were not at the phase transition.", "startOffset": 13, "endOffset": 37}, {"referenceID": 1, "context": "Baker (1995) showed that these instances were most often hard as a result of thrashing, and that they could be made easy by backjumping or dependency-directed backtracking.", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 13}, {"referenceID": 19, "context": "Random restarts are an integral part of randomized algorithms (Motwani & Raghavan, 1995) and are used frequently in local search and other techniques to escape from local optima (Johnson, Aragon, McGeoch, & Schevon, 1991; Langley, 1992; Selman, Levesque, & Mitchell, 1992; Gomes, Selman, & Kautz, 1998).", "startOffset": 178, "endOffset": 302}, {"referenceID": 6, "context": "From previous work (Cheeseman et al., 1991; Koml os & Szemer edi, 1983) we expect the phase transition to occur when d lnn+ ln lnn.", "startOffset": 19, "endOffset": 71}, {"referenceID": 6, "context": "We expect the phase transition for biconnectivity to be very similar to the phase transition for Hamiltonicity (Cheeseman et al., 1991) and we expect the phase transition for minimum degree greater than 1 to be almost identical to the phase transition for Hamiltonicity (Bollob as, 1984; Koml os & Szemer edi, 1983).", "startOffset": 111, "endOffset": 135}, {"referenceID": 8, "context": "These results appear to di er from those of Frank et al.

(1998), who found graphs which took orders of magnitude more search nodes to solve. (Their hardest graph took over 1 million nodes.) We believe this is due to two factors. Firstly, the algorithm used to generate the results in their paper did not do an initial check for biconnectivity nor did it use all of the pruning techniques used in our algorithm. Secondly and more importantly, on the small random graphs they used ( 30 vertices) the probability of obtaining certain hard con gurations (such as biconnected and non-Hamiltonian or non-biconnected and minimum degree 2) is much higher than when n is larger, as we discussed in section 2.2. The experiments on small Gn;m graphs (between 16 and 96 vertices) con rm this conjecture. In this case we do nd a small number of quadratically hard graphs, and a few very hard graphs. We consider for purposes of this paper, that a very hard graph on less than 100 vertices is any that takes at least 100,000 search nodes to solve. The very hard graphs from this set of runs are given in Table 4.1. Note that the very hardest took less than two minutes to solve, making our designation of \\very hard\" questionable. Also, note that the smallest graph in this set has 36 vertices, somewhat larger than the 30 vertex examples found by Frank et al. (1998).

Our class is intended merely to show that exponentially hard classes clearly exist for our algorithm, and many other backtrack algorithms using similar approaches. We do not claim our graphs are intrinsically hard, as there is a polynomial time algorithm that will solve this particular class. The basic concept we use in constructing these graphs is the non-Hamiltonian edge, which we de ne as an edge which cannot be in any possible Hamiltonian cycle. Note that since the graphs are Hamiltonian, each vertex must be incident on at least two edges which are not non-Hamiltonian. Our goal is to force the algorithm to choose a non-Hamiltonian edge at some point. The key observation is that once such an edge is chosen, the algorithm must backtrack to x that choice. With multiples of these bad choices, after backtracking to x the most recent bad choice, the algorithm must eventually backtrack to an earlier point to x a less recent bad choice, which means the more recent choice must be redone, with the algorithm making the bad choice again. The amount of work performed by the algorithm is at least exponential in the number of bad choices.
