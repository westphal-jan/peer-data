First, we analyze the case in which the priorities are strict total orders. Then, we complete the complexity analysis by extending the results to arbitrary, strict partial orders. Kautz and Selman analyze the complexity of determining the existence of extensions, careful reflection and valiant reflection on standard theories with the form errors listed in Table 1 (without the prescribed classes) and with objective parts that are sentences of words.

This is because there is always a unique default that is applied next, and this default cannot be overcome by any default that is applied later. Since Brewka does not take into account the non-normal standard theories, the complexity of this standard logic is much simpler than Reiter's standard logic. For unrestricted priorities, Table 2 summarizes the complexity of j = band j = BH with various syntactical limitations."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Tractable Classes", "text": "The following theorems show that the priorities applied are not an extension, but an extension.

Conclusions", "text": "We have presented a thorough analysis of the complexity of three versions of prioritized standard logic, which provides results that place this logic in the polynomial hierarchy, and analyzes the question of intractability versus tractability for syntactically limited classes of standard theories. The main results place the propositional variants of three general formalizations of prioritized standard logic, the logic of Brewka (1994) and Baader and Hollunder (1995), which are based on the semiconstructive definition of extensions, and a formalization based on lexicographic comparisons, at the lower levels of the polynomial hierarchy. Since the first two formalizations are very similar, it is not surprising that polynomial time translations exist between the decision problems of these two formalizations only when the polynomitic time translation of the selection logic and the standard logic of selectivity logic of Reiter exists."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This research was carried out mainly at the Technical University of Helsinki and the University of Ulm and supported by the SFB 527 of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.
