In this article, we describe a perturbational approach in the form of a cumulant expansion which, to lowest order, recovers the standard Kullback-Leibler variational bound. Higher-order terms describe corrections on the variational approach without incurring much further computational cost. The relationship to other perturbational approaches such as TAP is also elucidated. We demonstrate the method on a particular class of undirected graphical models, Boltzmann machines, for which our simulation results confirm improved accuracy and enhanced stability during learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2011 01:51:46 GMT  (128kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5455v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["d barber", "p de van laar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.5455"}, "pdf": {"name": "1105.5455.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["David Barber"], "emails": ["davidb@mbfys.kun.nl", "pierre@mbfys.kun.nl"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In this article we describe a perverse approach in the form in which people around the world have to deal with the question of how they should behave, and how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, whether they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, whether they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave behaved, how they should they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave, how they should behave behaved, how they should behave, how they should behave behaved, how they should they should behave behaved, how they should behave, how they"}], "references": [{"title": "A learning algorithm for Boltzmann", "author": ["D.H.
