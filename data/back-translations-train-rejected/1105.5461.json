Introduction Dealing with uncertain knowledge plays an important role in knowledge representation and reasoning. There are many di erent formalisms and methodologies for handling uncertainty. Most of them are directly or indirectly based on probability theory. In this paper, we focus on probabilistic deduction with conditional constraints over basic events (that is, interval restrictions for conditional probabilities of elementary events). The considered probabilistic deduction problems consist of a probabilistic knowledge base and a probabilistic query. We give a classical example. As a probabilistic knowledge base, we may take the probabilistic knowledge that all ostriches are birds, that the probability of Tweety being a bird is greater than 0.90, and that the probability of Tweety being an ostrich provided she is a bird is greater than 0.80. As a probabilistic query, we may now wonder about the entailed greatest lower and least upper bound for the probability that Tweety is an ostrich. The solution to this probabilistic deduction problem is 0.72 for the entailed greatest lower bound and 1.00 for the entailed least upper bound. More generally, probabilistic deduction with conditional constraints over propositional events can be done in a global approach by linear programming or in a local approach by the iterative application of inference rules. Note that it is immediately NP-hard, since it generalizes the satis ability problem for classical propositional logic (see Section 2.2).

Recent work on inference rules concentrates on integrating probabilistic knowledge into description logics (Heinsohn, 1994) and on analyzing the interplay between taxonomic and probabilistic deduction (Lukasiewicz 1998a, 1999a). We now summarize the main characteristics of the global and the local approach. The global approach can be performed within quite rich probabilistic languages (Fagin et al., 1992). Crucially, probabilistic deduction by linear programming is globally complete (that is, it really provides the requested tightest bounds entailed by the whole probabilistic knowledge base). However, a main drawback of the global approach is that it generally does not provide useful explanatory information on the deduction process. Finally, results on the special-case tractability of global approaches are driven by the technical possibilities of linear programming techniques and not by the needs of arti cial intelligence applications. Hence, they do not seem to be very useful in the arti cial intelligence context. A main advantage of the local approach is that the deduced results can be explained in a natural way by the sequence of applied inference rules (Amarger et al. 1991; Frisch & Haddawy, 1994). However, the iterative application of inference rules is generally restricted to quite narrow probabilistic languages. Moreover, it is very rarely and only within very restricted languages globally complete (Frisch and Haddawy, 1994, give an example of globally complete local probabilistic deduction in a very restricted framework). Finally, as far as the computational complexity is concerned, there are very few experimental and theoretical results on the special-case tractability of local approaches. The main motivating idea of this paper is to elaborate e cient local techniques for globally complete probabilistic deduction.
