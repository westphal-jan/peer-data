This temporal model is composed of a labeled temporal algebra and its reasoning algorithms. The labeled temporal algebra defines labeled disjunctive metric point-based constraints, where each disjunct in each input disjunctive constraint is univocally associated to a label. Reasoning algorithms manage labeled constraints, associated label lists, and sets of mutually inconsistent disjuncts. These algorithms guarantee consistency and obtain a minimal network. Additionally, constraints can be organized in a hierarchy of alternative temporal contexts. Therefore, we can reason on context-dependent disjunctive metric constraints on intervals and points. Moreover, the model is able to represent non-binary constraints, such that logical dependencies on disjuncts in constraints can be handled. The computational cost of reasoning algorithms is exponential in accordance with the underlying problem complexity, although some improvements are proposed.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 May 2011 22:09:11 GMT  (363kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6124v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["f barber"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.6124"}, "pdf": {"name": "1105.6124.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Reasoning on Interval and Point-based Disjunctive Metric Constraints in Temporal Contexts", "authors": ["Federico Barber"], "emails": ["FBARBER@DSIC.UPV.ES"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "\u00a9 2000 AI Access Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.

In this later case, disjunctive metric point-based constraints give rise to a Temporal Constraint Satisfaction Problem (TCSP) (Dechter et al., 1991). Reasoning on temporal constraints can be seen as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). An instantiation of the variables X is a n-tuple (v1, v2, v3, ...,vn) / vi\u2208D which represents the assignments of values {vi} to variables {xi}: (x1=v1, x2=v2, ...,xn=vn). A (global) solution of a TCN is a consistent instantiation of the variables X in their domains such that all TCN constraints are satisfied. A value v is a consistent (or feasible) value for xi if there exists a TCN solution in which xi=v. The set of all feasible values of a variable xi is the minimal domain for the variable. A constraint (xi cij xj) is consistent if there exists a solution in which (xi cij xj) holds. A constraint cij is minimal iff it consists only of consistent elements (or feasible values) that is, those which are satisfied by some interpretation of TCN constraints. A TCN is minimal iff all its constraints are minimal. A TCN is consistent (or satisfiable) iff it has at least one solution.

A subTCN is globally consistent if any locally consistent instantiation of the variables in the subTCN can be extended to a consistent instantiation of all TCN. A globally consistent TCN is one in which all its subTCNs are globally consistent. Thus, a TCN is strong nconsistent iff it is globally consistent (Dechter, 1992). The first reasoning task on a TCN is to determine whether the TCN is consistent. If the TCN is consistent, we can then obtain the minimal-TCN, all TCN solutions (by assuming a discrete and finite model of time), only one solution, a partial solution (consistent instantiation of a subset of TCN variables, which is a part of a global solution), etc. Deductive closure, or propagation, is one of the basic reasoning algorithms. The closure process is a deductive process on a TCN, where new derived constraints are deduced from the explicitly asserted ones by means of the composition (\u2297) and intersection (\u2295) operations. Thus, the process of determining the consistency and the minimality of a TCN is related to a sound and complete closure process (Vilain et al., 1986). Alternatively, CSP-based methods (with several heuristic search criteria) are also used for guaranteeing consistency and obtaining TCN solutions. In this paper, we are mainly interested in TCN closure processes. Determining the consistency of a general-case TCN is NP-hard, and Minimal TCNs can be obtained by a polynomial number of consistency processes (Vilain et al., 1986).

Therefore, any local consistent instantiation of a subset of two variables can be extended to a full consistent instantiation.

Thus, assembling a TCN solution can become a costly propagation process in disjunctive TCNs, even though a minimal TCN was used. The proposed reasoning processes maintain a complete and sound set of I-L-Sets (Theorem 8). Thus, we can deduce if a locally consistent set of elemental constraints is overall consistent by means of label sets associated to labeled elemental constraints and the set of I-L-Sets.
