(X) The size of this domain is determined by a trivial upper limit on the size of the search space of S (P). (X) The size of the search space is determined by the product of the domain.

Abs uses this filter information and maintains a measure for each variable x of how often the domain of x is reduced during the search. Abs can optionally maintain a measure of how much activity can be implied for each variable x = a to drive a value selection. If such a measure is maintained, the space requirement is proportional to the number of different assignments performed during the search.

Ibs, wdeg, and Abs were all implemented into the Comet system. Since the search algorithms are usually randomized, the empirical results are based on 50 runs and the tables report the average (\u00b5T) and standard deviation of runtimes in seconds. Unless otherwise stated, a time span of 5 minutes was used and running that was assigned a 300 runtime. The following parameter values were used for the experimental results: \u03b1 = 8 in both Ibs and Abs, \u03b3 = 0.999 (slow aging), and \u03b4 = 20%. Experimental results on the sensitivities of these parameters are also reported. For each heuristics, the results are given for three strategies: no restarts (NR), fast restart (Z = 1.1), or slow restart (Z = 2)."}, {"heading": "5.2 The Core Results", "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "5.3 Sensitivity Analysis", "text": "The results indicate that heuristic value selection of Abs does not play a decisive role and is only slightly faster / more robust in the largest instances. Statistics are based on 50 passes of the non-restart strategy; the box plots show the four headquarters for the runtime (in seconds) of Abs with a bandwidth of 0.8 to 0.05; the blue line connects the medians, while the red line connects the averages; the circles beyond the extreme quarters are outliers; the left side shows the results on msq-10, while the right side shows the results on msq-10; the right line connects the medians, while the red line connects the averages; the circles beyond the extreme quarters are outliers; the left side shows the results on msq-10, while the right side shows the results on msq-1."}, {"heading": "5.4 Some Behavioral Observations", "text": "Figure 5 shows the behavior of Abs and Ibs on radiation # 9 among all three restart strategies. The x-axis is the runtime on a logarithmic scale and the y-axis is the objective value each time a new upper limit is found. The three red curves represent the performance of an activity-based search, while the three blue curves correspond to the impact-based search. What is striking here is the difference in behavior between the two searches. Abs quickly descends to the optimal solution and then spends the remaining time proving the optimality. Without restarts, the activity-based search achieves the optimum within 3 seconds. On restarts, it finds the optimal solution within one second, and the proof of the optimality is also faster. Ibs slowly reaches the optimal solution, but then quickly proves the optimality. Restarts have a negative effect on Ibs. We suspect that the reduction of the large domains may not be such a good indicator of progress, and the search for certain radiation frequencies may be set to only 9. In the relatively high level of the individual radiation figure 6, the radiation values are relatively interesting."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "Robust search methods are a central component in the design of black box constraint programming solvers. In this paper, an activity-based search was proposed, which aims to use the activity of variables during propagation to guide the search. Variable activity is incremented each time the propagation step filters its domain and otherwise ages. A sampling method is used to initialize the variable activity before the search. Activity-based search was experimentally compared with Ib and wdeg heuristics based on a variety of benchmarks.The experimental results showed that Abs was significantly more robust than Ibs and Wdeg in these classes of benchmarks and often produced significant performance improvements."}], "references": [{"title": "Boosting systematic search by weighting constraints", "author": ["F.
