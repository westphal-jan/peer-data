Introduction", "text": "Is there any scientific principle, system, quality or technique that can explain the general cognitive phenomena? The Computer Theory of Mind and the Connectionist Model are the most successful cognitive scientific modelling principles, but there are still many unresolved questions about the nature of Mind. This article proposes the concept of pattern recognition as a formal answer to most of these questions and builds a solid cognitive theory that takes pattern recognition as a necessary and sufficient principle. Derived concepts such as pattern processing and pattern learning are used to propose a complete explanatory model for the functioning of the Mind. This article proposes a number of definitions and explanations as a physical phenomenon, from some poorly defined concepts in pattern recognition and cognitive science that are actually considered abstract principles."}, {"heading": "2. Pattern Recognition is a Necessary Cognitive Science Principle", "text": "No scientific study disputes that a wide range of cognitive phenomena such as recognition, perception or perception are closely related to pattern recognition processing. Intensive research in the field of pattern recognition processing in biological, neural, artificial and computer-assisted cognitive systems is indeed a promising frontend for science and technology. But no cognitive model formally discusses the concept of pattern recognition as a general and basic cognitive science principle. Such an approach is of fundamental importance, as pattern recognition processing is one of the mechanisms most experimentally observed. Since there is actually no other technique, formalism or model in cognitive science that can replace the function of pattern recognition function, this is a proposed proof that pattern recognition processing is a necessary and fundamental cognitive science principle."}, {"heading": "3. Pattern Recognition can be a Sufficient Cognitive Science Principle", "text": "It is generally accepted that pattern recognition can explain sensory and perceptible cognitive functions, but it is not the same for controversial cognitive functions as consciousness. This paper argues that the same pattern recognition mechanisms can perform instinctive, processing, learning and acting functions. Then, it is shown that with pattern recognition, we can define cognitive scientific formalism, an explanation for any controversial cognitive function as consciousness, with an understandable description. With objective formalism, it is possible to test qualitative and quantitative cognitive scientific models experimentally. All this allows this paper to claim that pattern recognition can be a sufficient principle for cognitive science."}, {"heading": "4. Physical and Cognitive Concept of Pattern Recognition", "text": "The concept of pattern recognition is widely used in cognitive fields of science. It is generally defined in mathematics, computer science, design and few other fields as a method or technique of classification, regularity search, etc., but the formal overall concept of pattern recognition from the physical to the algorithmic base is not clearly, conclusively or unambiguously defined in the scientific literature [Verhagen 1975], [Jie Liu, Jigui Sun and Shengsheng Wang 2006].Here some definitions of pattern recognition are first proposed as a general physical phenomenon. This is important because pattern recognition is often seen as an artificial technique and not as a fundamental natural phenomenon. Hence, the concept of cognitive pattern recognition and its difference to basic physical pattern recognition. In addition, the not frequently used concepts of pattern processing and pattern learning are proposed as important cognitive functions to explain the function of the mind."}, {"heading": "4.1. Pattern and Pattern Recognition \u2013 definitions and mechanisms", "text": "Here it is suggested that the concepts of pattern-making action can first be defined as a general physical pattern. The above definitions depend on the type of recognition. A precise definition of the mechanism is necessary in order to define the general pattern as a physical phenomenon."}, {"heading": "4.2. Pattern Processing \u2013 definitions and mechanisms", "text": "In the literature of cognitive science, the term pattern processing usually refers to any pattern, function, or pattern recognition algorithm, rather than a basic physical phenomenon that can be useful for cognitive science, as is suggested below. If a pattern is detected by a set of neurons or synapses, a set of retinal cells are activated by a second pattern, this can be considered the first step in the neural pattern recognition chain. Retinal cells can activate a set of synapses even though the optical nerve cells and a set of brain regions are activated in a second pattern recognition event."}, {"heading": "4.3. Pattern Learning \u2013 definitions and mechanisms", "text": "Just as the concept of synaptic weight functions of neural networks can be interpreted as biological neural learning, we can have a general definition of pattern learning: pattern learning is the modification of pattern recognition. This definition is useful because it corresponds to the intensively studied standard models of neural connectionists and artificial intelligence. Also, because it can be a generalization of these learning mechanisms as a basic pattern recognition process, since learning was simply the recognition of new patterns. A simple example can be the recognition of a new number pattern when a person dials a phone, or the recognition of a new facial image pattern to a new person.One consequence of this definition is that the concepts of learning and memory are equal. If we memorize, we learn new patterns, and when we learn, we memorize new patterns. This equivalence is not always clear in cognitive science. A difference between learning and memorization is found to be a new pattern, for example, when we are able to recognize different categories as we know patterns, and when we are able to memorize patterns."}, {"heading": "5. Pattern Recognition definitions and explanation of cognitive phenomena", "text": "The above physical to cognitive definitions and discussions are a formal basis for proposing a general theory for cognitive science in the following steps: \u2022 Description of instincts as a functional mechanism for pattern recognition. \u2022 Proposal of an unattended, instinctive pattern skewed model. \u2022 Proposal of pattern recognition definitions and explanatory mechanisms for all higher order cognitive concepts such as thinking and consciousness. \u2022 Suggestions for use."}, {"heading": "5.1. Instincts, Sensing, Feelings and Emotions - Basic Cognitive Phenomena", "text": "The basic animal instincts concept can be considered functionally isomorphic to the pattern recognition concept, and pattern recognition mechanisms as suggested here can be a mechanistic description of all instinctive related cognitive functions.As far as the patterns, or a set of characteristics, can be described by one or a set of instincts, pattern recognition processing can be proposed as a functioning mechanism. A simplified suggested description follows. Basic instincts such as pain, fear, desire, surprise, etc., can be considered predominantly in pattern recognition functions that are relatively independent of learning and can have a major impact on overall pattern processing in a period of time. The term has been used predominantly in the assumption that the biological instincts can be regarded with less influence from phenotypes learning, even some instincts seem to be able to react somehow other than for pain processing."}, {"heading": "6. Processing and Learning Strategies based on Instinctive Patterns", "text": "Another suggestion is that general cognitive processing activity may be compatible with the concept of pattern processing, as defined and discussed in Section 4.2, as a chain of interassociated cognitive pattern recognition activities or occurrences. The progress that this proposal can make in cognitive science is to identify some cognitive meanings from the large amount of processing activities of cognitive systems, either biological neural systems or artificial intelligence. This is also a proposal for an overall solution to the cognitive representation problem, as it objectively defines the cognitive representation structure in which the mechanisms of pattern recognition and processing mechanisms and the format structures pattern.Based on the definitions and discussions of Section 4.3, we can propose that cognitive learning mechanisms can also be described as pattern learning mechanisms. A simple, unattended learning strategy that is proposed here to describe the cognitive learning ability is the cognitive ability."}, {"heading": "6.1. Self, thinking and consciousness pattern recognition definitions", "text": "This section gives a number of suggested definitions and explanations as an argument that patterns of thinking, etc. are generally limited; a very persuasive argument is that it is a natural, formal language of representation for defining controversial cognitive concepts, such as the thinking and consciousness of people who have a universal understanding of all cognitive phenomena; and more, a set of patterns that are necessary to define a cognitive phenomenon can in principle be processed through a suitable physical recognition mechanism."}, {"heading": "7. From applications to philosophy", "text": "Since the pattern recognition scientific field is very broad, promising and active, we can expect that many of the above patterns may have applications, and the rapid development of pattern recognition science and technology is a serious candidate to answer many cognitive questions. One possible application is that objective quantitative criteria for non-human conscious and unconscious recognition could be defined as conscious, and patterns with a probability of less than 2% can be considered as unconscious. Or even proposed a graduation of conscious pattern recognition probability. Probability distributions can also be a suggested criteria for an artificial intelligence or an animal, as conscious, and patterns with a probability of less than 2%."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions", "text": "This paper proposes a new solution to the problem of the poorly defined pattern recognition concept [Verhagen 1975], [Jie Liu, Jigui Sun, and Shengsheng Wang 2006] by defining pattern recognition as a physical phenomenon, thereby putting forward the principles of pattern recognition scientific field with a concrete physical basis besides an abstract ambiguous reason. This paper also proposes a solution to the cognitive core problem of defining clear and comprehensible definitions, explanations, and descriptions of controversial cognitive scientific concepts as consciousness. Starting from the principle of pattern recognition as a formal explanatory concept, we showed the ability to provide physical and concrete explanations for the processing mechanism of the mind and provided an objective solution to many difficult and abstract questions in the field. All conceptual mechanistic explanations and definitions proposed in this paper can be compared with other similar important scientific proposals."}], "references": [{"title": "Some general remarks about pattern recognition", "author": ["Verhagen", "C.J.D.
