Introduction Qualitative spatial reasoning has received an increasing amount of interest in the recent literature. The main reason for this, as already observed by Jonsson and Drakengren (1997), is probably that spatial reasoning has proved to be applicable to real-world problems, as in Geographical Information Systems (Egenhofer, 1991; Grigni, Papadias, & Papadimitriou, 1995), and Molecular Biology (Cui, 1994). The speci c stress on qualitative reasoning about space, as observed by Zimmermann (1995), is justi ed by the fact that qualitative spatial relations can be treated as e ciently as their quantitative counterparts, but they seem to be closer to the model of relations humans adopt for spatial reasoning. Even though qualitative spatial reasoning has an extended literature, in spite of its relatively short history, certain aspects of the discipline have been neglected. In particular, no exhaustive computational perspective has been developed on qualitative morphological reasoning about space. The term morphological reasoning is intended to suggest reasoning about the internal structure of the objects. In the case of spatial reasoning this includes reasoning about the size, shape and internal topology of spatial regions. The purpose of the present work is to analyse the complexity of reasoning about relations of congruence, either actual or partial, between spatial regions, using the spatial algebra MC-4 which has been preliminarly analysed by Cristani (1997).

Our result is the analogous in MC-4 of Jonsson and Drakengren result for RCC-5. The MC-4 algebra, we describe in this paper, is structured in the same way as the Algebra of Partially Ordered Time (PO-time algebra), studied by Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez. We would like to stress two main aspects here: The MC-4 algebra has the PO-time algebra are the same algebraic structure: the discussion of this paper stands a di erent interpretation of the PO-time algebra, even di erent from the spatial interpretation provided by Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez in their papers. The computational results we present here can be applied to the PO-time algebra as well, and they extend the previous ndings obtained by Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez. In particular Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez (1998, 1999), proved that path-consistency is insu cient to ensure consistency for relations in this algebra, and that there exists a tractable subalgebra of it which can be treated by an O(n3) algorithm. Anger, Mitra and Rodriguez (1999), showed that deciding the consistency of a PO-time network is an NP-complete problem by reducing to it the analogous decision problem on RCC-5.", "startOffset": 156, "endOffset": 2833}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "The RCC model corresponds to subalgebras of Interval Calculus, as stated by Bennett (1994).

The backtracking technique is applicable to MC-4 as well, so we can perform a polynomial solution of MSAT on nondeterministic machines. This shows that MSAT is in NP, and allows us to claim: Theorem 2 MSAT(MC-4) is NP-complete. Because of this negative result a deep investigation is needed to de ne tractable subclasses of the set of 16 relations which allow us to perform polynomial analysis for at least a subset of the networks of constraints de nable on MC-4. In this paper we give the de nition of the three maximal tractable subclasses of MC4, exhibiting therefore a complete classi cation of tractability for the algebra.
