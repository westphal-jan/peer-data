Introduction The depiction of uncertainty and inaccuracy has received considerable attention in the artificial intelligence community, in an attempt to expand existing knowledge representation systems to deal with the imperfect nature of real information (which is more the rule than the exception).An impressive piece of work has been done in recent decades, which has led to a number of concepts being investigated, a number of problems being identified, and a number of solutions being developed (Bacchus, 1990; Dubois & Prade, 1996; Kruse, Schwecke, & Heinsohn, 1991; Pearl, 1988)."}, {"heading": null, "text": "In fact, classical DLi systems are usually insufficient. (Nowadays, a whole family of knowledge representation systems has been built using DLs that differ in terms of their expressiveness, complexity, and completeness of their algorithms.) Experience in the use of DLs in applications has also shown that we want to expand their representation and thinking capabilities. (Peltason, 1991; Brachman, 1992; Hollunder, 1991a; Horrocks, 1998.) The use of DLs in applications has also shown that we want to expand their representation and thinking capabilities, especially the use of DLs in the context of retrieval information (MIR) points to the need to expand DLs with capabilities that enable the treatment of inherent imprecision in multimedia objects (Meghini & Straccia, 1996; Meghini, Sebastiani, Straccia, 1998)."}, {"heading": null, "text": "While these probabilistic extensions increase the applicability of DLs, they do not address the question of arguing about individuals and imprecise concepts, since imprecise knowledge and uncertain knowledge are \"orthogonal\" (Dubois & Prade, 1994). Furthermore, arguing in a probabilistic framework is generally a more difficult task from a computational point of view than the relative non-probabilistic case, and in most cases lacks complete axiomatization (Halpern, 1990; Roth, 1996). Consequently, the computer-related problems need to be addressed carefully (Koller et al., 1997). We will proceed as follows: In the following section, we will first introduce ALC, which we will extend to the ambiguous case, and discuss some properties in Section 4, while in Section 5 we will outline a limitation on the propagation of calculations for the argument."}, {"heading": null, "text": "I = \"I\" (I) \"I\" (C \"D) I =\" I \"(C\" D \") I =\" I \"(F\" D \") I =\" I \"(F\" D \") (I =\" I \"(F\" D \") I =\" I \"(F\" D \") (F\" D \") (F\" D \") (F\" D \") (F\" D \") (F\") (F \"D\") (F \"D\") (F \"D\") (F \"D\") (F \"D\") (F \") (F\") (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) () (F) () (F) () (F) () () (F) () () () (F () () () () () (F) () () () () () () (() (F () () () () () () () () (() () () () () () () () () () () () () () (() () () () (() () (() () () (() () (())) (() ("}, {"heading": null, "text": "On the other hand, the definition of a concept is an expression of the form A: = C, where A is a primitive concept and C is a concept that identifies a type of sport with a sports tool.
