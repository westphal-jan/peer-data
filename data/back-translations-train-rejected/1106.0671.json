The stronger the local consistency, the more important is the time wasted. We see the consequences of the exponential worst-case time complexity of NIC1. For most of these problems, NIC1 requires a reasonable CPU time. But, as we can see in problem Scen11, a combinatorial explosion can result in a truly prohibitive CPU time for NIC1."}, {"heading": "6.1.2 Results on arc inconsistent problems (cf. Table 3)", "text": "When arc consistency is needed to detect the inconsistency of the problem, stronger local consistencies are not always more costly. Figure 3 shows that Max-RPC1 often has the best cpu-time performance, and in Graph06, for example, AC7 is one of the most expensive local consistencies. In enforcing AC, which requires the arc inconsistency of the problem to spread, stronger local consistency can erase a domain faster than AC7. In these constraint networks, all the algorithms used have a very low cpu time requirement, except for NIC1, which can be very expensive in some cases, such as Scen08."}, {"heading": "6.1.3 Results on the other problems (cf. Table 4)", "text": "For many of the RLFAP problems, local consistencies do not erase the same sets of inconsistent values. We can see an important similarity between the pruning, especially for the problems ScenXX.1 and GraphXX.1.Obviously, for most of these problems, the more pruned the local consistency is, the more important the time it takes. We can see this, for example, in the problems Scen06.1 and Scen09.1. However, AC7, RPC2, PIC2 and Max-RPC1 have CPU time performances of the same magnitude, while SAC1, SRPC1 and NIC1 are often much more elaborate. Domain Filtering ConsistenciesThis is particularly evident for Graph04 and Graph10. However, it is di cult to say which is the most interesting local consistency in these problems."}, {"heading": "6.2 Randomly Generated Problems", "text": "The random uniform CN generator in Section 5.2 is used to compare the CPU time required to enforce local consistency. We must point out that NIC is not designed to be used on uniform CNs, but to adjust the degree of variables in the constraint diagram. So NIC would perform better on non-uniform CNs than the ones shown in this section. The problems generated have 200 variables and 30 values in each initial domain. Figure 8 shows the results on CNs with a density of.02. These CNs are relatively sparse, as the variables have on average four neighbors. Figure 9 presents the performance at density. 15 (the variables have an average of 30 neighbors). Due to the parameters, there are no feared variables (MacIntyre, Prosser, Smith, & Walsh, 1998) in the problems generated."}, {"heading": "6.3 Experiments on Sparse CNs", "text": "Even on sparse CNs (see Figure 8), the CPU time results between algorithms (7h 48min for strong PCs at their peak, when AC7 requires an average of 0.22 seconds on average) are so low that a logarithmic scale must be used. Strong PC is really prohibitive, even for 6. In Section 5.2, the density reaching 1, there were obviously frightened variables for some parameter sets. Debruyne & Bessi discuss density values. SRPC and SAC have bad CPU time to the number of deleted values, except SAC on CNs, which have very narrow limitations, because the SAC algorithm used is based on AC6, which can be more precise than AC7 for such problems. On these sparse CNs, NIC often has better CPU time to the number of deleted values than SAC, but it removes no more values than RICs. Consequently, NCU has a bad PU time to the number of two SICs, although the number of SIC are stronger."}, {"heading": "6.4 Experiments on more Dense CNs", "text": "On denser CNs (see Figure 9), the complexity peaks of AC7, RPC2, PIC2, and MaxRPC remain close together. PIC2 is less worthwhile because it clears few additional values compared to RPC2, while the CPU time requirements are close to those of Max-RPC. MaxRPC has one of the best CPU time to number of deleted value ratios. Once RPC leads to a domain, the CPU time performances of SRPC and RPC2 merge. In fact, the SRPC algorithm used forces RPC2 before stopping the limited path consistency of the sub-problems P jDi = fagfor each (i; a) 2 D. When all values of a domain are inconsistent, RPC preprocessing nds is the global inconsistency of the problem and the SRPC algorithm."}, {"heading": "6.5 Discussion", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it will only be once before there is such a process, in which there is such a process."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "We proposed a new class of local consistencies, singleton consistencies. We examined these new local consistencies and the other local consistencies that can be used equally on large CNs, removing more values than arc consistency. We showed some correlations between them and compared their intersection and time consistencies both theoretically and experimentally. Most incisive are neighborhood consistency and singleton consistency. However, SRPC is time-consuming and the exponential time complexity of NIC makes it unusable on dense CNs. If we are looking for a local consistency that would be beneficial during the search, RPC and Max RPC seem to be the most promising local consistencies. In fact, they are relatively inexpensive and far cheaper than arc consistency."}, {"heading": "8.
