We believe that anaphora resolution requires numerous sources of information in order to find the correct antecedent of the anaphor. These sources can be of different kinds, e.g., linguistic information, discourse/dialogue structure information, or topic information. For this reason, our algorithm uses various different kinds of information (hybrid information). The algorithm is based on linguistic constraints and preferences and uses an anaphoric accessibility space within which the algorithm finds the noun phrase. We present some experiments related to this algorithm and this space using a corpus of 204 dialogues. The algorithm is implemented in Prolog. According to this study, 95.9% of antecedents were located in the proposed space, a precision of 81.3% was obtained for pronominal anaphora resolution, and 81.5% for adjectival anaphora.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Jun 2011 14:54:46 GMT  (187kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0673v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["p martinez-barco", "m palomar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.0673"}, "pdf": {"name": "1106.0673.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Manuel Palomar"], "emails": ["mpalomar@dlsi.ua.es", "patricio@dlsi.ua.es"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to move into another world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they are able to move, in which they are able to move, in which they are able to move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they are able to move, in which they, in which they are able"}, {"heading": "Computational Approach to Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Dialogues", "text": "TOPIC tren (train) AP1 ITI (OP) informaci on de Renfe, buenos d as.

An annotation scheme for dialogue structure For successful anaphora resolution in dialogues, we assume that it is essential to identify dialogue structure.

(1974) concerning (conversational) turn-taking. We use an annotation scheme based on these theories for three main reasons. First, as it is a general approach to dialogue modeling, it is applicable to all types of dialogues, including both task-oriented and information-retrieval-oriented dialogues. Consequently, the use of such a model as a basis for developing our anaphor resolution procedure allows us to apply the procedure to any type of domain, thus o ering an advantage over procedures based on discourse models speci c to particular domains. Second, this annotation scheme can be easily applied to automatic processes without metalinguistic considerations. Although in our work the annotation task has been performed by hand, for dialogue-based applications in which our procedure might be embedded (e.g., in dialogue management systems), annotation tasks must be performed automatically. Finally, we wanted to base our own procedure on studies of the in uence of dialogue structure on anaphora resolution that were carried out by Fox (1987), whose approach, in turn, is based on that of Sacks et al.", "startOffset": 160, "endOffset": 1224}, {"referenceID": 10, "context": "This form of anaphora, in which the reference appears within an adjacency pair, appears to be very common in dialogues (Fox, 1987).", "startOffset": 119, "endOffset": 130}, {"referenceID": 5, "context": "Such interventions lack information.

After that, by using an anaphor the speaker displays an understanding that sequence has not been closed down. We assert that two di erent sequences generate most of the anaphors to be found in dialogues: the adjacency pair and the topic scope. The former generates references to any local noun phrase, and the latter generates references to the main topic of the dialogue. Based on this, we propose that the anaphoric accessibility space for any given anaphor may be de ned as the set of noun phrases taken from: the adjacency pair containing the anaphor, plus the adjacency pair preceding the adjacency pair containing the anaphor, plus any adjacency pair including the adjacency pair containing the anaphor, plus the noun phrase representing the main topic of the dialogue. 4.2 An automatic topic detection proposal Several works about automatic topic detection have been published|Reynar (1999), Youmans (1991) or Hearst (1994)|.", "startOffset": 136, "endOffset": 1772}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "Palomar & Mart nez-Barco scheme is also compatible with those that are based on utterance functions, such as the one de ned in DAMSL by Allen and Core (1997).

ARDi operates with syntactic information provided by the SUPP partial parser (Ferr andez, Palomar, & Moreno, 1998). SUPP is based on a partial representation of slot uni cation grammar analysis (Ferr andez et al., 1999). This partial representation gives some of the utterance constituents, such as NPs, PPs, verbal chunks, and partial information about subordinated clauses. Thus, ARDi combines two kinds of knowledge about dialogues: (1) linguistic knowledge, such as lexical, morphological, and syntactic knowledge; and (2) knowledge about the dialogue's structure itself, which is based on the annotation of adjacency pairs5 and knowledge about the topic of the dialogue (manually annotated). Figure 2 shows the anaphora resolution procedure. ARDi is based, intuitively, on the following three steps: 1. Obtain all possible antecedents from dialogue structure and topic as follows: (a) take those NPs that are included in the same adjacency pair (AP) as the anaphor, and (b) take those NPs that are included in the previous AP to that containing the anaphor, and (c) take those NPs that are included in the most recent unclosed AP containing the AP containing the anaphor, and (d) take the topic of the dialogue 2. Discard incompatible antecedents by applying linguistic constraints, as follows: (a) for pronominal anaphora: 5. The use of adjacency pairs as dialogue units for anaphora resolution is based on the work of Sacks et al. (1974), in which they suggest that one form of anaphora which appears to be very common in dialogues is reference within an adjacency pair.", "startOffset": 22, "endOffset": 1800}, {"referenceID": 23, "context": "C-command and minimal governing category restrictions are proposed, as formulated in Reinhart (1983).

For adjectival anaphora, the space consisted of the previous four turns. 6.4.2 Constraints In the case of pronominal anaphora, the constraints included: 1. morphological agreement: discard the antecedents which are incompatible morphologically (gender, number, and person) 2. syntactic context: discard the antecedents which are non-co-referent according to Lappin and Leass (1994) In the case of adjectival anaphora, the constraints included: 1.", "startOffset": 116, "endOffset": 1073}, {"referenceID": 19, "context": "Palomar & Mart nez-Barco 4.

Needless to say, these results are very low for pronominal anaphora and extremely poor for adjectival anaphora. In evaluating the errors, we concluded that the de ned anaphoric accessibility space was too constrained and too arbitrarily de ned. It simply disregarded the relationship between anaphora and dialogue structure. Consequently, we proposed the following changes for the second experiment. 6.5 Experiment 1: Dialogue structure information only For this experiment, the de nition of the anaphoric accessibility space was changed to employ information provided by the dialogue structure, as suggested by Mart nez-Barco (1999).
