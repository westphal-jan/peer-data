This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach for automatically optimizing a dialogue policy, which addresses the technical challenges in applying reinforcement learning to a working dialogue system with human users. We report on the design, construction and empirical evaluation of NJFun, an experimental spoken dialogue system that provides users with access to information about fun things to do in New Jersey. Our results show that by optimizing its performance via reinforcement learning, NJFun measurably improves system performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Jun 2011 14:55:23 GMT  (162kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0676v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["m kearns", "d litman", "s singh", "m walker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.0676"}, "pdf": {"name": "1106.0676.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Satinder Singh", "Diane Litman"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is a matter of time in which the people of the USA, in Europe, in Europe, in Europe, in the USA, in the USA, in Europe, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the United Kingdom, in the USA, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in the United Kingdom, in"}, {"heading": "Singh, Litman, Kearns, & Walker", "text": "It is a question of whether the system should retrieve the desired information from a spoken dialogue system in real time through a telephone or some other form of communication with the user.
