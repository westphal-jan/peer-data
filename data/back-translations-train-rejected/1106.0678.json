Introduction", "text": "The first Trade Agent Competition (TAC) was held from June 22 to July 8, 2000, organized by a group of researchers and developers led by Michael Wellman of the University of Michigan and Peter Wurman of North Carolina State University (Wellman, Wurman, O'Malley, Bangera, Lin, Reeves, & Walsh, 2001), whose objectives included providing a benchmark problem in the complex and rapidly evolving domain of e-marketplaces (Eisenberg, 2000) and motivating researchers to adopt unique approaches to a common task. A central feature of TAC is that it required autonomous bidders to buy and sell multiple interacting goods in auctions of different types. Another key feature of TAC was that the participating agents competed against each other in a preliminary round and many practice games that led to the nals goals."}, {"heading": "2.

Results", "text": "TAC consisted of a week-long preliminary round of approximately 80 games for each of the 22 participants. The 12 best players were invited to the semi- and nals in Boston, MA on July 8th. As agents and conditions were constantly changing, and only 13 games were played by each agent in the semi- and nals, the competition does not offer a controlled testing environment. In this section we describe the success of ATTac-2000 in the tournament, but also present empirical results of controlled tests that demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the adaptive strategy of ATTac-2000."}, {"heading": "4.1 The Competition", "text": "ATTac-2000's scores in the 88 preliminary round games ranged from 3000 to over 4500 (average 2700, hourly 1600).A good score in one instance ranged from 3000 to 4000. We noticed that there were many very bad scores (12 less than 1000 and seven less than 0).4 With only 2 high bidders, the only way to escalate the price would be to bid for a combined total of 16 rooms of the same type of hotel, which could only happen if all their customers stayed in the same hotel on the same night, a very unlikely scenario given the TAC parameters. This is largely the result of ATTac-2000, which has not been associated with its adaptive timing."}, {"heading": "4.2 Controlled Testing", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it can only take one year to move on to the next round."}, {"heading": "5. Related Work", "text": "Although there is a lot of research on auction theory, especially from the perspective of auction mechanisms (Klemperer, 1999), studies of autonomous bidders and their interactions are relatively rare and new. FM97,6 is another auction project based on shmarket auctions (Rodriguez-Aguilar, Martin, Noriega, Garcia, & Sierra, 2001) and automatic bidders have also been created in this area (Gimenez-Funes, Godo, Stone-Aguiolar, & Garcia-Calves, 1998). There have been a number of studies of agents bidding for a single item in multiple auctions (Ito, Shintani, & Sycara)."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "While it was a very successful event, some minor improvements would increase his interest in a multi-agent learning perspective. Currently, there is no incentive to buy airline tickets until the end of the game.If the price of flights tended to rise or supply was limited, agents would have to weigh up the benefit of keeping their options open earlier against the savings of travel package.The information structure of the TAC setup was such that it was impossible to observe the bidding patterns of individual agents during the game.However, the strategic behavior of individual agents is often deeply market dynamics, especially in hotel auctions. It seems that it would be necessary to be able to observe the behavior of each individual agent directly. If there were information about the bidding behavior of agents during the game (so that other agents could deduce the preferences of customers, demand and prices), TAC agents would potentially be able to observe the behavior of individual agents directly."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank the TAC team at the University of Michigan, which includes Michael Wellman, Peter Wurman, Kevin O'Malley, Daniel Reeves and William Walsh, for creating the TAC server and for responding promptly and warmly to our many requests while conducting the research reported here.
