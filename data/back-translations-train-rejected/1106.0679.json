However, no empirical investigation has been made yet. Our experiments show that the adaption of the algorithms used for qualitative temporal reasoning can solve large RCC8 instances, even if they are in the phase transition region -- provided that one uses the maximal tractable subsets of RCC8 that have been identified by us. In particular, we demonstrate that the orthogonal combination of heuristic methods is successful in solving almost all apparently hard instances in the phase transition region up to a certain size in reasonable time.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Jun 2011 14:56:05 GMT  (237kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0679v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["b nebel", "j renz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.0679"}, "pdf": {"name": "1106.0679.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Jo hen Renz", "renz dbai.tuwien.a", "Bernhard Nebel"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "Journal of Arti ial Intelligen e Resear h 15 (2001) 289-318 Submitted 3/01; published 10/01", "text": "In fact, it is in such a way that it acts in a way in which people act in the world, in the world, in the world, in which they live, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in, in the world, in, in, in the world, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in,"}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": null, "creator": "dvips(k) 5.86 Copyright 1999 Radical Eye Software"}}}
