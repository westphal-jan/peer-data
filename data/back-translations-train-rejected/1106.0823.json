Existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry use corresponding feature points that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM - illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM - outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two else methods, termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method) and CTPM (curve tangent points method), for search epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on search correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolarline to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. Unfortunately these two methods give us only finite subset of solution, which usually include \"good\" solution, but don't allow us to find this \"good\" solution among this subset. Exception is the case of epipoles in infinity. The main reason for such result is inexactness of constant brightness assumption for smooth bodies. But outline and illumination characteristic points are not influenced this inexactness. So the first pair of methods gives exact result.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 4 Jun 2011 13:48:21 GMT  (1570kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0823v1", "33 pages, 19 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Oct 2011 12:33:21 GMT  (1568kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0823v2", "33 pages, 19 figures"], ["v3", "Wed, 19 Oct 2011 09:27:20 GMT  (1568kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0823v3", "33 pages, 19 figures"], ["v4", "Thu, 19 Jul 2012 12:38:37 GMT  (1568kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0823v4", "accepted to \"Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis\" for publishing in 2013, 33 pages, 19 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "33 pages, 19 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["oleg kupervasser"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.0823"}, "pdf": {"name": "1106.0823.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Recovering Epipolar Geometry from Images of Smooth Surfaces", "authors": ["Oleg Kupervasser"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 110 6.08 23v4 [cs.CV] 1 9Ju l 22 was implemented and tested on pairs of real images.

To assume a constant brightness, an illumination intensity of the corresponding points on the two images is used, which is identical. Normally, the corresponding points are some vertices of bodies. As on smooth bodies such points are missing, it is usually assumed that this procedure is not applicable. However, it is not absolutely true. Although the vertices on smooth bodies are really missing, illumination of smooth bodies creates similar characteristic points. For example, illumination of a spherical body creates a point of maximum illumination intensity, which is easily recorded on a pair of images. We will describe here all characteristic points that create illumination of smooth bodies."}, {"heading": "2.2 Implementation of the first method (ICPM) for real images", "text": "The numerical calculation shows that the SIFT method [10,11,12] detects many of the above-mentioned characteristic points (Figure 2).In Figure 2, about 30 pairs of corresponding points are marked with yellow color.These points are found by the SIFT method and a part of them are located on smooth bodies (sculptures).But all of these points on smooth bodies relate to one of 1-5 types of the characteristic points described above. The agreement of the points was found by the 6th method (of the six methods described above).The numerical calculation shows that these pairs of points provide enough information to precisely calculate the epipolar geometry using the usual methods.This result confirms the efficiency of the described method. This efficiency is explained by the fact that the characteristic points are found with hairsplitting accuracy. In fact, the intensity of illumination along these floors varies slowly and smoothly, except for the characteristic points described above. It leads to small errors for the geometry of the polepiar geometry."}, {"heading": "2.3 Method of tangents to an outline of smooth bodies (OTPM)", "text": "However, there is another method that also has split-hair accuracy - a method of tangents to outline smooth bodies. (This method is discussed in detail in [1,2,8].) Let A be the tangential point of a tangent to a smooth body outline from the epipole in the first image. And B is the tangential point of the corresponding tangential points to the corresponding outlines of smooth bodies from the second epipole in the second image. It is 6 proven in [8], [7] that these two points are corresponding points in the images. Suppose we have many smooth bodies and consequently many outlines of smooth bodies. Then, by splitting image planes on meshes, we consider all possible methods to place epipoles on these meshes. It is possible to find pair of epipoles that give the minimum error for the property of tangents described."}, {"heading": "3 Two methods using level curves of illumination intensity", "text": "In this section, we present our method of restoring the epipolar geometry of two images by determining the basic matrix F. (A pair of corresponding points in the two images, x and x, must correspond to xFx \u2032 T = 0.) The purpose of the methods specified in this section is to reconstruct the epipolar geometry of two 2D images of smooth bodies photographed from different positions. To find the epipolar geometry in a case of non-smooth bodies, we use correspondence of reference points, such as corners. In the case of smooth bodies, these vertices are absolutely non-existent, making finding matches a thoroughly solvable problem. Nevertheless, one can try to solve them. A basis for this purpose is the assumption of constant brightness. It is assumed that corresponding points in different images have the same value of intensity. This assumption is proven for the following conditions: 1) The Lambert law of reflections of surfaces is the assumption that an object is equal in intensity to an object of any direction."}, {"heading": "3.1 Description of the two methods for finding correspondence and", "text": "The first method we use is the search for a solution that is oriented to the respective requirement profiles, which in this case are very close to homography. In this case, the homography transmissions in Cusp, and the transmissions of the inflection points in an inflection point in an inflection point are identical. Accordingly, there is a correlation between the quantities of the curvature in the corresponding points. Furthermore, in the majority of practical cases, homography between the isophoto curves is very close to the similarity of the transformation occurring in the plane between the quantities of the curvature in the corresponding points of similarity."}, {"heading": "3.2 Searching for epipoles", "text": "In this section we present a division of the infinite plane into a finite number of regions.

In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted.
