The long-term aim of our project is to provide solid foundations for a large-scale integration of various kinds of knowledge, including basic terms, rock classification algorithms, findings and reports. We describe three steps we have taken towards that goal here. First, we develop a semi-automated procedure for transforming a database of igneous rock samples to texts in a controlled natural language (CNL), and then a collection of OWL ontologies. Second, we create an OWL ontology of important petrology terms currently described in natural language thesauri. We describe a prototype of a tool for collecting definitions from domain experts. Third, we present an approach to formalization of current industrial standards for classification of rock samples, which requires linear equations in OWL 2. In conclusion, we discuss a range of opportunities arising from the use of semantic technologies in petrology and outline the future work in this area.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2011 07:01:59 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1510v1", "10 pages.

Kuhn: CNLs are subsets of natural languages that are limited in such a way that their automatic translation into formal logic enables it. p.5 [9] We consider CNL to be a universal tool for the representation of formal ontological knowledge. The details of the proposed extensions are available at http: / / www.w3.org / TR / owl2-linear /. Our work on petrology can be considered as an application example.

These rules are the specification for SQL scripts that convert RDB to CNL text [15].OWL ontology: retrieve and analyze.
