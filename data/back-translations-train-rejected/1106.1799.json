Con lusion", "text": "In this note, I show that the problem of determining the optimal path diagram model is NPhard for a variety of ommonic learning approaches; the negative result for learning optimal path diagram models is in contrast to the positive result of learning tree diagram models. This hardness result underscores a potential discomfort with hardness. That is, one can solve a simple problem by raising an unsuitable subclass of models. Perhaps, by selectively lifting a broader range of models than tree diagram models, one can identify interesting graphic models to solve the problem of determining an optimal model. Another interesting problem is that graphic models are not grinded in this note (e.g. Lauritzen, 1996). Methods for learning leaky graphic models are directly related to the methods of the ground path in Se 2. In fact, for solving leaky path models, the problem is difficult to solve, as formulated in this year."}, {"heading": "Referen es", "text": "Boehnke, M., K., & Cox, D.
