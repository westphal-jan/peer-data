For normal modal logics, fusions have been investigated in detail. In particular, it is known that, under certain conditions, decidability transfers from the component logics to their fusion. Though description logics are closely related to modal logics, they are not necessarily normal. In addition, ABox reasoning in description logics is not covered by the results from modal logics. In this paper, we extend the decidability transfer results from normal modal logics to a large class of description logics. To cover different description logics in a uniform way, we introduce abstract description systems, which can be seen as a common generalization of description and modal logics, and show the transfer results in this general setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 13:18:57 GMT  (239kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1802v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["f baader", "c lutz", "h sturm", "f wolter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.1802"}, "pdf": {"name": "1106.1802.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Franz Baader", "baader s.rwth-aa"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is not only the way in which people get involved in the world, but also the way in which they get involved in the world, how they get involved in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the,"}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2013, "abstractText": "Fusions are a simple way of ombining logi s.
