Introduction", "text": "A belief network is a compact representation of a probability distribution (Pearl, 1988; Jensen, 2001). It consists of two parts, one qualitative and another quantitative. The qualitative part of a belief network is a set of conditional probability tables (CPTs) that quantitatively capture our beliefs in such influences. Figure 1 shows the structure of a belief network and the edges represent direct influences between these variables."}, {"heading": "2. The Tuning of Network Parameters", "text": "In this section, we report on a tool we have developed, called SamIam, for finetuning network parameters (Laskey, 1995; Castillo, Gutie \u0301 rrez, & Hadi, 1997; Jensen, 1999; Kj\u00e6rulff & van der Gaag, 2000; Darwiche, 2000).Given a faith network, some proofs e which are an instantiation of variable E in the faith network, and two events y and z of variables Y and Z, respectively, where Y, Z 6% E, our tool can efficiently identify parameter changes necessary to enforce the following types of constraints: difference: Pr (y | e) \u2212 Pr (z | e)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Binary Variables", "text": "We first consider the parameters of a binary variable X, with two values x and x, and, therefore, two parameters \u03b8x and \u03b8x | u for each parental instance. We assume that for each variable X and parental instance u we have a meta-parameter percx, which would lead to a simultaneous change in both aspects. We use the meta-parameter percx, because it is not useful to determine only the size of the change in the meta-parameter percx, which would lead to a simultaneous change in both aspects. We first observe that the probability of an instance x, Pr (e), is a linear function in a network."}, {"heading": "2.2 Multi-Valued Variables", "text": "Our results can easily be extended to multi-value variables, as long as we assume that a model is required for changing co-varying parameters = simultaneous changes (Darwiche, 2000; Kj\u00e6rulff & van der Gaag, 2000). After the parameter change, we must use a scheme to change the other parameters, \u03b8xi | u for all xi = x to ensure the sum-to-one constraint. The most common way to do this is to use the ratio scheme. In this scheme, we change the other parameters so that the ratios between them remain the same. For example, suppose we have three parameters Phenomenx1 | u =.6 and Phenomenx2 =.3 | u =.1. After the changes in.8, the other two parameter values we are changed to Phenomenx2 (.2 /.3) =.15 and Phenomenx3 =.4 = accordingly, we define the scheme."}, {"heading": "3. The Sensitivity of Probabilistic Queries to Parameters Changes", "text": "Our starting point for understanding the sensitivity of a query Pr (y | e) to changes in a meta-parameter \u03c4x | u is the analysis of the derived results Pr (y | e) / \u2202 \u03c4x | u. In our analysis we assume that X is binary, but Y and all other variables in the network can be evaluated multiple times. The following theory provides a simple boundary in relation to this derivative, in relation to Pr (y | e) and Pr (x | u) only if we use this simple boundary to investigate the effects of changes in meta parameter on probability queries. Theorem 3.1 If X is a binary variable in a belief network, then: 4% and Pr (e)."}, {"heading": "4. Changes that (Don\u2019t) Matter", "text": "We now return to a central question: When are changes in network parameters important and when not? As we have already mentioned, there are experimental studies that examine the robustness of faith networks to parameter changes (Pradhan et al., 1996), but we have also shown very simple and intuitive examples in which networks can be very sensitive to small parameter changes, which requires a better understanding of the effects of parameter changes on queries, so that one can intuitively sort out situations in which such changes matter or do not matter. Our goal in this section is to further develop such an understanding by examining some of the implications of theorem 3.3. First, we highlight the difference between this theorem and previous sensitivity analysis results."}, {"heading": "4.1 Network-Specific Sensitivity Analysis", "text": "One of the main differences between our results and other approaches to sensitivity analysis is that we do not need to know the faith network and therefore do not need to draw any conclusions. To illustrate this difference, we compare it with the sensitivity function approach (van der Gaag & Renooij, 2001), which calculates the sensitivity function that a query, f (x), and a parameter, x, in the form of: f (x) = a \u00b7 x + bc \u00b7 x + d, where a, b, c, d are constants that depend on the given network and are calculated by inference, as suggested by van der Gaag and Renooij (2001). Returning to Example 2.1, we can express the query Pr (fire, smoke, report) as a function of the parameter x = Pr (smoke | fire) and the function is determined by the following parameters: f (x) = 0.0031650.9684 \u00b7 x + 0.0005, and we can see this function increased by Figure 6.01, which we can see the value in the value of the 6.01."}, {"heading": "4.2 Assuring Query Robustness", "text": "One of the important questions that we still have to clarify is: \"What does it mean for a parameter change that it does not matter?\" One can imagine at least three definitions: First, the absolute change in probability Pr (y | e) is small. Second, the relative change in probabilities Pr (y | e) is small. Third, the relative change in probabilities O (y | e) is small. The first idea is the most widely used in the literature, so we will assume it for the rest of this section that we have a faith network for a diagnostic application and assume that we care about the robustness of the query Pr (y | e) in relation to changes in network parameters. In this application, y is a certain disease that predicts the disease, with Pr (y | e) =.9 Let us define robustness in this case to be an absolute change in the given query."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "Based on this technique, we have experimented with some faith networks, only to find that these networks are more sensitive to parameter changes than previous experimental studies suggest. This observation leads us to an analytical study of the effect of parameter changes, with the aim of characterizing situations in which parameter changes do not matter or do not matter. We have reported on a number of results in this direction. Our central finding shows that faith networks are robust in a very specific sense: the relative change in query odds is limited by the relative change in parameter rates. A closer look at this result, its significance and its impact provides interesting characterizations of parameter changes that matter or do not matter, and analytically explains some of the earlier experimental results and observations on the subject."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "A shorter version of this article appeared in Proceedings of the 17th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI-01), pp. 65-74.
