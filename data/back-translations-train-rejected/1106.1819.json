We then provide a knowledge compilation map, which analyzes a large number of existing target compilation languages according to their succinctness and their polytime transformations and queries. We argue that such analysis is necessary for placing new compilation approaches within the context of existing ones. We also go beyond classical, flat target compilation languages based on CNF and DNF, and consider a richer, nested class based on directed acyclic graphs (such as OBDDs), which we show to include a relatively large number of target compilation languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 13:56:25 GMT  (385kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1819v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["a darwiche", "p marquis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.1819"}, "pdf": {"name": "1106.1819.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Knowledge Compilation Map", "authors": ["Adnan Darwiche", "Pierre Marquis"], "emails": ["darwiche@cs.ucla.edu", "marquis@cril.univ-artois.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Querying a Compiled Theory", "text": "In assessing the suitability of a target compilation language for a particular application, one can also take into account the conciseness of the formulation, which must be weighed against the totality of questions and transformations it supports in the majority of questions. We limit our attention in this essay to the existence of multitemporal algorithms for answering questions, but we do not present the algorithms themselves. Interested readers are referred to (Darwiche, 2001a, 2001b, 1999), for some of these algorithms, and to the proofs of theorems in other languages. The queries we consider are tests for consistency, validity, implicit expropriation), implications, equivalence, and entative theory."}, {"heading": "5. Transforming a Compiled Theory", "text": "A transformation, on the other hand, is an operation that returns a modified theory without changing it. A transformation, on the other hand, is an operation that returns a modified theory, which is then operated with the help of queries. Many applications require a combination of transformations and queries.Definition 5.1 (from L to a formula of L that is logically equivalent to L.) Let L be a subset of NNF that is logically equivalent to L 1. Definition 5.2 (from C) Let L be a subset of L that is logically equivalent to L 1. Definition 5.2 (from C) Let L be a subset of NF. L satisfies a polytime algorithm that equals each formula of L to a formula of L that is logically equivalent to L. If a language meets one of the above properties, we will say that it is closed under the corresponding logical terminations."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "The second main contribution of the paper is a comprehensive analysis of more than a dozen languages, for which we have created a knowledge map in which these languages are sorted according to their conciseness and the polytemporal queries and transformations they support. This map allows system designers to make informed decisions about which target compilation language to use: after the class of queries / transformations is decided on the basis of the application of interest, the designer chooses the most concise target compilation art to support such operations in polytime. Another key contribution of this paper is the uniform treatment we have applied to different target compilation languages, showing how they are all subgroups of the NNF language. Specifically, we have identified a number of simple but significant characteristics, including decompilability, determination and determination, that well represent NPI combinations."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This is a revised and expanded version of the paper \"A Perspective on Knowledge Compilation,\" in Proceedings of the 17th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI '01), pp. 175-182, 2001.

In each step, we prove a number of concise relationships between different languages and then apply the transitivity of the concise relationship to derive even more relationships from it.

In each step, we prove a series of results that are aligned with each step of the proof. Since each step of the proof is a table in which we highlight all the results that are proven in this step, the table of the last step contains all the results that can be translated from this sentence into equivalent s-NNF sentences in polytime (Lemma A.1). Given the fact that CO is in NP hard (resp. VA is coNP hard) for classic CNF sentences (resp. DNF) sentences, and the inclusion between the various NNF subsets reported in Figure 4, we obtain the table.Table 17: SE implies both CO and CO and VA (Lemma A.10)."}, {"heading": "Proof of Proposition 5.1", "text": "The proof of this statement is divided into eight steps. Each step corresponds to one of the transformations in which we prove all results related to this transformation. To show that a language L meets the requirements for CD, we want to show that for each implicit formula L and each consistent term \u03b3, we can construct in each of these languages a sentence that belongs to L and is equivalent to a sentence in the same language. In the case of DNF (resp. CNF), some inconsistent terms (valid clauses) may be fulfilled by conditioning, but these can easily be removed in a polynomial way. - DNNF is sufficient to prove that conditioning preserves decompressibility."}], "references": [{"title": "Planning via model checking: a decision procedure for AR", "author": ["A.
