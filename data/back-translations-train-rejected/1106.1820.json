Impact of Ordering on the Overall Quality of a Summary", "text": "Although the problem of ordering information for multipliers has attracted relatively little attention, we hypothesize that a good order is crucial to producing quality summaries. Ideally, the consensus architecture of the state of things that are summarized consists of a content selection module in which the relevant information is extracted and a regeneration module in which the information is converted into a flowing text. Ideally, the regeneration architecture includes devices that perform a surface repair of the text by making a summary or selecting the corresponding lexical paraphrases. Our contention in this paper is that the multiplication architecture needs an explicit ordering component. If two pieces of information are summarized but not summarized, then one more surface mark should be selected."}, {"heading": "4. Naive Ordering Algorithms Are Not Sufficient", "text": "In this section, we describe two algorithms: http: / / www.cs.columbia.edu / nlp / newsblasterfor ordering sentences suitable for summarizing multiple documents in the news genre.The first algorithm, Majority Ordering (MO), relies only on the original sentence sequence in the input documents; the second, Chronological Ordering (CO), uses time-related features to order sentences. This strategy was originally implemented in MultiGen, followed by other summing systems (Radev, Jing, & Budzikowska, 2000; Lin & Hovy, 2001).In the MultiGen framework, ordering sentences corresponds to ordering themes, and we describe the algorithms related to themes.

To adopt the majority of the texts in which Th1 and Th2 occur, the sequence must be varied between the sentences of Th1 and Th2. This strategy defines a pair sequence between the subjects, but this pair relationship is not necessarily transitive.

Results are shown in Figure 13: ten summaries were rated as bad, eight were rated as fair, and seven were rated as good.

To confirm this hypothesis, we identified sentences that broke the original chronological order and restored the order manually. Interestingly, the shifted sentences were mainly background information."}, {"heading": "5.

We noticed that within the multiple orders of a sentence, some sentences always appear together; they do not appear in the same order from one order to the next, but they share an adjacent relationship. From now on, we refer to them as blocks. For each sentence, we identify blocks by automatically grouping sentences across orders. We use the average number of sentences that separate them across all orders as a distance measurement between two sentences. In Figure 10, for example, the distance between sentences D and G is 2. The blocks that are identified by clustering are: sentences B, D, G and I; sentences A and J; sentences C and F; and sentences E and H. We observed that all blocks in the experiment correspond to clusters of topically related sentences. These blocks form units of text that have to do with the same theme. In other words, all valid orders contain blocks that are contiguous."}, {"heading": "6. The Augmented Algorithm", "text": "The output of the CO algorithm is impaired if the topics are distributed throughout the text and violate the cohesion properties (McCoy & Cheng, 1991).A typical scenario is in Figure 11. The inputs are texts T1, T2, T3 (ordered by publication time).A1, A2, and A3 belong to the same topic whose intersection is A, and likewise for B and C. Topics A and B are thematically related, but C is not related. The summary S1, which is based only on chronological references, contains two thematic shifts: from A to C and back from C to B. A better summary would be S2, which holds A and B together."}, {"heading": "6.1 The Algorithm", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "6.2 Evaluation", "text": "The results are shown in Figure 13. The manual effort required to compare and evaluate the system results is comprehensive, considering that each human judge had to read three summaries for each input and skim the input texts to ensure that no misleading information was included in the summaries. Overall, there were 75 summaries that needed to be evaluated.The size of our corpus is comparable to the collection used for the DUC evaluation (30 summaries).This evaluation shows a significant improvement in the quality of explanations from the CO algorithm to the advanced algorithm. To assess the importance of the improvement, we used the Fisher test and confused bad and fair summaries in one category (p-value of 0.04).The advanced algorithm also shows an improvement in the MO value (0.007)."}, {"heading": "7.

Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we examined the arrangement of constraints in the majority of documents in the news genre. We evaluated two alternative constraints (CO) and majority orders (MO). Our experiments show that MO performs well only if all input texts follow a similar organization. In the areas where these constraints apply, MO would be an appropriate and highly effective strategy. But in the news genre, we cannot make this assumption. So it is not an appropriate solution. Chronological order (CO) can provide an acceptable solution for many cases, but it is not sufficient if the summaries contain information that is not based on events."}, {"heading": "9.
