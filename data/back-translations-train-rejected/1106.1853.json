How each curve can be expressed by several ordered sequences passed by several common points (turn points), we develop a dynamic programming algorithm to detect the order of curve type data, which can be traced back to the longest increasing sequence problem (Schensted, 1961).

The disturbed points in our minds (natural principle) could be the fourth, 15th, 16th, 18th, 22nd, 24th, 27th and 36th. If we remove these points, we can have a clean row like Fig. 9.

That's a kind of order, and that's what the algorithm tells us. What inner order we have, what outer order we achieve.
