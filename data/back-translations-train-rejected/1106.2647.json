Recursive models are shown to correspond precisely to a subclass of (possible-world) counterfactual structures. On the other hand, a slight generalization of recursive models, models where all equations have unique solutions, is shown to be incomparable in expressive power to counterfactual structures, despite the fact that the Galles and Pearl arguments should apply to them as well. The problem with the Galles and Pearl argument is identified: an axiom that they viewed as irrelevant, because it involved disjunction (which was not in their language), is not irrelevant at all.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2011 09:34:05 GMT  (42kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2647v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 17 Aug 2013 13:36:57 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2647v2", "A preliminary version of this paper appears in the Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2010), 2010.}"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["joseph y halpern"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.2647"}, "pdf": {"name": "1106.2647.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "From Causal Models To Counterfactual Structures", "authors": ["Joseph Y.

We can take primitive propositions that also correspond to the constellations of these variables; that is, the primitive propositions are in the form of MD = i, L = i, for i.

Specifically, causal models where the equations are recursive can be viewed as defining a strict subclass of the standard possible-worlds semantics. More precisely, a set of structural equation defines a world w (characterized by the unique solution to the equations) and can be implicitly viewed as defining an ordering relation on worlds such that, for every formula ~ X = ~x, the solution to the equations when ~ X is set to ~x determines a world w ~ X=~x that is the world closest to w according to the ordering such that ~ X = ~x. Somewhat surprisingly, this is not the case if we go to the larger class of causal models defined by equations that are not recursive, but have a unique solution for all settings ~ X = ~x. Of course, it is still the case that there is a world w ~ X=~x determined by the equations when ~ X is set to ~x. However, there is, in general, no ordering on worlds such that w ~ X=~x is the closest world to w according to the ordering. A closeness ordering on worlds places some restrictions (e.g., those characterized by the formula \u00ac\u03c6 in Theorem 3.7) that do not hold in all causal models in Tuniq. So where does this leave us? It is still the case that, in causal models, a formula such as \u03c6 \u03c8 is true at a world w if \u03c8 is true at some appropriate world w\u2032 satisfying \u03c6. However, w\u2032 cannot be viewed as the \u201cclosest\u201d world to w satisfying \u03c6. This leaves open the question of whether there are other ways of defining \u201cappropriateness\u201d other than \u201ccloseness\u201d. I do not have strong intuitions here, but it is a question that is perhaps worth pursuing. My own feeling is that these arguments show that models in Tuniq \u2212 Trec are actually not good models for causality. It is quite difficult to verify that a nonrecursive causal model is in Tuniq, as the model T given in Theorem 3.7 satisfying \u03c6 shows. I am not aware of any interesting real-world situation that is captured by a model in Tuniq \u2212 Trec. Further evidence of the \u201cunreasonableness\u201d of models in Tuniq \u2212 Trec is given by recent work of Zhang, Lam, and de Clerq [2012].

I suspect that there is an interesting class of nonrecursive causal models that can be captured in Lewis\u2019s framework, and that these will turn out to be the models that actually arise in practice.

Recursive models are shown to correspond precisely to a subclass of (possible-world) counterfactual structures. On the other hand, a slight generalization of recursive models, models where all equations have unique solutions, is shown to be incomparable in expressive power to counterfactual structures, despite the fact that the Galles and Pearl arguments should apply to them as well.
