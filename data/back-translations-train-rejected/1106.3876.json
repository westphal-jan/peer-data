Limit of traditional ontologies for uncertainty representation", "text": "One of the biggest limitations of traditional ontology formalities is the lack of consistent support for uncertainty, reliability and inaccuracy. In fact, ontologies currently being drafted contain only concepts and relationships that describe alleged facts about the world. This means that ontology itself is not insecure in its nature, but rather represents an a priori model of the world that must be considered true by its users. However, in many cases it is preferable to store information even if it is inaccurate and uncertain, rather than interpreting its content restrictively, which will lead to the storage of erroneous information. Currently, there is no standard mechanism for interoperable description and exchange of uncertain information about ontologies, and even less a standard for reasoning about this type of information. However, many researchers are currently trying to improve ontological capabilities in this area. Indeed, the requirement of representation has prompted the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to make the uncertainty about the reasons for the Group's 2008 Invisible to the Web Invisibility Report final."}, {"heading": "B. Probabilistic Approaches", "text": "In fact, it is that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able, that we are able to put ourselves in the lead."}, {"heading": "C. Fuzzy Approaches", "text": "FuzzyDL [10] is one of the most successful tools that suggests a fuzzy description language associated with an argumentation engine. Even if the syntax is based on fuzzy SHIF, we can translate a basic ontology into a fuzzyDL file thanks to a certain API. Then, fuzzy statements can be added to this file, or we can directly use fuzzyOntology. The latter is an OWL ontology that can be used to encode fuzzy OWL statements, and thanks to a parser, it can be translated into a fuzzyDL file. Finally, it supports two types of arguments: Zadeh semantics and Lukasiewicz logic. However, we could point out that the implementation is only intended to run on either MacOSX or Linux."}, {"heading": "D. Dempster-Shafer Approaches", "text": "The Dempster-Shafer Theory [11], also known as the Evidence Theory or Theory of Faith Functions, was developed by Glenn Shafer in 1975 after the work of Arthur P. Dempster. Belief in a hypothesis is calculated as the sum of the masses of all the sets it contains. It is often presented as a generalization of probability theory. In short, it allows the combination of evidence from different sources and the achievement of a degree of belief (represented by a belief function) that takes into account all available evidence. As far as ontology is concerned, it has so far been most widely applied in areas such as inconsistency treatment in OWL ontologies and ontology mapping ([14] and [15]), which are based on the hypothesis that ontologies do not deal with uncertainty but create uncertainty when they group a set of ontologies."}, {"heading": "III. MODELING AND REASONING ON DEMPSTER-SHAFER THEORY", "text": "We will now present the obvious advantages of the theory of the functions of faith, which lead us to look for a tool to implement this theory. However, according to this brief state of the art, and to our knowledge, there is currently no tool based on the Dempster-Shafer theory that fits our purpose, which is to represent and substantiate the uncertainty contained in our data / information."}, {"heading": "A. Advantages of Dempster-Shafer Theory", "text": "In the theory of uncertainty representation, we encountered an important difficulty in testing these tools in terms of the type of knowledge available in the input of data fusion applications. Indeed, the representation of the absence of information is poorly considered by probability theory. Indeed, prior and conditional probabilities must be specified in probabilistic methods. This requirement often results in a symmetry argument (minimax error) being used to assign previous probabilities to random variables (e.g. the mapping of 0.5 to binary values for which no information is available is more likely). However, any information contained in the missing priors and conditionals is not used within the Dempster shafer framework unless it can be achieved indirectly - and is then available for calculation using Bayes equations. One of the main advantages of the Dempster shafer theory is that the theory based on probability theory does not age."}, {"heading": "B. Ontological Representation", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "C. Reasoning on uncertain ontological aspects", "text": "Once we had a clear general representation of Dempster shafers for any arbitrary field, it was fairly easy to implement a Java application based on the Jena framework, which allows us to automatically think about the insecure objects contained in ontology. Jena is an open source Java framework for building semantic web applications. In fact, it provides a programmatic environment for RDF, RDFS and OWL, SPARQL, and contains a rules-based inference engine. In our application, the Jena framework is a tool for retrieving the instances associated with each insecure concept and the collected stenter-shafer information. This information is then transferred to a common basic dempster-shafer library [17], which then performs calculations in the Dempster-shafer theory. In other words, our Java application first forms our ontology-based annotation ab (the set of instances are represented, for example, the combination of numbers, shown in Figure 3)."}, {"heading": "D. Advantages, limits and future work", "text": "For now, we have a simple mechanism to instantiate our domain ontology in an uncertain way by importing the Dempster-Shafer ontology.The advantage of this method is that you can come with any domain ontology and instantiate it without making any changes to that ontology. This is mainly due to the fact that OWL is a structured language, but flexible enough to overcome the strict definition of properties that limit the value of the domain or domain to a few specific classes. What we mean is that we need to modify the original ontology slightly during the final phase of the instantiation of certain classes in terms of uncertain concepts. In fact, it would be impossible to link a property to an instance of Uncertain _ concept (in the role of reach or domain), since that class does not appear in the property definition in the domain ontology."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSION", "text": "In conclusion, let us remember that data fusion is the art of managing a lot of information that is imperfect in several respects and, in the end, offering a clearer view of the situation, i.e. less uncertain. Therefore, there is currently a serious lack of ontological capacity. Therefore, we have seen that the extension of uncertainty to OWL has made great progress in recent years. In this paper, we have proposed a simple approach to address the problem of representation of uncertainty based on the evidence approach. We have presented a mechanism to get our domain ontology going thanks to DS ontology. The advantage of this method is that you can come with any domain ontology and start it in an uncertain way without making any changes in domain ontology."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We are grateful to Arnaud Saval and Khaled Khelif for their comments and hope that the revised paper will address their concerns."}], "references": [{"title": "Introduction to the Semantic Web and Semantic Web Services", "author": ["Liyang Yu"], "venue": "Capman & Hall/CRC,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Use Cases for Ontologies in Information Fusion, Information Fusion", "author": ["Mieczyslaw M.
