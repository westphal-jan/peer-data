Though the sensitivity to coincidences has often been presented as resulting from an erroneous assessment of probability, it appears to be a genuine competence, based on non-trivial computations. The model presented here suggests that coincidences occur when subjects perceive complexity drops. Co-occurring events are, together, simpler than if considered separately.

We need the concept of the computational sequence recorded with the operator *. Sequence D1 * D2 means that the W machine must generate D1 before it creates D2: Cw (D1 * D2) = Cw (D1) + Cw (e1) > Cw (e1) + Cw (e2) - C (e2) - The inequality results from the fact that the computational sequence for the O machine is suboptimal. We can now verify the eight specifications.Analogy: This formula correctly predicts the meaning of a close analogy between the two events."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The research on the cognitive role of descriptive complexity initiated in recent years has already yielded valuable results, and the model presented in this paper should be understood as a contribution to this endeavour and should be extended in two directions. Firstly, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of the processes by which human subjects assess the descriptive complexity, and to see how they are consistent with the definitions used in the present model. Secondly, it will be interesting to confront the various predictions of the model with actual reactions of subjects presented with different versions of coincidences, as we did with probability estimates (Dessalles 2006). Parameters can be manipulated depending on the model to influence surprises. However, such studies can prove tricky as surprises cannot be produced successively in the same subjects. An important conclusion that the model strongly suggests is that the human mind is able to perform non-formal calculations."}], "references": [{"title": "The base-rate fallacy in probability judgments", "author": ["M.
