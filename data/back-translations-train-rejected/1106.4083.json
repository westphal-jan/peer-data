This corresponds to a memory expenditure of O (| V |), where V is the set of nodes in the underlying graph. Due to the simple geometric nature of empty rectangles, the amount of macro edges connected to each perimeter node can be calculated spontaneously in constant time. Dynamic Environments: In many application areas, especially video games, the assumption of a static environment is sometimes unreasonable. For example, obstacles may occur in the grid or existing obstacles may be destroyed during the game. In such cases, the underlying graph representing the world needs to be updated. If a new obstacle emerges or an existing one is destroyed, we can simply invalidate the affected rectangles and recalculate new ones."}, {"heading": "7 Experimental Setup", "text": "We evaluate the performance of RSR using three benchmarks from the freely available Scout Library Hierarchical Open Graph (HOG) 2: Adaptive Depth is a set of 12 cards 100 x 100, in which approximately 13 of each card is divided into rectangular rooms of different sizes and a large open area with large randomly placed obstacles. Baldur's Gate is a set of 120 cards taken from the popular role-playing game Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. These cards often appear as the standard benchmark in literature [1, 6, 8] and range from 50 x 50 to 320 x 320 and feature a distinctive 45 degree orientation. Rooms is a set of 300 cards 256 x 256, divided into symmetrical rows of small rectangular ranges."}, {"heading": "8 Results", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "We present RSR, a new search space reduction algorithm applicable to path finding on unified cost network maps. RSR is fast, memory efficient, optimal, and in some cases can make search completely superfluous. Compared to 4ERR [6], on which RSR is based, A * is up to 38 times faster than others.12We compare RSR with a number of search space reduction algorithms from literature. Compared to 4ERR [8], on which it is based, RSR is displayed significantly faster on cases where both methods can be applied (i.e. 4-networked maps). Next, we compare RSR with swamp-based intersection [8] and show that the two algorithms have complementary strengths. We find that swamps are more useful on maps with small open areas, while RSR becomes more effective as larger open areas are available on a map."}, {"heading": "10 Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank Alban Grastien and Patrik Haslum for their feedback on early drafts of this work.
