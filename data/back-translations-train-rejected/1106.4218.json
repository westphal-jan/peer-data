Despite the flourishing of different models and theories in both fields, several key questions still remain unanswered. The understanding of how opinions change and the way they are affected by social influence are challenging issues requiring a thorough analysis of opinion per se but also of the way in which they travel between agents' minds and are modulated by these exchanges. To account for the two-faceted nature of opinions, which are mental entities undergoing complex social processes, we outline a preliminary model in which a cognitive theory of opinions is put forward and it is paired with a formal description of them and of their spreading among minds.

In addition, grounding of opinions in the minds allows to take into account not only direct revision processes triggered by comparison with other opinions, i.e. social influences, but also revisions based on changes in other mental representations that support this opinion. The computer model presented in this paper aims to provide a preliminary unifying framework for defining opinions and characterizing their dynamics in a simple but non-reductionist approach.

Let us consider a series of units V (or nodes), a series of relationships E between these units (edges), and an alphabet L that takes into account any property that might have (label) a relationship; that is, E V \u00b7 V \u00b7 L. L can contain multi-value elements. It is assumed that the relationships (interactions) between units take place over a time dimension (continuous or discrete) T of the lifespan of the system, which is generally a subset of N (discrete time systems) or R (continuous time systems).

Such an aspect is modeled by the introduction of a real number that stands for tolerance or uncertainty, so that an agent with Opinion x interacts only with agents whose opinions are interval x, x +. Such a model does not provide an explanation for the broad, massive and disciplinary use of the BCM ([18, 14]), ranging from \"viral marketing\" to the distortions of opinion played by the Italians through controlled mass media (24, 4, 5, 14]). Such a model does not provide an explanation for the phenomena that lead to the tolerance value, it is simply assumed to be considered static value. In this work, we will sketch out the factors that influence the acceptance or rejection of others."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this preparatory work, we have tried to design a cognitively based dynamic opinion model, in which we defined these mental representations as carachterized by the presence of three specific characteristics. In contrast to psychological theories of opinions, which usually provide rich definitions that are too complex to reduce to measurable variables, we have isolated three essential constitutive elements that characterize this type of mental representation. On the other hand, we have tried to overcome the reductionist approach of opinion-dynamic models, in which the wealth of human cognitive processes is replaced by easily calculable factors that have little to do with actual human behavior. Therefore, we have proposed to apply time-varying diagrams in order to develop a formal model that is capable of taking into account the way opinions are generated and changed depending on the presence and opinions of other actors in the network. We are fully aware of the complexity of this problem, and this work represents a preliminary attempt to merge cognitive opinions with a narrow cognitive approach."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank two anonymous referees for their useful comments and participants of the workshop on gossip and opinions (Rome, June 2010, ISTC CNR), and special thanks to Isabella Poggi and Cristiano Castelfranchi for their comments."}], "references": [{"title": "Situating social influence processes: Dynamic, multidirectional flows of influence within social networks", "author": ["E.
