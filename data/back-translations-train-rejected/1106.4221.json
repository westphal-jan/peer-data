Conclusions", "text": "In this preparatory work, we have tried to construct a cognitively based dynamic opinion model, in which we defined these mental representations as carachterized by the presence of three specific characteristics. In contrast to psychological theories of opinions, which usually provide rich definitions that are too complex to reduce to measurable variables, we have isolated three essential constitutive elements that characterize this type of mental representation. On the other hand, we have tried to overcome the reductionist approach of opinion-dynamic models, in which the wealth of human cognitive processes is replaced by easily calculable factors that are little related to actual human behaviors. For this reason, we have proposed to apply time-varying diagrams to develop a formal model that is capable of taking into account the way opinions are generated and changed depending on the presence and opinions of other actors in the network. We are fully aware of the complexity of this problem, and this work represents a preliminary attempt to combine cognitive opinions with a cognitive approach."}, {"heading": "6.
