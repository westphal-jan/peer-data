This problem emerges when one considers what happens at the moment of transition from, say, truth to falsehood of a meaningful variable. The solution we adopt is a combination of the pragmatic and the philosophically principled. The pragmatic element is that we choose to model actions as immediate transitions with effects that begin at the moment of application, thus marking the endpoints of the intervals that are closed on the left and open on the right, ensuring that the intervals interact without inconsistency and the truths of the proposals. The same semi-open, semi-closed plan is adopted elsewhere."}, {"heading": "11.4 Planning with Time", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only be a matter of time before it is so far, until it is so far."}, {"heading": "12.
