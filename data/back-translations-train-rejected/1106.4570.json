However, the way to select a proper action when facing other agents is quite unclear. Most work in AI adopts classical game-theoretic equilibrium analysis to predict agent behavior in such settings. This approach however does not provide us with any guarantee for the agent. In this paper we introduce competitive safety analysis. This approach bridges the gap between the desired normative AI approach, where a strategy should be selected in order to guarantee a desired payoff, and equilibrium analysis. We show that a safety level strategy is able to guarantee the value obtained in a Nash equilibrium, in several classical computer science settings. Then, we discuss the concept of competitive safety strategies, and illustrate its use in a decentralized load balancing setting, typical to network problems. In particular, we show that when we have many agents, it is possible to guarantee an expected payoff which is a factor of 8/9 of the payoff obtained in a Nash equilibrium. Our discussion of competitive safety analysis for decentralized load balancing is further developed to deal with many communication links and arbitrary speeds. Finally, we discuss the extension of the above concepts to Bayesian games, and illustrate their use in a basic auctions setup.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2011 20:56:47 GMT  (190kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4570v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["m tennenholtz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.4570"}, "pdf": {"name": "1106.4570.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Competitive Safety Analysis: Robust Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Systems", "authors": ["Moshe Tennenholtz"], "emails": ["moshet@ie.technion.ac.il"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Decentralized Load Balancing", "text": "In this section, we look at decentralized load balancing, where two rational players must submit messages in a simple communication network: a network of two parallel communication lines e1, e2, and t. Each player has a message to send from s to t, and he must choose the path to choose. However, the communication line e1 is faster, and therefore the value of sending a single message along e1 X > 0, while the value of sending a single message along e2 is about 0.5 < \u03b1 < 1.4 Each player must choose the communication line to be used to send his message from s to t. If both players choose the same communication line, the value for each of them falls by a factor of two (a player receives X2, if both players choose e1, and a player receives such a solution if both players choose e2). In a matrix form, this game can be represented as follows: M = (X / 2, X / 2, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X2, X, X, X2, X, X, X2, X, X, X2, X, X2, X, X2, X, X, X2, X2, X1, X1, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2, X2,"}, {"heading": "4.

Safety Level in General 2 \u00d7 2 Games", "text": "The results in the previous sections relate to 2-person variants of central problems that arise in their respective contexts. In view of the encouraging results in these basic constellations, we want to consider two types of enhancements: 1. Generalize the results to a broader family of simple games. 2. Generalize the results to more general CS-related constellations that relate in particular to games with many players, while q refers to the likelihood of choosing players. 3. In this section, we should not confuse the fact that p \u00b2 has similarities between security levels and Nash balances. In fact, p \u00b2 refers to the likelihood of choosing a1 from players, while q refers to the likelihood that actions will be chosen by players. 2. In this section, we will deal with the first point, and in particular in section 7, we will look at the second. It is interesting to see if our results can be extended in sections 3-4."}, {"heading": "5.1 The Case of Pure Safety-Level Strategies", "text": "The reader may wonder whether the previous result can also be proved in the case where there are no limitations as to the structure of the security strategy q q of the game q. In several AI contexts, pure maximin strategies are discussed where probabilistic behavior is not taken into account. Of course, probabilistic maximin strategies are more powerful and in many cases, the best security level is achieved only by a mixed strategy and not by a pure one. However, it is of interest to consider the case where the security strategy is pure. As we now show, there is a generic, non-reducible 2 \u00b7 2 game g in which the optimal security strategy for a player is pure and the expected gain for that player is lower than the expected gain for that player in all Nash balances of g. Consider g in which a game g in which U1 (1, 1) = 100, U1 (1) = Uilify (2, 1) = 100, U210 (2) = 50, and U2 (1, 100) = 100."}, {"heading": "6. Beyond 2 \u00d7 2 Games", "text": "The leadership choice game is an example of a more general set of games: set theoretical games. In a set theoretical game, the strategies available to players are identical, and each player's payout is clearly determined by the set of strategies chosen by each player. Note, for example, that set theoretical games are very typical of voting contexts. In a typical voting context, we take care of the votes, but not the voter identification. We can prove the following: Set 3 In a 2-person set theoretical game g with a strictly mixed Nash Equilibrium strategy, then the value of an optimal security level strategy of a player Uilis results, but not the voter identification. Statement 3 In a 2-person set theoretical game g with a strictly mixed Nash Equilibrium strategy, then the value of an optimal security level strategy of a player results."}, {"heading": "7.

As an example, let's consider a family of decentralized load balancing settings. The (n \u2212 1) -th game in this advanced load balancing setting will consist of n players, one of whom is i.

Competitive Safety Analysis in Bayesian Games", "text": "The results in the previous sections relate to games with complete information. The games we have examined in this context relate to basic settings in AI and game theory, and deal with topics such as traffic jams. In this section, we show that our ideas can be applied to games with incomplete information as an auction. In a game with incomplete information, the behavior of the player is a fundamental criterion for the theory of economic mechanisms that relate to games with incomplete information. We have chosen to find a very basic mechanism for the auction that is not random. Auctions are fundamental in order to define the theory of economic mechanisms that are elaborated that do not have a dominant strategy."}, {"heading": "9. Discussion", "text": "Some previous work in AI has attempted to demonstrate the potential power of decision-making approaches that are not based on classical game theory analysis. Specifically, work in theoretical computer science has been extended to competitive analysis to address rationality constraints (Tennenholtz, 2001) to be applicable to multi-agent systems. Weintroduced competitive safety analysis, which bridges the gap between the normative AI / CS approach and classical equilibrium analysis, has shown that the observation based on Aumann that security-level strategies can yield the value of a Nash balance in non-zero-sum games is a powerful normative tool for computer scientists and AI researchers interested in protocols for non-cooperative environments."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was carried out while the author was on sabbatical from Stanford University's Department of Computer Science.
