Today is your birthday, so take a cake to the office to share with your colleagues. At tea time, people are arriving slowly. However, since some people have to leave early, you can't wait for everyone to arrive before you start sharing the cake. How do you proceed fairly? This is an example of a problem with online cake cutting. Most previous fair division studies assume that all agents are available at the time of the split [Brams and Taylor, 1996]. Agents arrive and leave depending on which objects are visible, the position of the sun, etc. How do we design an abstract model for a number of practical problems besides birthday parties. For example, consider the timing on a large telescope. Astronomers will have different preferences when they use the telescope, depending on which objects are visible, the position of the sun, etc. How do we design a web-based reservation system so that astronomers can select asynchronous observation times that will be fair to everyone depending on the size of the object you choose as the second issue?"}, {"heading": "2 Online cake cutting", "text": "We assume that agents are risk-averse, that is, they explain ratings of the cake that maximize the minimum value of the cake they receive, regardless of what the other agents do. This is a common assumption in cake cutting. For example, Brams, Jones and Klamler (2006) argue: \"As is common in cake-cutting literature, we postulate that each person's goal is to maximize the value of the cake (maximum piece) that he or she can guarantee, regardless of what the other person does. So we assume that each person is risk-averse: he or she will never choose a strategy that can yield a more valuable piece of cake if he or she has the ability to get less than a maximum.\" We will formulate cake cutting as a division of the unit, [0, 1] between n agents.Definition 1 (cutting) is a set of intervals."}, {"heading": "3 Fairness properties", "text": "In fact, it is that most of us don't know what to do, what it's about, and that they don't know what to do, what it's about, and that they don't know what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is"}, {"heading": "4 Online properties", "text": "We define some fairness characteristics that are specific to online procedures. Proportionality: We weaken the definition of proportionality to test whether the agents receive a fair share of the cake that remains on arrival. A cake cutting process is weakly proportional if each agent allocates at least a portion of the total value of the cake to their pieces, with r being a fraction of the total value that is allocated to the (remaining) cake upon arrival, and k being the number of agents who are allocated cake at that point. Envy: We can weaken the definition of envy to consider only allocating cake after the arrival of a particular agent. A cake cutting process is weak envy-free iff agents rate the cake that is allocated to the agents upon arrival no more than their own. Note that weak envy implies weak proportionality, but not vice versa weak freedom does not imply weak envy."}, {"heading": "5 Online Cut-and-Choose", "text": "It appears almost three thousand years back in Hesiod's poem Theogeny, where Prometheus divides a cow and Zeus selects the part he prefers. However, cut-and-choose is enshrined in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, where it is used to divide the seabed for mining. Incut-and-choose, one agent is the agent who cuts the cake and the other takes the \"half\" they prefer the most. We can extend cut-and-choose to more than two agents by one agent cutting a \"proportional\" slice and giving the agent a piece that values it the most. We then repeat the cake with one less agent and the other takes the \"half\" they prefer the most. \"However, we can extend the cut-and-choose to more than two agents by cutting a\" proportional \"slice and giving the agent who values it the most."}, {"heading": "6 Online moving knife", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they do not want."}, {"heading": "7 Online collusion", "text": "We will show that this is a feature that favors the online cut-and-choice procedure over the online moving-knife procedure. We say that a cut-and-choice procedure is prone (resistant) to online collusion if there is a protocol (non-existent) that the cut-and-choice agents can agree upon that increases or keeps constant the value of the cake that everyone receives. We assume that the agents cannot meet in advance and therefore can only agree to an arrangement if they meet at the cut-and-cut. We also assume that other agents can be present if the agents agree to it. Note that the cut-and-choice agents cannot change their arrival sequence and can only indirectly influence their departure sequence. The arrival sequence is determined in advance, and the sequence of departures is determined by the online cut-and-cut procedure."}, {"heading": "7.1 Online cut-and-choose", "text": "The online cut-and-choice process is resistant to online collusion. Consider, for example, the first two agents who participate: the first agent cuts the cake before the second agent is present (and has agreed to any secret protocol); since the first agent is risk-averse, he cuts the cake proportionally, fearing that the second agent will not participate in collusion; suppose the second agent does not assign a proportional or greater value to this piece; it would be risky for the second agent to agree to a protocol in which he accepts this piece, since he might assign less value to the piece that the first agent later offers as compensation; suppose the second agent assigns a proportional or greater value to this piece; it would therefore be risky for the second agent to agree to a protocol in which he rejects this piece, since he could assign less total value to the piece that he is later assigned, and cake to any agent who offers it as compensation to them."}, {"heading": "7.2 Online moving knife", "text": "Suppose four or more agents cut a cake using the online process, but the first two agents agree to the following protocol: 1. Each agent (tacitly) indicates when the knife is worth more than 34 pieces of the total amount. 2. Each agent calls \"Stop\" as soon as the knife is worth more than 34 pieces of the total amount, and the other agent (tacitly) indicates that the cake is worth as much to him. 3. Note that it is advantageous for the other agents to share this piece of cake with a movable knife. Under this protocol, both agents receive slices that are worth more than 14 pieces of the total value to them. This is better than not to collide. Note that it is advantageous for the agents to agree to agree to a protocol in which they call \"Stop\" later than this. For example, they could agree to arrange to get a stop at (p \u2212 1) p of the total value for half of the cake (more in this case than they \u2212 2)."}, {"heading": "8 Competitive analysis", "text": "An important tool for studying online algorithms is competition analysis. We say that an online algorithm is competitive when the relationship between its performance and the performance of the corresponding offline algorithm is limited."}, {"heading": "8.1 Egalitarian measure", "text": "An egalitarian measure of performance would be the reciprocity of the smallest value an agent assigns to his piece of pie. We take reciprocity such that performance measurement increases when the agent gets less valuable pieces of pie. With such a measure, neither the online cut-and-choice procedure nor the online moving knife procedure are competitive. There are examples with only 3 agents where the competition between the two online procedures is unlimited. The problem is that the cake left over between the late arriving agents can be of very little value to these agents."}, {"heading": "8.2 Utilitarian measure", "text": "A utilitarian measure of performance would be the reciprocity of the sum of the values that the agents assign to their pieces of cake (or equivalent the reciprocity of the mean).With such a measure of performance, the online cutting and selection processes are competitive provided that the total number of agents is limited n. Constructively, the first agent in the online cutting and selection process must receive at least 1n of the total value. Therefore, the sum of the ratings is at least 1n. On the other hand, the sum of the ratings of the corresponding offline algorithm cannot be more than n. Therefore, the competitive relationship cannot be more than n2. In fact, there are examples where the ratio O (n2) is. Thus, the utilitarian competitive relationship itself is limited."}, {"heading": "9 Experimental results", "text": "In order to test the performance of these methods in practice, we conducted some experiments in which we calculated the competitive ratio of the online methods of cutting and cutting and selected methods compared to their offline counterparts. We generated piecemeal linear ratings for each agent by dividing the cake into k random segments and assigning a random value to each segment, thereby normalizing the overall value of the cake. It is an interesting research question whether random ratings are more difficult than ratings that are more correlated. For example, if all agents have the same rating function (i.e., if we have a perfect correlation), then the online method of cutting behaves identically to the offline method. On the other hand, if the evaluation functions are not correlated, online methods of cutting may be fair, especially if late-arriving agents are assigned the slices of cake that are assigned to prematurely departing agents. The results that unrelated instances and the use of some cases need to be interpreted completely randomly."}, {"heading": "10 Online Mark-and-Choose", "text": "That is why we have to wait until it is our turn again, until it is our turn again."}, {"heading": "11 Related work", "text": "There is an extensive literature on fair distribution and cake cutting procedures. See, for example, [Brams and Taylor, 1996]. However, there has been much less work on fair distribution problems similar to those considered here. Thomson is considering a generalization in which the number of agents can increase [Thomson, 1983]. He is investigating whether it is possible to have a procedure in which the assignment of agents is monotonous (i.e. their values do not rise when the number of agents increases), combined with other common characteristics such as weak Pareto optimality. Cloutier et al. consider a different generalization of the cake cutting problem in which the number of agents is fixed, but there are several cakes [Cloutier et al., 2010]. This model provides situations in which, for example, agents want to choose layers over several days. This problem cannot be reduced to several individual cake cutting problems if the ratings of agents are linked to each other (e.g., the authors prefer the same day for each layer)."}, {"heading": "12 Conclusions", "text": "We have proposed an online form of the problem of cake cutting that allows us to explore the concept of fair sharing when agents arrive and leave during the process of dividing a resource. It can be used to model situations, for example, on the Internet, when we need to allocate resources asynchronously. There are many possible future directions for this work. An extension would be unwanted goods (such as housework) where we want as little of them as possible. It would also be interesting to look at the variation of the problem, where agents have partial information about the rating functions of other agents. In voting and other forms of preference aggregation, there has recently been considerable interest in thinking about preferences that are incomplete or partially known [Pini et al., 2007; Walsh et al., 2008]. In cake cutting, agents can act more strategically if they have such incomplete knowledge."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Toby Walsh is supported by the Australian Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, ARC and the Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development (AOARD-104123)."}], "references": [{"title": "Fair Division: From cake-cutting to dispute resolution", "author": ["Brams", "Taylor", "1996.
