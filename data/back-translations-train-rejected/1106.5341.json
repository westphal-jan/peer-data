INTRODUCTIONThe ability to estimate the three-dimensional pose of an articulated object such as a robot or a human being is important for a variety of applications (e.g. [8]). While recent technological advances have made the acquisition of depth images both convenient and affordable, obtaining information from these images remains a challenge - even if the kinematic structure of the target is provided. Popular approaches are often based on domain-specific knowledge and extensive training, and therefore offer little universality for any skeletons in which little or no training data exists. This paper presents results for estimating poses of any kinematic skeleton from a single depth image without prior training. Pose estimation is defined as a model-based estimation problem, and an evolutionary algorithm is used to anticipate the most likely structure of these algorithms based on the most optimal angorithms."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "The vast majority of research into the estimation of the pose focused specifically on the human kinematic skeleton. Recent surveys [5, 6] describe two primary directions: the assembly of the pose using probabilistic recognition of body parts and exemplary methods. Thus, Shotton et al. [7] described a particularly successful approach to the recognition of the human pose, which builds a probabilistic decision tree to first find an approximate pose of body parts, followed by a local optimization step. Although this technique is fast and reliable, it relies on significant training: 24,000 core hours of training on 1 million randomized poses. A primary limitation of these techniques is their dependence on domain-specific information on human kinematics, which does not generalize without explicit and additional training to any skeletons. In comparison, Gall et al. [3] Movement detection with markless camera systems, in order to find postures of complex visual models, such as those created by animals and garments, is not structural."}, {"heading": "III. POSE ESTIMATION VIA EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION", "text": "The estimation of the pose is defined as an optimization problem: s * = argmin s (\u03b8) 1NN * n = 0ln (1 + | | ~ pn \u2212 p * (\u03b8, ~ pn) | | \u03c3) (1), where s (\u03b8) is a skeletal model with the parameters \u03b8, ~ pn is a point from the observed depth picture, ~ p * is the point ~ pn closest to the point taking into account the parameters \u03b8, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the point spacing in the depth image. This optimization problem is a challenge since it is not convex with numerous local optimizers. Therefore, we use an evolutionary algorithm to find the pose parameters. The evolutionary algorithm is a population-based heuristic algorithm that selects and combines iterative solutions to produce increasingly better models [2]. The skeleton is presented as an acyclic linkage of graph parameterizable lengths with conventional equations."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "text": "We recorded a dataset of an articulated robot using the depth sensor of a Kinect camera [1]. Images were taken of two drastically different subjects: the first is a spider model based on a four-legged robot with 8 links that lead to 39 degrees of freedom, while the second is a humanoid model that consists of 17 links to 78 degrees of freedom. For the spider model, we arranged a robot in four different poses and collected five images taken at tilt angles per pose, resulting in a total of twenty depth images. There were several examples of self-exclusions in the dataset. For the humanoid model, eight images of four subjects were taken in a total of 32 images. Images in both datasets were pre-processed with subtraction background. We performed the learning algorithm for 109 objective function evaluations, comprising approximately 10,000 iterations. On a single 2.8 GHz Intel processor per 30 minutes, this required about 70 percent effort."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This work was partially supported by the NIH NIDA grant RC2 DA028981, the NSF CDI grant ECCS 0941561, and the DTRA grant HDTRA 1-09-1-0013.
