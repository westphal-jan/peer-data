BACKGROUND", "text": "Planning is a core area of artificial intelligence (pre o), eff o (part), where both partial goals are achieved (partially). Classical planning is the most basic form of planning that deals with only propositional logic. In this essay, we are working on the SAS + formalistic structure [Jonsson and Ba \ufffd ckstro \ufffd m 1998] of classical planning. SAS + formalism has recently attracted a lot of attention due to a number of advantages it has over traditional STRIPS formalism. Below, we review this formalism and present our notation.Definition 1. A SAS + planning task is defined as a tuple of four elements that attract a lot of attention. - X = {X, O, sG}. - X = {x1, \u00b7 xN} is a set of multi-value state variables, each with an associated finite domain dome (xi). - O is a set of measures and each action o o o o."}, {"heading": "3. PARTIAL ORDER REDUCTION THEORY FOR PLANNING", "text": "POR algorithms (Partial Order Based Reduction) have been extensively studied for model verification [Varpaaniemi 2005; Clarke et al. 2000], which also requires the examination of a state space in order to prove certain characteristics. POR is a technique that allows a search to explore only part of the entire search space and still maintain completeness and / or optimism. Without POR, model verification would be too expensive to be practicable [Holzmann 1997]. POR has not been systematically examined for planning, however. In this section, we will first present the concept of search reduction, and then present a general POR theory for planning that provides sufficient conditions to guide the design of practical POR algorithms."}, {"heading": "3.1 Search reduction for planning", "text": "Most search algorithms work on a defined spatial diagram. For the search for a reduced spatial diagram, there is a reduced solution. For the search for a reduced spatial diagram, a reduction algorithm must be used that reduces the state-space graph into a subgraph, so that a search is performed on the subgraph instead of on the original graph.

The basic idea is to form a stubborn set of applicable measures for each state and only extend the actions in the stubborn line during the search. As planning also examines a large search area, we propose to develop a stubborn set theory for planning. To achieve this, we need to address various subtle problems arising from the differences between model review and planning. We first define the concept of stubborn sets for planning, adapted to the concepts in the model checking.Definition 11 Stubborn Set for Planning."}, {"heading": "3.3 Left commutativity in SAS+ planning", "text": "Note that although Theorem 1 provides an important result for the reduction, it is not directly applicable, since the conditions in Definition 11 are abstract and not directly implementable in algorithms. We must find sufficient conditions for Definition 11, which can facilitate the design of reduction algorithms. In the following, we will define several concepts that may lead to sufficient conditions for Definition 11. Definition 13 State-Dependent Left Commutativity. For an SAS + planning task, an ordered action pair (a, b) is a left commutative in state s, if (a, b) is a valid path in s, and (b, a) is also a valid path in s and results in the same state. We denote such a relationship by s: b \u21d2 Definition 14 State-Independent Left Commutativity.

However, the conditions in Definition 13 are still abstract and not directly implementable, the key result is to efficiently find left commutative action pairs. Now, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for Definition 13, which determine practically left commutativity and facilitate the design of reduction algorithms. Theorem 4. For an SAS + planning task, for a valid path of action (a, b) in states s, we have s: b \u21d2 a ob and only if pre (a) and eff (b), pre (b) and eff (a), eff (a) and eff (b) are all conflict-free action paths valid and b is applicable to s.Proof. First, we know from the definition of s: b \u21d2 a that action b is applicable in the state (s, a), a), b (b) and eff (b).

A NEW POR ALGORITHM FRAMEWORK FOR PLANNING", "text": "We have developed a POR theory for planning and explain two previous POR algorithms using the theory. Now, based on the theory, we propose a new POR algorithm that is stronger than the previous EC algorithm. Our theory shows in Theorem 3 that the condition for enabling POR reduction is strongly related to the left commutativity of actions. In fact, the construction of a stubborn action set can be reduced to the search for a left commutativity whose action is not necessary according to our theory. As we show in Theorem 5, the EC algorithm follows this idea. However, the basic unit of reduction in EC is strongly based on DTG (i.e. either all actions in a DTG are extended or none of them are necessary), which according to our theory is not necessary."}, {"heading": "5.1 SAC vs. EC", "text": "SAC provides a stronger reduction than the previous EC algorithm because it is based on measures with a finer grain than DTGs. Specifically, SAC provides a stronger reduction than EC for two reasons. Firstly, applicable actions that are not associated with pioneering transitions are extended by EC but not by SAC, even if they are in the same DTG. Secondly, applicable actions that do not support measures in the pioneering action plan are expanded by EC but not by SAC. For example, in Figure 4a, G1, G2, G3 there are three DTGs. Target allocation is marked as an unfilled circle in G1. a, b, c, d, e. Arrows indicate the preconditions of actions. For example, the lower dashed arrow means that ACM Journal Name, Vol. V, No. N, Month 20YY. \u00b7 19b requires a precondition."}, {"heading": "6. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "We adopt the Fast Downward (FD) planning system [Helmert 2006] as our code base.

The knowledge compilation module will generate domain transition graphs and causal graph for the SAS + planning task. The search module implements various state-space search algorithms as well as heuristic functions. All these three modules communicate through temporary files. We make two additions to the above system to implement our SAC planning system as shown in Figure 5. First, we add a \"Comutativity Analysis\" module to support the knowledge compilation step."}, {"heading": "7.

RELATED WORK", "text": "In this section we will discuss some related work."}, {"heading": "8.1 Symmetry", "text": "From the point of view of node expansion on an SAS + formalism for planning, we can see that symmetry removal is different from SAC. For example, consider a domain with three objects A1, A2, and B where A1 and A2 are symmetrical, and actions related to B will not conflict with actions related to A1 or A2. In this case, the symmetry removal will extend actions related to (A1 and B) or (A2 and B), whereas actions related to the DTG for B will only extend if we select a groundbreaking action based on it. This is because both the actionACM Journal Name, Vol. V, No. N, Month 20YY.22 \u00b7 core and the action closure does not include any actions associated with A1 or A2 as no conflict with actions in B.Intuitive, symmetrical distance determines that it is not important whether A1 or A2 is used, as they are associated with other symmetrical actions prior to SAC 1."}, {"heading": "8.2 Factored planning", "text": "There are some limitations of factored planning.First, for some problems with dense subgraphs, the number of subplans in each subgraph can be very large, which makes the search very expensive. Worse, there are many subgraphs where the target is not specified, which leads to more subplans that need to be considered. We have done some empirical studies on this topic. For example, for pipesworld20, there are DTGs, 18 of which have target factors where the target is not specified, and which lead to the subplans."}, {"heading": "8.3 Planning utilizing the SAS+ decomposition", "text": "Our POR method is based on the SAS + representation [Helmert 2006]. Furthermore, there has recently been an increasing interest in the use of the SAS + representation. Fast Down Planner [Helmert 2006] develops its heuristic function by analyzing the causal graphs on the SAS + models. Another SAS + -based heuristics for optimal planning is recently achieved by a linear programming model that encodes DTGs [van den Briel et al. 2007]. The LAMA planner derives inadmissible heuristic values by analyzing landmarks in SAS + models [Richter et al. 2008]. An admissible version of this is proposed in [Karpas and Domshlak 2009] through the use of cost-sharing. However, another admissible heuristics called \"mergeand-shrink\" is developed based on the abstraction of landmarks in SAS + models [Richter et al.]."}, {"heading": "9. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "Previous work in both model verification and AI planning has shown that POR is a powerful method for reducing search costs. POR is an enabling technique for modeling verification that will not be practicable without POR due to its high complexity. Although POR has been extensively studied for model verification, its theory for AI planning has not been developed. In this work, we developed a new POR theory for planning that is parallel to the persistent set theory in model verification. Furthermore, we applied our theory to explain two earlier POR algorithms for planning, providing useful insights that lead to a stronger and more efficient commutativity between actions. Based on the notion of left commutativity, we developed sufficient conditions for finding stubborn sets during planning."}], "references": [{"title": "Factored planning", "author": ["E. Amir", "B.

It amounts to exploring a state space of planning domains typically modeled as a directed graph. However, prohibitively large sizes of the search space make search expensive. Developing better heuristic functions has been the main technique for improving search efficiency. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that improving heuristics alone has certain fundamental limits on improving search efficiency. Recently, a new direction of research called partial order based reduction (POR) has been proposed as an alternative to improving heuristics. POR has shown promise in speeding up searches. POR has been extensively studied in model checking research and is a key enabling technique for scalability of model checking systems. Although the POR theory has been extensively studied in model checking, it has never been developed systematically for planning before. In addition, the conditions for POR in the model checking theory are abstract and not directly applicable in planning. Previous works on POR algorithms for planning did not establish the connection between these algorithms and existing theory in model checking. In this paper, we develop a theory for POR in planning. The new theory we develop connects the stubborn set theory in model checking and POR methods in planning. We show that previous POR algorithms in planning can be explained by the new theory. Based on the new theory, we propose a new, stronger POR algorithm. Experimental results on various planning domains show further search cost reduction using the new algorithm.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.98 Copyright 2009 Radical Eye Software"}}}
