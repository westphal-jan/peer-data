The goal is to determine the class of an unknown object in the face of a series of N possibilities H = {h1,..., hN}. Let H be a random variable equal to the true class of the object. In the simplest case, a binary classification task is considered (e.g., H = h0 denotes an object of interest and H = h1 denotes the absence of such an object).We can observe the object from a number of possible places L = {L1,.,., LM} where the locations themselves are not informative.1 There are costs for moving from the location Li to the location L j, which we call di j. In robotics applications, these costs are determined by the kinematics of the vehicle and the dynamics of both the vehicle and the environment. A number of characteristics F = {F1, FK} is also given that distinguish between objects."}, {"heading": "3.1 Noiseless Case", "text": "For each hypothesis h, a policy will have \u03c0 costs c (\u03c0, h) associated with the places visited by the policy. We define the expected cost of this policy in relation to a distribution on hypothesis P (H) as: c (\u03c0): = EH [c (\u03c0, h)] (3) This equation represents the expected cost of the policy \u03c0. In the silent case, we assume that each hypothesis h has an associated vector Vh = [f1,... fK] of characteristic values that always occur for this hypothesis. Consequently, P (F1,...) assumes only the values of one or zero. An incomplete characteristic vector V is said to be consistent with a hypothesis h, if for all f... V we f... Vh.Without observation noise, we can fully determine the hypothesis."}, {"heading": "3.2 Noisy Observations", "text": "If the observations are loud, it will probably be impossible to determine with certainty the class of an unknown object. However, as in the Decision Theory literature, we minimize the expected loss (also known as Bayes' Risk [18]) of the final classification decision. Consequently, each hypothesis is no longer associated with a deterministic vector Vh, and typically we cannot determine the hypothesis unambiguously even by observing all the characteristics. In the loud observation case, we can generate a policy that minimizes a loss function l (d, h) associated with the decision d for that object (i.e. the decision on the object class). If the object is explosive, a false negative could cause a very high threshold, but a false negative would be a lower problem."}, {"heading": "4 Proposed Solution", "text": "The goal is to optimize the expected loss for a \u03c0 policy. The expected loss is a function of final faith b (T) representing P (H | F1: T). Calculating this loss over an infinite horizon would require studying an exponential number of paths in the horizon length. To make the calculation feasible, we can use the abbreviated expected loss: \u03c0 = argmin \u03c0 (1: T) EH [l (d, h) | \u03c0 (1: T)]] (7) A related measure of the quality of b (T) is the information gain of the class in light of the observed characteristics IG (H; F1: T) = H (H) \u2212 H (H | F1: T), where H is entropy. We will further motivate the use of information gains in Section 5. Heuristics for solving the active classification problem using information gains can be formulated as follows:"}, {"heading": "5 Theoretical Analysis", "text": "The active classification problem is now associated with recent advances in active learning theory that allow us to analyze the performance of both non-adaptive and adaptive strategies, and active classification falls into a class of informative path planning problems [14]. Given some potential places where observations can be made, the problem with informative path planning is to maximize a function F (A), where A = {L1, L2,..., LT} is a set of places visited by the vehicle until an end-time T. In most cases, the groups of possible places to visit are limited by obstacles, vehicle kinematics, or other factors. For the active classification problem F (A) = \u2212 EH [l (d, h) | A], the expected negative loss after observation along path A."}, {"heading": "5.1 Performance Guarantees", "text": "The non-adaptive policy will typically be easier to calculate and implement, since it can potentially be calculated offline and carried out without modification. However, a fixed function mainly depends on the objective function (i.e., the informativeness of the views), which does not decrease and has submodular views. A fixed function is not decreasing if the target never decreases by observing more places in the vicinity. A fixed function is submodular if it fulfils the notion of decreasing returns (see Singh et al). The information gain is both non-decreasing and submodular if the observations of more places in the vicinity are observed. A fixed function is submodular if it fulfils the notion of decreasing returns (see Section 3)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Benefit of Adaptivity", "text": "A natural question is whether we can quantify the amount of benefit to be gained from an adaptive policy for a given problem. To begin our analysis of adaptability, we consider the problem of minimizing the expected cost of observation, which is subject to a hard coercion.: Problem 1. Given hypotheses H = {h1, h2,., hN}, characteristics F = {F1, F2,.., FK}, locations L = {L1,., LM}, costs c (Li, L) = di j for observing the site j, and a loss function defined as l (d, h) for selecting the hypothesis d, if the true hypothesis exists."}, {"heading": "6 Implementation and Experiments", "text": "In this section, we investigate the active classification problem experimentally by using synthetic images and data from the image sonar during the ship's hull inspection. Results confirm the benefit of active visual selection in these applications, as well as the benefit of adaptability when considering more than two hypotheses. In all experiments, we assume a simple 0 / 1 loss model, where incorrect classification incurs costs of one and correct classification costs of zero."}, {"heading": "6.1 Synthetic Images", "text": "The relevance of polyhedron detection for underwater inspection is direct, as explosive devices often have cubic or pyramid shapes [6], which is a particularly difficult active detection problem due to similarities and symmetries between polyhedra. These experiments serve to (1) demonstrate the benefit of selecting the views with the highest information potential about the unknown object and (2) investigate the benefit of adaptive action in investigating multiple possible objects. To identify the polyhedrons, we use prominent features extracted from the synthetic depth map. Training images were created from 24 different viewing angles around the objects, and the OpenCV [2] SURF feature extractor [1] was used to extract features for the different objects and angles. Low-noise test images were then created with Gausian noise (distance = 0.25 m)."}, {"heading": "6.1.1 Two objects", "text": "Figure 3 shows SURF characteristics and correlations for a tetrahedron and a cube viewed from the face and vertex; the number of SURF characteristics and correlations is greater for viewing the vertex than for viewing the faces; especially for the cube, the viewing of the face provides few correlations and little information about the object classes.For quantitative analysis, we now compare the selection of informative views with the selection of random views on the synthetic depth map data of a cube and tetrahedron; the information gain of each view is calculated on the basis of the number of expected prominent features corresponding to the true object minus the expected number of false correspondences; this calculation requires comparing all views with the corresponding views of the respective other objects (O (N2), calculating the number of hypotheses based on the transverse correlations."}, {"heading": "6.1.2 Multiple objects", "text": "In addition to cubes and tetrahedrons, we include training images of the icosahedron, octahedron, and dodecahedron as possible object classes. Theoretical analysis in Section 5 suggests that adaptive action should improve performance for the multi-hypotheses problem. Figure 5 shows results for the classification of cubes and tetrahedrons when considering additional hypotheses for the other three platonic bodies. Adaptive policy in most cases exceeds both random selection and non-adaptive policy. The difference is particularly significant for the tetrahedron. Note that the dominance of adaptive policy does not match at all data points. These results suggest that in some cases the addition of additional hypotheses reduces the performance of active visual selection."}, {"heading": "6.2 Imaging Sonar Data", "text": "To investigate the utility of active classification of real-world data, we conducted experiments with on-screen sonar maps taken by a ship inspector with an underwater vehicle to determine whether an explosive device was placed on the hull of the ship. It appears as a small patch of bright pixel on the sonar map. As the sonar data is not dense enough to provide distinctive features, we take a simpler approach to using the brightness of the pixels as a basis for characterization. A brightness threshold was learned by minimizing the number of incorrectly classified pixels in the labeled data. Performance metric is the total number of pixels correctly classified as part of the explosive device. We use this metric because images with a large number of corresponding pixels can provide additional information during post-processing."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "The experimental results show that information from the depth map can be used to identify objects of interest, and that (compared to passive methods) up to 80% fewer views need to be examined when the views are selected based on their expected information content. Furthermore, adaptive action by re-evaluating the best informed views when new information becomes available leads to improvements when considering more than two classes. These results are consistent with the theoretical analysis of the benefits of adaptability. Future work includes further theoretical analysis of possible performance guarantees, especially in case of path constraints. In addition, the results in this paper utilize features for classification. Recent work in unconventional classification through the use of point clouds would also benefit from active classification methods. Finally, the analysis in this paper includes applications that go beyond underwater inspection. Tasks such as environmental monitoring, education and monitoring are just a few areas that would benefit from active planning for the most informed views."}], "references": [{"title": "SURF: Speeded up robust features", "author": ["H.
