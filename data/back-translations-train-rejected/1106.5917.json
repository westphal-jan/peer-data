Most of these algorithms or models lack the ability to handle complications or diversions. Moreover, they also do not explain the factors influencing intuition and the accuracy of the results from this process. In this paper, we present a simple series based model for implementation of human-like intuition using the principles of connectivity and unknown entities. By using Poker hand datasets and Car evaluation datasets, we compare the performance of some well-known models with our intuition model. The aim of the experiment was to predict the maximum accurate answers using intuition based models. We found that the presence of unknown entities, diversion from the current problem scenario, and identifying weakness without the normal logic based execution, greatly affects the reliability of the answers. Generally, the intuition based models cannot be a substitute for the logic based mechanisms in handling such problems. The intuition can only act as a support for an ongoing logic based model that processes all the steps in a sequential manner. However, when time and computational cost are very strict constraints, this intuition based model becomes extremely important and useful, because it can give a reasonably good performance. Factors affecting intuition are analyzed and interpreted through our model.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Jun 2011 12:03:33 GMT  (100kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5917v1", "14 pages with 1 figure + 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages with 1 figure + 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["jitesh dundas", "david chik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.5917"}, "pdf": {"name": "1106.5917.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Implementing Human-like Intuition Mechanism in Artificial Intelligence", "authors": ["Jitesh Dundas", "David Chik"], "emails": ["jbdundas@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "He explained the variations in statistical intuition and statistical knowledge [1]. His work also shows the possible errors in people's intuition [1]. Clearly, however, intuition as a process is prone to false values, and correctness depends on various factors, in particular on mapping the right element of past experiences (or their combination). Kahnemann cites Shane Frederick's experiments [1], which show that people have a tendency not to think hard. They seem inclined to accept what comes first in their minds without correct and logical thinking. Common Sense is defined as the ability to perceive possible consequences in a short span of time from a wide range of possibilities [2]. This explanation assures us that the normal process of thinking is based on the same principles. However, this explanation does not shed light on the concept of intuition with a mathematical or logical explanation, the idea of intuition."}, {"heading": "2.
