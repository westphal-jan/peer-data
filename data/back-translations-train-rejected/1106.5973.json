A background of Indian writings is given in [1] - [6]. Indian writings are highly systematic in their arrangement of sounds, and the milieu in which they arose is explained in essays on early Indian science [7] - [11]. From the evidence available at the time, it can be assumed that the writing of the 3rd millennium BC Indus evolved into the Brahmi writings of later centuries BC, which in turn evolved into the various modern Indian writings. Structurally, all Indian writings are closely related, although their forms may vary. Brahmi writing is also the parent of Southeast Asian writings. The alphabets of Indian languages are classified in consonants, vowels and other symbols."}, {"heading": "Entropy", "text": "The entropy of the language is defined as the entropy of the English language, taking into account the 26 alphabets and spaces and excluding punctuation; the entropy of the Telugu language is calculated by converting the Telugu language into English using software and then using the above formula to calculate it. Entropy in the Telugu language is calculated in two ways: by converting it into English and then treating it as English letters. To understand the conversion of Telugu into English, here are some examples: The entropy in the Telugu language is calculated in two ways: by converting it into English and then viewing it as English letters, converting it into English and then viewing it as Telugu letters."}, {"heading": "Q 0.00 Q 0.01", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "O 0.49 O 1.46", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "J 0.78 J 0.04", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "F 0.04 F 0.00", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "B 0.99 B 0.00", "text": "V 2,43 V 0,01"}, {"heading": "W 0.00 W 0.00", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "X 0.00 X 0.00", "text": "Y 1,86 Y 0,00"}, {"heading": "Z 0.00 Z 0.00", "text": "In the next method, after conversion to English script, they are considered Telugu syllables as opposed to English alphabets in Method One.

The entropy of the English language is calculated by taking into account the 26 letters and the spaces and omitting the punctuation. The entropy of the Telugu language is calculated in two ways. By converting it into English and then treating it as English alphabets (Telugu 1). By converting it into English and then treating it as Telugu alphabets (Telugu 2).Graph 1: Comparison of the entropy letters is calculated.The next section deals with Telugu 2, where the alphabets are considered to be in Telugu language. We have considered one syllable at a time, two syllables at a time, etc., until we have reached a value that does not change much. Entropy decreases as the number of syllables considered is considered."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "For Indian languages such as Hindi and Telugu, which are phonetic so that the pronunciation of new words can be reliably predicted from their written form, consonants contain more information than the vowels. This can be deduced both from the time it takes to read the text and from the percentage of correctness. Words can be read with great ease if the first and last letter are left in place. Telugu entropy is higher than that of English, which means that Telugu is more concise than English and each syllable in Telugu (as in other Indian languages) contains more information than English. Comparing entropies of the language for original and confused texts confirms that the user can read confused text without great difficulty."}], "references": [{"title": "A frequency analysis of the Indus script", "author": ["S.
