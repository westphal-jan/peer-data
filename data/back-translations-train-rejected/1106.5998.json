In addition to describing the domains, the planners and the objectives of the competition, the paper includes analysis of the results. The results are analysed from several perspectives, in order to address the questions of comparative performance between planners, comparative difficulty of domains, the degree of agreement between planners about the relative difficulty of individual problem instances and the question of how well planners scale relative to one another over increasingly difficult problems. The paper addresses these questions through statistical analysis of the raw results of the competition, in order to determine which results can be considered to be adequately supported by the data.

Overview: The Third International Planning Competition", "text": "As organizers of the Third International Planning Contest, we decided on several new challenges that we believe are important for the ambitions of the planning community: solving problems with metric limitations of numerically evaluated variables, scheduling (including managing parallelism and planning activities), and constructing plans that are subject to optimization criteria other than a simple count of the number of steps. Setting these goals has obvious implications for potential competitors in terms of enhanced expressiveness and additional problem solving needed to manage the expansions. To control the extent to which competitors would have to successfully manage all of these expansions, we constructed variants or levels of all domains used in the competition. For most of the domains, we have a strip level, a numerical level (using only stripes and metric variables), a simple time level in which measures have a duration, but there are no other metric values in the domain and a full-time level."}, {"heading": "3.1 Problem Domains", "text": "This means that most people are not able to move, and that they are not able to move, they are not able to be able, they are able to feel, they are able to feel, they are able to be able, they are able to feel, they are able to be able, they are able to be able, they are able to be able, they are able to be able, they are able to feel, they are able to be able, they are able to be able, they are able to be able, they are able to be able, they are able to be able, they are able to be, they are able to be, they seem to be, they seem to be, they seem to be, they seem to be the world."}, {"heading": "3.2 The Competitors", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where you feel you can go to the top without being able to go to the top."}, {"heading": "3.3 Additional Challenges", "text": "The hard-numerical and complex problems used in the competition do not fit easily into the analysis of the other results. These problems raise interesting challenges for the planners. We will discuss some of these challenges now and present data below. Each of these challenges has been examined in only one or two problem groups, so generalizations about the performance of the planners based on the data collected are inappropriate. Therefore, we do not perform a statistical analysis of these data, but instead present the relevant data in a simple graphical form."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 The hardnumeric Satellite Problems", "text": "The hardnumerical satellite problem cases contained logical objectives, almost all of which are trivial. Thus, for example, in most cases, it was simply ensured that each satellite was targeting a specific observation site at the end of the plan. However, the planmetric used to evaluate the plans was much more informative: the plans were evaluated on the basis of the data collected by the satellites during their execution. Simply meeting the explicit objectives would generate a correct plan, but a worthless plan in terms of the planmetric. Of the fully automated planners, only Mips and Shop2 took these problems into attack. tlplan and shop2 were the hand-coded planners who attempted these problems. It is instructive to compare the qualities of the plans created by all four of these planners to this set of problems. Figure 2 shows that the quality of the plans produced by the hand-coded planners is significantly higher than the quality of the plans generated by the fully automated planners, so that the plans generated by both are limited, in fact, the plans generated to meet only the logical objectives, but the problem is very simple to minimize the ones that both."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 The Complex Satellite Domain", "text": "In addition to the hardnumerical satellite domain, a complex satellite domain has also been considered, and the complexity in this domain stems from the fact that it combines temporal actions, the duration of which depends on the parameters of the action, with the management of numerically measured resources (in this case, the data store for the collected data).The problem has a quality similar to a knapsack problem, where the data must be packed into the limited memory of suitable satellites, plus the time-based optimization problem, which ensures that the satellites are used efficiently, move between targets and collect the data according to their capabilities, current aspects and available memory. As shown in Figure 3, the planners - fully automated and hand-coded - have created plans of quite different quality (lower values are better here because quality is measured by macespan).In general, tllplan has produced the best quality plans, although lpg has also created some high-quality plans for the smaller problems."}, {"heading": "3.3.3 The Settlers Domain", "text": "The settler domain is based on resource management computer games, in which resources must be collected and used for the construction of new resource centers with new specialized production and skills. An interesting problem that this domain highlights is that the pddl2.1 language family does not offer a convenient way to name objects that are created during the execution of a plan. In the version used for the competition, we overcame this problem by initially having a selection of names available that are originally irrelevant. When an object is constructed, an unassigned name is used to name it by assigning the properties of the new object to the name and marking the name as used. An important problem that this approach creates for most current planners is that the initial creation of actions involves all sorts of ways in which the names can be assigned to objects and then used in different roles within the plan. This leads to a significant explosion in the size of the domain that is encrypted in the future (problem 20 is also interesting to observe that only the problem 6 is solved automatically)."}, {"heading": "4. Analysis of Competition Performance", "text": "One of the most important roles of a competition is to identify the state of the art in relation to a variety of measures and to try to answer broad questions about the landscape of the research area. Of course, a competition cannot have the last word on the state of the art. It may be that planning systems, for whatever reason, are prevented from participating in the competition, but the competition provides some useful insights into the capabilities of modern planning systems. Planning performance can be measured in terms of the speed of solving the problems and the number and quality of solutions found. Other metrics could also be identified. There are different planning architectures and heuristic evaluation functions, as well as different types of domains and problems."}, {"heading": "4.1 Raw Performance Analysis", "text": "We make pairs of comparisons between planners to see if a consistent pattern can be identified in their relative speed and plan quality. We first focus on comparing the fully automated planners and, separately, the hand-coded planners. We then perform an additional set of analyses to try to determine the raw performance benefit derived from the use of hand-coded control knowledge. To this end, we perform the Wilcoxon test on pairs that cross the line between the fully automated and hand-coded planning groups. Where the conclusion is that the improvement achieved is significant, we can only say that control rules lead to an improvement in performance. We cannot take into account the price in terms of coding the rules that must be paid to achieve this improvement. Understanding what is involved in writing useful control knowledge is still anecdotal, and it remains an important challenge for the community to quantify this more accurately."}, {"heading": "4.2 Analytic Framework", "text": "Vnlrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"}, {"heading": "4.3 Results of Analysis", "text": "The results of performing the Wilcoxon tests to compare velocity performance between fully automated planners are presented in Figure 4. The results of similar tests to compare plan quality are presented in Figures 5 and 6. The data of the double strokes are presented in Figure 6. The corresponding tests for the hand-coded planners are shown in Figures 7 and 8. The tables have rows corresponding to the four problem levels for which the competition has gathered sufficient data for analysis: stripes, numerical, simple time and time. There are so many results for the fully automated planners on stripe domains that they are split into two rows, creating five rows in these tables. In Planner quality comparisons, we report the stripe results separately using sequential plan length and simultaneous plan length. The data in the rows are interpreted as follows: Each cell representing a pair of planners being compared presents the Z-value and the corresponding table is identified from the Wilcoxon statistical table."}, {"heading": "4.4 Interpretation", "text": "Our results show that the null hypothesis can be discarded. Therefore, we assume the alternative hypothesis and discuss here the partial jobs resulting from the data. The data presented in Figures 4 to 8 can be interpreted as partial jobs about the speed and quality of the fully automated and hand-coded planners at each of the four problem levels. This can be done at any level simply by putting a sequence between planner pairs from A to B if the Wilcoxon value for that pair is given in the subcolumn associated with A and is significant at level 0.001. Results are shown in Figures 9 to 12. In each of these figures, sub-graphs are identified that are associated with each of the four problem levels. The presence of an arrow in a graph indicates that a statistically significant sequence exists. The absence of an arrow from A to B indicates that no statistically significant relationship between A and the corresponding problem level cannot be found and therefore no such sequence of B cannot be found."}, {"heading": "4.4.1 Partial orderings based on speed", "text": "Figure 9 describes the speed comparisons that can be made between the fully automated planners after the Wilcoxon test. It can be noted that the capture is significantly faster than the other fully automated planners at the stripe and number level (the significance of each arrow in the figure is sufficient to support transitive thinking). In fact, at the stripe and number level, there is an interesting linear sequence between ff, lpg, mips and vhpop (three of which were the winners among the fully automated planners) that is maintained between lpg, mips and vhpop at the simpler time level. Despite the observation that the planner was faster than mips in a significant proportion of the strips problems, there is no significant Wilcoxon relationship between them, so the four winners are a backbone of the performance that the other planners at these levels argue about."}, {"heading": "4.4.2 Partial orderings based on quality", "text": "Dre rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rfu the rfu the rf\u00fc the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the"}, {"heading": "4.4.3 Cross-boundary partial orderings", "text": "We have performed a final set of comparisons to better understand the benefits of using hand-picked planners instead of fully automated planners in terms of speed and quality.

Tests for Magnitude", "text": "To complement the Wilcoxon tests, we perform some additional analyses to determine whether, given that two planners are being compared, the size of the performance differences between the two planners is statistically significant. We perform paired t-tests (see Appendix C) using a subset of planner pairs. We focus our attention on those couples where consistent significant differences have been found, because we do not think it makes sense to compare size outcomes for planners where no consistent dominance is evident. We also limit our attention to planners who, according to Wilcoxon tests, were the most impressive performers at any level of competition. We conduct separate tests on speed and quality. In examining the size differences in performance, it is not useful to include problems that have not been resolved by one of the planners being compared. Using infinite time or quality measures would result in a magnitude that grossly distorts the true picture."}, {"heading": "5.1 Analytic Framework", "text": "The t-tests are performed on the basis of the normalized performance of the two planners. They find the magnitude of the difference between the performance of two planners, p1 and p2, on the basis of a collection of problem cases. For example, in a collection of n problems, we find the result pairs p1ri and p 2 ri, which represent the instances i = 1 to i = n. In any case, we normalize these values by dividing each of them by the mean of the pair. This process establishes a performance range between 0 and 2, with 1 representing the same performance. The t test results in a t-value represent the difference between the average normalized performance of the two planners. We perform 2-tailed tests on p < 0.05 because we are interested in the individual results and not in extrapolated sub-orderations based on the order of magnitude. We want to look at the size information because it is relevant to the individual consistency results."}, {"heading": "5.2 Results of Analysis", "text": "The tables in Figures 16 to 20 are arranged as follows: Tables in Figures 16, 18, and 20 contain the speed results found for the fully automatic, hand-coded, or mixed pairs. Tables in Figures 17, 19, and 20 contain the quality results for the same three groups. In each table, there is a row for each of the five levels of competition (although blank rows have been omitted); the columns represent the planer pairs that are being compared. In each cell, five sets of data are specified: the mean normalized power for each planner; the calculated t value and the degree of freedom used (derived from the number of double strokes at that level); and the resulting p value. A positive t value means that the size difference in favor of the planner is determined as second in the cell. A negative t value is identified in favor of the planner as first. Where the resulting t value indicates a difference in the order of magnitude, we use the font difference for the pair that is smaller than the font test = 0.05, in favor of the pair that is 0.p."}, {"heading": "5.3 Interpretation", "text": "The results show that the null hypothesis can be discarded in almost all pair comparisons of planners for whom the Wilcoxon test has a significant consistent performance difference. There are some cases where the null hypothesis cannot be discarded, implying that the consistent performance difference in a planner pair does not yield statistical significance in their mean relative performance. As shown in Tables 16 to 20, there was a reassuring consistency with the results of the Wilcoxon tests. That is, where significant consistency differences between two planners are detected using the Wilcoxon test, the t test for the size difference also generally shows a significant size difference."}, {"heading": "6. Dependence of Performance on Domain", "text": "We believe it is important to quantify the difficulty of the problems used in the competition, as this provides the basis for a deeper understanding of the relative performance of the planner. To investigate this, we investigate whether any of the domains used were uniformly regarded as simple or hard, among the fully automated and hand-coded planners. We also investigate whether the strip problems were generally regarded as simpler than the problems at the numerical and time level. These two questions lead to two related investigations based on bootstrapping techniques. Our analyses show that different planners find different domains and levels difficult, both within the fully automated and hand-coded categories. In the first competition, in 1998, it was reported that no planner solved a problem with more than about 25,000 ground actions and that 10,000 ground actions marked a limit beyond which the performance of the planner was clearly unreliable."}, {"heading": "6.1 Analytic Framework", "text": "To explore the two questions, we used the planners to find out how difficult the domains and levels were. For each planner, domain and problem level, we plot the number of problem cases to be solved against the time in milliseconds. This results in a curve under which the planner's difficulty in solving the problems in the given problem area can be measured in milliseconds. To finally keep the area below the curve, we use a cut-off time of thirty minutes. This extended cut-off time (fifteen minutes was used in the competition) results in a higher penalty paid by a planner who does not solve the problems. In the experiment used to tackle the first question, the zero hypothesis is that the planner finds all problems at a given level equally difficult. To test this, we constructed a boat strapping technique, ten thousand samples of twenty values from the collection of domains at the appropriate level."}, {"heading": "6.2 Results of Analysis", "text": "The results of the two experiments described above can be found in Figures 22 and 23, which describe the individual problems we have created using the fully automated planners and the hand-coded planners. The table for the hand-coded planners is further divided into two parts: the first five lines correspond to the small problems, the last five lines to the big problems. The performance of the hand-coded planners on the big problems was measured using the bootstrapped samples taken from the large problem collection. Tables are arranged as follows: The rows correspond to the domains as labeled, and the columns on the levels are considered, and the number of planners are used. Planners vary between the columns that participated in the different domains that participated more planners on the strips than on the strips, as if the planners on the levels, and the planners on the planners."}, {"heading": "6.3 Interpretation", "text": "The results allow us to reject the null hypothesis in some cases, but not in others. We are able to determine significant differences in the relative hardness of domains as determined by certain planners, but there is also evidence of the lack of consistency between the judgments of different planners. For example, there are some domain / level combinations that are found by certain planners and not others. The tables in Figures 22 and 23 allow us to determine which domains present the most interesting problems for planners participating in the competition. Although it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from data that are really indicative, some interesting patterns are emerging. For example, the level-specific data in Figure 22 show that none of the fully automated planners has found problems at all levels that are caused by comparing with problems drawn from other domains. The satellite strips problems were significantly simple by comparing them with other levels."}, {"heading": "7. Scaling Issues", "text": "The results of this section allow us to conclude that there is no general consensus on which of the competitive areas and levels were found hard, but it does not allow us to determine which planners in particular areas and levels agreed or disagreed. To look at the relative scaling behavior of planners, we need to identify the extent of such agreement, because to investigate scaling behavior, it is necessary to have a scale that measures performance in a way that is meaningful to both planners in comparison. Therefore, the analysis described in this section attempts to provide statistical evidence of such agreement. To evaluate scaling behavior, we first examine whether the competing planners agree on what makes a problem within a given area and level difficult. Although it may seem straightforward to ensure that a set of problems consists of increasingly difficult problems (for example, generalizing cases of increasing size)."}, {"heading": "7.1 Analytic Framework", "text": "As discussed in Section 6, we use the planners themselves as judges to determine how difficult individual problems were. Given that most of the competing planners proceeded by first grounding the problem instance and then searching the problem space using a variation on the theme of relaxed distance estimation, there seems to be little reason to believe that planners would differ greatly from each other. If a particular instance or instance proved difficult for a planner, one might expect that this same collection would be challenging for all competitors. In order not to be distracted by the effects of the hand-coded control rules, we separate the judgments of the fully automated planners from those of the hand-coded planners. For each domain / layer combination, the hypothesis is that planners agree on the relative difficulties within that domain and level. To explore the extent to which the agreement exists, we perform vertices for agreement in several areas (Kanji, 1999)."}, {"heading": "7.2 Results of Analysis", "text": "The cells in Figure 26 indicate the obtained F-values (and the degrees of freedom used). In almost all cases, the critical value was exceeded and the null hypothesis of non-match could be discarded at least for the level of 0.05. In only a few cases (those written in bold), the critical value was not exceeded and therefore no statistical evidence of agreement between planners on the difficulty of the cases in the corresponding domain and level could be found. Interestingly, the problematic cases are all within the numerical level, both for fully automated and for hand-coded planners. Furthermore, the case closest to the critical limit (the small numerical problems of the repositories in the handcoded table with an F-value of 2.19) is also within the numerical level."}, {"heading": "7.3 Interpretation", "text": "The results support the rejection of the null hypothesis in almost all cases. Therefore, we can adopt the alternative hypothesis and observe that there are many cases where planners agree on the relative difficulties of problem cases within a particular domain / level. During the competition, we observed that the valley planner is at a disadvantage compared to the other hand-coded planners when working on small problems. We see the effects of this start time in the tables. Note that in those domain / level combinations in which the valley planner competed (stripes, simple time and time), we see a low degree of agreement among hand-coded planners on the small problems (except in the case of the rover domain). This is not because the valley planner disagrees with the other planners on the order of the actual problems, but because the problems are small enough that the problems with this problem are not completely eliminated in terms of the difficulty of grading in the actual category."}, {"heading": "8. Relative Scaling Behaviours", "text": "The MRCs described in Section 7 show that planners agree, as expected, on the relative difficulty of problem cases within most domain / level combinations. In these cases, it is possible to further explore the planners \"domain and level-specific scaling behavior, and we continue to investigate this behavior in this section. We cannot investigate the planners\" scaling behavior across domains because, as we discussed in Section 6, there does not seem to be much general agreement regarding the relative hardness of the domains, so it would be unlikely to see agreement in multiple judgments across domain boundaries. The ideal basis on which to investigate scaling behavior would be to have a collection of problems with a canonical scaling of difficulty and then compare planners \"performance as they are scaled to increasingly severe problems within this survey. Unfortunately, many factors contribute to the problems being hard and not affecting them uniformly."}, {"heading": "8.1 Analytic Framework", "text": "In order to test the different scaling characteristics of planners, we make pairs of performance comparisons with only those areas where both planners agree on the difficulty of the problems. That is, we use one domain in a comparison when both planners find it hard and record the results separately. We do not try to evaluate the problems in the order of their scaling, we recognize that the different planners are better at the problem areas than the others, and that we look at the scaling within the four problem levels and split the results separately. We try to integrate these results into a single conclusion about scaling."}, {"heading": "8.2 Results of Analysis", "text": "The table in Figure 27 shows the significant scaling differences we found between fully automatic planner pairs at each level. Figure 28 shows the relative scaling of the hand-coded planners. In both test series, two planners could only be compared at the levels where both were competing, and in areas where they were competing, they were either simple, hard, or neither simple nor hard. We report the results such that the line-by-line indexed planner is the one that shows the superior scaling behavior. Where planners were not competing on the same rails, we display this with the symbol that is incomparable. Where no significant scaling difference was found, we specify this with a zero correlation. Where no match was found to support a comparison, we use the symbol that indicates inconsistencies. To avoid duplication of data, we place entries as positive correlations only in the cell that matches the favored planner for the comparison, and the correlation of the corresponding planner with the seeder."}, {"heading": "8.3 Interpretation", "text": "In almost all cases where a comparison could be made, a significant difference in scaling behavior was found that supported the rejection of the null hypotheses. However, since we only used areas where there was agreement on the relative difficulty of the problems, it is not necessary to limit our conclusions to their domain independence. However, we only had a limited collection of data points available, so we have to be careful how we generalize this picture. Based on our analyses, we believe that we can make some preliminary estimates about how planners scale in pairs comparisons within the four levels of competition. For fully automated planners, one can informally observe that there is a high degree of consistency between the scaling behavior of certain planners at the problem levels where they worked together. Although we cannot draw general conclusions from the datasets with a high degree of confidence, we can conclude that scaling exhibits the best scaling behavior at the levels where it was created on the scale-time and on the best level."}, {"heading": "9.

This area was created to explore the power of the strips in the event of transportation problems when transportation entails a sub-problem in acquiring a driver. The problem is one that provides significant opportunities for the simultaneous use of drivers and vehicles, so we were also interested in seeing how the time variants were handled. The metric variant of the area adds up the cost of walking and driving, and the overall problem situations that it requires to optimize the combination of costs and schedules."}, {"heading": "A.3.3 The Zeno-Travel Domain", "text": "In this area, there are actions for passengers to board and disembark aircraft that can fly at two alternative speeds between the locations. The strip variant is rather uninteresting because the two speeds do not offer any sensible alternatives. In the metric variant, the aircraft use fuel at different speeds depending on the cruising speed (two alternatives) and distances between the locations. Problem cases require plans to minimize a linear combination of time and fuel consumption. The time versions are closer to the original Zenoproblem. They include duration of the different means of travel and different levels of consumption. Unlike the original Zenoproblem, fuel consumption is not described by a continuous function, but by discrete step functions applied at the endpoints of permanent actions. The fact that the fuel in an aircraft cannot be affected by several different simultaneous actions and its value is not relevant to satisfying the preconditions of any measures that may begin during the continuous consumption or replenishment of fuel."}, {"heading": "A.3.4 The Satellite Domain", "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "A.3.5 The Rovers Domain", "text": "The rover domain was conceived as a simplified representation of the problem facing the Mars Exploration Rover missions launched in 2003, the Mars Science Laboratory mission planned for 2009, and other similar missions expected under ESA's AURORA project. The strip version of the problem involves planning multiple rovers equipped with different but possibly overlapping equipment to traverse a planetary surface, requiring rovers to travel back and forth between waypoints to collect data and transmit it to a lander. Crossing the domain is complicated by the fact that certain rovers are limited to traveling across specific terrain types, making certain routes impassable for some of the rovers, and data transmission is also limited by the visibility of the lander from the waypoints. The metric version of the domain involves energy costs associated with actions, and an action that allows rovers to recharge in the sun, provided they are in time."}, {"heading": "A.3.6 The Settlers Domain", "text": "The problem has been suggested by Patrik Haslum. An interesting difficulty that presents the problem is that this is a problem that involves constructing new objects from resources, which is not easy to illustrate in pddl2.1. In fact, the only way to capture the area in pddl2.1 is to name the objects to be constructed and give them an attribute that indicates whether they were actually constructed or not. This leads to a very cumbersome encoding and also presents a particular problem for planners to take action before planning, as a large number of potential objects have to be taken into account in the process, resulting in a huge accumulation of actions. Many of these actions are uninterestingly different, as the specific selection of names for objects that are created in solving a case is clearly irrelevant, but any alternative is taken into account and considered in the planning process."}, {"heading": "A.3.7 The UM-Translog-2 Domain", "text": "The UM-Translog-2 domain (Wu & Nau, 2002) was used only for hand-coded planners, and only an incomplete set of results was collected for time reasons at the end of the trial period.

However, it is very difficult to measure the effort. In principle, it should be possible to tie the time to reformulate the domain, but then differences in the team size and experience of the team members can become very important in order to compare what was achieved by the different participants.

Rules can work in such a way that search branches that are predicted (by the human coding of the rules) that no solutions can be found can be cut off.
