This learning algorithm will present the computer to look at the internal and external environment in series of independent entities, which will interact with each other, with and/or without knowledge of the computer's brain. When a learning algorithm interacts, it does so by detecting and understanding the entities in the human algorithm. However, the problem with this approach is that the algorithm does not consider the interaction of the third party or unknown entities, which may be interacting with each other. These unknown entities in their interaction with the non-computer entities make an effect in the environment that influences the information and the behaviour of the computer brain. Such details and the ability to process the dynamic and unsettling nature of these interactions are absent in the current learning algorithm such as the decision tree learning algorithm. IBSEAD is able to evaluate and consider such algorithms and thus give us a better accuracy in simulation of the highly evolved nature of the human brain. Processes such as dreams, imagination and novelty, that exist in humans are not fully simulated by the existing learning algorithms. Also, Hidden Markov models (HMM) are useful in finding \"hidden\" entities, which may be known or unknown. However, this model fails to consider the case of unknown entities which maybe unclear or unknown. IBSEAD is better because it considers three types of entities- known, unknown and invisible. We present our case with a comparison of existing algorithms in known environments and cases and present the results of the experiments using dry run of the simulated runs of the existing machine learning algorithms versus IBSEAD.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 11:08:35 GMT  (282kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.6186v1", "Keywords: Self-evolving algorithm; machine learning; decision-trees; learning algorithms, Hidden Markov Models;this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "Keywords: Self-evolving algorithm; machine learning; decision-trees; learning algorithms, Hidden Markov Models;this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jitesh dundas", "david chik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.6186"}, "pdf": {"name": "1106.6186.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "IBSEAD: - A Self-Evolving Self-Obsessed Learning Algorithm for Machine Learning", "authors": ["Jitesh Dundas", "David Chik"], "emails": ["jbdundas@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This learning algorithm will enable the computer to view the internal and external environment in a series of independent units that interact with each other, with and / or without knowledge of the computer's brain.

Introduction", "text": "The goal of machine learning is the ability of machines to learn and interpret information like humans. In recent decades, we have made great progress in achieving this goal. However, there are still problems in providing accuracy in understanding and interpreting knowledge by machines. Here, we present the learning algorithms that have so far had a lot of impact in the field of artificial intelligence. However, these algorithms are not able to deliver learning skills (the human level) to robots. We present IBSEAD - a learning algorithm that allows robots to learn at a higher level. We then compare the existing learning algorithms and measure whether IBSEAD is better in complex situations and interactions with the same efficiency as a normal human."}, {"heading": "3.

Advantages", "text": "This algorithm takes into account the invisible entities that affect the robot's interactions and learning process. 1) Decision tree-based systems do not take into account scenarios in which the entities may not interact in a tree-like manner. Tree-based structure is invalid if the interactions on the second and lower levels lead to unrecognizability. What if there are interactions without such sub-levels.2) Decision tree algorithms do not take into account horizontal and backward interactions, something that is so frequent and indispensable in any learning process.5) IBSEAD fills the gap in this direction. 3) IBSEAD provides a more comprehensive and accurate representation than its predecessors.4) IBSEAD can answer the problems of adding consciousness and awareness in robots, something that current algorithms cannot add.5) This program considers entities as individuals and not as groups or subsystems (with common goals), which seems to be the case with most living and dynamic environments."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusion", "text": "We have found that IBSEAD has better performance and accuracy in learning from robots when it comes to existing methods such as decision-tree-based learning methods, in certain scenarios. IBSEAD takes into account invisible beings and their interaction and effects, something that existing algorithms do not provide. There is a switch to ensure that beings are ready to deal with complex situations that are new and not falling, as per the \"learn from existing entities and knowledge.\" In cases where no previous experience is available, IBSEAD performance could be slowed. We would like to pursue this to the future extent of these algorithms.
