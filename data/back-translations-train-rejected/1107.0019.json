Within the score+search paradigm, the dominant approach uses local search methods in the space of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where the usual choices for defining the elementary modifications (local changes) that can be applied are arc addition, arc deletion, and arc reversal. In this paper, we propose a new local search method that uses a different search space, and which takes account of the concept of equivalence between network structures: restricted acyclic partially directed graphs (RPDAGs). In this way, the number of different configurations of the search space is reduced, thus improving efficiency. Moreover, although the final result must necessarily be a local optimum given the nature of the search method, the topology of the new search space, which avoids making early decisions about the directions of the arcs, may help to find better local optima than those obtained by searching in the DAG space. Detailed results of the evaluation of the proposed search method on several test problems, including the well-known Alarm Monitoring System, are also presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:32:05 GMT  (196kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0019v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["s acid", "l m de campos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0019"}, "pdf": {"name": "1107.0019.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Search for Bayesian network structures in the Kurpark"}, {"heading": "Restri ted A y li Partially Dire ted Graphs", "text": "Silvia A id a id de sai.ugr.es Luis M. de Campos l i de sai.ugr.es Departamento de Cien ias de la Computa i on e I.A.

Within the s ore+sear h paradigm, the dominant approa h uses lo al sear h methods in the spa e of dire ted a y li graphs (DAGs), where the usual hoi es for de ning the elementary modi ations (lo al hanges) that an be applied are ar addition, ar deletion, and ar reversal. In this paper, we propose a new lo al sear h method that uses a di erent sear h spa e, and whi h takes a ount of the on ept of equivalen e between network stru tures: restri ted a y li partially dire ted graphs (RPDAGs). In this way, the number of di erent on gurations of the sear h spa e is redu ed, thus improving e\u00c6 ien y. Moreover, although the nal result must ne essarily be a lo al optimum given the nature of the sear h method, the topology of the new sear h spa e, whi h avoids making early de isions about the dire tions of the ar s, may help to nd better lo al optima than those obtained by sear hing in the DAG spa e. Detailed results of the evaluation of the proposed sear h method on several test problems, in luding the well-known Alarm Monitoring System, are also presented.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.86 Copyright 1999 Radical Eye Software"}}}
