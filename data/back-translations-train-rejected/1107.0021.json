We present a simple model of supply chains, highlighting two characteristic features: hierarchical subtask decomposition, and resource contention. To decentralize the formation process, we introduce a market price system over the resources produced along the chain. In a competitive equilibrium for this system, agents choose locally optimal allocations with respect to prices, and outcomes are optimal overall. To determine prices, we define a market protocol based on distributed, progressive auctions, and myopic, non-strategic agent bidding policies. In the presence of resource contention, this protocol produces better solutions than the greedy protocols common in the artificial intelligence and multiagent systems literature. The protocol often converges to high-value supply chains, and when competitive equilibria exist, typically to approximate competitive equilibria. However, complementarities in agent production technologies can cause the protocol to wastefully allocate inputs to agents that do not produce their outputs. A subsequent decommitment phase recovers a significant fraction of the lost surplus.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:32:28 GMT  (368kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0021v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["w e walsh", "m p wellman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0021"}, "pdf": {"name": "1107.0021.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Decentralized Supply Chain Formation: A Market Protocol and Competitive Equilibrium Analysis", "authors": ["William E.

Introduction", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "2. The Supply Chain Formation Problem", "text": "A key feature of our problem model is hierarchical task division: in order to perform a given task, an agent must perform some sub-tasks that can be delegated to other agents, which in turn can have sub-tasks that can be delegated to form a supply chain by splitting up task completion. Task assignment constraints arise from resource conflicts where an agent needs a common resource (such as a task fulfillment or something tangible such as a device) to perform his tasks. Tasks are performed on behalf of a particular agent; if two agents need a task, it would have to be performed twice to satisfy both. In this way, tasks are the same as any other discrete, competing resource. Therefore, in our model we do not distinguish between \"good\" and \"good\" to refer to a task or resource provided or required by an agent. In this way, tasks are the same as any other discrete, competing resource."}, {"heading": "2.1 Example: Automotive Supply Chain Formation", "text": "We illustrate our model of supply chain formation using a stylized, hypothetical example from the automotive industry. Traditionally, automotive supply chains extend over many levels, which are formed and maintained over long periods of time through extensive human negotiation. There is some automation emerging, for example, through Covisint2, a company founded by GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler to mediate negotiations and exchange of parts and other interactions in the supply chain. Currently, the focus of this effort is on a specific exchange relationship within a single production level. We view the broader issue of multi-level relationships as complete, workable supply chains. In the example shown in Figure 1, Ford and GM must acquire transmission contracts in order to manufacture specific car models. Ford can manufacture the transmissions in its own factories or acquire them from an independent transmission manufacturer. GM currently does not have the ability to produce and outsource the desired transmissions."}, {"heading": "2.2 Problem Specification", "text": "The two types of node points represent goods and agents, respectively. < M > S > S < S > S > S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S\" S \"S.

Resource Contention", "text": "A natural candidate approach to the formation of supply chains is the CONTRACT NET Protocol (Davis & Smith, 1983), the most widely studied algorithm for establishing performance relationships between distributed actors. CONTRACT NET actually fits our framework as it uses local negotiations to achieve a hierarchical division of tasks. Although, due to the many variants of CONTRACT NET in the literature, definitive characterization is difficult (Baker, 1996; Davis & Smith, 1983; Dellarocas et al., 2000; Sandholm, 1993), it is fair to say that the \"quotation request\" comes from the root (right to left from the consumer, in our network terminology), and contract conclusion is bottom to top (left to right from the consumer), with selection at each level among the candidates \"offers\" being a close decision. (Variants of the protocol are made primarily by the form of bids and selection criteria used, which are easily distinguished as a result)."}, {"heading": "4. Price Systems", "text": "A price system p assigns a non-negative number p (g) to each good as the price. Prices are anonymous (i.e. non-agent dependent) and linear in the quantity of goods. Intuitively, prices indicate the relative value of the goods, and agents use the prices to guide their local decision-making. We assume that agents have quasi-linear supply functions, defined by \"cash holdings\" plus the value (or minus costs) associated with the allocation of goods. Agents want to maximize their surplus relative to prevailing prices. Definition 3 (surplus) The surplus that agents a (a, (V, E), with allocation (V, E) at prices p results in: \u2022 va ((V, E) \u2212 \u2211 < g, a > < g (E) < a > < p (E) if they have a surplus."}, {"heading": "4.1 Price Equilibrium", "text": "In general, an allocation (V, \"E\") is a competitive equilibrium at prices p \"if (V,\" E \") is possible and assigns to each agent an allocation that matches the surplus of the agent to p.\" For our model, this specifically means: \"The optimal choice of a producer is either to be active and practicable or not to purchase goods. Therefore, a producer achieves a non-negative surplus in allocation by being active, and a producer who is not involved in allocation would achieve a non-positive surplus by being active."}, {"heading": "4.2 Existence of Competitive Equilibrium", "text": "Recall that in equilibrium active actors must achieve a non-negative surplus and inactive producers must not be able to achieve a positive surplus. Price inequalities among goods result from the limitations of the surplus associated with the activity of agents. The lower limits of commodity prices 1, 2 and 5 ensure that producers a1, a2 and a5 can achieve a non-negative surplus; the upper limit of 3 ensures that a3 could not achieve a positive surplus; the lower limit of 4 ensures that a6 would receive a non-positive surplus; the propagation of these limits of 6, we see that p (6) and a7 produce a positive surplus."}, {"heading": "4.3 Approximate Price Equilibrium", "text": "We should generally assume that market protocols based on discrete price adjustments (such as the SAMP-SB protocol we describe in Section 5) would exceed the exact balances by at least a small amount. Therefore, our analysis emphasizes approximate equilibrium concepts (Demange et al., 1986; Wellman et al., 2001a). We introduce a certain type of equilibrium equilibrium defined in parameters that determine the degree to which actors achieve sub-optimal surpluses. Intuitively, this limits the sub-optimality of a consumer surplus, so that the sub-optimality of the product surplus is due to its production, and limits the sub-optimality of a product surplus to the input frequency g. As described in Section 5, these parameters have also applied a special interpretation in our market protocol as task dependence.Denote as Ha (the sub-optimality of a producer surplus that is attributable to input)."}, {"heading": "4.4 Valid Solutions", "text": "In the following sections, we show that \u03bb-\u03b4 competitive balances can be a useful concept for analyzing decentralized market protocols. However, such protocols do not always achieve \u03bb-\u03b4 competitive balances for all networks. Therefore, we also consider weaker price constraints consistent with a lower degree of drug optimization in a solution distribution. We say that a solution (V, E) applies in terms of price p if: 1. Each consumer in the solution pays no more than its value for a single good. That is, for all c-C-V products there is a single < g, c-E products like this p (g)."}, {"heading": "5. SAMP-SB Protocol", "text": "In order to calculate prices and allocations, we must, through a systematic process of communication, extract information concerning the relative value of goods. Mechanisms that determine the market-oriented exchange based on messages from agents are referred to as auctions (McAfee & McMillan, 1987).Agents \"bidding policies represent their strategies for interacting with auctions.While the auction mechanism can be designed by a central authority, bidding strategies are usually determined by individual agents.To understand the impact of auction design, it is necessary to analyze the market protocol resulting from the combination of the auction mechanism and the agent's bidding policy.The space for potential auctions is expansive (Wurman et al., 2001), and definitive theoretical results are currently known only for fairly limited problem classes (Bikhchandani & Mamer, 1997; Demange & Gale, 1985; Gul & Stacchetti, McMillain, McMillain, McMillain, 1999, MilMilMilMilMilk)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Auction Mechanism", "text": "The SAMP SB mechanisms include a number of positive or negative offers, one for each commodity. Auctions run simultaneously, asynchronously and independently of each other, with no direct coordination. Agents interact with the auctions by making bids for goods they want to buy or sell. A bid is of the form: (q1 p1). (qn pn) Each pair (qn pn) indicates an offer to buy or sell the commodity, with Qi indicating the quantity of the offer and pi indicating the price. If Qi > 0, it is an offer to buy Qi units of good for no more than pi per unit, and we refer to it as an offer to buy. If Qi < 0, it is an offer to sell Qi units for no less than Pi per unit, and we refer to it as a sale offer. Since no agent sells both buys and the good in a task dependency network, one bid contains either all positive or quantitative offers."}, {"heading": "5.2 Bidding Policies", "text": "Although the constructors of the negotiation mechanisms generally have no control over the behavior of the agents in the system, they assume that any conclusions about the outcome of a mechanism need only be based on some assumptions about these behaviors. A typical assumption in economics is that the agents are rational in a certain sense, for example, that they are playing strategies that create a balance between producers and Nash. However, as discussed in Section 7.1, our analysis assumes that the agents follow a simple, non-strategic supply policy that is described in this section. Other variations may be reasonable or perhaps better than the strategies we described. Instead of exploring the range of possibilities, we chose in this work to examine in depth a particular set of strategies."}, {"heading": "5.3 Bidding with General Preferences", "text": "The task dependency model represents relatively simple production capacities and benefits for consumers. At this point, we are discussing some natural potential extensions of the tendering guidelines to a broader class of skills and preferences. A producer who is able to produce variable units could offer just as if they were several identical producers. Such a producer would maintain separate offers for each unit in his tenders and update the individual offers independently of each other. Similarly, a consumer with additive value for several goods or several units of a product for each unit could offer as if it were a separate consumer. A producer with alternatives to some input factors can switch his offer to the currently cheapest option independently of other input factors. Subtle problems may arise for a producer who has alternative input sets, especially if he wins parts of the input sets on an experimental basis. An option would be to focus on the set with the lowest perceived costs, which may include a premium for goods that are not included in the winning group."}, {"heading": "5.4 Properties of SAMP-SB", "text": "In this section, we describe a number of theoretical properties of SAMP-SB.

Figure 9 shows network requirements that illustrate this observation. The agent called launch sites makes a one-time offer to sell a unit of well over 0 for $2. Since \u03b1 (0) = 2, and producers 1-2 initially lose their input bids, these agents each offer a price of 2 for their production goods. Producers 1-3 receive the new price quotas for goods 1-A and 1-B asynchronous, hence can upgrade their offer for well 1 twice."}, {"heading": "5.4.2 EFFICIENCY AND CONVERGENCE TO PRICE EQUILIBRIUM", "text": "In some cases, the difference between the two (g) and p (g) may indeed be very high.

For each instance, we selected production costs uniformly [0.1], but for each consumer in a network, we calculated a fixed value, so that, excluding all other consumers, there is a positive excess solution for this consumer with a 0.9 probability. We determined consumer values by simulation, assuming the specific distributions of production costs.

We tested more cases easier than part of a broader study (Walsh et al., 2000).Recall (from Section 5.4.2) that efficiency loss in SAMP-SB is essentially due to three, not necessarily exclusive, causes: dead ends, the failure to form a solution when a positively rated solution exists, and a suboptimal solution. We can show the percentage of suboptimal substances in SAMP-SB by examining the differences between SAMP-SB-D and SAMP-SB."}, {"heading": "7.

Theorem 13. Theorem 13 The calm state of SAMP-SB is a \u03bb-\u03b4 competitive equilibrium for a tree. Proof. We prove by induction at the S-level of the producers that no producer changes his original production supply. Since the purchase offers never fall, it follows that a producer, when he wins his production, does not lose his production in any successive state of the course of the protocol. Since a producer only bids for his inputs when he wins his production, no inactive producer will buy any positive price performance, and the current theorem follows from the 11th base case: Supply policy stipulates that a producer at S-level never changes his original production supply."}, {"heading": "A.10 Proof of Theorem 14", "text": "Theorem 14 The calm state of the safe SAMP-SB is a competitive equilibrium (\u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2) for a network without complementary inputaries.Proof. We will show that no inactive producer buys his input data at a positive price in the quiet phase of the safe SAMP-SB. Since the characteristics of the safe SAMP-SB during the rest phase are the same as during the rest phase, the current theorem then follows from Theorem 11. On the contrary, let us assume that the producer wins his input data at a positive price but loses his supply for production."}, {"heading": "A.11 Proof of Theorem 15", "text": "When we prove the theory, we refer to the C-level and S-level of the producers in a network as defined at the beginning of the section."}, {"heading": "A.12 Proof of Theorem 16", "text": "Theorem 16 If SAMP-SB achieves a quasi-calm with p (g) < vc (g) for some < g, c > E, c (c), then the state of the system represents a valid solution.Evidence. Since the definition of quasi-calm requires that active producers do not change their bids, they must be feasible.All other actors are feasible by definition. The price of an active producer's production goods must not be less than the total price of its input goods, otherwise it would increase its production supply and thus violate quasi-calm. Because p (g) < vc (g) consumers c (g) its offer for g. A consumer bids in such a way that he gains only one unit of a commodity, and consumers do not change their bids to quasi-calm. Finally, the auction guarantees that there is a one-to-one mapping between successful bids and successful bids for all goods, thereby ensuring a material balance."}, {"heading": "A.13 Proof of Theorem 17", "text": "Theorem 17. If a run of SAMP-SB in (V, E) is in a valid solution state (\u03b2 \u03b2), so that: \u2022 each consumer c wins either an offer or p (g) + \u03b4b > vc (g) for all < g, c > E, \u2022 all agents have correct beliefs about what goods they are currently winning \u2022 all bids from consumers and active producers were received in response to current price quotations, \u2022 and no sales offers are lost due to a tie, then after the subsequent price offer from each auction the system will be in a quasi-calm state with a valid solution. Proof: Let the current prices be p. The current consumer supply policy dictates that consumers will not change their offers under the stated conditions. Since we have a valid solution, each producer is feasible and therefore does not increase any of their wholesale offers. Therefore, no agent will modify any purchase offer."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "Supply chain formation is the process of determining the structure and terms of exchange relationships to enable a multilevel, multiagent production activity. We present a simple model of supply chains, highlighting two characteristic features: hierarchical subtask decomposition, and resource contention. To decentralize the formation process, we introduce a market price system over the resources produced along the chain. In a competitive equilibrium for this system, agents choose locally optimal allocations with respect to prices, and outcomes are optimal overall. To determine prices, we define a market protocol based on distributed, progressive auctions, and myopic, non-strategic agent bidding policies. In the presence of resource contention, this protocol produces better solutions than the greedy protocols common in the artificial intelligence and multiagent systems literature. The protocol often converges to high-value supply chains, and when competitive equilibria exist, typically to approximate competitive equilibria. However, complementarities in agent production technologies can cause the protocol to wastefully allocate inputs to agents that do not produce their outputs. A subsequent decommitment phase recovers a significant fraction of the lost surplus.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.90a Copyright 2002 Radical Eye Software"}}}
