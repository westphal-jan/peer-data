In many domains it is desirable to assess such preferences in a qualitative rather than quantitative way. In this paper, we propose a qualitative graphical representation of preferences that reflects conditional dependence and independence of preference statements under a ceteris paribus (all else being equal) interpretation. Such a representation is often compact and arguably quite natural in many circumstances. We provide a formal semantics for this model, and describe how the structure of the network can be exploited in several inference tasks, such as determining whether one outcome dominates (is preferred to) another, ordering a set outcomes according to the preference relation, and constructing the best outcome subject to available evidence.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:32:52 GMT  (2056kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0023v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["c boutilier", "r i brafman", "c domshlak", "h h hoos", "d poole"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0023"}, "pdf": {"name": "1107.0023.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "CP-nets: A Tool for Representing and Reasoning with Conditional Ceteris Paribus Preference Statements", "authors": ["Craig Boutilier", "Ronen I.

The reason for such intensive analysis of these predictions finds its succinct expression in the opening of Hansen's (1996) essay: When discussing with my wife which table we should buy for our living room, I said, \"A round table is better than a square table.\" By this I did not mean that any round table, regardless of its other characteristics, is better than any square table. Rather, I meant that any round table is better (for our living room) than any square table that does not significantly differ in its other characteristics, such as size, type of wood, finish, price, etc. That is the preference paribus or \"everything else.\""}, {"heading": "2.1 Preference Relations", "text": "We focus our attention on single-step decision problems with complete information, ignoring in this paper all questions arising from multi-step sequential decision analysis and any consideration of risks arising in the context of uncertainties.

Each action that is taken in a state has a specific outcome (we do not concern ourselves with uncertainty about the impact or knowledge of the state). The amount of all results is determined by O.

However, the general definition of a CP network can allow an arbitrary total preorder iu to Dom (Xi), which allows the user to express indifference between two values of variable X, say x and x. \"We denounce this with x\" in the CPT (X).It turns out that the ceteris paribus semantics is quite strong when we say that two variable values are equally preferred. Example 4 Consider the following two CPTs for a network using variables A and B, where A is a parent of B: a; a: b) b) b) b) b) b) b) b) should be a parent of B) b) b) b) b) a parent of b) b)."}, {"heading": "3.

More generally, we assume that we have evidence that restricts possible outcomes in the form of an instantiation z \u2212 n of a subset Z V of network variables. Determining the best completion of z vi (i.e., the best result consistent with z) can be achieved in much the same way as we are now using it.

Unfortunately, the TreeDT procedure for polytree CP meshes is not complete unless it is extended with some form of traceability (even if it is limited to binary variables) due to the fact that several parents of a particular node are allowed to flip their values, but only one of the choices can lead to the target result, while the others lead to a dead end. Consider, for example, the CP mesh N in Figure 9 and the query N | = ab c a causal causal causal causal causal causal causal c, starting with the result a b b c, in the first iteration of TreeDT, we have the choice of either A or B. If B is selected, the mapping to a bc will be changed.

(Brafman & Domshlak, 2003) These results also imply that dominance tests for binary-rated CP networks remain in np if the number of unique paths between each pair of nodes in the CP network is polynomically bundled.

Concluding Remarks", "text": "In this thesis, we introduced CP networks, a new graphical model for displaying qualitative preference arrangements that reflects the conditional dependence and independence of preference statements in the context of ceteris paribus semantics. This formal framework provides a compact and arguably natural representation of preference information and allows us to efficiently answer some of the most important forms of preference requests. We described several types of queries and algorithms for answering them in relation to a specific CP network. In particular, it was shown that result optimization and result arrangement techniques can be solved in a temporally linear manner in relation to the number of variables in the network. However, in the case of dominance queries, the situation is more complicated. First, we demonstrated the equivalence of answering dominance queries with the task of the existence of an improving (or deteriorating) sequence of variable value changes in relation to the given CP network. Subsequently, we reduced the latter task to a specific search for a sub-class of general insights that we are using for several possible subclassifications in the structure."}, {"heading": "7.1 Applications", "text": "One such application - preferential driven adaptive multimedia presentation - was recently developed at Ben-Gurion University (Domshlak et al., 2001; Gudes et al., 2002).We have described the key components of this system in Section 3.2. Another application where both conceptual and computer-specific properties of CP networks appear to be useful is a distributed meeting planner. A basic prototype for such a system was implemented at Bengurion University (Brafman & Domshlak, 2001).We are expanding this system while working on the related theoretical problem of multiagent optimization."}, {"heading": "7.2 Related Work", "text": "A number of lines of research relate to CP networks. In addition to the conceptual work in philosophy and philosophical logic described in Section 2, in AI, Doyle and Wellman (1991, 1994), ceteris paribus assertions and their logical properties are examined. However, it is not clear whether useful questions can be answered within this framework, and in particular graphic representations of preference statements are not taken into account. To get the most out of our knowledge, there are no computer-based results for this formalism. Therefore, it is not clear whether useful questions can be answered within this framework. On the surface, CP networks are reminiscent of Bayean networks (Pearl, 1988), which also include graphical structures that capture conditional claims of independence. Indeed, Bayesian networks and their use of probable independence provide important motivation for our work, but the two structures differ significantly from each other."}, {"heading": "7.3 Future Work", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules that they need for their work, and they are able to play by the rules that they need for their work."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Some parts of this paper appeared in C.

In many domains it is desirable to assess such preferences in a qualitative rather than quantitative way.

Such a representation is often compact and arguably quite natural in many circumstances. We provide a formal semantics for this model, and describe how the structure of the network can be exploited in several inference tasks, such as determining whether one outcome dominates (is preferred to) another, ordering a set outcomes according to the preference relation, and constructing the best outcome subject to available evidence.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.86 Copyright 1999 Radical Eye Software"}}}
