Its design clearly separates explicit and symbolic directed exploration algorithms from the set of on-line and off-line computed estimates and associated data structures. MIPS has shown distinguished performance in the last two international planning competitions. In the last event the description language was extended from pure propositional planning to include numerical state variables, action durations, and plan quality objective functions. Plans were no longer sequences of actions but time-stamped schedules. As a participant of the fully automated track of the competition, MIPS has proven to be a general system; in each track and every benchmark domain it efficiently computed plans of remarkable quality. This article introduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were necessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems and to achieve a high level of performance. The extensions include critical path analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal parallel plans. The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses known NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect to the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of this algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each encountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is scheduled. One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds and simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers knowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain object symmetries. The latter aspect is analyzed in detail. MIPS has been developed to serve as a complete and optimal state space planner, with admissible estimates, exploration engines and branching cuts. In the competition version, however, certain performance compromises had to be made, including floating point arithmetic, weighted heuristic search exploration according to an inadmissible estimate and parameterized optimization.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:33:38 GMT  (895kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0025v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["s edelkamp"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0025"}, "pdf": {"name": "1107.0025.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Taming Numbers and Durations in the Model Checking Integrated Planning System", "authors": ["Stefan Edelkamp"], "emails": ["stefan.edelkamp@cs.uni-dortmund.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "MIPS has performed excellently in the last two international planning competitions.

Henceforth, the planning process is roughly grouped into three phases, pre-compilation, heuristic search planning and the construction of schedules. The problem and domain description files are fed into the system, analysed and grounded, which fixes the state space problem to be solved.

Relaxed Planning Euristics (RPH) The approximation of the number of planning steps required to solve the planning problem, removing all deletion effects (Hoffmann & Nebel, 2001). Heuristics is constructive, i.e. it returns the number of operators that appear in relaxed planning. Numerical Relaxed Planning Euristics (Numerical RPH) Our extension to RPH for dealing with numbers is a combined propository and numerical approximation scheme that allows the application of multiple operators.Sample database heuristic (explicitly PDB) Various planning space abstractions are found greedily and result in a selection of pattern databases that fit into the main memory.

Weighting the influence of heuristic estimation can accelerate solution finding, but also influence optimality (Pohl, 1977).Iterative-Deepening A * (IDA *) The memory-limited variant of A * is suitable for large exploration problems with valuation functions of small integer ranges and low time complexity (Korf, 1985).IDA * can be expanded with bit-state hashing (Edelkamp & Meyer, 2001) to improve double detection of ordinary transit stable tables (Hoffmann, 1994).Reinforced search problem (D)."}, {"heading": "3.5 Composition of the Competition Version", "text": "In Figure 1, we shaded the parts that were actually used in the competitive version of MIPS in dark gray. We used relaxed planning heuristically for sequential plan generation. We used relaxed planning heuristically while it was used in temporary domains. Only in Level 2, we used the numerically advanced RPH techniques since it was added to the system in the final weeks of the competition. We experimented with (symbolic) pattern databases with different results. As pattern databases are purely propositional in our implementation and do not offer the restoration of operators in the optimal abstract plan, we did not include them in the competitive version. Our approach to enhance relaxed planning with numerical information helps find plans in challenging numerical domains such as settlers and was influenced by Hoffmann's work on his competing planner Metric-FF (Hoffmann, 2002a)."}, {"heading": "3.6 Visualization", "text": "For the visualization of plans with MIPS, we have expanded the animation system Vega (Hipke, 2000); a client-server architecture that executes a commented algorithm on the server side, which is visualized on the client side in a Java front end.

We have expanded Vega in two ways (see Figures 7 and 8).Called Chart Visualization Gannt Charts are representations for schedules in which horizontal bars are drawn for each activity, indicating the estimated duration / cost.

Of course, this option assumes that the time structure only contributes to the value of the plan and not to its accuracy. That is, it assumes that there is in fact no necessary simultaneity in a valid plan. In cases where measures are achieved at their starting points and these are deleted at their end points, contemporaneity can be a necessary part of the structure of a valid plan.

A delay in any tasks on the critical path results in a delay in the project. At the heart of PERT is a network of tasks required to complete a project that shows the order in which the tasks must be completed and the dependencies between them. As shown in Figure 10, PERT scheduling reduces to a variant of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in acyclic graphs (Cormen, Leiserson, & Rivest, 1990). As a fact, the algorithm provides the length of the critical path, not the plan derived from it. However, observing the temporary plan is simple. In the algorithms, e (Oi) is the most temporary end time of the operator Oi, i."}, {"heading": "4.4 On the Optimality of MIPS", "text": "Since MIPS optimally plans the sequence plans, the question remains whether the system will ultimately find an optimal plan. However, in the competition, the system ends when the first sequence plan is found. As relaxed planning is heuristically not permitted, all A * variants cannot guarantee optimal (sequential or parallel) planning. However, it is desirable to calculate optimal plans, even if - due to limited computing resources - the search for optimal but limited plans is difficult. This leads directly to the following na\u00efve plan renumeration algorithms: Each operator starts or ends either at the beginning or end of another operator's time. Therefore, at least a limited number of measures in the optimal plan require a potentially exponential but limited number of possible parallel plans."}, {"heading": "4.5 Pruning Anomalies", "text": "Acceleration techniques such as the detection of duplicates in sequential planning must be carefully selected to maintain the parallel plan length optimization, as the following example shows.

In the competitive version of MIPS, we did not use any time packaging because no optimal solutions were required and the practical runtime behavior is poor. Instead, we used an A * search engine that ends with the first established solution. The question remains: Is there still hope of finding near-optimal parallel maps?

In optimizing time, the sequence of boarding and zooming actions is important. In optimizing total fuel consumption, we reduce the speed to reduce fuel consumption to 333.33 per flight, but we can take the first passenger on board immediately.

However, when two tanks are emptied in one place, they can be considered symmetrical again.

Our work is based on similarities produced by the TIM inference module (Fox & Long, 1998). While searching for additional information at the current symmetry level in the form of an object transformation, the matrix is stored and updated with each state. Our approach is different in the sense that it efficiently calculates object symmetries for each state and it does not consume additional space per node expansion.

Its design clearly separates explicit and symbolic directed exploration algorithms from the set of on-line and off-line computed estimates and associated data structures. MIPS has shown distinguished performance in the last two international planning competitions. In the last event the description language was extended from pure propositional planning to include numerical state variables, action durations, and plan quality objective functions. Plans were no longer sequences of actions but time-stamped schedules. As a participant of the fully automated track of the competition, MIPS has proven to be a general system; in each track and every benchmark domain it efficiently computed plans of remarkable quality. This article introduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were necessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems and to achieve a high level of performance. The extensions include critical path analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal parallel plans. The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses known NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect to the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of this algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each encountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is scheduled. One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds and simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers knowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain object symmetries. The latter aspect is analyzed in detail. MIPS has been developed to serve as a complete and optimal state space planner, with admissible estimates, exploration engines and branching cuts. In the competition version, however, certain performance compromises had to be made, including floating point arithmetic, weighted heuristic search exploration according to an inadmissible estimate and parameterized optimization.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.90a Copyright 2002 Radical Eye Software"}}}
