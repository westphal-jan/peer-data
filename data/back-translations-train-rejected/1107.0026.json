The suggested applications are in natural language processing, more specifically in surface natural language generation and in machine translation, where a sentence is obtained by first generating a large set of candidate sentences, represented in a compact way, and then by filtering such a set through a parser. We study several formal properties of IDL-expressions and compare this new formalism with more standard ones. We also present a novel parsing algorithm for IDL-expressions and prove a non-trivial upper bound on its time complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:33:50 GMT  (139kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0026v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["m j nederhof", "g satta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0026"}, "pdf": {"name": "1107.0026.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Mark-Jan Nederhof", "markjan let.rug.nl", "Giorgio Satta"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "Journal of Arti ial Intelligen e Resear h 21 (2004) 287-317 Submitted 06/03; published 03/04", "text": "It's about the question of whether it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way and it's about a way"}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": null, "creator": "dvips(k) 5.86 Copyright 1999 Radical Eye Software"}}}
