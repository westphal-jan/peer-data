Recommendation systems help users find items of interest of a particular type, such as movies or restaurants, but are still somewhat awkward to use. Our solution is to take advantage of the complementary strengths of personalized recommendation systems and dialogue systems, creating personalized aides. We present a system -- the Adaptive Place Advisor -- that treats item selection as an interactive, conversational process, with the program inquiring about item attributes and the user responding. Individual, long-term user preferences are unobtrusively obtained in the course of normal recommendation dialogues and used to direct future conversations with the same user. We present a novel user model that influences both item search and the questions asked during a conversation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in significantly reducing the time and number of interactions required to find a satisfactory item, as compared to a control group of users interacting with a non-adaptive version of the system.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:34:41 GMT  (227kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0029v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["m h goker", "p langley", "c a thompson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0029"}, "pdf": {"name": "1107.0029.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Personalized System for Conversational Recommendations", "authors": ["Cynthia A.

Introduction and Motivation", "text": "User systems help users to find and select personalized elements (e.g. books, movies, restaurants) from the vast amount of information available on the Web or in other electronic information sources (Burke, 1999; Resnick & Varian, 1997; Burke, Hammond, & Young, 1996); in view of a large number of elements and a description of the user's needs, they present to the user a small number of elements that fit well into the description; recent work in recommendation systems includes smart helpers for filtering and selecting websites (Eliassi-Rad & Shavlik, 2001), news stories (Ardissono, Goy, Console, & Torre, 2001), TV listings (Cotter & Smyth, 2000) and other information. Users of such systems often have different, contradictory needs; differences in personal preferences, social and educational systems are pervasive interests; as a result, it seems desirable to have personalized intelligent systems."}, {"heading": "2. Personalized Conversational Recommendation Systems", "text": "Our research objectives are twofold: firstly, to improve both the quality of interaction in recommendation systems and the benefits of results by making them adaptable and conversational; secondly, to improve the performance of the dialog system through personalization; therefore, our goals for user modeling differ from those commonly adopted in recommendation systems, such as improving accuracy or associated measures such as precision and recall; and secondly, our goals differ from those of previous work in the field of user modeling in dialog systems (Haller & McRoy, 1998; Kobsa & Wahlster, 1989; Carberry, 1990; Kass, 1991), which emphasize the ability to pursue the user's goals as a dialogue progression, but typically do not sustain the models over multiple conversations. Our hypothesis is that improvements in efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved by using an inconspicuously preserved user model to help guide the conversational search of the system for the recommended elements."}, {"heading": "2.1 Personalization", "text": "The goal of this customization is to increase the quality and appropriateness of both the interaction and the results generated for each user; the user models stored by personalized systems may represent stereotypical users (Chin, 1989; Rich, 1979) or individuals; they may be handmade or learned (e.g. from questionnaires, ratings or usage traces); and they may contain information about the behavior of previously selected articles, preferences in terms of article characteristics (e.g. location or price); the characteristics of the users themselves (Kobsa & Occupation), 1989; Rich, 1979; some systems may store user models only for the duration of an interaction with a user. (Carberry, Chu-Carroll, Elzer, 1999; Smith Hipp, 1994); Fiedler, Fiedler, who is himself."}, {"heading": "2.2 Conversational Recommendation", "text": "The goal of recommendation systems is to help users find interesting topics, and therefore they must exclude some decisions from consideration while keeping others in mind. To achieve this, they must either know or determine the interests of the current user, then they must present elements that satisfy those interests. However, one of the most commonly used approaches to obtaining information in recommendation systems is the use of a simple form (usually a single query field) that the user fills in a list. Paired with this, a common presentation format is the ranking list approach. In this scheme, the system presents a usually long list of results, ordered by their predicted relevance to the user. The combined technique of obtaining information through a form and presentation in a list that arises from information retrievance, where it was used to find documents or reports during library research. The basic method we refer to as a ranking is more general, but more user-friendly, and easier to use in the search engine."}, {"heading": "2.3 Conversation via Dialogue Management", "text": "The most important tasks performed by dialog systems are speech interpretation, speech generation and dialogue management. Natural language interpretation and creation are topics in themselves, and we will not discuss them here; for two introductory texts, see Allen (1995) and Jurafsky and Martin (2000). This answer shows that the researcher will have learned to use the system more efficiently; the simplest dialog managers are based on finite-state automata, in which the states correspond to questions and arcs depending on a user-provided answer (Stent, Dowding, Gawron, Bratt, & Moore, 1999; Winograd & Flores, 1986). These systems support the so-called fixed or system-initiative conversation, in which only one of the participants controls the system whether the system addresses the co-determination system (Panatt, & Moore, 1999; Winograd & Flores, 1986)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Interactive Constraint-Satisfaction Search", "text": "This year, it will be able to solve and fix the problems mentioned."}, {"heading": "3.1 The User Model", "text": "Our focus on personalized conversations suggests that a fine-grained model of user preferences, the emphasis on the questions a user prefers to answer, and the answers he tends to give in addition to the preferences of entire articles. We will now describe this model in more detail. In later sections, we will describe how it affects the number of articles and the question posed. Generally, a user may tend to answer questions about some attributes more frequently than others."}, {"heading": "3.2 The Retrieval Engine", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have set themselves, and they will be able to play by the rules they have set themselves in order to achieve their goals."}, {"heading": "3.3 Conversing with the User", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "3.4 Updating the User Model", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to move to another world in which they are able to integrate, to a world in which they are able, in which they are able to live, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able to change the world, in which they are able to change the world, in which they are able to change the world in which they are in."}, {"heading": "4. System Evaluation", "text": "To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment with a version of the Adaptive Place Advisor, which recommends restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area. The system describes elements that use seven attributes: cuisine, rating, price, location, reservations, parking options, and payment options. Most attributes have few values, but cuisine and location have dozens. There are about 1,900 elements in the databases. We asked several users, all from the Bay Area, to interact with the system to help them decide where to eat. Users received no external guidance or instructions on which types of restaurant to select, except to search for and select those that they might actually be patronized. An experimenter was present during all of these interactions that were filmed, but his help was not needed, except in rare cases where a subject repeatedly tried out words that were not included in the speech recognition grammar."}, {"heading": "4.1 Experimental Variables", "text": "To test our hypothesis on the benefits of personalization in the Adaptive Place Advisor, we controlled two independent variables: the presence of user models and the number of times a user interacted with the system. First, because we believed that users could improve their interactions with the Place Advisor over time, we divided the subjects into an experimental or modeling group and a control group. 13 subjects in the modeling group interacted with a version of the system described in Section 3.4. 11 subjects in the control group interacted with a version that did not update the model, but the selected attributes and items from the standard distribution in Section 3.1. Of course, users were not aware of their assigned group."}, {"heading": "4.2 Experimental Results", "text": "The persons mentioned are able to abide by the rules that they are able to abide by the rules that they have applied in practice."}, {"heading": "4.3 Discussion", "text": "In summary, our experiment showed that the Adaptive Place Advisor improved the efficiency of conversations with subjects as it gained experience with them over time, and that this improvement was due to updating the user models of the system, rather than to subjects learning how to interact with the system. This conclusion is based on significant differences between user models and control groups, both in terms of the number of interactions and the time per conversation. This is true even with large error bars and a small sample size. This, in turn, implies that the differences are large and the system could make a significant difference to users. Results in terms of effectiveness were more ambiguous, with trends in the right direction, but no significant differences between the modeling and control groups. Subjects in both conditions generally liked the system, but we found no significant differences along this dimension. A larger study may be necessary to determine whether such differences occur. Further user studies are warranted to investigate the differences between the two sources."}, {"heading": "5. Related Research", "text": "Previous research on related topics can be roughly divided into three areas, with the first focusing on personalized recommendation systems, the second on conversation interfaces, and the third on adaptive dialog systems."}, {"heading": "5.1 Personalized Recommendation Systems", "text": "Although research into personalised recommendation systems has only become widespread in recent years, the basic idea cannot be traced back to Rich (1979), nor can it be discussed with other work on conversation interfaces. Langley (1999) provides a more in-depth review of recent research on adaptive interfaces and personalisation.Several other adaptive interfaces attempt to capture user information inconspicuously. An interesting example is the Casper project (Rafter et al., 2000), an online recruitment service. The project investigates methods that translate click and read time data into accurate relevance information, since the raw data is naturally loud. Similarly, Goecks and Shavlik (2000) describe a technique for learning web preferences by observing a user's surfing behavior. Another example is the Adaptive Routing Consultant (Rogers et al., 1999), which recommends guiding routes to a particular destination."}, {"heading": "5.2 Conversational Interfaces", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able to determine themselves are not able to determine themselves what they want and what they want. In fact, it is the case that they are able to determine themselves what they want and what they want. In fact, it is the case that they are not ready to decide what they want and what they want. In fact, it is the case that they are not ready to decide what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "5.3 Adaptive Dialogue Systems", "text": "Finally, another body of recent work describes the use of machine learning or other forms of adaptation to improve dialog systems. (10 researchers in this field develop systems that learn user preferences, improve task completion, or adapt dialog strategies to an individual during a conversation. The next such work also pursues our goal of learning user preferences. (1999) Such an example of consultation dialogues, but take a different approach. Your system acquires user preferences by pursuing both the explicit statements of the user and their acceptance or rejection of the system's proposals. It uses discrete preference values instead of our finer-grained probability model. Also, its system does not use preferences during article search, but only during article presentation time to evaluate whether better alternatives exist. Finally, its evaluation is based on assessments of the quality of the system's hypotheses and recommendations."}, {"heading": "6. Directions for Future Work", "text": "Our results so far with the Adaptive Place Advisor are promising, but much remains to be done. In this section, we discuss ways to make the search model more flexible, expand the conversation model, and enrich the user model and learning technique."}, {"heading": "6.1 Search Model", "text": "In terms of the search mechanism, we first plan to explore alternative techniques for using item similarity values to determine which are to be returned, for example, by truncating items at the point where the similarity diminishes most, rather than our current use of a threshold. We also note that works like those by Cohen, Schapire and Singer (1999) for instance learning could be nicely applied to this work by extending our current item ranking scheme. Furthermore, we plan to develop a version of the system that generates alternative items or values in an excessive situation (Qu & Beale, 1999). One way to do this would be to use the preferences to estimate the strength of a stated item ranking barrier system, or to link our preference-based similarity scale to a more traditional domain-specific attribute buint metric (Pieraccini et al., 1997). We also plan to evaluate the effects of producing even stronger preferences over time."}, {"heading": "6.2 Conversational Model", "text": "First, we plan to increase the number of speech files available to the user, for example by adding confirmation dialogs and improving current clarification dialogs to enable other types of adaptation strategies, as in Singh et al. (2002). In a longer-term study, we plan to expand our adaptation techniques to include more complex itinerary planning dialogues (Seneff, Lau, & Polifroni, 1999; Walker & Hirschman, 2000), which may require additions to the user model, such as preferences in terms of language and style of dialogue, including initiative, system complexity and vocabulary, which in turn need to be appropriately acquired and used by the system. In general, the insights we have already gained in using and acquiring user preferences at various interfaces of the dialog and search process should prove useful to support personalization in other tasks."}, {"heading": "6.3 User Model", "text": "To improve the user model, we first plan to add more types of preferences. As we discussed in Section 3.1, combinations and diversity preferences can capture more complex user behavior than our current model, and we plan to include both in the next version of our system. Combination preferences can help predict both values or acceptable attributes better, which in turn affect the similarity calculation and the case basis. (Agrawal, Imielinski, & Swami, 1993) or refer to a Bayesian network that in turn influences the query, in the form of similarity calculations and the case basis. For preferences on acceptable attribute combinations, the system can learn conditional probabilities and use them to influence attributes."}, {"heading": "6.4 Evaluation", "text": "Finally, we plan to conduct a larger user study. We need to further verify that the differences in our study are not due to different task priorities, as we did not control the difficulty of finding a particular element. Specifically, different values for the same constraints may not result in the same number of matching elements. So, although two users answered the same number of questions, the number of matching elements can be small enough for a user to start presenting them, while the other user may have to answer additional questions first. To support an extended rating, we have implemented a version of the system that recommends movies that let us draw from a broader user base. This should help us more easily measure user satisfaction, as Walker et al. (1998) noted that efficiency is not the only important consideration and that users tend to prefer more predictable interfaces."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we described an intelligent adaptive conversation wizard designed to help people select an element. Overall, we have made significant progress on methods for discreetly acquiring an individual, long-term user model during referral interviews. We have expanded our work to date on adaptive recommendation systems that were not conversation-oriented, and on dialog systems that were not user-adaptive. Our long-term goal is to develop even more powerful methods that are able to adapt to a user's needs, goals, and preferences over multiple conversations. While we are effectively using the feedback between conversation and recommendation, such feedback is likely to be present in other tasks such as planning or planning.The two key issues addressed by our research are designing adaptive recommendation systems when conversations are the interaction mode, and complementing personalization in dialog systems, starting here with referral dialogues. Unlike many referral systems, this model is to create a keyword list and accept its options as one."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was conducted while the lead author was at Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and Information, and the other authors were at the DaimlerChrysler Research and Technology Center in Palo Alto, California.

We also plan to evaluate the effect of making even stronger assumptions about user preferences. For example, if the system is certain enough about a value preference, it may not have to ask a question about the associated attribute. A final improvement of the search mechanism concerns the techniques for ranking attributes for constraining and relaxing. For attribute constraint ranking, we have implemented but not yet evaluated a conditional entropy measure (G\u00f6ker & Thompson, 2000). The system selects the attribute to constrain by determining the attribute with the highest conditional entropy among the unconstrained attributes. This scheme would not be useful for ranking attributes to relax. Therefore, the system simply determines the size of the case base that would result if each attribute were relaxed, ranks these case bases from smallest to largest, and orders the attributes accordingly, excluding those attributes that, if relaxed, would still result in an empty case base. We also plan to investigate the combination of the user model with information gain, as well as with alternative attribute ranking techniques such as the one used by Abella, Brown, and Buntschuh (1996).

Individual, long-term user preferences are unobtrusively obtained in the course of normal recommendation dialogues and used to direct future conversations with the same user.
