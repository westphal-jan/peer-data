Introduction", "text": "Many market decision issues involve some anticipation or prediction of future prices. Price forecasts are, for example, particularly important when it comes to making a binding offer to purchase a commodity that needs to be purchased at a later date. Such scenarios arise whenever there are sequential or overlapping auctions for related goods. Although market forecasting techniques are widely used, we are not aware of any studies that examine the issue in a context reminiscent of multi-auction auction environments. Annual Trading Agent Competition (TAC) (Wellman et al., 2003) provides a practical medium for studying approaches to price forecasting. as an open invitation tournament, it has attracted a diverse community of researchers interested in many aspects of trading agent strategy. Price forecasting has proven to be a central theme in the TAC market game, 1 and an interesting set of approaches has emerged from the game designers \"efforts to predict prices over three years, as well as being a regular observation of the market."}, {"heading": "2. TAC Travel-Shopping Game", "text": "The TAC Market game presents a travel shopping task in which the merchants assemble flights, hotels and entertainment programs for a set of eight likely generated customers. Customers are described by their preferred arrival and departure dates (pa and pd), the premium (hp) they are willing to pay for staying in the \"towers\" (T), rather than \"shanties\" (S), and their values for three different types of entertainment programs. The objective of the agents is to maximize the value of travel for their customers, the expenditures in the markets for travel vouchers. Flights. A feasible trip includes the round-trip air, which consists of an in-flight day i and outflight day."}, {"heading": "3.

TAC-02 Agents", "text": "The nineteen agents participating in the TAC-02 tournament are listed in Table 1, which shows the average results of the finals and semi-finals, as well as weighted averages for the seeding round. For an overview of most of these agents, see the survey (2003a) published by Greenwald. The seeding rounds were held from July 1 to July 12, with each agent playing 440 games. Weights increased every day, so that later games counted more than before, and the lowest 10 points for each agent were dropped. The top 16 agents reached the semi-finals, which took place on July 28 in Edmonton, Canada. There were two semi-final rounds: H1, consisting of agents seeded 1-4 and 13-16, with the 5-12 seeds placed in heat H2. The top four teams from each run (14 games, lowest scoring) advanced to the finals, which ran 32 matches on the same day, with the 5-12 seedings placed in heat H2. Further details on the TAC / 02 / tac tournament are available at http: / tac-tac / www.."}, {"heading": "5. Price Prediction Survey", "text": "Shortly after the TAC-02 event, we distributed a survey to all participants who provided descriptions and data on their agents \"price forecasting methods. Sixteen out of 19 teams responded to the survey, including 14 out of 16 semi-finalists and all eight finalists. The result provides a detailed picture of the forecasting techniques used and allows a comparison of their effectiveness in terms of a shared experience - the TAC-02 final and semi-finals.13 out of 16 respondents stated that their agents have in fact produced explicit price forecasts for use in their trading strategies, of which thirteen are listed in Table 2, along with some high-level descriptors of their approach to the initial forecasting task. 2 Furthermore, tniTac and zepp responded that price forecasts were part of their agent design but were not sufficiently developed to be used in the tournament. TOMAhack reported an ambitious design (also not really applied) based on model-free policy predictions that take other agents\" behavior into account."}, {"heading": "5.1 Forms of Prediction", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have established in the past, and they will be able to play by the rules they have established in the past."}, {"heading": "5.2 Information Employed", "text": "For TAC-02, all agents except Walverine use historical information in their predictions. Only ATTac, kavayaH and Walverine use airfares. All agents constructing Pricelines effectively take into account the preferences of their customers. Walverine does not construct Pricelines, but takes into account its own customer preferences as part of its equilibrium calculations. The identities of other agents participating in a game instance are not known during the TAC preliminary rounds (qualifying and seeding rounds), as the agents are randomly drawn into a round robin tournament. However, in the semi-finals and final rounds a group of eight agents was set for a series of games, so that the identities of other agents could be observed effectively. ATTac is the only agent to take advantage of the availability of this information."}, {"heading": "6. Approaches to Price Prediction", "text": "On the basis of survey results, we classify TAC 02 prediction techniques into three categories."}, {"heading": "6.1 Historical Averaging", "text": "Most agents took a relatively straightforward approach to the initial price forecast, estimating hotel bookings based on the observed historical average. For example, harami calculated the average hotel prices for the previous 200 games and used these as a baseline forecast. The respective agents classified as \"historical\" in Table 2 differ in the type of games they played 3. WhiteBear also reported that they used price indicators for the interim forecast (Vetsikas & Selman, 2003), but initial predictions were essentially points. Including the average but most frequently used games from the seeding round. In the face of a data set, agents tend to use the sample mean or distribution itself as an estimate, 4 at least as a starting point. The majority of average agents fixed a pool of previous games and did not update the averages during the finals. An exception was Southk, which used a moving average of the previous round of the current ten or the previous round as a starting point."}, {"heading": "6.2 Machine Learning", "text": "The premise of this approach is that game-specific features provide potentially predictable information that allows the agent to anticipate the hotel's price directions before they manifest themselves in pricing (Stone et al., 2003). The development of the technique was explicitly motivated by the TAC pricing problem, although the resulting algorithm is fairly general. ATTac learns a predictor for each hotel type and day category (i.e. days 1 and 4 are treated symmetrically as if they were able to determine prices)."}, {"heading": "6.3 Competitive Analysis", "text": "Walverine's overall approach to the TAC markets is to assume that they are well approximated by a competitive economy (Cheng et al., 2004). His method of forecasting hotel prices is a literal application of this assumption. Specifically, he calculates the competitive equilibrium of the TAC economy, defined as a set of prices at which all markets would be clear, provided other agents behave as price winners (Katzner, 1989). Taking into account exogenously set airfares, Walverine finds a set of hotel prices that support such an equilibrium, and reflects these values as his prediction of the final prices of the hotels. Let p be a vector of hotel prices consisting of elements indicating the price of the hotel type on day i. Run it; i (p) denote agent j's equequequequequequequequate day i at these prices, and write the vector of such claims as xj (p)."}, {"heading": "7.

Evaluating Prediction Quality", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "8.1 Accuracy Measures", "text": "It now remains to assess the effectiveness of the various forecasting approaches in terms of the agents' price forecasts in the actual TAC 02 finals and semi-finals, and to do this we need a measurement that characterizes the accuracy of a prediction p against the actual prices p of a particular game."}, {"heading": "8.1.1 EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE", "text": "A natural measure of the proximity of two price vectors is their Euclidean distance: d (p; p) 24X (h; i) (p; h; i) 2351 = 2; where (h; i) the price of hotel h 2 fS; Tg on day i 2 f1; 2; 3; 4g. Clearly, lower values of d are preferred, and for each p, d (p; p) = 0.The calculation of d is straightforward, and we have done this for all reported predictions for all 60 games. Note that if the value of d is in the form of a distribution, the Euclidean distance of the mean provides a lower limit on the average distance of the components of that distribution. Thus, at least after this measurement, our evaluation of the distribution forecasts with respect to their averages results in a bias in their advantages. Likewise, among all constant predictions, the actual mean of p decreases for a number of games."}, {"heading": "8.1.2 EXPECTED VALUE OF PERFECT PREDICTION", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "8.2 Results", "text": "This year, it is so far that it is only a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "8.3 The Influence of Flight Prices", "text": "Note that the three best price forecasts - ATTac01, Walverine PP and kavayaH - are the very agents who take airfares into account. Initial prices potentially influence hotel prices by influencing agents \"early travel decisions. Theoretically, lower airfares should increase agents\" tendency to travel on those days, and anything else is the same, increasing hotels \"prices on the corresponding days of the stay. Indeed, capturing this effect of airfares was one of the main motivations for Walverine's equilibrium approach. ATTac and kavayaH are trying to induce the relationship between the game data. In particular, kavayaH's designers have studied neural network models based on their hypotheses about which flights are likely to influence hotel prices (Putchala et al., 2002). In order to isolate and quantify the impact of airfares, we have examined the contribution of various factors that Walverine uses in his predictions."}, {"heading": "8.4 Relating Accuracy to Performance", "text": "As shown by the Scatter Plot of Figure 1, our two measurements of accuracy are highly correlated (= 0: 908). Since the EVPP is value-based, this suggests that the accuracy in the previous work by Stone et al. (2003), which evaluated the predictive accuracy and overall performance of ATTac01 in an experimental study, suggests using a different measure of predictive accuracy than that of Stone."}, {"heading": "9. Limitations", "text": "It is important to highlight several limitations of this study that must qualify any conclusions about the effectiveness of the forecasting methods evaluated here. First, we have focused exclusively on the initial price forecast, while many agents have placed more emphasis on the preliminary forecasting task. Second, we have in many cases represented the agents \"predictions by abstracting the actual object generated by their prediction modules. In particular, we reduce the probability distributions to their means and consider only the first unit of a priceline prediction. More generally, we do not consider the very different ways in which agents apply the predictions they generate. Second, it should be acknowledged that, despite the usefulness of isolating focused components of an agent for analysis, complete separation is not possible in principle."}, {"heading": "10. Conclusions", "text": "We have presented a comprehensive overview of the approaches of the first price forecast in TAC-02, with quantitative analysis of its relative accuracy. Our analysis introduces a new metric, the expected value of the perfect forecast, which in an important sense captures the instrumental value of accurate predictions, beyond their nominal conformity with realized results. We draw several conclusions about the price forecasts in TAC from this exercise. First, the results clearly show that incession-specific information can have a significant impact on the pure background story. Three agents use incession-specific information to work better on at least one metric than any constant forecast. In particular, the initial airfares provide significant predictive value. This can be illustrated empirically, as by the success of machine learning agents. The predictive value flows from the impact of airfares on demand for hotels, as demonstrated by the success of the competitive analysis in terms of equality."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This study would not have been possible without the generous cooperation of the TAC-02 participants.
