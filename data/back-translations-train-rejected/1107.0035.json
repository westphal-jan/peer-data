Its inference mechanism takes a scenario describing the constituent interacting components of a system and translates it into a useful mathematical model. This paper presents a novel compositional modelling approach aimed at building model repositories. It furthers the field in two respects. Firstly, it expands the application domain of compositional modelling to systems that can not be easily described in terms of interacting functional components, such as ecological systems. Secondly, it enables the incorporation of user preferences into the model selection process. These features are achieved by casting the compositional modelling problem as an activity-based dynamic preference constraint satisfaction problem, where the dynamic constraints describe the restrictions imposed over the composition of partial models and the preferences correspond to those of the user of the automated modeller. In addition, the preference levels are represented through the use of symbolic values that differ in orders of magnitude.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:35:37 GMT  (649kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0035v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j keppens", "q shen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0035"}, "pdf": {"name": "1107.0035.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Compositional Model Repositories via Dynamic Constraint Satisfaction with Order-of-Magnitude Preferences", "authors": ["Jeroen Keppens", "Qiang Shen"], "emails": ["JEROEN@INF.ED.AC.UK", "QIANGS@INF.ED.AC.UK"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

A model space is an ATMS (de Kleer, 1986) that contains all participants, relationships and assumptions that can be instantiated from a given scenario. In this thesis, the generalized version of the ATMS as introduced by de Kleer (1988) describes how it allows the use of node negations in justifications.

Preferences that express this (relative) degree of appropriateness are linked to the assumptions describing the design decisions of the model, and hence to the attribute-value pairs in the aDCSP. As discussed in Section 2, such an extension of the aDCSP represents an aDPCSP. More specifically, it should be remembered that Section 2.2 provides an order-of-magnitude preference calculation that allows the presentation and reasoning with subjective user preferences for different assumptions of relevance and modeling. Next, Section 2.3 introduces a solution algorithm for aDPCSPs containing an aDCSP, such as those constructed using the Section 3.3.2 approach, and extends it to include subjective user preferences for alternative design decisions."}, {"heading": "3.4 Outline analysis of complexity", "text": "The complexity of the work results from four main sources: 1) the model space construction, 2) the propagation in the ATMS, 3) the model of transformation, and 4) the DPCSP solution.

Firstly, it expands the application domain of compositional modelling to systems that can not be easily described in terms of interacting functional components, such as ecological systems. Secondly, it enables the incorporation of user preferences into the model selection process. These features are achieved by casting the compositional modelling problem as an activity-based dynamic preference constraint satisfaction problem, where the dynamic constraints describe the restrictions imposed over the composition of partial models and the preferences correspond to those of the user of the automated modeller. In addition, the preference levels are represented through the use of symbolic values that differ in orders of magnitude.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.86 Copyright 1999 Radical Eye Software"}}}
