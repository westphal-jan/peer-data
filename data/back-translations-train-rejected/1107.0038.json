In many cases, there is considerable choice for the decision variables. Consider, for example, permutation problems in which we have as many values as variables, and each variable takes an unique value. In such problems, we can choose between a primal and a dual viewpoint. In the dual viewpoint, each dual variable represents one of the primal values, whilst each dual value represents one of the primal variables. Alternatively, by means of channelling constraints to link the primal and dual variables, we can have a combined model with both sets of variables. In this paper, we perform an extensive theoretical and empirical study of such primal, dual and combined models for two classes of problems: permutation problems and injection problems. Our results show that it often be advantageous to use multiple viewpoints, and to have constraints which channel between them to maintain consistency. They also illustrate a general methodology for comparing different constraint models.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:37:09 GMT  (131kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0038v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["b hnich", "b m smith", "t walsh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0038"}, "pdf": {"name": "1107.0038.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Dual Modelling of Permutation and Inje tion ProblemsBrahim Hni h brahim 4.u.ie Cork Constraint Computation Center University College Cork, Cork, IrlandBarbara M.

When writing a limitation program, we need to have as many values as variables and how we represent the limitations of these variables. In many phases there are unilateral limitations on the definition variables. For example, consider permutation problems where we have so many values as variables, and ea h variable assumes a unique value. In su h problems we have a limitation between an origin and a dual point of view.

Introdu tion", "text": "We always have a problem of this kind of problems with the values that underlie us, so that we can easily solve them. In many cases, programming constraints is a highly complex task. In many cases, programming constraints consists of a set of constraints associated with a particular domain of values and a set of constraints allowed for subsets of these variables. In many cases, the definition of constraints and their values depends on many factors that have a good constraint problem for the constraints, and in many cases, modelling the constraints on these variables is impossible. In many cases, it is as if the constraints variables and their values are represented. In a test, the variables can represent the tests, and the values represent the times in which the variables are used."}, {"heading": "2.

Second, the application of AC to the binary, non-equivalent constraints performs as much cut as the maintenance of AC to the constraints of channel circumcision. Furthermore, the application of AC to the constraints of channel circumcision requires longer breathing. Third, adding the constraints of channel circumcision does not reduce the trim and only increases the expenditure for runtime."}, {"heading": "10.4 Dynami Variable And Value Ordering Heuristi s", "text": "In Table 12 we give results for Golomb ruler problems. We observe that the original, all-encompassing model is not ompetitive for the larger problems. The best runtimes are achieved with the hannelling-onstraints (and a primordial alldierent-onstraint), which use the smallest domain or the double-smallest domain heuristi for both sets of variables or for the dual variables. That we use only the primordial variables (and a primordial alldi-erent-onstraint) for the hannelling-onstraints violates the bran hing heuristi. A double point of view seems to represent the bran hing heuristi very significant advantages for this problem.

In su h problems, we an hoose between a primal and a dual viewpoint. In the dual viewpoint, ea h dual variable represents one of the primal values, whilst ea h dual value represents one of the primal variables. Alternatively, by means of hannelling onstraints to link the primal and dual variables, we an have a ombined model with both sets of variables. In this paper, we perform an extensive theoreti al and empiri al study of su h primal, dual and ombined models for two lasses of problems: permutation problems and inje tion problems.
