A soft constraint is a function defined on a collection of variables which associates some measure of desirability with each possible combination of values for those variables. However, the crucial question of the computational complexity of finding the optimal solution to a collection of soft constraints has so far received very little attention. In this paper we identify a class of soft binary constraints for which the problem of finding the optimal solution is tractable. In other words, we show that for any given set of such constraints, there exists a polynomial time algorithm to determine the assignment having the best overall combined measure of desirability. This tractable class includes many commonly-occurring soft constraints, such as 'as near as possible' or 'as soon as possible after', as well as crisp constraints such as 'greater than'. Finally, we show that this tractable class is maximal, in the sense that adding any other form of soft binary constraint which is not in the class gives rise to a class of problems which is NP-hard.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:39:17 GMT  (186kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0043v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["d cohen", "m cooper", "p jeavons", "a krokhin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0043"}, "pdf": {"name": "1107.0043.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["David Cohen"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "A maximum Tra table Class of Soft ConstraintsDavid Cohen d. ohen rhul.a.uk Computer S ien e Department Royal Holloway, University of London, UKMartin Cooper ooper irit.fr IRIT University of Toulouse III, Fran ePeter Jeavons peter.jeavons omlab.ox.a.uk OUCL University of Oxford, UKAndrei Krokhin ak d s.warwi k.a.uk Computer S ien e Department University of Warwi k, UKAbstra tMany resear hers in arti ial intelligent e begin to explore the use of soft onstraints to express a number of (possibly on I ting) problem requirements.

A number of authors have suggested that the usefulness of onstraint should be satisfactory by linking the onstraint in lude nition of an onstraint to lude soft onstraints, whi h allow di erent measures of desirability to be asso iated with di erent omations of values."}, {"heading": "2.

Con lusion", "text": "As we have shown from a number of examples, the problem of finding an optimal mapping for an arbitrary application of soft constraints is generally NP-hard. However, by using the term submodularity, we have identified a large and expressive set of soft constraints for which this problem is acceptable. In part, we have shown that binary soft constraints can be solved with the property of submodularity in ubi time. By using this result, it should be possible to expand the range of optimization problems that can be solved by means of restrictive programming.
