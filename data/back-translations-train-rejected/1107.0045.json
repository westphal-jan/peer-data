Starting from the framework proposed by Dung in 1995, our purpose is to introduce 'graduality' in the selection of the best arguments, i.e., to be able to partition the set of the arguments in more than the two usual subsets of 'selected' and 'non-selected' arguments in order to represent different levels of selection. Our basic idea is that an argument is all the more acceptable if it can be preferred to its attackers. First, we discuss general principles underlying a 'gradual' valuation of arguments based on their interactions. Following these principles, we define several valuation models for an abstract argumentation system. Then, we introduce 'graduality' in the concept of acceptability of arguments. We propose new acceptability classes and a refinement of existing classes taking advantage of an available 'gradual' valuation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:39:39 GMT  (328kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0045v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["c cayrol", "m c lagasquie-schiex"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0045"}, "pdf": {"name": "1107.0045.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Graduality in Argumentation", "authors": ["Claudette Cayrol", "Marie-Christine Lagasquie-Schiex"], "emails": ["ccayrol@irit.fr", "lagasq@irit.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Argumentation is based on the exchange and evaluation of interacting arguments that support opinions and assertions. However, it can be used, among other things, in the legal field, for collective decision support systems or to support negotiations. The basic characteristic of an argumentation system is the interaction between arguments. However, when the argument takes the form of logical evidence, arguments can be made for an argument and arguments against this reasoning. In this case, the reasoning relationship is based on logical inconsistency. The argument process is usually divided into two steps: an assessment of the relative strength of the arguments followed by the selection of the most acceptable arguments.In the evaluation stage, it is common to distinguish two types of evaluations:"}, {"heading": "2.

Intuitively, an argument labelled with ? is both supported and weakened. Definition 4 (Jakobovits and Vermeir\u2019s labellings, 1999) Let <A,R> be an argumentation system. A complete labelling of <A,R> is a function Lab : A \u2192 {+, ?,\u2212} such that: 1. If Lab(A) \u2208 {?,\u2212} then \u2203B \u2208 R\u2212(A) such that Lab(B) \u2208 {+, ?} 2.

So: If A has no attacker Lab(A) = +. If Lab(A) =? then \u2203B \u2208 R\u2212(A) such that Lab(B) =?. If (\u2200B \u2208 R\u2212(A), Lab(B) = \u2212) then Lab(A) = +. If Lab(A) = + then \u2200B \u2208 R\u2212(A) \u222aR+(A), Lab(B) = \u2212. Every argumentation system can be completely labelled. The associated semantics is that S is an acceptable set of arguments iff there exists a complete labelling Lab of <A,R> such that S = {A|Lab(A) = +}.

The approach can be characterised as follows. An argument is structured as a pair \u3008support, conclusion\u3009, where support is a consistent set of formulae that enables to prove the formula conclusion. The attack relation considered here is strict and cycles are not allowed. The notion of a \u201ctree of arguments\u201d allows a concise and exhaustive representation of attackers and defenders of a given argument, root of the tree. A function, called a \u201ccategoriser\u201d, assigns a value to a tree of arguments. This value represents the relative strength of an argument (root of the tree) given all its attackers and defenders. Another function, called an \u201caccumulator\u201d, synthesises the values assigned to all the argument trees whose root is an argument for (resp. against) a given conclusion. The phase of categorisation therefore corresponds to an interaction-based valuation.

Our basic idea is that an argument is all the more acceptable if it can be preferred to its attackers. First, we discuss general principles underlying a \u201cgradual\u201d valuation of arguments based on their interactions. Following these principles, we define several valuation models for an abstract argumentation system. Then, we introduce \u201cgraduality\u201d in the concept of acceptability of arguments. We propose new acceptability classes and a refinement of existing classes taking advantage of an available \u201cgradual\u201d valuation.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.92b Copyright 2002 Radical Eye Software"}}}
