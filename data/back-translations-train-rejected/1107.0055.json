Phase transitions have been successfully used to analyze combinatorial optimization problems, characterize their typical-case features and locate the hardest problem instances. In this paper, we study phase transitions of the asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that has many real-world applications. Using random instances of up to 1,500 cities in which intercity distances are uniformly distributed, we empirically show that many properties of the problem, including the optimal tour cost and backbone size, experience sharp transitions as the precision of intercity distances increases across a critical value. Our experimental results on the costs of the ATSP tours and assignment problem agree with the theoretical result that the asymptotic cost of assignment problem is pi ^2 /6 the number of cities goes to infinity. In addition, we show that the average computational cost of the well-known branch-and-bound subtour elimination algorithm for the problem also exhibits a thrashing behavior, transitioning from easy to difficult as the distance precision increases. These results answer positively an open question regarding the existence of phase transitions in the ATSP, and provide guidance on how difficult ATSP problem instances should be generated.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:45:03 GMT  (147kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0055v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["w zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0055"}, "pdf": {"name": "1107.0055.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Phase Transitions and Backbones of the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem", "authors": ["Weixiong Zhang"], "emails": ["ZHANG@CSE.WUSTL.EDU"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction and Overview", "text": "In recent years, however, it has attracted a lot of attention (Gomes, Hogg, Walsh, & Zhang, 2001; Hogg, Huberman, & Williams, 1996; Martin, Monasson, & Zecchina, 2001), having been extensively studied in the so-called spin-glass theory, it appears only in large systems; a larger system usually exhibits sharper and more abrupt phase transitions, leading to a phenomenon of crossover of phase transitions."}, {"heading": "2. The Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem and Assignment Problem", "text": "Given n cities and the distance or cost between individual cities, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is to find a minimum cost tour that each city visits once and returns to the starting city (Gutin & Punnen, 2002; Lawler et al., 1985). If the distance from the city i to the city j is the same as the distance from j to i, the problem is the symmetrical TSP (STSP). If the distance from the city i to the city is not necessarily equal to the reverse distance, the problem is the asymmetrical TSP (ATSP). The ATSP is more difficult than the STSP, in terms of optimization and approximation (Johnson et al., 2002). The TSPs are important NP-hard problems (Garey & Johnson, 1979; Karp, 1972) and have many practical applications."}, {"heading": "3. The Control Parameter", "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "4. Phase Transitions", "text": "With the determined control parameter, the effective number of digits (n; b) for intercity distances, we are now able to investigate possible phase transitions in the ATSP and the associated assignment problems. To investigate these phase transitions, we have consistently generated and examined random problem cases with 100, 200, 300 to 1,500 cities and 1,500 cities. Although we have results from 100, 200, 300, 1,000, 1,000 city and 1,500 city problems to make the result numbers readable, we only use data from 100, 500, 1,000 and 1,500 city problems to report the results. For the problem distances considered, intercity distances are chosen independently and uniformly from f0; 1; 2; R 1g for a specific range R controlled by the number of digital b."}, {"heading": "4.1 Phase Transitions in the ATSP", "text": "We are particularly interested in possible phase transitions in ATSP costs, phase transitions in backbones, and phase transitions in the number of ATSP tours. Backbone results may shed some light on the intrinsic constraints between cities as the accuracy of distance measurement changes."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 THE ATSP TOUR COST", "text": "There is a phase transition in the ATSP tour costs, ATSP (D), below the control parameter, the effective number of digits for intercity distances. Figure 2 (a) shows the results for 100, 500, 1000, and 1,500 city ATSP instances, averaging over 10,000 instances for each data point. The reported tour costs are obtained by dividing the integer ATSP tour costs by n (R 1), where n is the number of cities and R is the range of intercity costs. Likewise, an intercity distance has practically been converted to a real value in [0; 1. As shown, the ATSP tour costs increase abruptly and dramatically when the effective number of digits increases, with phase transitions occurring; the transitions become sharper as the problem grows, and there are transitions between curves of different problem sizes. By finite size scaling, we further determine the critical value of the control parameter that occurs during the discussion of phase transitions (in section 1) (in phase 1)."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 BACKBONE AND NUMBER OF OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS", "text": "We now turn to the backbone of the ATSP, i.e. the percentage of directed arcs that occur in all optimal solutions; the backbone also exhibits phase transitions as the effective number of digits for distances increases; the result is contained in Figure 3 (a), where each data point averages over 10,000 problem cases; the reversed result is shown in Figure 3 (b), where the critical point = 1. Interestingly, the phase transition pattern of the backbone follows a similar trend to the percentage of different units in the distance matrix shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, the phase transition patterns of tour costs and backbones discussed in Section 4.3 are similar; the break of the backbone variables is related to the number of optimal solutions to a problem; we therefore examined the total number of optimal solutions in the ATSP, based on small ATSPs, as all optimal solutions to major problems are computationally too expensive."}, {"heading": "4.1.3 EXISTENCE OF HAMILTONIAN CIRCUIT WITH ZERO-COST EDGES", "text": "If the precision of the intercity distances is low, it is likely that the ATSP tour, a complete tour with minimal cost among all complete tours, costs zero, which means that there is a Hamiltonian circuit consisting of free sheets. It is a decision problem to determine whether a Hamiltonian circuit exists in a given ATSP. We examined this decision problem using the same set of 10,000 problem cases used in Figures 2 and 3. The result is in Figure 5. Note that the critical point of transition, 0 = 0: 865, is different from the critical point of = 1 for the phase transitions of spine and the ATSP tour costs as shown in Figures 2 and 3."}, {"heading": "4.2 Quality of the AP Lower-bound Function", "text": "The existence of Hamiltonian circuits with zero-cost arcs also indicates that with a very small number of digits for cross-country routes, for example less than 1.9 (or R 80) for n = 1; 500, both AP and ATSP costs are zero, which means that these two costs are also the same. It is useful to know how likely the AP costs are to be identical to the ATSP tour costs; the answers to this question represent the first step in determining the accuracy of AP costs of lower tied cost functions.Given a random distance matrix D, how likely is it that AP costs will be the same as ATSP tour costs, as the effective number of digits increases? We answer this question by examining the probability that an AP cost AP (D) is equal to the corresponding ATSP cost ATSP (D) as increases."}, {"heading": "4.3 How Many Phase Transitions?", "text": "Qualitatively speaking, all of these phase transitions follow the same transition pattern, meaning that they can all be captured by the same formula of the finite size of () log10 (n), with a critical point depending on the specificities of interest. Interestingly, the critical points for the phase transitions of ATSP tour costs and fractions of backbone variables are all at = 1. A close examination also shows that these two phase transitions follow almost the same phase transition as shown in Figure 8, where the recalculated curves for ATSP tour costs and the proportion of backbone variables originate from 1,500 city ATSPs, which have an average of over 10,000 problem minutes. Except for the close similarity of the phase transitions of ATSP tour costs and the proportion of backbone variables, the other phase transitions all have different critical points indicating that they are going through the same type of phases at different transitions."}, {"heading": "5. Asymptotic ATSP Tour Length and AP Precision", "text": "As a by-product of the phase transition results, we are now presenting numerical values of ATSP costs, AP costs and their accuracy asymptotically as the number of cities grows; we are trying to extend the theoretical results to AP costs, which approach asymptotically 2 = 6 (Aldous, 2001; Me \u0301 zard & Parsi, 1987); and the observations that the relative error of AP lower limits decreases as the problem size increases (Balas & Toth, 1985; Smith et al.). Not every real number can be represented in a digital computer, making it impossible to examine a theoretical result directly on the basis of a digital computer. For our purpose, the phase transition results suggest that the precision of intercity distances is high, all the quantity of intercity we have studied, including ATSP costs."}, {"heading": "6. Thrashing Behavior of Subtour Elimination", "text": "All of the phase transition results discussed in the previous section indicate that the ATSP becomes more limited and difficult the higher the distance precision gets. In this section, we will examine how a known algorithm for the ATSP, the elimination of partial sections (Balas & Toth, 1985; Bellmore & Malone, 1971; Smith et al., 1977), behaves. We will separate this problem from the phase transition phenomena previously investigated because in this section we will look at the behavior of a particular algorithm that may not necessarily be a feature of the underlying problem. However, this remains a question of self-interest as this algorithm is the oldest and still one of the best-known methods for the ATSP, and we hope that a better understanding of an efficient algorithm for the ATSP can shed light on the typical computational complexity of the problem."}, {"heading": "6.1 Branch-and-bound Subtour Elimination", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "6.2 Thrashing Behavior", "text": "The average complexity of the BnB Subtour Elimination algorithm is determined by two factors, the problem size, or the number of cities, and the number of digits used for the intercity distances. Figure 10 shows this average complexity, measured by the number of calls to the AP function, on a logarithmic scale. The result is about the same 10,000 problem cases as those used for the phase transitions in section 4."}, {"heading": "7. Related Work and Discussions", "text": "The first line of related work was on the expected complexity of tree search, which sheds light on the BnB subtour elimination algorithms described in Section 6.1 on how to solve the ATSP problem in a tree search, but the analysis was done on an abstract random tree model called an incremental tree T. T (Karp & Pearl, 1983; McDiarmid, 1990; McDiarmid & Provan, 1991; Zhang & Korf, 1995; Zhang, 1999) T's internal nodes have a variable number of children and edges in T. The cost of a node in T is the sum of marginal costs along the path from the root to that node. An optimal target node is a knot-knot-knot-knot-knot minimum cost at a fixed depth. The general goal is to find an optimal target node transition at the cost of the optimal target node."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions", "text": "Our main contributions to this research are twofold: First, we responded positively to the long-standing question of whether the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has phase transitions (Kirkpatrick & Toulouse, 1985) and disapproved of the belief that the problem does not have phase transitions (Kirkpatrick & Selman, 1994); we investigated this problem on a more general, optimistic version of the problem, the asymmetric TSP (ATSP); we empirically demonstrated that random problem transitions with distances from a uniform distribution; that many important properties, including ATSP tour costs and the break of backbone variables, have two characteristically different values; and the transitions between them are rather abrupt and dramatic, with the control parameters of phase transitions between phase transitions being."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was supported in part by NSF grants IIS-0196057 and ITR / EIA-0113618, and in part by the DARPA Collaboration Agreements F30602-00-2-0531 and F33615-01-C-1897.

The internal nodes of T has variable number of children and edges in T are assigned finite and nonnegative random values. The cost of a node in T is the sum of the edge costs along the path from the root to that node. An optimal goal node is a node of minimum cost at a fixed depth d. The overall goal is to find an optimal goal node. There exist phase transitions in the cost of the optimal goal node and the complexity to the problem of finding an optimal goal in T . The control parameter is the expected number of child nodes of a common parent node which have the same cost as the parent. The cost of an optimal goal node almost surely undergoes a phase transition from a linear function of depth d to a constant when the expected same-cost children of a node increases beyond one. Meanwhile, best-first search and depth-first branch-and-bound also exhibit a phase-transition behavior, i.e., their expected complexity changes dramatically from exponential to polynomial in d as the expected same-cost children of a node is reduced to below one. Note that following the result by Dechter & Pearl (1985), best-first search is optimal for searching this random tree among all algorithms using the same cost function, in terms of number of node expansions, up to tie breaking.", "startOffset": 89, "endOffset": 1293}, {"referenceID": 47, "context": "For examples, unary prime implicate refers to such a variable that must be set to a fixed value for an instance of Boolean satisfiability (Parkes, 1997); a frozen development describes a pair of nodes that must share the same colors in a graph coloring problem (Culberson & Gent, 2001).", "startOffset": 138, "endOffset": 152}, {"referenceID": 40, "context": "It is important to note that the exact locations of various phase transitions presented here remain to be mathematically determined, using methods probably from statistical physics (Martin et al., 2001; M\u00e9zard et al., 1987).", "startOffset": 181, "endOffset": 223}, {"referenceID": 9, "context": "Such TSPs include those proposed and studied by Cirasella et al., (2001) and Johnson et al.", "startOffset": 48, "endOffset": 73}, {"referenceID": 9, "context": "Such TSPs include those proposed and studied by Cirasella et al., (2001) and Johnson et al., (2002), for examples, problem instances with constraints of triangle inequalities, instances converted from particular applications such as disk drive optimization, jobshop scheduling, coin collecting optimization, etc.", "startOffset": 48, "endOffset": 100}, {"referenceID": 57, "context": "9-15, 2003 (Zhang, 2003).", "startOffset": 11, "endOffset": 24}], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "In recent years, there has been much interest in phase transitions of combinatorial problems. Phase transitions have been successfully used to analyze combinatorial optimization problems, characterize their typical-case features and locate the hardest problem instances. In this paper, we study phase transitions of the asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that has many real-world applications. Using random instances of up to 1,500 cities in which intercity distances are uniformly distributed, we empirically show that many properties of the problem, including the optimal tour cost and backbone size, experience sharp transitions as the precision of intercity distances increases across a critical value. Our experimental results on the costs of the ATSP tours and assignment problem agree with the theoretical result that the asymptotic cost of assignment problem is 2=6 as the number of cities goes to infinity. In addition, we show that the average computational cost of the well-known branch-and-bound subtour elimination algorithm for the problem also exhibits a thrashing behavior, transitioning from easy to difficult as the distance precision increases. These results answer positively an open question regarding the existence of phase transitions in the ATSP, and provide guidance on how difficult ATSP problem instances should be generated.", "creator": "dvipsk 5.86 p1.5d Copyright 1996-2001 ASCII Corp.(www-ptex@ascii.co.jp)"}}}
