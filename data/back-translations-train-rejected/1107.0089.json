GROUP MULTIPLE CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Multiple Criteria Decision Making", "text": "Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) was long ago derived from the Pareto Optimization Concept. After 50 years, Koopmans [2] introduced the Efficient Point in Decision Making. At the same time, Kuhn and Tucker [3] introduced the concept of vector optimization. Charnes and Cooper [4] then investigated the model and application of linear programming in decision science. In 1972, the International Conference on MCDM held by Cochrane and Zeleny [5] noted that normative MCDM theory had been developed as a mainstream of decision science. More recently, many applicable MCDM approaches have been used to design decision support systems to solve specific domain problems. MCDM with specific information and under certain conditions is referred to as classical MCDM. Major methods of classical MCDM can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) Multiple Criteria Utility Theory, (2) Outranking, (3) Pregregation."}, {"heading": "1) Multiple Criteria Utility Theory", "text": "Fishburn [6] and Huber [7] provided a very specific literature review on Multiple Criteria Utility Theory.

ELECTRE was first proposed by Roy [9] in the 1960s, and the PROMETHEE method was originally established by Brans [10]. Xu [11] extended the PROMETHEE method to include a Superiority and Inferiority Ranking (SIR) method, which integrated into the Outranking approach. 3) Preference Disaggregation.2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops978-0-7695-4257-7 / 10 $26.00 \u00a9 2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109 / ICDMW.2010.80851Jacquet-Lagreze et al.

General Problem Model of Group MCDM", "text": "In order to facilitate the establishment and development of an MCDM support system, we perform an analysis of the MCDM group to build a general model.Figure 1 shows our proposed general problem model for the MCDM group. It generally contains three decision sets: alternative decision sets (iY), decision sets (ke) and criterion sets (jG). It comprises two types of weights: decision weights (kw) and criterion weights (j\u03c9). Decision makers provide their individual decision matrix () kijd and the weights (j\u043e) of each criterion. In this figure, individual decision information is presented with a decision level (kP), including black dots (() k ijd) and gray dots (() kj\u043e).Therefore, the group aggregation process can be presented as a level projection from the individual decision level kP to the group-integrated decision level () K."}, {"heading": "III. UNCERTAINTY MULTIPLE CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS", "text": "Although the classical MCDM already has a fairly complete theory, it still cannot solve most of the MCDM problems in the real world. A major reason for this is that the decision information is not usually provided completely, clearly or accurately in reality. In most cases, people have to make decisions in the uncertainty environment. Therefore, many researchers pay more attention to this branch of research of uncertainty MCDM. The uncertainty MCDM is not classical and can be treated as an extension of the classical MCDM. We can generally classify the uncertainty problems into three categories: (1) Stochastic type (2) Fuzzy type (3) Rough type. A comparison of these uncertainty types is shown in Table I. Accordingly, Uncertainty MCDM also has three research directions: Stochastic MCDM, Fuzzy MCDM and Rough MCDM. Recently, many approaches have been developed to solve these problems (e.g. [15])."}, {"heading": "1) Stochastic MCDM", "text": "Baye's theory is proposed for stochastic processes that can enhance objectivity and truthfulness in stochastic decision-making. Bernoulli [16] then introduced the concept of usefulness and the expected benefit model. Von Neumann and Morgenstern [17] completed the theory of expected benefit value, proposed the axiomatics of the expected benefit model, and mathematically proved the results of the maximized benefit model for decision-makers. Wald [18] established the basis of the statistical decision problem and applied it to the selection of stochastic decision schemes. Blackwell and Girshich [19] integrated subjective probability with benefit theory into a clear process for solving decision-making problems. Savage [20] expanded the expected benefit model and Howard [21] introduced the approach of systematic analysis into decision theory and developed it from theoretical and application aspects."}, {"heading": "2) Fuzzy MCDM", "text": "In 1965, Zadeh [22] proposed the fuzzy sets, which took over the member functions to represent the level of membership of elements to sets. Atanassov and Gargov [23] extended Zadeh's fuzzy sets concept to Intuitionist Fuzzy Sets (IFSs), which are described by a membership and non-membership level whose values are intervals and not real numbers. On the basis of this pioneering work, the theories of the IFSs and IVIFS received much attention from researchers. Until recently, some basic theories such as calculation operators and fuzzy measures for various applications were established [25] [26]. Chai and Liu's earlier work [15] proposes a novel fuzzy MCDM approach based on the intuitionist fuzzy sets problem (FSIFS problem) and rewriting the basis for decision-making in the MCDM group."}, {"heading": "3) Rough MCDM", "text": "Pawlak [27] [28] systematically introduced the Rough Sets Theory. Slowinski [29] completed the achievements of Rough Sets in theory and application to date. Since 1992, the annual International Conference on Rough Sets has played a very important role in promoting the development of Rough Sets in theory extension and various applications. More recently, Greco [30] proposed a dominance-based Rough Sets Theory, which generates decision rules with greater applicability. Meanwhile, Rough Sets Theory is applied in decision analysis, process control, knowledge gathering, machine learning, pattern recognition, etc. In the UGDSS, the rough MCDM approaches are mainly implemented through different subsystems with specific function modules, key intelligences and other applicable applets."}, {"heading": "IV. UGDSS FRAMEWORK", "text": "In this section, we propose the framework of the UGDSS. Here, the term \"knowledge\" is a comprehensive concept that encompasses data, models, human knowledge and other forms of information, as long as it can be used in the decision-making of uncertainty groups."}, {"heading": "A. Uncertainty Group Decision Process and System", "text": "StructureIn uncertainty group decision-making process, we mainly look at three factors that increase the complexity of decision-making in reality: (1) Uncertain decision-making environment, (2) Unstructured decision-making problem, (3) Complex decision-making group, and another issue: Unification of decision-making conflicts. This process provides a mechanism to address the three types of complexities and group conflicts that have the basic logical sequence from the point of view of decision-makers: Decision Environment Analysis Decision Problem Analysis Decision Scheme Analysis Conflict Analysis Group Coordination and Decision AnalysisFrom the point of view of decision-makers, these stages have the basic logical sequence. Suppose there is an MCDM problem with complex internal structure involving multiple participants. First, we need to analyze the existing internal and external environments and find out what the decision-making conditions are, decision-making conditions, whether the decision-making information is complete, secure and quantifiable, what type of uncertainty it is."}, {"heading": "1) Decision Environment Analysis", "text": "Decision-making environments are important factors that significantly influence other stages of decision-making, and they can include various aspects such as decision objectives, decision principles, possible constraints, available resources, etc. More importantly, people need to analyze whether there is uncertainty information. In this paper, we define that uncertainty decision information consists of the following situations: Information deficit Information incompleteness Dynamic information Uncertainty information Inaccuracy information Multiple uncertaintyAlthough several MCDM approaches have been developed, it is not enough to solve complex uncertainty problems in reality. Therefore, one of our future work aims to establish an Uncertainty Environment Analysis Sub-System (UEAS) to handle uncertainty information and subsequently enhance their ability to solve other uncertainty decision-making problems."}, {"heading": "2) Decision Problem Analysis", "text": "We can generally divide decision-making problems into three categories: (1) structure, (2) semi-structure, (3) non-structure. For the first group, problems are well organized and serve for ontological analysis and decomposition. For the second group, problems are usually presented in the form of texts or interview dialogues. Therefore, these problems must be ontologically presented and described at this stage. Some useful analysis technologies can be adopted, including ontological analysis in onto-broker [31], natural language processes, etc."}, {"heading": "3) Decision Group Analysis", "text": "Many real-world decision-making problems (such as the major strategic decision of government or industry, the organizational decision of a large corporation, etc.) affect multiple participants with complex human relationships or organizational structures. Good group analysis can lead to very efficient decision-making processes and impartial decision-making outcomes. Group support system (GSS) is used for group analysis, including decomposition, reorganization, character analysis, integration, etc. Some methods, such as the Double Selection Model [32], are a practicable approach to implementing group analysis in GSS."}, {"heading": "4) Decision Scheme Analysis", "text": "Decision-making programs are the solutions to specific decision-making problems. These systems can be derived from previous decision-making models reorganized in the Scheme Base; new problem-solving models developed by domain experts; solutions developed in group discussions and negotiations; all kinds of information on the Web or elsewhere, etc. This phase is supported by the Domain Expert System and the corresponding Decision Resource MIS."}, {"heading": "5) Decision Conflict Analysis", "text": "Conflicts can be derived at any stage of the decision-making process, so the subsystem can call the Negotiation Support System (NSS) programs for conflict analysis at any stage. Chai and Liu's previous work [32] provided a group argumentation model for solving complex decision conflicts, which can be used to design and develop a negotiation support system."}, {"heading": "6) Group Coordination and Decision Analysis", "text": "This phase assumes responsibility for integrating group opinion. Many methods can be used to solve this problem, such as vector space clustering, entropy weight clustering, Intuitionist Fuzzy Weight Average (IFWA) method [26], Weighted Group Projection method [15], etc. In addition, the Individual Decision Support System is a tool for decision makers to develop their own opinion, which corresponds with Domain Expert Systems, in order to build high-quality individual decision schemes."}, {"heading": "B. UGDSS Architecture", "text": "Unlike existing DSS designs, which focus mainly on specific problem areas, the UGDSS architecture provides an integrated system platform for complete decision analysis and comprehensive applications. The system architecture is shown in Fig. 2, which consists of three layers: 1. The application layer 2. The intelligent agent layer 3. The technology layer."}, {"heading": "1) Application Layer", "text": "a) Basic Function Modules User Interface Management System (UIMS) UIMS, as a subsystem of UGDSS, consists of several programs and functional interface components in intelligent agent layers such as natural language processes, insecurity analysis, visual reorganization functions, etc. Multimedia support Multimedia technologies are widely used in UGDSS. Application level interfaces are connected to many intelligent agents, including visual detection, audio detection, etc. Wireless supportMany mobile application technologies such as PDA, mobile phone, wireless devices are used to support group decision-making. To ensure the security of the system and data transmission, security support is indispensable when building the system. Some important technologies such as internal control mechanisms, firewall, ID authentication, encryption techniques, digital signature, etc.b) Application Domain Security Modules (Support Modules) UGDSS (Support Modules) is required to resolve the CRM Supply problem in different domains."}, {"heading": "2) Intelligent Agent Layer", "text": "Sensory SystemSensory systems such as vision systems, tactile systems and signal processing systems provide a tool for interpreting and analysing the knowledge gathered and for responding to and adapting to changes in different environmental conditions. Genetic algorithms (GA) are computer agents learned by producing offspring that are better and better than measured by a fitness function. Algorithms of this type can be used in decision-making processes such as web search, financial forecasting, vehicle routing, etc. Neural Network (NN) Computer Agent A Neural Network is a set of mathematical models that simulate the functioning of a human brain. A typical intelligent agent based on NN technology can be used in inventory forecasting for decision making. Uncertainty Analysis Agent This agent is used to analyze the environment and conditions of decision problems. Case-based Reasoning (CBR) Agent Lase Based Reasoning (Solving of Adaptation Agent) is a means of solving old problems or problems through adaptation ABR."}, {"heading": "3) Technology Layer", "text": "This layer provides the necessary system support for two additional layers and DRMIS. It mainly includes (1) support for programming languages (VS.Net, C #, Java, etc.) (2) support for network protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, ATP, etc.) (3) support for markup languages (HTML, XML, WML, etc.) In addition, the technology layer provides various technology support for building the four bases, Inference Engine, etc."}, {"heading": "C. Knowledge-related System Designs", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "1) Knowledge-based Decision Resource MIS framework", "text": "It mainly consists of four types of subsystems: KBMS, DBMS, MBMS, KW. In this system, different types of information, knowledge, models and data interact with each other and provide support for the entire UGDSS.Data Base Management System (DBMS) Generally, DSS requires a standalone database. Specifically, this DSS is needed to solve the complex uncertainty group decision problems. Therefore, DBMS is a necessary component in UGDSS, which consists of a DSS database and a data mining system. A database is created, accessed and updated by a DBMS. And Data Mining System is used to discover knowledge from data resources. Many technologies are applicable to mining data, such as statistical approaches (Bayes theorem, cluster analysis, etc.)."}, {"heading": "2) Knowledge Management Process in KBMS", "text": "In this process, there are five basic classes of knowledge manipulation activities, including: acquisition, selection, generation, assimilation, and emission [33]. These activities are the basis for problem-solving, as well as participation in each phase of the decision-making process. In this essay, we offer a knowledge management process in KBMS (see Figure 4). Knowledge resources: Some possible knowledge sources include domain experts, books, documents, computer files, research reports, databases, sensors, and all information available on the Internet. Knowledge acquisition: This activity is the accumulation, transfer, and transformation of documented knowledge resources or expert problem-solving schemes. Knowledge presentation: The knowledge acquired is organized into this activity, which involves the preparation of a knowledge map and the coding of knowledge in the knowledge base. Knowledge selection: In knowledge refinement and explanation system, knowledge is validated and its quality is verified until acceptable."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper proposes the framework of the Uncertainty Group Decision Support System (UGDSS) and other two types of knowledge-based system components: Decision Resource MIS and Knowledge Base Management System (KBMS). Firstly, we provide a general problem model of the Group MCDM. Secondly, we perform an analysis of the Uncertainty Group MCDM problem and present the basics of system design to handle uncertainty decisions. Finally, we propose a series of detailed drafts of system architectures and structures to support a complete uncertainty group decision process, including (1) environmental analysis, (2) problem analysis, (3) group analysis, (4) scheme analysis, (5) group coordination analysis and (6) decision conflict analysis. In the future, we will seek two directions. In the systems aspect, we will need to develop several intelligent agents, middleware or subsystems that will be incorporated into UGSS decision-based theories such as Grey."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors would like to acknowledge the partial support of the GRF 5237 / 08E of the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong."}], "references": [{"title": "Analysis of Production as an Effect Combination of Activities", "author": ["T.
