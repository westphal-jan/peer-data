In addition, two aspects of the application of global constraints are considered: efficiency and the behavior of the 1NN classifier for different values of constraints. In both constraints, experiments with the unrestricted measurement and a measurement with the following constraints are performed: 75%, 50%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 1% and 0% of the size of the time series. This distribution was chosen because actions with larger constraints are expected to behave similar to the unrestricted measurement, while smaller constraints exhibit more interesting behavior [10, 18]. A comprehensive set of experiments was conducted on 38 sets of data from [12], covering the majority of all publicly available data sets in the world designated as time series sets. The length of time series varies from 24 to 1882 depending on the data set."}, {"heading": "4.1.

However, the distance matrix for a dataset is the matrix in which element (i, j) contains the distance between i-th and j-th time series from the dataset. However, the calculation of the distance matrix is a time-consuming operation, which makes it suitable for measuring the efficiency of global constraints.In Table 1, the calculation times of the DTW in milliseconds are given for all datasets and for different values of the constraints.Table 2 contains the same data for the LCS measurement. All experiments are carried out on AMD Phenom II X4 945 with 3GB RAM. It is obvious that the introduction of global constraints in both measurements considerably accelerates the process of the distance matrix calculation, which is the direct consequence of a faster similarity measurement."}, {"heading": "4.2.

Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "Although the Euclidean metric for time series data is simple and very intuitive, it has a known weakness in sensitivity to distortions in the timeline. To overcome this weakness, many elastic metrics (DTW, LCS, ERP, EDR, etc.) are proposed, all based on dynamic programming and with square computational complexity. Global constraints are introduced into dynamic programming algorithms to narrow the search path in the matrix and reduce the computation time. In this paper, we examined the impact of global constraints on two most representative elastic metrics for time series: DTW and LCS. Through an extensive series of experiments, we demonstrated that the use of global constraints can significantly shorten the computation time of these metrics, which is their main weakness. In addition, we showed that the limited metrics are qualitatively different from their unlimited timetables."}], "references": [{"title": "Fast Subsequence Matching in TimeSeries Databases", "author": ["C.
