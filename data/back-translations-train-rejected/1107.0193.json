Generally, it is as if it were an expression that reflects these qualities, others that do not show them at all, and others that do not show them in some way. \"In particular, a predicate that is vague does not exist. It is impossible to determine whether it is an object that has these qualities or not.\" Many predicates in natural languages are vague, and they do not comply with the law by which they act. \""}, {"heading": "3 Ambiguity and logical reversibility: a rigorous", "text": "In this section, we first introduce the concept of logical (ir) reversibility of a given calculation, then formally explain how code generated by logically irreversible calculations is necessarily ambiguous, and we quantify the degree of ambiguity as the minimum amount of information needed to correctly reconstruct a given message."}, {"heading": "3.1 Logical irreversibility", "text": "The concept of calculation is theoretically studied as an abstract process of data manipulation and only its logical properties are taken into account; but if we want to investigate how an abstract calculation is realized by a physical system, such as an electronic machinery, an abacus or a biological system as the brain, it becomes important to take into account the connections between the logical properties of (abstract) calculations and the physical - or precise, thermodynamic properties of the system that perform these calculations. Fundamental investigation of physical constraints must satisfy if they are to be carried out by a physical system that is continued in several other works."}, {"heading": "3.2 Logical (ir)reversibility in terms of Turing machines", "text": "In this section, we rigorously define simple operations that take place after an initial moment. To this end, we must present an abstract computing unit, i.e., a Turing machine is an ideal calculation algorithm defined by [34]. Turing machines seem to represent a stable and maximum class of computing devices in terms of the calculations that they can perform. Although Turing machines are fairly primitive and simple, they are able to express any algorithm and simulate any programming language, and in fact any operation that a modern computer can perform can be simulated by a Turing machine. In fact, it is generally accepted that any kind of formalization of the intuitive idea of what is computable corresponds to a Turing machine, a conjecture commonly known as church-turing theory. We informally describe the action of a Turing machine on a band divided into squares as a series of simple operations that take place after an initial moment."}, {"heading": "3.3 Logical reversibility and ambiguous codes", "text": "Before moving on to the concepts of logical (ir) reversibility in a communication system formed by two actors (an encoder and a decoder) and the channel, some clarifications are needed. Firstly, we note that logical (ir) reversibility refers to the potential existence of a reconstruction or decoding algorithm, which does not mean that such an algorithm is at work in a real scenario; in other words, logical (ir) reversibility is a feature of the calculations alone. Secondly, during the process of transmitting a signal through a channel, the presence of noise in the channel through which the output is received may be responsible for the emergence of logical irreversibility. This implies that although the encoder agent could in principle calculate a reversible regime, the noise of the channel, the noise of the cascade system makes the encoder agent + the channel analogous to a single computing device that operates in an irreversible system."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Noise: quantifying the degree of ambiguity", "text": "The minimum amount of additional information required to correctly reconstruct the input from the knowledge of the output is identified as a quantitative estimator of ambiguity. The more additional information we require, the more ambiguous the code is. This minimum amount of spilled information is referred to in standard information theory as noise, and its formulation with respect to the problem we are dealing with is the goal of the following two subdomains. To investigate the logical irreversibility in information theory terms, we choose a simple version of the transition function. This choice leaves aside the role of states, but is justified for clarity reasons and because the qualitative nature of the results does not change: the only changes are the sizes of the input and output sets. Let us be a matrix by using the basic principle ij = (mi) = sj 0 otherwise.Since the machine is deterministic, there is no way to have two outputs for one."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Ambiguity and logical irreversibility", "text": "The interpretation we have provided for the noise equation allows us to rigorously combine ambiguity and logical (ir) reversibility. First, we emphasize a crucial fact: by the properties of Shannon's entropy, H (XB | XS) \u2265 0, which explicitly states that information can either be destroyed or managed but never be generated in the course of a given calculation - as shown in [4]. If there is no uncertainty in defining the input signals by the only knowledge of the results, then H (XB | XS) = 0, i.e., there is certainty that the calculations performed by the coding machine will be reversed. Therefore, the calculations performed by T to define the code are logically reversible and not ambiguous, and the code is not ambiguous. ifH (XB | XS) > 0, 8By reversing the paper, we need additional information (at least H | XB to reverse the process correctly)."}, {"heading": "4 The emergence of ambiguity in natural com-", "text": "The tension we spoke of at the end of the last section was postulated by the linguist G. K. Zipf [36] as the origin of the widespread scaling behavior of the word bearing his name. Such a communicative tension was understood as an equilibrium between two opposing forces: \"the economic power of the speaker\" and \"the economy of the auditor.\""}, {"heading": "4.1 Zipf\u2019s hypothesis", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive themselves are able to survive themselves, and they are able to survive themselves, \"he said in an interview with The New York Times.\" I believe that we will be able to survive ourselves, \"he said in an interview with The New York Times, adding,\" I don't think we will be able to do what we are doing to change the world. \""}, {"heading": "4.2 Symmetry in coding/decoding complexities", "text": "How can we adapt the previous intuitions to the strict framework proposed in Section 3? The economy of the auditor leads to a one-to-one mapping between two different types of information. (In this case, the economic power of the speaker is directed in exactly the opposite direction.) In these latter terms, the best option is an all-to-one mapping, i.e., an encoding process in which any amount of information is encoded by a single signal. Such encoding is logically irreversible and therefore completely ambiguous, because it is clear that the knowledge of the output tells us nothing about the input, so to characterize this conflict, let us formalize the above intuitive statement correctly: The power of the auditor pushes the code forward in a way that is possible to reconstruct by interpreting the output."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "In this article, we have argued that ambiguity appears in the externalization branch of language. We have substantiated this assertion by reviewing certain familiar types of ambiguity: lexical ambiguity, syntactical ambiguity, and quantifying ambiguity. We have constructed a communicative argument based on basic concepts of computation theory and information theory to understand the emergence of ambiguity in the externalization branch, or in other words, why the generative method reduces the resolution of phonetic forms related to the connection of the A-P system and the C-I system."}, {"heading": "A Appendix: Ambiguity and physical irreversibil-", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of us are able to deal with the question of how far they are able to trump themselves.
