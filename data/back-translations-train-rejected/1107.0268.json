SATzilla, the algorithm portfolio that has dominated recent SAT competitions, is the most important and successful algorithm portfolio for SAT, with admirable performance (Xu et al., 2008; Xu, Hutter, Hoos & LeytonBrown, 2009)."}, {"heading": "3 Nearest Neighbor-Based Algorithm Portfolio", "text": "Existing SAT portfolio systems build their models (e.g. runtime prediction models, grouping of instances, etc.) in advance, regardless of the characteristics of the input instance. We expect that a finer selection of algorithms could be achieved when building and using a local, input-specific model. However, a simple model of this kind can be achieved by the next adjacent method (Duda, Hart, & Stork, 2001), of only a few instances that are similar to the instance that is solved. In the rest of this section, we describe our algorithm portfolio for SAT. It is assumed that a training set of instances is solved by all solvers from the portfolio, and that the solution times are available (within a given cutoff time). Based on these solution times, a penalty can be calculated for each instance (the longer resolution time, the greater penalty). Each instance is represented by a vector of features."}, {"heading": "4 Implementation and Experimental Evaluation", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to put itself at the top of the list in the way that it is able to put itself at the top."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "The system presented, ArgoSmArT kNN, benefits from the SATzilla system in several ways: it uses a subset of SATzilla functions to represent instances, a selection of SAT solvers, SATzilla solution data for the training corpus, and fragments of the SATzilla implementation. However, the proposed system differs significantly from SATzilla. Instead of predicting runtimes, our system chooses a solver based on knowledge of instances from the local neighborhood of the input instance, using the k-next-neighbor method. The proposed system is implemented and publicly available as open source. Experimental evaluation shows that the particular decisions made in the design of our system are even better than the decisions made in the similar current system (malital-SAT method), which is the most successful (SATT algorithm version), not necessarily, but is the most successful."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was partially supported by the grant of the Serbian Ministry of Science 174021 and the SNSF grant SCOPES IZ73Z0 127979 / 1.
