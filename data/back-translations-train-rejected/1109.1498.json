Introduction", "text": "In this paper, we focus on content-based image retrieval, which expresses the characteristics of the image itself, i.e., its image characteristics. Most research in this area so far has focused on developing appropriate techniques for extracting relevant terms using image analysis algorithms. Current systems lead to effective, so-called low-level properties, such as color distribution or texture. Systems such as IBM QBIC1 are easily retrieved, including stamps that contain the image of a brown horse in a green field when prompted to retrieve images with brown central area."}, {"heading": "1.1 Contributions of the Paper", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive themselves are able to survive themselves by surviving themselves by surviving themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are not able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are not able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are not able to survive themselves, most of them are not able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are not able to survive themselves."}, {"heading": "1.2 Outline of the Paper", "text": "In Section 3, we will describe our formal language, first its syntax, then its semantics, and begin by demonstrating some basic properties.

In the last section, we will draw conclusions and suggest guidelines for future work."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) has recently become a widely studied area of research. Several systems and approaches have been proposed; here we briefly report on some significant examples and categorize them in three main directions."}, {"heading": "2.1 Feature-based Approaches", "text": "Most of the research on CBIR focuses on low-level features such as color, texture, and shape that cannot be extracted with image processing algorithms and are used to characterize an image in a feature space for subsequent indexing and similarity retrieval, thus replacing the problem of retrieving images with homogeneous content with the problem of retrieving images that are visually close to a target (Hirata & Kato, 1992; Niblak et al., 1993; Picard & Kabir, 1993; Jacobs, Finkelstein, & Salesin, 1995; Flickner et al., 1995; Bach, Fuller, Gupta, Hampapur, Horowitz, Humphrey, Jain, & Shu, 1996; Celentano & Di Sciascio, 1998; Cox, Miller, & Papathomas, 2000; Gevers & Smeulders, 2000)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Approaches Based on Spatial Constraints", "text": "This approach to the problem of image recovery focuses on finding the similarity of images in relation to spatial relations between objects within them. Normally, the focus is only on relative positions of objects that are considered as \"symbolic images\" or symbols, identified with a single point in 2D space. Information about the content and visual appearance of images are usually neglected.Chang, Shi, and Yan (1983) present the modeling of this type of images in relation to 2D strings, each of the strings that take into account the position of icons along one of the two planar dimensions. In this approach, retrieval of images retrieval of images retrieval of matching to simpler strings. Gudivada and Raghavan (1995) consider the objects in a symbolic image that is associated with texts in a weighted diagram. Edges - i.e. lines that represent the centrifugal of an object, are the relationships between the objects and spatial objects."}, {"heading": "2.3 Logic-based and Structured Approaches", "text": "The idea is to associate parts of an object (and of a scene in general) with regions where an image can be fragmented into different parts. The hierarchical organization of knowledge that can be used in the recognition of an object was first proposed by Marr (1982). Reiter and Mackworth (1989) proposed a formalism of reason to characterize the characters as outlined diagrams. In their approach, the possible relative positions of the lines are fixed and highly qualitative (touch, intersect).Structured descriptions of three-dimensional images are already available in languages such as VRML (Hartman & Wernecke, 1996) or hierarchical object modeling. However, the semantics of such languages are operative, and no effort is made to automatically classify objects in relation to the structure of their manifestations. Meghini, Sebastiani, Sebastiani, and 2001, a hierarchical object is modeled."}, {"heading": "3. Syntax and Semantics", "text": "In this section, we present the formalism that deals with the definition of composite form descriptions, their semantics, and some of the characteristics that distinguish our approach from previous ones. We note that our formalism deals with image characteristics such as shape, color, texture, but is independent of the way in which features are extracted from actual images. For the interested reader, the algorithms that we have used to calculate image characteristics in the implementation of formalism are presented in the appendix."}, {"heading": "3.1 Syntax", "text": "We also take into account the other characteristics that typically determine the visual appearance of an image, namely color and texture.Basic shapes are referred to by the letter B and have an edge contour e (B) that characterizes them. We assume that e (B) is described as a single, closed 2D curve in a room whose origin is at the center of B. Examples of basic shapes can be circle, rectangle, with the contours e (circle).We assume that e (rectangle) =, but also any complete, rough contour of the shape of a ship - is a basic form. To make our language compositional, we consider only the external contour of a region. For example, if one region is contained in another, as in the contour outer region, the contour contour of the outer contour is explicit."}, {"heading": "3.2 Semantics", "text": "We are looking at an advanced semantic in which syntactic expressions are interpreted as subsets of a particular structure. < p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p (p) p (p) p (p) p (p) p (p) p (p) p (p) p (p) p (p) p (p) p (p) p (p) p (p) p (p) p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\")."}, {"heading": "4. Reasoning and Retrieval", "text": "We see several reasons why services that can be performed in a logic for image retrieval: 1. Form Recognition: Faced with an image I and a form description D, decide whether D is recognized in I.2. Image Retrieval: Faced with a database of images and a form description D, retrieve all images in which D can be recognized. 3. Image Classification: Faced with an image I and a collection of descriptions D1,..., Dn, find the descriptions in I. In practice, I will classify by finding the most specific descriptions (with respect to subsumption) satisfied that the classification is a type of \"preprocessing\" recognition. 4. Description of subsumption (and classification): Faced with a (new) description D and a collection of descriptions D1,., Dn, decide whether D subsummed (or subsummed by) each Di, for i = 1."}, {"heading": "4.1 Exact Reasoning on Images and Descriptions", "text": "We start with a reformulation of (2), more suitable for computational purposes.

Using the semantics for approximate detection (3), the extended formula for the evaluation of KI (I) is now interpreted as follows: maximum detection of the maximum dimensions of KI (I)... maximum detection of the maximum dimensions of KI (I))... maximum detection of the maximum dimensions of KI (I)... maximum detection of KI (I)... maximum detection of the maximum dimensions of KI (E (R1), R1 (E (Bn))))))))))),., sim (E (RM), RO, RO, RO, RO, RO, RO, RO (RO), RO, (RO, RO, RO, RO, RO, RO (RO), RO, RO, RO (RO), RO, RO, RO (RO, RO, RO), RO, RO (RO, RO, RO), RO, RO (RO, RO, RO, RO)."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Spatial Similarity", "text": "For a given component - say, component 1 - we calculate all angles under which the other components of 1 are considered.

There are n (n \u2212 1) / 2 such angles. Then we calculate the corresponding angles for the region rj (1), namely angle \u03b2 (i) j (1) j (h) j (h) with the vertex in the center of rj (1), formed by the lines forming this center with the regions rj (i) and rj (h). An illustration of the angles is shown in Figure 6.Then we let the difference between the individual components be spatial (e (rj (1)), the absolute difference between the regions rj (B1)."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Rotation Similarity", "text": "For each basic shape, one can imagine a unit vector with origin in its center and oriented horizontally on the right (as seen on the palette). If the shape is used as a component - say, component 1 - then this vector will also be rotated horizontally (as seen on the palette). Let's call 6h such a rotated vector (as seen on the palette). For i = 2,.., n, let's leave the anti-clockwise oriented angle with the vertex in component 1, and formed by 6h, and the line that represents the center of component 1 with the center of component i.For the region rj (1), the analog 6u of 6h can be constructed by determining the rotation phase for which the cross correlation reaches a maximum value (see appendix).

In the image, Mj (1) should be the size of the region rj (i) and Dj (1) j (i) should be the distance between the centers of the regions j (1) and j (i).

We will also describe the smoothing function \u03a6 = i = complex function and the way we calculate similarity for the image attributes introduced in Section 4.2.A.1. In order to deal with objects in an image, better segmentation is required to obtain a division of the image. Multiple segmentation algorithms have been suggested in the literature. Our approach does not depend on the respective segmentation algorithm we have chosen. It is already obvious that the better segmentation, the better our system will work. In our system, we use a simple algorithm, edge recognition and regional growing.Illustration of this technique goes beyond the scope of this paper; we will limit ourselves here to describing image attributes that require successful segmentation."}], "references": [{"title": "Computing spatial similarity by games", "author": ["M.
