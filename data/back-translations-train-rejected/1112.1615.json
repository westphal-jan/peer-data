The network model", "text": "We begin this section by modeling the inter-domain network, we model the network by an undirected graph G (V, E), in which the sentences V and E each denote the ASS5 and inter-domain links. We consider that the vertices of the graph are weighted by their capacity given by the functional upper limit: V \u2192 N *, and their delay by d: V \u2192 N *. These functions each represent the maximum amount of traffic that is required by a node with a guaranteed QoS and the time required to transmit traffic from a node to one of its neighbors. We can divide the capacity used by each node v into three parts (see Figure 1): 5 Autonomous system assumed in the following document that each domain in the network has only one AS. Thus, one domain and one operator all correspond to a node that we assign to each node, each one node."}, {"heading": "2.2. Contract Definition", "text": "Each SLA between two adjacent ASs corresponds to the bilateral contract for the purchase of the route to the specified destination, this route is purchased by the Customer from its Provider. This contract defines the obligation of each AS to another, between the two ASs (the Provider who sells, and the Customer who purchases a route to the specified destination). Thus, each contract relating to each route purchased by the Customer from its Provider has the following characteristics: the capacity, the delay, the cost, the availability, the start time and the Provider of that route. We refer to the contract between a Customer v and its Provider for a route with u as- cap _ IN (v): the capacity of traffic sent from other nodes with v as the destination. - cap _ OUT (v): the capacity used by nodes with v as the destination. - cap _ OUT (v): the capacity used by nodes with v as the destination."}, {"heading": "2.3.

Offering capacity on the route to destination u is always initiated by the destination node u (service provider), and that node must have at least one service. The provider node can trigger this event if it wants to sell capacity on its route.

This event is initiated by the customer node in response to the positive selection query sent by the provider in the selection step. This response can be positive or negative (see Figure 11). Note that any node that wants to change the provider for the route to destination u only releases its route when it receives a sales confirmation from its new provider. Figure 11. The selection occurs when the customer is selected in the same phase S by another provider for whom it requests route r2 with the same destination u (i.e. it has already selected route r1 to destination u purchase by p1, and the availability of this route is not yet initiated.If the customer has not yet started the chosen route v, then we suggest the 3 solutions of interest v = 1."}, {"heading": "4.

We can have two cases for the route with u as the destination: 1. If the provider node is the destination node, the available capacity that this node offers to its neighbors corresponds to its free capacity (free _ capv, v S = possv, v S).2. If the provider node v is different from the destination node u, the available capacity that this provider node v offers to its neighbors is the difference between the capacity purchased on this route and the capacity that it wants to keep for its own customers (free _ capv, u S = possv, u S \u2212 local _ capv, u S)."}, {"heading": "4.2. The fixation price policy for an offer of route", "text": "This policy allows to define the price of each route on each level S. Any vendor v who wants to sell the capacity on his route to the destination u must apply this policy to fix the price of this route. The price v must fix on this route is equal to the sum of the price he has bought on this route and his margin. So the idea in this policy is to fix the margin. Two cases may occur in this policy, before we present these cases, we will show how to determine the benefit of v after the purchase and sale of capacities on the route using v as margin. Benef v, u S = [(# blokw, u Sw, u Cust v, u S) * (possw, uS) * (cost, uS)] + [(# blokv, u S) * (local _ capv, u S) * (utility (v) de Snoxes (# blokv, u S) * (cost, u S).The case in which this is sold."}, {"heading": "4.3. The capacity demand policy", "text": "This policy allows each customer at each stage S to define the capacity interval on each route he wishes to purchase. We have already seen that during the communication phase at each stage S between two nodes (the provider p and the customer v) for the purchase of the route with destination u, the customer requests the capacity for his route at an interval so that: 0 \u2264 cap _ minv, u S \u2264 cap _ maxv, u S \u2264 cap (cap (v), free _ capp, u S), this policy allows the customer v as he determines his cap _ minv, u S and cap _ maxv, u S \u2264 cap _ maxv, u p (cap (v), free _ capp, u, u S and cap, u S and cap _ max.min."}, {"heading": "4.4. The customers' selection policy by the provider", "text": "This policy defines the order in which the requirements for the acquisition of capacity are met by the provider node v. This policy is applied when the capacity required by the customers exceeds the capacity available on this route. This policy depends on both the quantities cap _ minw, u S and cap _ maxw, u S. At each stage S, each provider v tries to assign a minimum capacity to each of its customers in order (cap _ minw1 \u2264 cap _ minw2 \u2264... \u2264 cap _ minwi \u2264...) and then provider v distributes its remaining capacity among the number of customers. Always respecting the previous order of customers, it adds a part of this remaining capacity to each of its customers. This part should not exceed the difference between cap _ minwi S and cap _ maxwi S."}, {"heading": "5. SIMULATION ANALYSIS", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them will be able to show themselves that they are able to survive themselves, and that they are not able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves, \"he said in an interview with the\" New York Times. \""}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "We have presented a new model for QoS and resource management within the cross-domain routing framework, which we have referred to as an inventory model, which is presented using a reverse cascade approach and an iterative process in which nodes could learn the right amounts of purchasing and storage capacity, and the simple simulation results we have presented confirm this model, showing that in the case of simple network topologies and / or basic strategies, the model converges towards good and satisfactory situations. Moreover, since the model converges with positive values of minimum capacity (cap _ min), it does not disadvantage vendors, but customers are not more disadvantaged as they can buy positive capacity stocks. Therefore, this model really represents an inventory model that pushes for nodes to anticipate the resource stock they can resell. However, in cases of more complex network topologies or scenarios (for example, with multiple targets), this model would need to be reinforced by more complex features and features."}], "references": [{"title": "Optimal transit price negociation: The distributed learning perspective", "author": ["L.
