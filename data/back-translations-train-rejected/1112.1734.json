Nowadays, companies have technology to store detailed information about each transaction carried out and to generate large databases. This stored information can help companies to improve themselves, and for this reason, companies have sponsored research and the development of tools to analyze databases and useful information.Over the years, manual methods have been used to convert data into knowledge. However, the use of these methods has become expensive, time-consuming, subjective and impractical when applied in large databases.Problems with the manual methods stimulated the development of processes of automatic analysis, such as the process of discovering knowledge in databases or data mining. This process is defined as a process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful and ultimately understandable patterns in data [6].In the data mining process, the use of association rules, the use of association rules in databases or data mining has drawn attention to the use of the association rules of large sets of ARE patterns]."}, {"heading": "2 Association Rules and Taxonomies", "text": "An association rule LHS \u21d2 RHS represents a relationship between the elements LHS and RHS [2]. Each element is an atom that represents the presence of a particular object. The relationship is characterized by two metrics: support and trust. Support for a rule R within a dataset D, where D itself is a collection of articles (or itemsets), is the number of transaction rules in D, which contain all transaction rules that contain more support and trust than the minimum support and minimum confidence defined by the user. High values of minimum support and minimum confidence generate only trivial rules. Low values of minimum support and minimum confidence generate large amounts of rules (patterns) that complicate the user's analyses."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "We conducted some experiments with the GART algorithm to show that the use of taxonomies to generalize large rule sets reduces large amounts of association rules and simplifies the analysis of the rules. The experiments were conducted with a sales database of a Brazilian supermarket.The database contained sales data from the last 3 months. We made 4 partitions of the database to perform the experiments.The partitions were conducted with sales data along a day, 7 days, 14 days and 1 month.To generate the association rules, we used the implementation of the Apriori algorithm generated by Chistian Borgelt3 with a minimum support value of 0.5, a minimum trust value of 0.5 and a maximum number of 5 elements according to rule.The generated rule sets are described as follows: - RuleSet 1 day - 32668 rules generated using the 1 day partition; - RuleSet 7 days - 166 days, the rules of 161 day, the rules of use of partition 14 26353; - The rules of 161 days were generated under partition 14 26353 days."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "One problem found in the data mining process is the fact that several of the algorithms used generate large amounts of patterns, making it difficult to analyze the patterns. This problem occurs with association rules, a data mining technique that attempts to identify all the patterns in a database.In this paper, we proposed the use of taxonomies in the knowledge post-processing step to generalize and trim uninteresting and / or redundant rules. Then, we presented the results of some experiments conducted to show that the GART algorithm can reduce the volume of association rules. As the sets of taxonomies were made by the user, other estonomies can generate higher reduction rates than those presented by experts in the experiments."}], "references": [{"title": "Data Mining for Association Rules and Sequential Patterns", "author": ["J.M.
