It is used to identify the co-expressed genes in specific cells or tissues that are actively used to make proteins. This method is used to analysis the gene expression, an important task in bioinformatics research. Cluster analysis of gene expression data has proved to be a useful tool for identifying co-expressed genes, biologically relevant groupings of genes and samples. In this paper we applied K-Means with Automatic Generations of Merge Factor for ISODATA- AGMFI. Though AGMFI has been applied for clustering of Gene Expression Data, this proposed Enhanced Automatic Generations of Merge Factor for ISODATA- EAGMFI Algorithms overcome the drawbacks of AGMFI in terms of specifying the optimal number of clusters and initialization of good cluster centroids. Experimental results on Gene Expression Data show that the proposed EAGMFI algorithms could identify compact clusters with perform well in terms of the Silhouette Coefficients cluster measure.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Dec 2011 08:16:13 GMT  (757kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4261v1", "ISSN (Online): 1694-0814this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "ISSN (Online): 1694-0814this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE cs.DB", "authors": ["t chandrasekhar", "k thangavel", "e elayaraja"], "accepted": false, "id": "1112.4261"}, "pdf": {"name": "1112.4261.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Performance Analysis of Enhanced Clustering Algorithm for Gene Expression Data", "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In the last few years it has been shown that the number of people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to"}, {"heading": "2.

One of the disadvantages of AGMFI is the random selection of the starting point of the desired clusters, which has been overcome with Enhanced for Finding the initial centroids algorithms to avoid for initial values at random. Therefore, the EAGMFI algorithm is independent of the choice of the number of clusters and the automatic evaluation of the starting point of the centroids it generates with Silhouette coefficient measurement, with different better results."}], "references": [{"title": "Initializing K-Means using Genetic Algorithms", "author": ["Bashar Al-Shboul", "Sung-Hyon Myaeng"], "venue": "World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2009}, {"title": "K-Means Clustering Algorithm with Improved Initial center", "author": ["Chen Zhang", "Shixiong Xia"], "venue": "Second International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (WKDD), pp. 790-792, 2009.", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2009}, {"title": "K - Modes clustering", "author": ["A Chaturvedi J.C.", "P Green"], "venue": "Journals of Classification, (18):35\u201355, 2001.", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2001}, {"title": "Fuzzy C means method for clustering microarray data", "author": ["Doulaye Dembele", "Philippe Kastner"], "venue": "Bioinformatics, vol.19,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2003}, {"title": "An Interactive Approach to mining Gene Expression Data", "author": ["Daxin Jiang", "Jian Pei", "Aidong Zhang"], "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Network constrained clustering for gene microarray Data\u201d, doi:10.1093 /bioinformatics", "author": ["Dongxiao Zhu", "Alfred O Hero", "Hong Cheng", "Ritu Khanna", "Anand Swaroop"], "venue": "bti 655,", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2005}, {"title": "An Efficient enhanced K-Means clustering algorithm", "author": ["A.M Fahim", "M Salem A", "A Torkey", "A Ramadan M"], "venue": "Journal of Zhejiang University,", "citeRegEx": "9", "shortCiteRegEx": "9", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Automatic Generation of Merge Factor for Clustering Microarray Data", "author": ["K Karteeka Pavan", "Allam Appa Rao", "A V Dattatreya Rao", "GR Sridhar"], "venue": "IJCSNS International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security,", "citeRegEx": "10", "shortCiteRegEx": "10", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Divisive Correlation Clustering Algorithm (DCCA) for grouping of genes: detecting varying Patterns in expression profiles", "author": ["K.R De", "A.
