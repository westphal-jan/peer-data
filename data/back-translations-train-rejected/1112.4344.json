In recent years, networked data has become increasingly important due to the growing importance of social networks and other web-related applications, and this growing interest is pushing researchers to find scalable algorithms for important practical applications of these problems. In this paper, we focus our attention on a task called node classification, which is often studied in the semi-monitored environment of Zhu et al. [2003]. Recently, several teams have examined the problem from a theoretical perspective with interesting results, for example Cesa-Bianchi et al. [2009, 2010, 2011] developed on-line fast predictors for weighted and unweighted graphs, and Herbster et al. developed different versions of the Perceptron algorithm to classify the nodes of a graph (Herbster et al. [2009], Herbster and Pontil 2006]."}, {"heading": "2 Basic Framework", "text": "Considering a weighted graph G = (V, E, W), a label of G is an assignment y = (y1,.., yn) \u04320, 1,..., c} n, where n = | V |. We expect our graph to respect an idea of regularity, where neighboring nodes often have the same designation: this term of regularity is called homophily. Most machine learning algorithms for node classification (Autbster et al. [2009], Cesa-Bianchi et al. [2003], Cesa-Bianchi et al. [2011], adopt this bias and use it to improve their performance. The learner receives the graph G, but only a subset of y, which we call a training set. The goal of the learner is to minimize the remaining labels between the number of errors."}, {"heading": "3 Graph Transduction Game", "text": "In this section, we describe the game presented by Erdem and Pelillo, which in a certain sense aims to spread the cost of approaching the multi-way cut across the nodes, by expressing the sum of all players \"strategies (the so-called social equilibrium). We must be aware that the value of the multi-way cut is strongly linked to the value of the social well-being of the game, but in general, a Nash equilibrium cannot guarantee the collective outcome. In the Graph Transduction Game (later called GTG), the value of the multi-way cut is strongly linked to the value of the social well-being of the game, but in general, a Nash equilibrium will not guarantee the collective outcome. The Graph Transduction Game (later GTG), the graph topology is known in advance and we consider each node as a player. Any naming of the nodes is a pure strategy of the players."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Evolutionary Stable Strategies approach", "text": "In fact, most people are able to move to another world in which they are able to find themselves, in which they are able to find themselves, and in which they are able to move."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "This year, it is so far that it is only a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "5.1 Binary classification", "text": "In order to allow a fair comparison, we will generate our data sets for the experimental activity in the same way as Cesa-Bianchi et al.

USPS is a set of handwritten digits collected by the United States Postal Service and contains 9298 16 x 16 pixel (grayscale) images; the data set called RCV1 is a subset of 10,000 articles in chronological order taken from Reuters Corpus (a huge collection of messages published by Reuters Corpus). All articles were pre-processed with TF-IDF. Both datasets were natively multiclass, so we tested our binary predictors using a standard one-on-rest scheme. We have 10 binary experiments for USPS and 4 binary experiments for RCV1. We created our diagrams with as many nodes as the total number of examples for each dataset, using only 10 closest neighbors for each node (prior to symmetry)."}, {"heading": "5.1.2 Experimental results", "text": "The results shown in Table 1 are not conclusive, but we can observe some interesting trends: \u2022 GTG-ESS is the most accurate algorithm, but its computational complexity does not make it particularly suitable for most current practical applications. \u2022 MUCCA's accuracy is good and it is always close or better to SHAZOOs. \u2022 LABPROP approaches competitors when the size of the training set grows."}, {"heading": "5.2 Multiclass classification", "text": "In the multiclass comparison we have replaced RCV1 with two other datasets, because it is not only multiclass, but also multi-label (an element has more than one label).As we explained earlier, SHAZOO only works on binary problems, so the only scalable competitor in this section is WMV."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Datasets", "text": "\u2022 USPS is the same graph we used for binary classification. \u2022 CARDIO consists of measurements of the characteristics of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) on cardiotograms classified by experienced obstetricians. We created a graph based on the characteristic vectors, as we did for USPS and RCV1. The graph consists of 2126 nodes and 13696 edges. The nodes are divided into 3 classes (fetal states) 1. \u2022 GHGRAPH is a graph created from data published by Github.com for its 2009 competition. Each node represents a repository and an edge, meaning that a developer works on both repositories connected by this edge. If more than one developer works on these repositories, the number of developers used as weight for this edge is the most common repository used in this repository."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 Experimental results", "text": "The results of our experiments shown in Table 2 are not conclusive, but we can observe some interesting trends: \u2022 It is not really clear which between GTG-ESS and LABPROP is the most accurate algorithm, but nevertheless MUCCA is always competitive with them. \u2022 MUCCA is always much better than WMV. As expected, WMV works better on \"not too sparse\" graphs like GHGRAPH, but even in this case it is surpassed by MUCCA. \u2022 The temporal complexity of GTG-ESS and LABPROP did not allow us to perform them in a reasonable time with our computing resources."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and future work", "text": "We introduced a novel scalable algorithm for classifying multi-class nodes in arbitrarily weighted graphs. Our algorithm is based on game theory1 The cardiotography dataset was created by de Campos et al. [2000] and is now freely available on the UCI website with a full description: http: / / archive.ics.uci.edu / ml / datasets / cardiotocographyframework, where test labels are expressed as the Nash equilibrium of a particular game. In practice, MUCCA even works well in binary problems with competitors such as Label Propagation and SHAZOO, which are specifically designed for the binary environment. Several questions remain open. For example, committees of MUCCA predictors work well, but we do not know if there are better ways to act on their predictions. Given their common game theory background, it would also be interesting to investigate possible links between committees of MUCCA predictors and ESG-ECCA predictors."}, {"heading": "A. Blum and S.
