Essential knowledge work is complex and evolves in nature. It is often identified as \"unstructured problems.\" [6] In fact, many of them have characteristics of evil problems [8] that can be extremely difficult to solve due to incomplete, contradictory and changing requirements, which are often difficult to identify. They have complex interdependencies, so that trying to solve one aspect of a problem can reveal or even create other problems. Even when a solution is worked out, the implementation of the solution can produce unexpected results. Moreover, the people who carry it out cannot be expected to have the same expertise [6]. All these problems together create the problem of designing an SSKW, especially if we are aiming for its sustainable usability by a community of users, which is extremely difficult."}, {"heading": "3.1 Principle of Resilience and Flexibility", "text": "Given the general nature of knowledge work, it is very likely that it will soon prove fragile in the face of unforeseeable changes in the work environment and in practice. Therefore, we have to accept from the outset that we cannot foresee future requirements and most likely even all current requirements. Consequently, it will not always be possible for an SSKW to provide the desired level of support. However, the SSKW must have multi-layered capabilities so that a user can easily build up new capabilities at a higher level, using the lower ones, when needed. Such a situation can be found in the scenario described above in line 16b, in which the SSKW does not deliver the desired result. However, it provides sufficient lower-level support on which the physician can develop remedies (line 16c) to obtain the desired information. Additionally, the multi-layered capabilities of an SSKW serve a crucial purpose. An SSKW is first built around a specific structure of the task structure, on which there can be no basic structure."}, {"heading": "3.2 Principle of Evolution and Adaption", "text": "Due to (the right kind of) evolution, a system becomes more efficient in what it does, while adaptation allows it to cope with new / altered requirements on it due to changes in the environment in which it operates. An SSKW is by nature a collaborative tool that raises some difficulties in its conception, which we will examine later. However, it also opens a window of time that can be used by an SSKW to develop and adapt. Each instance of performance that SSKW uses creates new resources, nominally the information related to the instance (line 28), and in addition other valuable resources, such as those contained in lines 16d and 23.An SSKW should be designed to actively seek to maximize the scales of use of these new resources. To achieve this effectively, an SSKW must employ various means to relate the specific situation that requires resources to the general situation (s) where they may be useful."}, {"heading": "3.3 Principle of individual and communal usability", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the solution to the problem is not only a problem, but also a problem that has become prevalent in people's minds in recent years."}, {"heading": "3.4 Principle of coherent extensibility", "text": "Given the complexity of the knowledge work and the need for large amounts of different information during its execution, we believe that an SSKW should be designed as an open system, and should be able to expand or improve its capabilities by appropriately using the powers of external systems. Such systems may include information repositories, analysis tools or even other SSPs. In our example scenario on line 4, the list of possible illnesses can be obtained from standard disease databases; in line 7b, extracts of an article may have been obtained from an article archive (e.g. PubMed5) via the Internet. Similarly, the activities on lines 16b and 16c can actually make use of the capabilities of an external statistical data analysis tool. For an SSKW designer, the challenge is to translate the needs and context expressed by SSKW users through their own domain vocabulary into languages that can be understood by external tools and vice versa."}, {"heading": "4 Technological feasibility of SSKW", "text": "The degree of complexity envisaged in our example scenario may not be immediately technologically attainable, but we believe that the innovative application of state-of-the-art in informatics / IT5http: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nihm.gov / pubmed / research and technology can lead us significantly in the desired direction. In the following, we will discuss some relevant ideas and possibilities, some of which are currently being examined in the context of KwSS [5]."}, {"heading": "4.1 Activity modeling", "text": "An SSKW must be aware of the structure of tasks related to constituent activities and their interrelations (dependence, target structure, etc.) at the granularity level of its performance. Furthermore, it must be aware of the context and semantics of activities and of the various resources (information, tools, calculation protocols, etc.) required to carry out the activity. As a means of grasping them in order to form a nominal or basic knowledge base (KB) for SSKW, we must create a rich and holistic but formal representation of knowledge-intensive activities. Such formalism can be co-opted by modern social sciences. For example, we should perceive the model of human activity as in \"Activity Theory (AT).\" Figure 1 describes the elements of the model and their correspondence with various entities involved in knowledge work."}, {"heading": "4.2 Activity models in an SSKW", "text": "The typological model (TM) is essentially a reference / nominal or basic structure of the target that can be tracked by a user of the SSKW. On the other hand, SSKW can use the TM to track the activities performed by a user. This allows SSKW to provide resources for providing focused, context-aware support for granular activities, as well as detect and record deviations, if any, in relation to the TM made by a user. An element of a TM can be designed to provide easy access to very rich resources by providing detailed semantics (in the form of domain ontology, glossary, thesauri, etc.) and other relevant information (e.g. politics, legal constraints) about the represented entity by allowing the user to use information for on-job learning as well as the SSKW part to perform sophisticated reasonablenities, other thesauri policies, etc.)."}, {"heading": "4.3 More of an SSKW", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the solution to these problems is an attempt to achieve a solution that is capable of being achieved, as has already been apparent in the past."}, {"heading": "4.4 Improving an SSKW", "text": "In general, the challenge is to find better ways to serve the user with a well-defined and largely static repertoire of resources. In contrast, in an SSKW, the volume of potential resources is increasing, so there must be additional capabilities to find out the benefits of new resources. This can be very difficult to achieve, but in the case of SSKW, we have the advantage that it is a system to support users rather than replace them. Consequently, we propose a pragmatic approach in which systemic learning can be completed with appropriate support for users. An SSKW improves through evolution and adaptation to them is the ability to identify and acquire resources."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We believe that the SSKW as a system class will play a major role in the coming days. These systems can come in various forms, from personalized support for individuals to those used by large, distributed teams to collaborate and orchestrate complex information flows. However, to realize their potential, even at the level depicted in our example scenario, a diverse and concerted research effort spanning a range of disciplines is required. Nevertheless, our experience with KwSS [5] leads us to believe that even the level of performance of an SSKW that can be achieved with innovative applications of available technologies can be of considerable value."}], "references": [{"title": "A mind so rare: The evolution of human consciousness", "author": ["M.

An SSKW can be defined as a system built for providing comprehensive support to human knowledge-workers while performing instances of complex knowledge-works of a particular type within a particular domain of professional activities. To get an idea what an SSKW-enabled work environment can be like, let us look into a hypothetical scenario that depicts the interaction between a physician and a patient-care SSKW during the activity of diagnosing a patient. The patient-care task is practiced by health-care professionals, typically within organizational setups like hospitals. An instance of the task, known as a case, is carried out by a group of professionals (physicians, surgeons, nurses, laboratory technicians etc.) led by a physician (often known as the lead physician for the case) with the primary goal of restoring an ailing patient to state of health. However, the performance also serves various secondary goals achieved through capture and reuse of information about the case. The overall task is usually divided into subtasks or activities such as examination, identification of possible diseases, clinical tests, diagnosis, treatment, follow-up etc. The actions taken during these activities and their results have complex interrelationships. The patient-care SSKW realizes an integrated IT-based system platform which supports all the constituent activities in ways consistent with their interrelationships. Our hypothetical scenario depicts a particular activity by the lead physician (shall be referred as LP hereafter), i.e., diagnosing a patient P with the help of a patient-care SSKW. Making a diagnosis results in identifying a particular disease based on available evidence (e.g., symptoms, signs and medical history of the patient, results of various clinical tests conducted) for which the patient will be treated. Such a scenario is described below. For diagnosing P , LP opens the case in SSKW and the following interactions take place:", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
