DOCUMENT CLUSTERING BASED ON TOPIC MAPS (TMHC)", "text": "We first transform each document into a compact form that represents only the topics presented in the document, as well as the occurrence and connection between the topics. It maps information using an online open source application Wandora [14]. It is an application that applies data analysis techniques to topic maps and is able to generate topic maps that support different data representations. It uses an online plug-in, integrated with an Open Calais service that has proven very useful in creating topic maps, using plain text files as input and returned topic maps based on the information contained in these text files. It then exports the topic maps to the XTM format using the Wandora export utility program. After collecting topic maps, a similarity measure was developed that extracted useful information from the topic maps and identified the three layers of information in the topic maps that are used as a criterion clustering."}, {"heading": "3.1 Document Representation in TM", "text": "The three datasets contain different document formats, and all three datasets are analyzed to transform theme map-based data structures using Wandora.

The similarity that we have defined is calculated as the number of common themes, with common theme days and the tag value. The following equation calculates the similarity between a pair of document Di and Dj. where DTi and DTj represent the common theme presented in the document that has been successfully extracted from the theme map representation. For example, the theme tag is the instance of a topic; sports is a topic, cricket and hockey are theme days. Therefore, Dtagi and Dtagj are the common theme days. The last construct that needs to be included in similarity is the tag value. It is the instance level that is presented for each topic. So, DtagVali and DtagValj respectively represent these values.) The above equation was used to calculate the similarity between the documents."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP", "text": "The proposed algorithmic approach has been compared with a number of recently proposed document clustering algorithms on some standard datasets for the problem of document clustering.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we present a new approach to document clustering based on the representation of documents by topic maps. Insights derived from the representation of topic maps serve to define the measurement of similarity between a pair of documents. This measurement serves to cluster by means of hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC).The experimental results show that the TMHC performs better in terms of the quality of the generated clusters than comparative algorithms.An increased cluster purity clearly demonstrates the fact that topic maps naturally capture the semantics of documents.The experimental setup of the four well-known reported algorithms is implemented and tested on the data sets defined for this evaluation, the F measurements for the algorithms are shown in Table 2 together with a graphical sample of measurements.The proposed approach had clearly shown an improvement in all test cases.The FMeasuring for Dataset D4, which shows a subset of NEW20, is a significant improvement to this document quality, if this approach leads to a significant improvement in the document quality."}, {"heading": "6.
