The vector space can be considered a generated as an architecture by the network of relations in the network space; words are then not only related, but also positioned.

Introduction", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where there can only be a noteworthy aversion to such aversion."}, {"heading": "2. The framing concept", "text": "The concept of framing was introduced by Goffman (1974), who explained that messages in the mass media are \"framed,\" meaning that a description is provided from a particular perspective and with a specific interpretation. McCombs (1997) described framing as \"the selection of a limited number of thematically related attributes for inclusion in the media agenda when a particular object is discussed.\" Van Gorp (2007) pointed out that this process of selection is inevitable, since journalists cannot provide an objective picture of reality. McQuail (2005, on page 379) agreed with this inevitability, which leads to the inclusion of a specific way of thinking in the communication process. Entman (1993) also argues that this process of being conscious or unconscious."}, {"heading": "3. The dynamics of frames", "text": "Through the research methods described in this study, it is possible to examine differences or changes within a network, not only static, but also dynamic. Danowski (2007) examined changes in frames from the perspective of language. He pointed out that frames refer to the way that is based on cultural and social backgrounds."}, {"heading": "4. Using semantic maps for the study of frames", "text": "In addition to manual content analysis (Krippendorff, 1980; Krippendorff & Bock, 2009), computer programs can be used to generate semantic maps based on large amounts of messages. A properly normalized semantic map can be helpful in determining latent dimensions in text groups. By using statistical techniques, it is possible to analyze the structure in semantic networks and color them accordingly. Content can be contained in a set of documents, a sample of sentences, or other textual analysis units. In our design, the textual analysis units are considered cases, and the words in these messages - after proper filtering of the stop words - are colored as variables. Thus, we work with matrices that contain words as variables in the columns and textual analysis units as cases in the rows. In the word and document characters - the word matrices - the word matrices - and the social section - are commonly used as symmetry in this section."}, {"heading": "4.1. Generating the word/document occurrence matrix", "text": "To create the Text / Document Occurrence Matrix, you must first save a series of messages in such a format that the various programs to be used below can use them as input files. If the messages are short (less than 1000 characters), we can use Notepad or another text editor to save them as separate lines in a single file. 2 This file must be called \"text.txt.\" In this case, you can use the program Ti.exe (available at http: / / www.leydesdorff.net / software / ti), which analyzes title-like phrases. If the messages are longer, the messages must be saved as separate text files named text1.txt, text2.txt, etc. 3 These files can be read by the program FullText.exe (at http: / / www.leydesdorff.net / software / fulltext /)."}, {"heading": "4.1.1. Frequency List", "text": "The text file text.txt can be used directly as input for the program Frequency List (FrqList.exe at http: / / www.leydesdorff.net / software / ti), which produces a word frequency list from the file text.txt, which is needed to assess which words the analyst wants to include in the Word / Document Occurrence Matrix. As a rule of thumb, more than 75 words are listed on each line. If using Word or WordPad, you should be careful to save the file as a so-called DOS plaintext file. When prompted by Word, select the option to add CR / LF to each line. (CR / LF is an old specification of carriage returns and line feeds, as with a typewriter.) 3 Sometimes Windows will automatically add the extension.txt. qtxt can be automatic so as not to save the files with the double extension. \"txtxt\" just go \"one of the single text and run\" FrqList.exe \"programs."}, {"heading": "4.1.2. Full Text", "text": "In fact, it is so that it will be able to ereniei the aforementioned lcihsrteeaJrh for eerwdnei eerwdnei eerwdnei eerwtlrsAeerenie.n"}, {"heading": "4.2. Analyzing the word/document occurrence matrix", "text": "To label the variables by name, select \"File - Open - Syntax\" to read the file labels. Select \"Run - All.\" As seen in the syntax file, FullText has deleted the \"s\" at the end of the words. The goal is to remove the plural forms, but this can be of no use when analyzing a word / document occurrence matrix. Compared to the original words in the WRDFRQ.txt file (created by FrqList), the labels in the SPSS variable view can be manually customized, which is only necessary if you want to use the words as labels, for example in a table of the SPSS output. When visualizing the word / document occurrence matrix, as we explain below, the words can be customized for use in Pajek at a later date."}, {"heading": "4.2.1. Factor analysis", "text": "Factor analysis can show which words belong to which components. Before factor analysis you have to calculate the variance of the variables (the words from the matrix). Words with a variance of zero cannot be used in a factor analysis and must therefore be excluded from the process. (The variance can be calculated in SPSS by selecting \"Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - Descriptives,\" then selecting all words in the right column and then ticking under \"Variance.\") The next step is the analysis of the data using a factor analysis. Select \"Analyze - Data Reduction - Factor\" in SPSS. This step is shown in Figure 5. Select all variables in the left column and select them in the right column."}, {"heading": "4.2.2. Cronbach\u2019s alpha", "text": "Before visualizing the matrix, one can perform a reliability analysis by calculating Cronbach's alpha (\u03b1) for each frame (component), which measures, after the factor analysis, whether the frames form a reliable scale. First, you can determine which words belong to which frames from the output of factor analysis in SPSS, as in Figure 6. The next step is to calculate Cronbach's alpha in SPSS by selecting \"Analyze - Scale - Reliability Analysis.\" Select the words from the first frame in the right column and run the reliability analysis by selecting \"OK.\" Figure 7 shows the output of this analysis with Cronbach's alpha for the example in Figure 6 using the second frame, which consisted of nine items (i.e. words as variables). In the example in Figure 7, Cronbach's alpha has a value of.95. To ensure the internal consistency of the scale, Cronbach has a minimum alpha value of 65."}, {"heading": "4.3. Visualizing the word/document occurrence matrix", "text": "In this section, we explain how to visualize the word / document associated with the use of Pajek 7 and the output of factor analysis in SPSS. To visualize the results of this analysis, one only has to follow the factor analysis generated by FullText. 8 In the first part of this section, the drawing of the figure is discussed and discussed, and then it is explained how the visualization can be designed by the output of factor analysis in SPSS. The last part of this section discusses the layout of the figure and how it can be changed."}, {"heading": "4.4. The discourse about \u201cautopoiesis\u201d visualized as an example", "text": "This section provides a brief illustration of the research methodology by visualizing the international discourse on autopoiesis, consisting of nine newspaper articles from various English-language newspapers harvested at LexisNexis. 11 The messages were stored as separate text files, and the output of the Frequency List (FrqList.exe), Full Text (FullText.exe), and SPSS programs were used as input for Pajek. Figure 13 visualizes the word / document occurrence matrix and factor analysis using Pajek. 11 The Washington Post (2), The Australian (1), Calgary Herald (1), The Herald (Glasgow) (1), The Independent Extra (1), The New York Times (1), The Observer (1), and factor analysis using Pajek."}, {"heading": "5. Limitations", "text": "Although this method has the advantage of being more objective in frame extraction than other methods, there are, of course, some limitations. First, Matthes and Kohring (2008) argued that all computer-aided methods of content analysis assume that words and phrases have the same meaning in every context. However, a human encoder might be better able to recognize all the different meanings in a text and provide an interpretation of the contexts of the words. As Simon (2001) also describes, the computer cannot understand human texts with all their subtlety and complexity. However, our methods allow further expansion, for example by using factorial complexity as an indicator of words with different meanings in translation between - different frames (Leydesdorff & Hellsten, 2005). Second, one could argue that there is a problem of validity."}, {"heading": "6. Future research directions", "text": "The resulting results can be further embellished for presentation purposes with the help of Lesson 6 at http: / / www.leydesdorff.net / indicators. Other files on this page use the same techniques for other purposes. For example, you may be interested in the references cited in texts and therefore create a quotation matrix instead of a matrix of adjacent words. The basic scheme is that of the text units of analysis (messages) to which a number of variables can be assigned. These variables can be words, author names, institutional addresses, cited references, etc. You can then create the file matrix.txt and cosine.dat as described above and for analysis in SPSS and / or visualization in Pajek.In addition to the statistics available in SPSS, Pajek houses a number of statistics developed in social networks in recent decades."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "In our argument, semantics has been seen as a property of language, while meaning is often defined in terms of use (Wittgenstein, 1953), i.e. at the level of action. Since the exploration of intersubjective \"meaning\" in various philosophies (e.g. Husserl, 1929; Mead, 1934), the emphasis in measuring meaning has gradually shifted to the intrinsic meaning of textual elements in discourses and texts, i.e. to a more objective and supra-individual level (Luhmann, 2002). Pragmatic aspects of meaning can be measured using Osgood et al. \"s (1957) Likert scales and by questioning the respondents, but modelling the dynamics of meaning requires further elaboration (cf. Leydesdorff, 2010). Our long-term purpose is to model the dynamics of knowledge in scientific discourse."}], "references": [{"title": "Toward a Structural Theory of Action", "author": ["R.S.

We distinguish between the communication of information in the network space (social network analysis) and the communication of meaning in the vector space. The vector space can be considered a generated as an architecture by the network of relations in the network space; words are then not only related, but also positioned. These positions are expected rather than observed and therefore one can communicate meaning. Knowledge can be generated when these meanings can recursively be communicated and therefore also further codified.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
