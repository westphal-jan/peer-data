Without community there would be no life. As a general understanding (according to Wikipedia), a community can be described as a group of interacting people. Often, the group shares some common values, characteristics or interests and is associated with social cohesion. Unlike real-life communities, an online community is a virtual community that exists online. Members are a group of people who communicate or interact with each other using information technology, typically via the Internet and not in person. Social networking services consist of one of the most representative types of online communities. In the information age, online communities have become an important form of social interaction between the majority of people."}, {"heading": "Smart Community", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them are able to survive themselves without there being a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is"}, {"heading": "TECHNICAL CHALLENGES", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "SUMMARY", "text": "In this position paper, we outline our vision of smart communities, with which a paradigm shift in IT is planned, in which the virtual, physical and social worlds will converge.

We argue that the importance of the role that smart communities will play in our society cannot be overstated, and in particular, smart communities will help address emerging societal challenges in ways that were impossible a few years ago. However, multidisciplinary studies need to be undertaken to address the challenges of building smart communities, and we look forward to extensive efforts in this direction."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work was partially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60903153, the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (DUT10ZD110) and the SRF for ROCS, SEM."}], "references": [{"title": "Integrating Sensors and Social Networks", "author": ["C.
