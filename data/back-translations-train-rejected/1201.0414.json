A more general concept of continuous function defined between two domain-free continuous information algebras is presented. It shows that by combining and focusing all continuous functions between two domain-free continuous information algebras, a new s-continuous information algebra is formed. By investigating the relationship between domain-free information algebras and labeled information algebras, it is shown that they correspond to each other on s-compactness.Keywords: domain-free continuous information algebra; labeled continuous information algebra; continuous function; compactness."}, {"heading": "1.

First, we present these definitions of continuity and compactness in labeled information algebras. The difference in continuity between labeled informational algebras and domain-free information algebras is that in a labeled information algebra, any element algebra with labeled information algebras can be approximated."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this thesis we defined the concepts of labeled continuous information algebra and domain-free continuous information algebra. We examined the correspondence between labeled information algebra and domain-free information algebra for continuity, s-continuity, compactness and s-compactness. Continuity between two domain-free information algebras was redefined. It was shown that the functional space between two domain-free s-continuous information algebras also forms a domain-free s-continuous information algebra."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors would like to thank two anonymous speakers and Professor Bernadette Bouchon-Meunier, Editor-in-Chief, for their valuable comments and constructive suggestions, which have significantly improved the quality of this work.
