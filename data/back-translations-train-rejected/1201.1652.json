In this paper, we emphasize the close link between the high level and low representations involved in sign languages. Signed languages are fully formed languages that serve as means of communication between deaf people. They are characterized by meanings: they have their own rules for compositional elements, grammatical structures and prospective representations that include multimodal components set into action by movements."}, {"heading": "2 Related Works", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to put themselves in a situation where they are able to survive themselves, and in which they will put themselves in a situation where they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able to assert themselves."}, {"heading": "3 The Motor Theory of Sign Language Perception", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "4 Methodology: Sign Language Production and Perception", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to put themselves in a situation where they are able to survive on their own, and in which they have got into a situation where they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able to flourish."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "This work promotes a motor theory of sign language perception as a guideline for understanding the linguistic encoding and decoding of sign language gestures. According to this theory, what we perceive is nothing other than the movement of the articulators of the body. In other words, this assumption states that linguistic knowledge is mapped to sensory-motor processes. Such a a priori statement is based on two main hypotheses: First, we are able to derive motor data from sensory data through a sensory-motor inversion process, and second, elements of linguistic information are somehow encoded into motor programs. A methodology directly derived from these two hypotheses is based on a so-called analysis-through-synthesis loop, which loop, through a perceptible evaluation of sign language by sign language experts, allows to validate or validate the hypotheses of linguistic language for codification."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partially supported by the SignCom project, an audiovisual and multimedia project of the French National Research Agency (ANR)."}], "references": [{"title": "The phonological structure of words.
