Introduction", "text": "It is widely accepted in the industry that maintaining existing customers is more cost-effective than attracting new customers, and that 20% of customers generate 80% of profits [1]. This means that companies need to learn a lot about their customers \"needs and requirements, their tastes and purchasing propensities, etc., which is the focus of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). [3] For CRM purposes, data mining techniques can potentially be used to extract hidden information from customer databases or databases."}, {"heading": "2. Related work", "text": "Analytical CRM is gaining momentum these days, and some approaches have been suggested in the literature. Padmanabhan and Tuzhilin [11] categorized CRM components into three groups: adaptive learning, forward-looking, and optimization. Using these components, they formulated CRM to take into account government-dependent factors. Using the proposed framework, they learned about the evolution of customer demand and the dynamic impact of their marketing. Xu and Walton [10] discussed the latest findings of CRM systems and their application. In addition, they introduced an analytical CRM system for acquiring customer knowledge. Electronic CRM was also studied in [10]. In this study [2], Xu and Walton extracted hidden information from the protocols to automatically tailor ranking functions to a specific user group or collection. Baesens et al. introduced a method to predict future customer spending behavior, and predicting customer behavior through a transactional database [12]."}, {"heading": "3. Methodology", "text": "Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is halfway between supervised and unsupervised learning. A set of tagged data is used to develop an initial classifier, which is then used to label the remaining untagged data. Once this is done, a classifier is constructed based on both the original and newly tagged data. Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that when the problem area is too complex, a large number of training protocols are required for classification. However, in CRM, similar to other real-world applications, untagged data is abundant and readily available, while tagged data requires human experts or other expensive categorization tools. In this essay, we introduce a semi-supervised learning technique that requires only a small size of tagged data for training. Additional tagged data sets are collected automatically."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Data", "text": "We examined the proposed algorithm on two sets of data. These data sets represented customer relationship management issues. The first set relates to bank records, containing 1000 records and 32 variables. The data set was divided into a training subset of 700 records and a test subset of 300 records. Subsequently, the training subset was divided into labelled and unlabelled subsets of 216 and 440 records, respectively. Training data consisted of two classes (good and bad). The secondary data set relates to insurance records. It contained 8802 records and 22 variables. The data set was divided into a training subgroup of 6000 records and a test subgroup of 2802 records. Subsequently, the training subset was divided into labelled and unlabelled subsets of 2250 and 3750 records, respectively. Training data consists of two classes (yes and no)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Proposed Semi-Supervised Algorithm", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "4. Experiment and Result", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before a solution can be found in which an agreement can be reached."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion & Future Work", "text": "The key findings of the above techniques are the reorganization of data and information for easier access, more effective efficiency and better data classification to get the best results from it. Data mining and CRM integration have advantages and many advantages for companies that need to discover the profitability of some customers more than other customers. Data mining can identify important customers in the data warehouse. Our approach has the following advantages: First, semi-monitored machine learning techniques are used to automatically create customer behavior modeling to improve accuracy. Secondly, a neural network can be used for visualization purposes. Data visualization is an important step in data analysis and can provide valuable insights in all steps of classification. Future work will also examine the use of other classification methods, such as fuzzy neural network, to classify data of varying trust. We are also interested in comparing our method with other operational CRM databases."}, {"heading": "6.
