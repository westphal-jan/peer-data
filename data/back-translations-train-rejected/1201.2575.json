However, for a slowly decaying channel and densely populated interferers, a small size neighborhood often results in nontrivial link outages and is thus insufficient for making optimal scheduling decisions. A question arises how to deal with the information outside a neighborhood in distributed link-scheduling. In this work, we develop joint approximation of information and distributed link scheduling. We first apply machine learning approaches to model distributed link-scheduling with complete information. We then characterize the information outside a neighborhood in form of residual interference as a random loss variable. The loss variable is further characterized by either a Mean Field approximation or a normal distribution based on the Lyapunov central limit theorem. The approximated information outside a neighborhood is incorporated in a factor graph. This results in joint approximation and distributed link-scheduling in an iterative fashion. Link-scheduling decisions are first made at each individual node based on the approximated loss variables. Loss variables are then updated and used for next link-scheduling decisions. The algorithm repeats between these two phases until convergence. Interactive iterations among these variables are implemented with a message-passing algorithm over a factor graph. Simulation results show that using learned information outside a neighborhood jointly with distributed link-scheduling reduces the outage probability close to zero even for a small neighborhood.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Jan 2012 14:28:23 GMT  (458kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2575v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 4 Mar 2012 23:06:41 GMT  (460kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2575v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NI", "authors": ["sung-eok jeon", "chuanyi ji"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.2575"}, "pdf": {"name": "1201.2575.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Joint Estimation of Information and Distributed Link-Scheduling in Wireless Networks: Mean-Field Approximation and Graphical Models", "authors": ["Sung-eok Jeon"], "emails": ["sujeon@microsoft.com,", "jic@ece.gatech.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "II.

First, we describe the structure of distributed connection planning, then we present an example of distributed planning with complete information. We give an example of how the performance of distributed planning with partial information deteriorates, which leads to two approximation schemes. We give an overview of the approximation schemes to motivate the following sections."}, {"heading": "A. Distributed Link-Scheduling Decisions", "text": "In a distributed environment, a node determines its channel access plan, i.e., whether to access a channel at a given time, using the information within its neighborhood. Information refers to the \"state that includes the relative positions, the transmission statues (who transmits to whom), the transmission performance, and the planning decisions for links. For convenience, this work does not take into account current control and assumes a fixed transmission capacity for each node.The decision made is cooperative and based on two criteria: first, whether the SINR requirements for neighboring connections are met when a node chooses to use a channel; second, maximizing the spatial channel reuse, which is the number of simultaneously active links in the network.Decisions are made in a distributed manner. A node sends its decision to neighbors, and neighbors use the information to make their own decisions about linking planning, and then send it to their neighbors. Distributed decisions are made collectively and within a network in order of all nodes."}, {"heading": "B. Complete Information", "text": "First, we consider an ideal environment in which complete information is available for individual nodes to make link planning decisions [8] [30]. Complete information refers to the state of all nodes in a network. That is, the neighborhood for each node is an entire network. A node then determines whether to access a channel at a given time, using the available information. Such a scenario is used as a starting point for comparing approximations. Consider an example of a linear network in Figure 1. Suppose that limiting channel competition requires that each active connection between two adjacent nodes be separated by a neighboring link. Interference constraint requires that each active connection must be separated by at least two links. Suppose that the network maximizes spatial channel reuse, maximizing the total number of simultaneously active connections."}, {"heading": "C. Partial Information", "text": "Partial (state) information is available to a node if its neighborhood consists only of nodes that consist of parts of a network. Suppose, for example, that the neighborhood for each node is the adjacent link. This means that the neighborhood is determined only by the requirement that a node would not have access to the channel if its neighbor was transmitting information. Such a neighborhood size is smaller than desirable because the node does not know whether the node 6, 7) and (9, 10) are active (see eighth line in Figure 2). These active connections are outside the neighborhood system and are therefore invisible to the node 2."}, {"heading": "E. Approximation of Information Outside Neighborhood", "text": "Let's consider that each node considers information outside its neighborhood, i.e. the remaining interference, as a loss variable. The loss variable deals with the effects of the rest of a network except for the neighbors in the aggregation. Two approaches are used for the approximation: The first is to characterize the expected value of a loss variable using the deterministic Mean Field approach [24], i.e., a number of Mean Field equations are derived by optimizing a limit of variation from the network model [20]. The expected values of the loss variables can be determined iteratively by solving deterministic Mean Field equations. The second is to consider the loss variable as random and estimate its probability distribution. The probability distribution can be learned iteratively from information within the neighborhood model. The approximations flow into distributed planning decisions. First, each node estimates either the Mean Field value or the distribution of the loss variable The probability distribution can then be determined from the information within the neighborhood as well as from the complete access plan."}, {"heading": "III.

Let \u03c3 = (i, j) represent the activity of the connection (i, j). Here, it is assumed that the node i is a transmitter, whereas the node j is a receiver. We assume that each node maintains complete information within a neighborhood area. The shape of the neighborhood cannot be circular for each node and each node cannot be node."}, {"heading": "B. Objectives", "text": "The goal of link planning is to maximize the spatial channel reuse at a given time, while at the same time fulfilling the SINR requirement of active links, i.e., maximizing the interference at the receiver of (1). R0 is the inversion of an interference threshold. R0 is a large positive constant in which R0 > Rij is used for (i, j).L. R0 is used to maximize the objective function whenever a new connection becomes active. The first term is the total number of active links that should be maximized for the reuse of the channel in the network.The second term: ij Rij\u03c3ij represents the effect of total interference of active links. The objective function in (3) satisfies the following three properties. The goal is (i) to fulfill the INotype requirement; to reduce the requirement for the SINverse (SI function) in relation to any (SI function)."}, {"heading": "C. Probabilistic Decisions", "text": "Decisions made by a node must take into account loss variables, i.e. the aggregated information outside its 5 neighborhoods and decisions made by neighbors. Since deterministically distributed decisions can easily be trapped in local minimums, we consider probabilistic, i.e. randomized decisions (see [10] [13] [16] and references to them). At any time, nodes make decisions about linkage planning based on a probabilistic model of the linkage planning decisions of neighboring nodes in the previous time period and loss variables. This requires a probabilistic decision model."}, {"heading": "IV.

A linkage between two nodes represents spatial dependence. The spatial dependence results from interference in the radio channel and corresponds to coupled terms in the system of potential energy H (\u03c3).

Optimal Configuration and Distributed Decisions", "text": "A fully connected dependency graph influences how distributed decisions should be made using the probability model. Node decisions are all interdependent. Therefore, optimal6 decisions require nodes to share information with all other nodes on the network. Graphically, this means that an entire network is a neighborhood, i.e. a node must receive information about all other nodes. In reality, this prevents the implementation of optimal distributed link planning."}, {"heading": "V. APPROXIMATION OF PROBABILISTIC MODEL", "text": "We now derive approximate values of the probability model for distributed planning.

Such a performance measurement measures the likelihood that a linkage cannot meet the requirement of the SINR requirement.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have studied distributed scheduling decisions, where each wireless node uses complete information within a neighborhood and information derived from it outside. We have characterized the complex spatial dependence of distributed scheduling decisions with a factor diagram. Factor diagram enables information exchange between neighbors. More importantly, the wide-ranging dependence in residual interference is not ignored, but is approximated by a variable as an aggregated dependence outside a neighborhood. Meanfield approximation considers the residual interference outside a neighborhood as a deterministic meanfield. Such a meanfield approximation optimizes the variable free energy, resulting in a simple Markov Random Field model for distributed decisions. A disadvantage is that the meanfield approximation method is mathematically costly to maintain. Normal approximation considers the residual interference outside a neighborhood as a random loss variable for distributed decisions."}, {"heading": "I.

with information exchange only among a small number of neighbors. However, for a slowly-decaying channel and densely-populated interfering nodes, a small size neighborhood often results in nontrivial link outages and is thus insufficient for making optimal scheduling decisions. A question arises how to incorporate the information outside a neighborhood in distributed link-scheduling. In this work, we develop joint approximation of information and distributed link scheduling. We first apply machine learning approaches to model distributed link-scheduling with complete information. We then characterize the information outside a neighborhood, i.e., the residual interference, as an aggregated random loss variable. The loss variable is characterized by either a Mean-Field approximation or a normal distribution based on the Lyapunov central limit theorem. The approximated information outside a neighborhood is incorporated in a factor graph. This results in joint approximation of information and distributed link-scheduling in an iterative fashion. Link-scheduling decisions are first made at each individual node based on the approximated loss variables. Loss variables are then updated and used for next link-scheduling decisions. The algorithm repeats between these two phases until convergence. Interactive iterations among these variables are implemented by a message-passing algorithm over a factor graph. Simulation results show that using learned information outside a neighborhood jointly with distributed linkscheduling reduces the outage probability close to zero even for a small neighborhood.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
