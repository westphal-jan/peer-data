Introduction", "text": "The ability to accurately track a vehicle's location and status is the primary goal of vehicle trajectory monitoring systems, which are implemented using multiple hybrid technologies, including: wireless communication, geographical positioning, and embedded applications.Vehicle tracking systems are designed to help companies with a large number of cars and multiple uses. A fleet management system can minimize the cost and effort of employees to complete road deployments in the shortest possible time.Advanced orders can also be planned based on the vehicle's current location, making centralized fleet management essential for large companies to meet customers \"diverse needs and improve productivity [1]."}, {"heading": "2. Related work", "text": "Many researchers have suggested the use of state-of-the-art technologies to serve the purpose of vehicle tracking, including: communications, GPS, GIS, remote control, server systems, and others. The tracking system proposed in this paper is designed to track and monitor the status of cars used by specific parties for specific purposes. This system is an integration of several modern embedded and communication technologies [2] - [6]. To provide location and time information anywhere in the world, the Global Positioning System (GPS) is often used as a space-based global navigation satellite system [2]. Location information provided by GPS systems can be visualized using Google Earth [3]. In wireless data transmission, the Global System of Mobile (GSM) and the Short Message Service (SMS) technology are a common feature among all wireless carriers [4, 5]."}, {"heading": "3. System overview", "text": "The system has two main modules, as shown in Figure (2): The first module is the positioning device connected to the moving car. This module consists of: a GPS receiver, a microcontroller and a GSM modem. The GPS receiver retrieves the position information from satellites in the form of latitude and longitude measurements in real time. The microcontroller has three main tasks: reading certain engine parameters from the automotive data port (OBD-II), processing the GPS information to extract the desired values and transmitting this data via SMS to the server using a GSM modem. The selected engine parameters are: RPM, engine coolant temperature, vehicle speed, percent throttled.The second module consists of a receiver GSM modem and the workstation computer. The modem receives the SMS containing GPS coordinates and engine parameters. This text is processed with a visual numerical program to convert the parameters."}, {"heading": "4. Hardware specification", "text": "The tracking unit, as shown in Figure (3), consists of two main inputs: the first input received is the GPS output, which has a set based on the NMEA 0183 standard; the other input is obtained through the automotive data port, which is typically called ON Board Diagnostics Port, Version II (OBD-II); the unit sends a text message using the Hayes command (AT Command).The GSM port used (OBD-II) is a universal automotive protocol supported by modern automobiles to retrieve diagnostic errors via a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus of the microcontroller (MCU).The GSM module used is of type SIM900D, this module supports the standard AT command and is compatible with multiple GSM networks. Transmission parameters are set: baud rate is set at 19200 bps, the data are not configured to 81 and the NSM format is not."}, {"heading": "5. Software specification", "text": "In our tracking system, we use Google Earth software to track and display the status of the car [14]. Google Earth currently supports most GPS devices, and the dedicated GPS module includes the NMEA 0183 protocol for transmitting GPS information to a PC. This protocol consists of several sentences, starting with the $character, with a maximum length of 79 characters. The NMEA message for reading data with position and time is: $GPRMC [14]. Therefore, only the $GPRMC information is used to determine the location of the car to reduce SMS text. The status of the car along with $GPRMC information is sent through the MediaTek MT3329 GSM modem. Consequently, the receiver has GSM, including the NMEA 0183 protocol, receiving the transmitted SMS to obtain the GPS coordinates and status information of the car."}, {"heading": "6. Error correction of in-vehicle GPS coordinates using Kalman filtering", "text": "The GPS is a satellite-based navigation system. In places close to Earth, the satellite signals from skyscrapers and other elevations are reflected, which is known as the multipath effect. Therefore, a GPS device in the vehicle cannot produce accurate positioning due to the large delay spreads that do not cause the line of sight propagation paths of the satellite signals (radio waves). Other factors influencing the accuracy of positioning include: satellite geometry, shifts in satellite orbits, clock clocks, tropospheric and ionospheric effects and calculation errors [15, 16].To investigate this problem, some researchers have proposed to mount 4 GPS antennas on a vehicle to analyze the correlation of data from one antenna to the other. This approach will increase costs and require more complicated compilations. Other researchers have investigated the effectiveness of differential correction and the influence of satellite configurations carried out by ground-based error transmitters."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "This paper introduces a real-time positioning system for cars via Google Earth, which consists of two main components: an embedded transmitter module to interface GPS and GSM devices in the vehicle to detect and transmit vehicle status and status information via SMS. The second stationary module is a receiver module to collect and process the transmitted information in a format compatible with Google Earth for online remote monitoring of the vehicle location and status. The transmitted location of the vehicle was filtered using Kalman filters to achieve accurate tracking. 2DRMS coordinates were improved, the accuracy of the filtered coordinates was less than 15 meters compared to about 43 meters for the transmitted coordinates received by the GPS module in the vehicle."}, {"heading": "8.
