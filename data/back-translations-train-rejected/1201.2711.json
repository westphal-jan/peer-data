They offer us a useful starting point because they also use ultrametric topological representations and processing frameworks. It will become clearer later that our primary motivation is not based on a physical (and therefore, let's assume, observable by physico-chemical and biological processes) view of the brain. Instead, our motivation is to have a processing framework to model human thinking based on data such as text or dialogue data or other behavioral signals. In Section 3, we examine Matte Blanco's \"logical-mathematical,\" though largely descriptive, theory of psychoanalysis: 120 1,27 v3 [11cs]."}, {"heading": "2 Topology of Mental Processes: Neuro-Cognitive", "text": "Approaches Anashin and Khrennikov (2009) represent a modeling of cognitive processes and psychology, pointing out how it is best to use the point of view of ultrametric topology rather than the associated p-adic or m-adic (where p prime and m are positive integer trees) algebraic structure. Mental entities are modeled as partially ordered spheres (hence sentences) in physical space. \"Mental topology is ultrametric\" (Anashin and Khrennikov, 2009, p. 486) This work traces that Khrennikov began at the end of the 1990s and is also described in Khrennikov (2004).

Areas of application, as we have noted, can be robotics including robotic behavior - psychotic robot behavior, for example, can be underestimated. In this article, our focus is more restrictive in a certain sense, since it is about thought processes and especially argumentation. Instead of robotics as an application for us, we are interested in psychoanalysis and in particular text, literature and other foundations for empirical data analysis and signal processing. In other works (e.g. Murtagh et al., 2009), we have discussed and examined the quality of artistic creation and how well this can be understood computationally, i.e. through pattern recognition. Similarly, we find in the work of Matte Blanco an excellent basis for statistical and computoric investigation of human ways of thinking.

As Lauro-Grotto (2007, p. 539) observed, the aspect of anomaly modelling by means of ultrametry largely coincides with Matte Blanco's symmetrical logic:... \"we know that something similar can actually be experienced in finite space if we look at a very distant three-dimensional structure and perceive it as a single point. There, the symmetrization of relationships can be described as a transition from a metric to an ultrametric conceptual organization.\""}, {"heading": "4.1 Metric", "text": "The triangular inequality applies to metrics. An example of a metric is the Euclidean distance illustrated in Figure 1, where each and every triangle of points fulfils the relationship: d (x, z) \u2264 d (x, y) + d (y, z) for the distance. Two other relationships must also apply: symmetry or positive definition: d (x, y) = d (y, x) and d (x, y) > 0 if x 6 = y, d (x, y) = 0 if x = y. Semantic analysis based on a metric embedding is pursued in Murtagh (2005a), especially in Chapter 5, which deals with many types of text content, including technical, literary and philosophical. In Murtagh et al. (2009), a comprehensive analysis of film scripts shows how emotions can be traced, and this is achieved in an unattended manner solely through text input."}, {"heading": "4.2 Ultrametric", "text": "To see how an ultrametrist is a good mathematical model of anomaly or exception or novelty, look at Figure 2. Suppose there is a situation of searching for the best match material, and our search term and the available material are presented as points in Figure 2, right. If the target population has at least one good match that comes close to the query, then (let's assume) this is clear. However, if all matches in the target population are very different, does it make any sense to choose the next one? What answer we are focusing on here is the inherent ambiguity that we will appropriately note or record. Figure 2, right, illustrates this situation where the query is the point on the upper right. Relative to the figure in Figure 2, left, the query point would be associated with Figure 2."}, {"heading": "5 From Data to an Ultrametric: Hierarchical", "text": "Clustering"}, {"heading": "5.1 Ultrametric Topology and Hierarchy", "text": "Ultrametric topology was introduced by Marc Krasner (1944), and ultrametric inequality was formulated by Hausdorff in 1934. Schikhof (1984, see in particular chapters 18, 19, 20, 21) provides the main motivation for investigating this area as follows: Real and complex fields led to the idea of investigating any field K with a complete evaluation |. | comparable to the absolute value function. Such fields fulfil the \"strong triangular inequality\" | x + y | \u2264 max (| x |, | y |). In view of an evaluated field that defines a completely ordered abelic (i.e. commutative) group, an ultrametric space is induced by | x \u2212 y | = d (x, y). Various terms can be used interchangeably for analysis in and above such fields as p-adic, ultrametric and non-archimedic."}, {"heading": "5.2 Further Properties of Ultrametric Spaces", "text": "As already mentioned, in an ultrametric space all triangles are arranged either uniformly or uniformly. Here, we have very clear symmetries of form in an ultrametric topology. This symmetry \"pattern\" can be used for fingerprint data sets and time series: see Murtagh (2004, 2005b) and Ezhov et al. (2008) Every point of a circle in an ultrametric space is a center of the circle. (1981, chapter 0, part IV), Chakraborty (1978) and van Rooij are to be considered as followers. (2008) Every point in a circle is a center of the circle."}, {"heading": "5.3 Inducing an Ultrametric through Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering", "text": "A mapping of the metric to ultrametry is achieved by an agglomerative hierarchical cluster algorithm, a well-established approach that depends on a cluster (compactness or connectedness or some other) criterion. If each of the n observations is considered a singleton node in the hierarchical tree, n \u2212 1 agglomerations take place in pairs, resulting in a new node in the tree with each agglomeration. There is a redefinition of cluster distance (or, less restrictively, dissimilarity) following each agglomeration. Such a tree is dual or binary. A p-adic coding of observations can be read with each agglomeration (Murtagh, 2009, 2010b). The agglomerative algorithm outlined here is for computational efficiency reasons. Instead, the closest hierarchical coding of observations is an equivalent point between the places (Murtagh, 2009, 2010b)."}, {"heading": "5.4 Short Review of Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms", "text": "Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was the dominant approach to the construction of embedded classification schemes in space in 1979. It is often helpful to distinguish between methods that include a compactness criterion and the target structure of a 2-way tree that represents the partial order of subsets of the power set; as opposed to an implementation that refers to the details of the algorithm used. As with many other multivariate techniques (i.e. input data consists of measurements on an object crossed by an attribute set, the obects are called multivariate), the objects to be classified have numerical measurements on a number of variables or attributes. Therefore, the analysis is performed on the rows of an array or a matrix. If we do not have a matrix of numerical values to begin with, then it may be necessary to construct such a matrix from qualitative or symbolic data."}, {"heading": "5.5 Ultrametrics and Logic", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of them are able to survive themselves if they do not put themselves in the position they are in.
