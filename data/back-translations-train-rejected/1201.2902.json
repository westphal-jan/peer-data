Many research efforts have been conducted to facilitate the presentation modes used by instructors in classrooms as well as provide means for students to review lectures through web browsers. Other studies have been made to provide acoustical design recommendations for classrooms like room size and reverberation times. However, using acoustical features of classrooms as a way to provide education systems with feedback about the learning process was not thoroughly investigated in any of these studies. We propose a system that extracts different sound features of students and instructors, and then uses machine learning techniques to evaluate the acoustical quality of any learning environment. We infer conclusions about the students' satisfaction with the quality of lectures. Using classifiers instead of surveys and other subjective ways of measures can facilitate and speed such experiments which enables us to perform them continuously. We believe our system enables education systems to continuously review and improve their teaching strategies and acoustical quality of classrooms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Jan 2012 17:46:17 GMT  (222kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2902v1", "7 pages, technical report"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, technical report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["marian george", "moustafa youssef"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.2902"}, "pdf": {"name": "1201.2902.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Acoustical Quality Assessment of the Classroom Environment", "authors": ["Marian George", "Moustafa Youssef"], "emails": ["marian.george@alexu.edu.eg", "moustafa.youssef@ejust.edu.eg"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to put themselves in a situation in which they are able, in which they are able to move, and in which they are able, in which they are able to move."}, {"heading": "A. Features Extraction", "text": "1) The sound pressure level Lp in decibels (dB) is defined by 20 lg / Where is a reference pressure (20E-6 Pa) that corresponds to the threshold of audibility. As shown in [19], the A-weighted sound level is in decibels (dB) when assessing noise. The A-weighted filter is designed to mimic the response of the human hearing system.2) Pitch and RASTA-PLP: The main difference between male and female speech is pitch. In general, female speech has a higher pitch range than male speech. Therefore, pitch is usually used in combination with other characteristics for gender identification. Many tone rating algorithms (PDAs) have been proposed [21]. In our system we used the autocorrelation model [22], which is one of the most commonly used tone value effects."}, {"heading": "B. Classification", "text": "1) Student Noise Estimation: Sound pressure level frequency distributions (in the statistical sense, which indicates the time ratio for which the level assumed values, not the acoustic sense) were determined and plotted, and these distributions were then adjusted to a normal distribution curve that yielded similar results to non-symmetrical Weibull distribution curves. Mean and standard deviation of the curve were recorded, and the characteristics are then used to train a KNN classifier to classify a lecture as loud or quiet. Figure 2 shows the mean and standard deviations of about 80 recordings. Using k-fold cross-validations with k = 3, an error rate of = 0.1 is achieved with a 5-NN classifier. The lecture as a whole is classified as loud if the number of noisy recordings is classified as normal throughout the lecture."}, {"heading": "C. Analysis and Correlation", "text": "Possible relationships between different characteristics such as the height of the students \"sound level, the most common position of the sound level, the teacher's language level, the gender of the teacher and other characteristics are investigated 1) Noise level measurement: The sound pressure level varies with the distance from the speaker. This property is used in determining the approximate position of the sound level in a classroom. To assess the quality of a classroom environment, high-precision speech localization is not necessary, so we approach the position of the sound level, whether it is in the front left, back left or back right of the classroom. We adjust the normal distribution curves to the weighted sound pressure levels of four processed recordings to different positions in the classroom. The four recordings are recorded simultaneously, with the maximum average level between the four curves indicating the position of the noise, whether it is the position of the sound left or back right of the classroom."}, {"heading": "A. Data Collection", "text": "Our experiments were conducted in two university lecture halls, located on the second floor of a 5-story building with about eight lecture halls on each floor. Outdoor noises consist mainly of student noise and the rustling of tree leaves, but generally no significant noises from outside the lecture hall occurred. Typical lecture halls, such as coughing and stool movements, were not removed. The lecture hall is 12m x 10m in size and comprises seven rows of chairs with 10 chairs each. Both male and female lecturers were involved in teaching a variety of topics. In most cases, the classes consisted of lectures, with the lecturer being the main source of the speech. About three classes were tutorial sessions where students discussed various exercises with the lecturer. Recordings were made with Nokia N97 mobile phone voice recorders. Our student noise assessment and student / teacher gender determination experiments were conducted in real-world environments. Recordings were made in thirty lecture halls each lasting for approximately two hours, and one lecture per lecture per lecture for approximately two hours."}, {"heading": "B. Performance", "text": "1) Classification of lectures as loud or quiet: For each lecture, the k-NN classifier was used to classify each audio recording as loud or loud. Then, the entire lecture was classified as loud if the number of noisy recordings exceeded the number of silent recordings; conversely, the lecture was classified as quiet if the number of noisy recordings exceeded the number of noisy recordings. We achieved a classification accuracy of 94.2% when using k = 5. Figure 3 shows the classification accuracy of thirty lectures using different k values for the k-NN classifier."}, {"heading": "C.
