In order to provide a mathematical tool for mining tacit knowledge, we establish a concrete model of 6-ary linguistic truth-valued concept lattice and introduce a mining algorithm through the structure consistency.

We respectively give the algorithms of generating the linguistic truth-valued congener context and constructing the linguistic truth-valued concept lattice.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Jan 2012 17:33:28 GMT  (216kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3107v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["li yang", "yuhui wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.3107"}, "pdf": {"name": "1201.3107.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Tacit knowledge mining algorithm based on linguistic truth-valued concept lattice", "authors": ["Li Yang", "Yuhui Wang"], "emails": ["yangli6672@sina.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords Concept Grid; Tactical knowledge; Linguistic truth-value concept Grid; Congenital context; Attributes advanced algorithm;"}, {"heading": "1.
