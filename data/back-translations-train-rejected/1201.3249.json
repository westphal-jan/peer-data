This paper presents a LCS where each traditional rule is represented by a spiking neural network, a type of network with dynamic internal state. We employ a constructivist model of growth of both neurons and dendrites that realise flexible learning by evolving structures of sufficient complexity to solve a well-known problem involving continuous, real-valued inputs. Additionally, we extend the system to enable temporal state decomposition. By allowing our LCS to chain together sequences of heterogeneous actions into macro-actions, it is shown to perform optimally in a problem where traditional methods can fail to find a solution in a reasonable amount of time. Our final system is tested on a simulated robotics platform.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Jan 2012 13:19:55 GMT  (1222kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3249v1", "20 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG cs.RO", "authors": ["gerard howard", "larry bull", "pier-luca lanzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.3249"}, "pdf": {"name": "1201.3249.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["david4.howard@uwe.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 120 1.32 49v1 [cs.NE] 1 6Ja nKeywords Learning Classifier Systems \u00b7 Spiking Neural Networks \u00b7 Self-adaptation \u00b7 Constructivism"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "To achieve reasonably complex behavior, this problem must be viewed over time.

In addition to self-adaptive mutation, two evolutionary topology schemes are used in this work to allow for the modification of spiking networks in two ways: by adding / removing hidden layer neurons; and by adapting / removing interneuronal connections. This allows each classifier to autonomously control his own knowledge in terms of the frequency and range of mutation that occurs in a given time (Bull et al, 2000), and by adapting the hidden layer topology of neural networks to reflect the complexity of the problem brew considered by the network (Bull, 2002).5.1 Constructivismo 1997, Connovismo Sectist (e.g., Quartz), the structures are small."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments in Continuous State Space", "text": "We compare our previous work with an MLP-based N-XCSF (see Howard et al (2008); Howard et al (2009) for details.

Santamaria et al (1998) extended the latter approach by considering continued spheres of action.

Although a standard RL test scenario, the continuous network world is a physical complexity missing in any real world, which has been mainly chosen to allow a direct comparison with TabularQ Learning. Evaluating our system on a robot simulation suite is therefore a logical step forward. An overview of current robot simulation platforms can be found in an environment lacking in physical complexity, 2007).

Because networks can calculate their actions, they have the ability to perform the right actions in different areas of the problem area, even if this action is different. Furthermore, using XCSF's predictive calculation, we observed that a network can accurately predict the payout in several spatially unequal regions of the problem area, even if the payout values are different. Results of adding TCS showed that if the system was presented with an environment that allowed it to use its temporal capabilities, it performed in environments where a temporal element does not exist, in other words, the system is able to process underlying temporal information in a problem, the main strength of the TCS-based continuous actions it was the simple generation of."}], "references": [{"title": "A genetic programming-based classifier system", "author": ["M Ahluwalia", "L Bull"], "venue": "RE (eds) Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference", "citeRegEx": "Ahluwalia and Bull,? \\Q1999\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ahluwalia and Bull", "year": 1999}, {"title": "Automated alphabet reduction method with evolutionary algorithms for protein structure prediction", "author": ["J Bacardit", "M Stout", "JD Hirst", "K Sastry", "X Llor\u00e0", "N Krasnogor"], "venue": "Lipson H (ed) Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference,", "citeRegEx": "Bacardit et al\\.,? \\Q2007\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bacardit et al\\.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Reinforcement distribution to fuzzy classifiers", "author": ["A Bonarini"], "venue": "Proceedings of the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI) \u2013 Evolutionary Computation,", "citeRegEx": "Bonarini,? \\Q1998\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bonarini", "year": 1998}, {"title": "Learning fuzzy classifier systems for multi-agent coordination", "author": ["A Bonarini", "V Trianni"], "venue": "Information Sciences", "citeRegEx": "Bonarini and Trianni,? \\Q2001\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bonarini and Trianni", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Generalization in reinforcement learning: Safely approximating the value function", "author": ["JA Boyan", "AW Moore"], "venue": "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems", "citeRegEx": "Boyan and Moore,? \\Q1995\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Boyan and Moore", "year": 1995}, {"title": "Radial basis functions: theory and implementations", "author": ["MD Buhmann"], "venue": "Cambridge Monographs on Applied and Computational Mathematics,", "citeRegEx": "Buhmann,? \\Q2003\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Buhmann", "year": 2003}, {"title": "On using constructivism in neural classifier systems", "author": ["L Bull"], "venue": "HP (eds) Parallel Problem Solving from Nature - PPSN VII,", "citeRegEx": "Bull,? \\Q2002\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bull", "year": 2002}, {"title": "On dynamical genetic programming: Simple boolean networks in learning classifier systems.
