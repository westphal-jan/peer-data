So the design of systems such as simulation systems, cooperative systems or assistance systems includes a very accurate modelling of interactional and communicational levels. The agent-based approach provides an adapted abstraction level for this problem. After having studied the organizational context and communicative capacities of agentbased systems, to simulate the reorganization of a flexible manufacturing, to regulate an urban transport system, and to simulate an epidemic detection system, our thoughts on the interactional level were inspired by human-machine interface models, especially those in \"cognitive engineering\". To provide a general framework for agent-based complex systems modelling, we then proposed a scale of four behaviours that agents may adopt in their complex systems (reactive, routine, cognitive, and collective). To complete the description of multi-level agent models, which is the focus of this paper, we illustrate our modelling and discuss our ongoing work on each level.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Jan 2012 19:02:11 GMT  (851kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3880v1", "10 pages; IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 6, No 1, November 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages; IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 6, No 1, November 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["alain-j\\'er\\^ome foug\\`eres"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.3880"}, "pdf": {"name": "1201.3880.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Modelling and simulation of complex systems: an approach based on multi-level agents", "authors": ["Alain-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Foug\u00e8res"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Agent Paradigm", "text": "There are many definitions of the agent paradigm [19, 37] that are supported by suggestions on the typology, but new types of agents continue to emerge [35]. Therefore, it is difficult to build consensus. However, through these definitions, we find that three functions characterize the activity of agents: perceive, decide and act. An agent has his own knowledge. He acts in autonomy from reason and decides according to his goals, his interactions with other agents in the system and his ambient perception. In a broader sense, experts in this field generally agree on the following characteristics with regard to cognitive agents: intentionality, rationality, engagement, adaptability and \"intelligence.\" ABS are systems that make it possible to distribute agents, communicate, autonomous, reactive, skillful and finalized units. They form intelligent solution networks that are weakly bound and cooperate to solve problems that go beyond their individual abilities and knowledge of agents. [18] Among the proposed agent architectures, the agent cognitive models can be implemented (three)."}, {"heading": "2.2. Agent Organisation and Interaction", "text": "Working in sociology or in scientific organizations has always interested the ABS community as a source of modeling behavior [38]; the organizational configuration type scale of Mintzberg [21], from hierarchical structure (centralization) to professional bureaucracy (decentralization), through \"adhocracy\" (mutual adjustment between groups), is one example. The problems inherent in partial agent knowledge in pursuing local goals or networked agents require the development of advanced coordination mechanisms [9]. An organization must allow ABS to behave as a coherent whole in order to uniformly solve a problem. It controls and coordinates the interactions between agents of the system and structures its activities. Communication and interaction are interlinked. Following the definitions proposed for human-machine dialogue [5], it is possible to distinguish these two concepts as follows: Interaction is an exchange between agents and their environment, depending on the intrinsic properties of the environment in which they operate."}, {"heading": "2.3. Agent-Based Systems Design", "text": "The ABS design, which is often questioned from a procedural or methodological perspective [4], assumes that the designer proceeds with a local vision to respect the fact that each agent manages his or her own knowledge and actions (autonomy). The support languages of the ABS design are numerous [3]. In [11] we proposed an ABS design method in four steps, referring in detail to AUML (Agent Unified Modelling Language) [1]: (1) using the use case diagrams (class diagrams provided by ABS); (2) for each case, sequence diagrams perform the interactions (message exchange and scheduling) between the actors involved in this reference case; (3) from the sequence diagrams identifying agents, objects and their class diagrams, completing the class diagram: objects are associated with classes, exchanged messages (service diagrams are transmitted between classes, since class queries can be transmitted to classes), since class behavior is sufficient in the ABS design (since class questions are transmitted to classes)."}, {"heading": "2.4. Proposition of Agent-Based Systems Modelling", "text": "After examining the organizational context of the ABS to simulate the reorganization of a flexible production system and the regulation of an urban transport system, we focused on the modelling of agents with pronounced communication skills that can be used as a basis for the design of complex systems such as cooperative systems and assistance systems. Our thoughts on this interactive level were fed by models of the human-machine interface, especially models of the \"cognitive engineering\" approach [6]. Subsequently, we proposed a variable granularity agent model based on Rasmussen's three-step scale [10, 11, 28]."}, {"heading": "2.4.1 Notations", "text": "The following notes and definitions are used in this modeling section: {{} i\u03b1 = \u03b1 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430 = \u0430,..., 2,1; \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s"}, {"heading": "2.4.2 Modelling", "text": "The formal approach we follow is to define the modular architecture of agents to define their model of interaction, communication and knowledge and to respect a rigorous methodology for acquiring expertise. < < A, P, O > (1), where A is a set of agents whose interactions I have defined for agents of A, P, is the role model played by agents of A, and O is the group of organizations of agents in communities.

In APIC, each configuration position is an agent. Then, each specification (characteristic of the product), the solution (component of the product) and the restriction is represented by an agent.

The mediator is part of a group of human actors engaged in cooperative functional analysis."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion and Perspectives", "text": "This article defines a generic framework for modeling agents who design complex systems (cooperative systems, assistance systems, etc.) The underlying formal approach is to define a modular architecture for designing the various cognitive processes of agents. So, we have adapted the behavior of agents in our various application areas to define their knowledge and complete their patterns of interaction and communication. This scale consists of four levels that we have presented in this article. From the perspective of modeling communication and cooperation in CS, we have identified two levels of interaction situations: (1) microinteraction situations, such as cooperation between agents of mediators."}], "references": [{"title": "and J", "author": ["B.

After having studied the organizational context and communicative capacities of agentbased systems, to simulate the reorganization of a flexible manufacturing, to regulate an urban transport system, and to simulate an epidemic detection system, our thoughts on the interactional level were inspired by human-machine interface models, especially those in \"cognitive engineering\". To provide a general framework for agent-based complex systems modelling, we then proposed a scale of four behaviours that agents may adopt in their complex systems (reactive, routine, cognitive, and collective).
