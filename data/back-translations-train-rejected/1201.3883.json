Introduction", "text": "Everyone recognizes that effective collaboration requires each member of the collaboration to receive relevant information about the activity of their partners. Support for this relevant information exchange consists of models for formalizing relevant information, processors for measuring relevance, and indicators for presenting relevant information. System Engineering (SE) is the application area of our research activity. According to ISO / IEC 15288: 2002, the concepts and implementations of relevant information models in the fields of HCI and ubiquitous computing were presented."}, {"heading": "2. Issue of this Research", "text": "Information technology has played an important role in higher education infrastructure, and e-learning systems are making education more and more flexible and ubiquitous [7, 8]. Since learning is considered a collaborative activity, a variety of CSCL (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) systems have been developed to have a more effective study performance. CSCL systems allow students and teachers to perform all their activities in this virtual classroom environment, such as sharing resources, disseminating knowledge and information, discussing and disseminating the project, etc. In e-learning systems, the exchange and dissemination of information between students and teachers is very helpful and useful, such as learning resources, questions, feedback, etc. However, in most CSCW (Computer Supported Collaborative Work) systems, the exchange and dissemination of information can cause redundancy that has a negative impact on work and study performance [9, 10]. In our project, it is noted that shared information and motivation are affected."}, {"heading": "3.

Experiment", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this project is a project, it is a project, it is a project, it is first and foremost a project."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "We now think that learning activities will have better performance and effectiveness if we can eliminate the redundant common information in the collaborative system. Therefore, we proposed an implementation of the DSC method, supported by a collaborative learning system environment, which can provide relevant useful resources and appropriate workflows for the realization of projects, for the exchange and dissemination of relevant information. We have described an original methodology of the DSC model to address the problem of shared redundancy in collaborative learning environments. In this method, context models are used to prepare for DSC modelling. An approach to collective activity analysis (Activity Theory) allows us to build this context model. This phase is crucial, as the dynamic common context model depends on this context model to obtain satisfactory context factors. After describing our methodology, we presented an illustration in a collaborative learning context we selected from this hierarchical mapping."}], "references": [{"title": "The relationship of system engineering to the project cycle", "author": ["K.
