Introduction", "text": "Sustainable development and urban planning One of the most frequently cited definitions of sustainability is the one drawn up by the Brundtland Commission in its report (Brundtland, 1987), which defines sustainable development as development that \"responds to the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\" The report highlights three fundamental components of sustainable development: environmental protection, economic growth and social justice. Whether environmental issues are not the only aspects of sustainable planning and decision-making processes, they are impossible to avoid. In urban areas, one of the most important environmental problems is air pollution, which is largely caused by car traffic. This pollution can cause serious damage to health and is of particular importance due to the high population density in cities. Improving air quality is therefore imperative and must be taken into account in a sustainable urban planning process. In fact, a deep understanding and accurate prediction of urban flow and pollutant dispersion in cities is required to carry out proactive urban planning."}, {"heading": "Air quality models", "text": "The various categories include 3D air pollution models, which aim to \"reconstruct\" the environment, its properties and physical laws. Current air quality models and the associated simulation systems apply a number of (simplistic) assumptions about the environment, in particular its geometry and physical properties, depending on the scale of interest. Therefore, models used to study air quality at the local to regional level use a spatial resolution on a grid basis, where each grid cell has dimensions in the order of 1 x 1 km. To return to the urban scale, simulation models attempt to reconstruct the building shapes and basic geometric features and dimensions in order to improve simulation results."}, {"heading": "3D city models", "text": "At the same time, 3D city models are evolving rapidly (some cities have already been modelled in CityGML), which may (in part) provide the air quality models with the missing information they need to be more precise and effective. On the other hand, urban planners and stakeholders need information on the impact of their development plans on air quality development (current air quality and future scenarios), so their models need to be supplemented by data from air quality models. However, this data does not fit directly into the urban planning models, but needs to be adapted to these models (aggregated, calculated, etc.)."}, {"heading": "2. CityGML", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "What is CityGML?", "text": "CityGML is an open information model for the representation and exchange of 3D virtual city models at the international level (OGC, 2006) (Kolbe et al, 2005) (Kolbe et al, 2006).CityGML defines the classes and relationships for the most relevant topographic objects in cities and regional models in terms of their geometric, topological, semantic and optical characteristics. It has been defined in this way because purely graphic or geometric 3D models are not sufficient for visualization purposes, for applications such as urban and landscape planning, architectural design, tourist and leisure activities, 3D cadastral, environmental simulations, mobile telecommunications, disaster management, homeland security, vehicle and pedestrian navigation, training simulators or mobile robotics. CityGML distinguishes five successive detailed levels (LOD), from terrain alone to architectural models (exterior and interior)."}, {"heading": "Underlying concepts of CityGML", "text": "The most important topics are: - terrain (called relief), - coverage by land use objects (called land use), - transport (both graph structures and 3D surface data), - vegetation (solitary objects, surfaces and volumes, with vegetation classification), - water objects (volumes and surfaces), - locations, in particular buildings (bridge, tunnel, excavation or embankment in the vicinity), - urban furniture (for immovable objects such as traffic lights, traffic signs, benches or bus stops). Thus, the basic concepts of CityGML (see figure below) are: relief, land use, location, buildings (as a subconcept of location), transport object, vegetation object, water object, urban furniture. Buildings in CityGML can be represented with roofs, walls, doors, rooms and even furniture (according to LOD), which are represented with relief objects, surface objects, surface objects, surface objects (water object, surface objects, LOD), surface objects (water object, surface objects, surface objects, LOD)."}, {"heading": "3. OUPP: an ontology of urban planning", "text": "CityGML, with its urban and geometric concepts and their semantic relationships, is useful to represent an urban planning project, but not sufficient. In fact, some non-geometric concepts such as right of way or more abstract concepts such as soft mobility are missing in CityGML. OUPP has been defined and is still under development within the framework of the research project \"Integrating Urban Knowledge into 3D City Models,\" which is funded by the Swiss Confederation and part of the European COST action \"Towntology.\" The main objective of this research is to contribute to better communication between the various stakeholders involved in an urban planning process.

Towards an ontology of air quality models", "text": "The first phase of our ontology of air quality models focuses on road canyon models. The underlying concepts and properties of road canyon models are based on equations that serve as input: - the properties of the pollutant source (source location, product emitted, etc.) - the meteorological conditions, mainly the wind conditions in the environment (speed, direction in relation to the road canyon, etc.), but also to a certain extent the thermal conditions (solar heating) - the road canyon geometry, especially its aspect ratios (height-width ratio for 2D and 3D models, height-length ratio for 3D models) or its orientation in relation to the ambient wind and production as output: - a flow characterized mainly by its vortices (intensity, direction of rotation, location, etc.) - a pollutant dispersion distribution between the two areas."}, {"heading": "Street Canyon", "text": "Shape wide / square / narrow Height to width Ratio of building height to street width Height to height Ratio of building height on the air side to building height on the leeward side (absolute) Leeward location (depending on current wind conditions) Airside location Street level / building level / roof level Road position (absolute) Width Orientation (absolute) Albedo (average coefficient of reflection) Building location (absolute) Height Roof pitch Albedo (average coefficient of reflection)"}, {"heading": "Meteorological Conditions", "text": "Ambient wind conditions (as part of meteorological conditions) Speed direction (absolute) Turbulence intensityThermal conditions (as part of meteorological conditions) Sunshine duration Temperature of air temperature at the lowest temperature of the street on the building surface at the side temperature of the building on the air side The direction of ambient wind to the street canyon (required in the equations of the model) can be calculated from the absolute direction of ambient wind and the absolute orientation of the road"}, {"heading": "Pollutant Source", "text": "Origin of the emitted product Traffic related / chemical toxins / biological toxins Reactivity reactive / non-reactive source Location Road level / increased emission rate Continuous / non-continuous distribution of dispersion, which is a pollutant distribution flow (this is a vector field) regime Isolated roughness flow / afterflow interference flow / skimming flow Vortex is a vector field part of a weak / strong clockwise / counterclockwise rotation direction Origin mechanically induced / thermally induced form Portal vortex / roller-shaped vortex / horseshoe vortex"}, {"heading": "Isosurface", "text": "Value range Geometry a closed surface"}, {"heading": "Vector Field", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Scalar Field", "text": "Isosurface property, which refers to the Isosurface concept Pollutant Dispersion Distribution (which is a scalar field), is a source of pollutants"}, {"heading": "6. Interconnecting CityGML and air quality models", "text": "In this section, we will present different integration patterns that occur when CityGML (CG) and an air quality model (AQ) are connected and how they are represented in the OUPP ontology. Our goal is to provide a formal (logical) description of the linkages at the conceptual level that can be easily converted into an automated (computer-aided) process. The main idea is to create \"associative\" concepts and axioms in OUPP that relate to the interconnected concepts in AQ and CG. The goal is 1. to depict potentially complex integration patterns 2. to place and avoid all integration-related units in OUPP, to modify AQ orCG 3. to provide a kind of centralized intermediary for the integration of other models (water quality, noise reduction, etc.) The linkage technique that we propose here is inspired by the work of Mitra, Re-hold and Ontussiologies that are not related to the articulations in their architecture."}, {"heading": "Interconnection patterns", "text": "0.

Concepts with different viewpoints", "text": "The properties of the two concepts are not the same in both ontologies, and some properties can be calculated from those of the other ontology.

We present the following connecting concept (concepts of the same name differ in that they are preceded by the ontology name)."}, {"heading": "OUPP:street", "text": "Properties in _ AQ a AQ: street in _ CG a CG: street Each instance of OUPP: street refers to the same street in AQ and CG.The following axiom expresses the dependence between the properties of width and geometry for all in OUPP: street: s.in _ AQ.width = width _ computation (s.in _ CG.geometry), where width _ computation represents the (possibly complex) geometric function that calculates the width of the polygon that forms the road geometry in CG. Another similar example is AQ: building, whose roof pitch is calculated from the roof surface of CG: building and its albedo derived from the surfaces, material and color of CG: building."}, {"heading": "2. Instances derived from several instances in the other ontology", "text": "This is a more complex integration pattern in which one conceptual instance in one ontology corresponds to a series of conceptual instances in the other.

The following axiom defines the term street canyon for all c in OUPP: street _ canyon: for all x in c.buildings _ 1: borders (x, s) and for all y in c.buildings _ 2: borders (y, s) and continuously _ aligned (c.buildings _ 1) and continuously _ aligned (c.buildings _ 2) where borders and continuously _ aligned are geometric predictions. Furthermore, the properties of the street canyon in AQ depend on its components (in CG) properties (as in case 1) and possibly on other factors."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion and future work", "text": "In this paper, we have argued that integrating air quality models with 3D city models can significantly improve air quality modelling and sustainable urban planning. Air quality modelling can then leverage the semantically rich representations of 3D city models to facilitate the simulation of air flows. We have proposed a theoretical and practical approach to air quality and 3D city model integration based on the definition of an ontology of air quality and the use of an ontology of the urban planning process that acts as an intermediary to help urban planners deal with air pollution issues. We have proposed a theoretical and practical approach to air quality and 3D city model integration that is based on the definition of an ontology of air quality and the use of an ontology of the urban planning process that acts as an intermediary. By this approach, it is possible to support and formally specify complex linkage patterns. In addition, we can re-use the OUPP mediation sontology to integrate several other models that are of sustainable urban planning interest and we plan for the near future in this air quality model and incorporate the results from other examples."}], "references": [{"title": "A Numerical Study of Flow and Pollutant Dispersion Characteristics in Urban Street Canyons", "author": ["Baik", "Jong-Jin", "Kim", "Jae-Jin"], "venue": "In Journal of Applied Meteorology,", "citeRegEx": "Baik et al\\.,? \\Q1999\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baik et al\\.", "year": 1999}, {"title": "Modeling reactive pollutant dispersion in an urban street canyon", "author": ["Jong-Jin Baik", "Yoon-So Kang", "Jae-Jin Kim"], "venue": "In Atmospheric Environment,", "citeRegEx": "Baik et al\\.,? \\Q2007\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baik et al\\.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Air pollution at street level in European cities", "author": ["EEA"], "venue": "European Environment Agency (EEA) Technical report, No 1/2006, Copenhagen.", "citeRegEx": "EEA,? 2006", "shortCiteRegEx": "EEA", "year": 2006}, {"title": "A two-dimensional air quality model in an urban street canyon: evaluation and sensitivity analysis", "author": ["H.

However, a direct approach, that consists in establishing correspondences between concepts, is not sufficient in the present situation. One has to take into account, among other things, the computations involved in the correspondences between concepts. In this paper we first present theoretical background and motivations for the interconnection of 3D city models and other models related to sustainable development and urban planning.
