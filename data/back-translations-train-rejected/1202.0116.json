In order to find an answer, the following types of problems are considered: verification of hypotheses for persons and atypical actions, determination of persons and circumstances for atypical actions, planning of actions, determination of the cause of events and condition of persons. To formulate an answer, both derivative and plausible reasoning are used. As a field of knowledge, the social behavior of persons is considered, plausible reasoning is based on laws of social psychology. Proposed algorithms of inference and plausible reasoning can be realized in computer systems closely connected with word processing (criminology, business administration, medicine, document systems)."}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "The present work is dedicated to solving logical questions in a computer system based on the representation of natural language sentences using methods of mathematical logic (calculus of predicates). [7] Persons, organizations, machines, and other objects are described with the help of predicates. Properties of these objects are presented with variables (arguments) of predicates. Actions and events associated with these objects are also described with predicates containing references to specific objects."}, {"heading": "2. Knowledge base", "text": "A knowledge base includes frames (articles) with the description of concepts (nouns and verbs) 6. It is proposed the description of schemes, scripts and plans (schemes of cities, buildings and the like). The description of concepts and operations was examined in [11]. Therefore, we consider only the description of diseases, scripts and plans. 2.1. Description of scripts A story of life is referred to as a script if this story begins with a certain code code code and describes subsequent actions and condition of persons and other objects. The script (for example, a distress of ships) is formed with the next sentences: Frame is the script of distress2predicates are presented with tables of a relational database.Ship has code people put themselves in boats people can block many days at sea. People can die from lack of water and food. 2.2. Description of diseases. The description of a disease (for example, influenza.) is formed in the following way: preference temperature is high."}, {"heading": "3. Check of hypotheses for persons and actions", "text": "The question of the cause and end point of the action is first of all an algorithm of wayfinding from a starting point to an end point. If the starting point and end point of the action are on the same block, we move along the shortest path. The next algorithm is used to find a path from a starting point to an end point that does not belong to an end point. If the starting point and end point are on the same block, we move along the shortest path. The next algorithm is used to find a path from a starting point to an end point where these points do not belong to an end point. If the starting point is a crossing, we go to step 3, otherwise to step 2. Let us determine a crossing (in the starting block), the closest to that end point, and let us go to step 3."}, {"heading": "4. Determination of persons and circumstances for non-typical actions", "text": "To determine a person and the circumstances of atypical actions, the above-mentioned algorithms are used to verify a person's whereabouts, motives and actions. As mentioned above, proposed algorithms also apply a basic fact.4.1. Identifying the person for an atypical action To determine a person, the next algorithm is used: 1. persons are selected from a database, using the time and place of the action from a question or a basic fact. 2. For each person and the action given, it is examined whether a motive and tool corresponds to that person's knowledge base. 3. If the given person fulfils all checks, then an answer includes that person.The LEIBNIZ system gives a positive answer to the question: Who shot a girl on 9 Street1 Street? This answer is Petrov.4.2. Determining the cause of atypical action To determine a cause for an atypical action To determine a cause for an atypical action, the next algorithm is used: 1. verifying an act of a particular person and a fact of a time, 2."}, {"heading": "5. Planning actions", "text": "Consider the following problems: \u2022 finding a person who is likely to plan a targeted operation; \u2022 identifying a possible operation planned by a particular person; \u2022 identifying ways and means to perform a given operation by a particular person; solving these tasks is illustrated by the example of the operation that robs an office; a knowledge base contains the description of this operation; we only use an alternative procedure and its motives; going to the office to find an alternative procedure that does not work; opening a safe procedure with a tool; taking money alternatively by describing the action to rotate it; taking money as the subject that has an alternative procedure."}, {"heading": "6. Determination of event cause and person state", "text": "To determine the cause of an event: 1. Select events from a database when these events have the same state, time, and place as in a questionnaire. 2. Find an action (in the database) that produces the given event. We get the answer as a girl shot to the question: Why is a girl dead on November 7th at 9 Street1?.A person's condition depends on: \u2022 previous events that come with certain consequences; \u2022 internal physiological and psychological factors [9]. An algorithm for determining the state of a person is next: 1. If there has been an action recently that produced an event related to the state of a given person 7, then an answer is such a state.2. If there is a symptom of a disease8, then an answer is that disease.3. If a situation in which a person was typical of a particular script after a late event is a response to a disease.9."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "In order to solve the problem of understanding natural language for a certain area of knowledge, we apply the ontological approach. However, since a set of natural language describes facts (actions and events for objects of the real world), the problem of the given understanding of sentences is in an adequate representation.7 It is pointed out in the dictionary of verbs. 8Symptoms of the disease, however, are described within an appropriate framework of a knowledge base. 9This script must be incorporated into a knowledge base.Such representation is realized in our paper using predicate calculation. Each task from the field of knowledge is also interpreted with a series of predicates. validity of an answer is examined by an expert. The possibility of such a solution is the problem of solvability (for general questions) or compatibility (for special questions). Typical tendency for modern computer systems is in the use of artificial intelligence algorithms [15]."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2012, "abstractText": "Algorithms of inference in a computer system oriented to input and semantic processing of text information are presented.
