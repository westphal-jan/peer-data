INTRODUCTION", "text": "The last few years have shown that people are able to decide for themselves what they want to do and what they want to do."}, {"heading": "2. FLAMING", "text": "The term \"flaming\" comes from the early computing community, and The Hacker's Dictionary Figures [5] defines it as \"tospeak rabid or incessantly on an uninteresting topic or with an overtly ridiculous attitude.\" Flaming is described as an anti-normative and abusive phenomenon between users [6]. O'Sullivan and Flanagin (2003) define flaming as \"a concept that has emerged from the popular discourse around the online community to describe aggressive, hostile, profane interactions.\" Landry (2000) refers to the phenomenon as \"uninhibited and aggressive communication.\" In general, flaming means attacks with the intention of insulting someone by email, commenting or commenting on any statement using insults, intense language, trolling, etc. However, this definition is not considered entirely appropriate as there are many incidents where people are found to be insulted."}, {"heading": "3. COMPUTER MEDIATED", "text": "COMMUNICATION VS. FACE-TO-FACE COMMUNICATION Although, according to researchers, flames play a larger role in computer-mediated communication compared to face-to-face communication in general, such incidences of flames are quite low in both cases [13]. In the same line, initial studies comparing CMC and face-to-face communication showed that \"flames\" and other antisocial interactions were more common in electronic interactions [14]. The reason for such hostile behavior lies in the fact that in computer-mediated communication, the identity of users remains hidden and prominent in most cases. This anonymity associated with computer intermediation allows users to be more expressive and less concerned about the results of their actions [24]. Another reason for increased flame behavior in the CMC are the factions involved in sending and receiving flames, which may not have eye contact or physical presence during communication [1], which is therefore very important to the majority of body language, and may be present in most of the expressions."}, {"heading": "4. MOTIVATION", "text": "The research identified the need to classify flames in a way that has not been attempted before, based on the type of content presented and the style of language in which they are presented. In classification, the research aims to contribute to a better understanding of the flame process and thus give developers a better idea of how to design efficient solutions to the issue."}, {"heading": "5. CLASSIFICATION OF FLAMES", "text": "Until now, a lot of research has been done in the field of flame in the last 25 years, but there have been few attempts to classify flames. By the content, the study categorizes the type and style of flame. By the content of the message or the literature used in the messages, the flames can be classified as \"direct and deliberate flame\" and \"indirect flame.\" By the style or language of the transmission of the intended meanings, the message can be \"straightforward\" or \"satirical.\""}, {"heading": "5.1 Direct and Intentional Flaming", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves, and that they are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

This flame style is used in conjunction with direct or indirect flame. As flames are clearer in their meaning and the intentions are clear, such messages are more likely to generate counter flames by the user. Such a style is adopted in the CMC, where the identity of the flame is discreet. Users use the anonymity of the communication mode and express themselves more openly, which is a behavior that is often observed on the Internet."}, {"heading": "5.4 Satirical Flames", "text": "When a user uses speech figures or statements that tend to take turns to derive insults, contempt, or even malice from specific factions, places, or situations, they may be referred to as Satirical Flames, including the use of witty language, irony, and poetic freedom to convey insults, contempt, or even malice. These flames predominate among users who want to post incendiary messages but still seem to post normal statements. This style is used in conjunction with direct or indirect fire. Since satirical flames are more complicated, since references and intentions are vague and puzzling, responses to such flames usually ask for the details. Generally, the faction for whom the flame was intended does not respond to such messages when they perceive the true meaning of it. In doing so, they usually choose to be as enigmatic as the message with its comments. Consider a hypothetical scenario in which an employee places his supervisor of the company he works for on a public asynchronous micro-blogging brand page."}, {"heading": "6. DISCUSSION", "text": "The study saw the need to classify flames, as it was observed that certain types of flames appeared more frequently than others in certain CMC channels. For example, direct and straightforward flames are widespread in anonymous forums or message boards, which offer a considerable degree of discretion to the identity of users. Users of such flames fear at best a ban from the site, which some overcome by creating alternative accounts to sign up. On the other hand, indirect but direct or satirical flames are more common on microblogging sites, social networks and other CMC channels, where the true identity of users is partially or fully revealed. It has been observed that the discretion of users \"identities was directly responsible for the type of flames that the flames took on. Users used more open and offensive tones and language (direct and straightforward) on sites where their identity was not compromised, while using mild or indirect, enigmatic or satirical flames on real-life sites that linked their identity to their identity online."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION", "text": "Using various examples and real-life flame wars, the study was able to classify the flames seen in CMC according to the type of content depicted and the style in which they are presented. Based on the type, two types of flames were defined: direct and indirect. Based on the language style used, the study classified the flames as: straightforward and satirical. Direct flames are more prominent and can be easily identified and have a greater negative impact on the audience or the flame recipients than others. Satirical flames are more prominent on sites that connect the user to his true identity, such as social networks, company mailing lists, etc. All flames can be assigned to one type and style, regardless of where they are posted."}, {"heading": "8.
