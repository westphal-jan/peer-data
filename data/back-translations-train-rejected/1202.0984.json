Although certain OWL features (like owl:sameAs) are very popular, other features of OWL are largely neglected by publishers in the Linked Data world. This may suggest that despite the promise of easy implementations and the proposal of tractable profiles suggested in OWL's second version, there is still no \"right\" standard fragment for the Linked Data community. In this paper, we (1) analyse uptake of OWL on the Web of Data, (2) gain insights into the OWL fragment that is actually used/usable on the Web, where we arrive at the conclusion that this fragment is likely to be a simplified profile based on OWL RL, (3) propose and discuss such a new fragment, which we call OWL LD (for Linked Data).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Feb 2012 17:51:00 GMT  (346kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0984v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.AI", "authors": ["birte glimm", "aidan hogan", "markus kr\\\"otzsch", "axel polleres"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.0984"}, "pdf": {"name": "1202.0984.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "OWL: Yet to arrive on the Web of Data?", "authors": ["Birte Glimm", "Aidan Hogan", "Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch", "Axel Polleres"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

We often use turtle syntax; e.g., we can use an abbreviation for rdf: type. Finally, V denotes the set of RDF variables that exceed C and we prefix variables with \"?.\" An RDF triple (s, p, o) is a triple of the set of all RDF triples G: = U \"B\" U \"x\" C, with s being the subject, p predicate, and o object."}, {"heading": "2.2 OWL and its Fragments", "text": "OWL 2 is an ontology language that provides advanced schema modeling capabilities that can be used with RDF data. OWL 2 replaces the earlier specification \"OWL 1\" by introducing new modeling features, additional serializations, updated conformity requirements, and various fixes. If we omit the version number, we mean the current standard OWL 2. Each RDF graph can be considered an OWL ontology and the language of all RDF documents, which can be more complex than individual triples. For example, the triple Ex: a owl: sameAs ex: b. corresponds to the OWL axiom languages (ex: a ex: a ex: a ex: b)."}, {"heading": "2.3 OWL Semantics and Reasoning", "text": "OWL ontologies can be interpreted under two different semantics that agree in important cases: the RDF-Based Semantics (RS) [17] and the Direct Semantics (DS) [26]. As in RDF (S), semantics is defined by specifying a model theory, i.e. by defining valid interpretations for ontologies based on semantic conditions. In RS, these models are based on the representation of OWL axioms as RDF graphs and are therefore considered a sophisticated form of RDF interpretation. In DS, models are based directly on the structure of OWL axioms within the conceptual framework of description logic (which in turn is based on first-order logic)."}, {"heading": "3.

RELATED WORK", "text": "Here we discuss related studies on the use of RDFS and OWL on the Web (related OWL profiles were covered in Section 2).One of the earliest comprehensive empirical studies of RDF web data was presented by Ding et al. in 2005 [8]. They report on the prevalence of vocabulary terms in over 1.5 million RDF / XML web documents, in which the bulk of the data was described with a friend's friend (FOAF) and Dublin Core (DC) ontologies. The work focuses on the characterization of the structure and distribution of the raw data and not on semantics issues or on RDFS and OWL.Various papers look at the syntactic profiles of OWL ontologies on the Web [2, 38, 7]. Bechhofer and Volz identify and categorize OWL DL constraints through a sample of 201 OWL ontologies."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSION", "text": "We have presented a comprehensive analysis of the current use of OWL on the Web, based on a large sample of RDF / XML documents. We confirmed that OWL has indeed \"arrived\" in the Web of Data, albeit to varying degrees for different characteristics. Following the principles of Linked Data, we used a PageRank algorithm to assess the importance of individual documents. Our results show that OWL-RL features with a single, triple expression are most important on the Web. An analysis of existing tools confirms that these simple characteristics tend to be better supported. Based on these observations, we defined the OWL-LD profile as a sublanguage of OWL-RL and provided a rules-based reasoning calculation for this. Although motivated by a new analysis of the current ontology documents in the Web of Data, OWL LD is well aligned with the earlier proposals of RDFS-Plus and L2, suggesting that it may be a natural perspective."}, {"heading": "9.
