Some dictionaries can provide this information, but even assuming that a broad machine-readable dictionary exists, this dictionary cannot say whether arguments for a particular verb are optional or how likely they are to occur. Knowledge of the selective preferences and requirements of verbs is useful for systems that have explicit lexicalized grammars of the languages they cover, be it for parsing, generation, or both (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997), and for linguistic interest in themselves (Gahl et al., 2004). The goal of this work was to build resources for use in L3 (Gasser, 2011), a rules-based machine translation system based on dependency grammar that records combinatory possibilities for each word in its own lexicon."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "Many other researchers have addressed the problem of documenting the properties of different verbs in a particular language using evidence from corpora and manual lexicography.

We see in the literature a few different terms that describe the combinatory potential of a verb, including sub-categorization, sub-categorization framework, value or value. In any case, these terms describe what arguments and additions may occur with a particular verb, how often and which are mandatory. Although they describe similar terms, these terms do not seem to be interchangeable; while this work is about the syntax of the \"surface level,\" arguments that are present in practice (so that a parser might find them) are sought in the functional description alone (a generational reference term, where D may not refer to a person)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Valency lexica for English", "text": "It is not only a matter of time when and where people will be able to unfold, but also what they need to do to unfold.

VALLEX uses functional generative description as the background for its representation of verbs, recording at least whether a verb takes an actor, an addressee, an effect and an origin, and whether they need to be specified as well as a large number of other \"quasi-valence complements\" and \"free modifications.\" VALLEX provides a very detailed representation of the potential uses of each verb in its lexicon, much more detailed than what can currently be produced using automatic methods."}, {"heading": "2.3 Valency Lexica for Arabic", "text": "Based on the Prague Arabic Dependency Bank and the syntax theory of functional generative description (FGD), Bielicky \u0301 and Smrz \u0442 (2008) describe desiderates for a valence dictionary for Arabic. They do not describe the production of such a dictionary in practice, but rather design a framework for discussing it and propose a structure for lexical entries in the valence dictionary. Their structure is based on VALLEX, which seems to have a generally applicable formalism for the description of verbs. They also describe some tools useful for the task, including an FST-based morphological analyzer for Arabic, and explain the presentation of verbal arguments / additives by the FGD."}, {"heading": "2.4 Resources for Quechua", "text": "Rios et al. (2009) address the more general problem of acquiring enough linguistic knowledge to build effective NLP systems for underfunded languages such as Quechua, with a more labor-intensive approach. They describe their construction of a phrase-oriented Quechua and Spanish tree bank comprising about 200 sentences, with texts from the Declaration of Human Rights (available in many languages, including Spanish and Quechua) and the website of La Defensor\u0131'a del Pueblo, a Peruvian government organization advocating civil rights. Apart from the morphological analysis of Quechua, the tree and alignment process currently requires human attention, although this may be partially automated in the future. The tree bank is small so far, but it could be increasingly useful for machine translation as its tree banking process is increasingly automated. Rios et al. Note a surprising number of available requests for Spanish / Quechua, including political texts, messages, and poems."}, {"heading": "3 Proposed Approach", "text": "Our approach begins by processing each sentence in the corpus with the morphological analyzer and finding all verbs. In sentences with only one verb, we then count the occurrences of nouns that, due to inflection, appear to be the arguments of the verb. Here, plausible verbal arguments must be identified with a small number of language-specific heuristics. For example, a noun flexed with the accusative case in a sentence with a verb and a clear subject is likely to be the object of this verb. This approach throws away the information from sentences with multiple verbs and embedded sentences, but does not require syntactical analysis. We had hoped that the frequencies learned with this approach would approximate the frequencies learned with deeper syntactical analysis, but this is not confirmed empirically. Noisy observations could be filtered out by an approach similar to the one described in Przepio D\u00f6rkowski, 2009."}, {"heading": "3.1 Evaluating Valency Learning Techniques", "text": "When building a system that builds valence dictionaries for the verbs of a particular language, we want both a good memory, which means that the system identifies many of the verbal uses that actually exist in the training text, and a high degree of precision, which means that the answers that the system provides are actually correct. To measure both, we can consider an existing dictionary as the gold standard, but good valence dictionaries are not available for most languages. Instead, what we can do is take the verb used in a tree bank and consider the subcategory dictionary constructed in this way as the gold standard. We have an Arabic tree bank (Arabic tree bank part 1, v3.0) from the LDC available, so that we use both this tree bank and the related flattext for this work."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments with Arabic", "text": "Most of us have dealt with the text of the Arabic tree bank, using both the transliterated text with syntactical annotations and the uncommented Unicode text in Arabic script. In view of the tree bank annotations, we can find the verbs in each sentence, as well as the other components of the verb phrases, quite simply by traversing the tree of each sentence and capturing the immediate children of the verb phrase, who are not the verb itself. These are considered a sentence and challenged with the stem of the verb. To find all the verb subcategories in the tree, we traverse the tree of each sentence and capture the verb phrase that is considered to be such."}, {"heading": "4.1 Sentence Selection in Practice", "text": "Considering the English verbs such as \"think,\" \"believe\" or \"request,\" which usually occur with a clerical argument that includes another verb, we imagine that the analogue verbs in the language we study are under-represented or simply not learned. Experiments have shown that both of these concerns are well founded: sentences that had only one verb had a substantially different distribution of verb stems. The verbs that were most common in the one-verb sentences were \"saj al,\" \"qAl,\" \"qAl,\" \"aEolan,\" \"$Arik,\" \"kAn,\" \"daEA,\" \"balag,\" \"aHoraz\" and \"lotaqiy.\" These verbs are referred to by Google as \"record, said, called, beat,\" made. \""}, {"heading": "4.2 Morphological ambiguity", "text": "The goal with the uncommented text was to see which subcategories we could observe in sentences with a single verb. Rich Arabic morphology usually marks the case for nouns, which should allow us to find many arguments for verbs. We could then compare the values learned from the uncommented corpus with those that are easier to observe from the tree bank. If the values we discover with the unannotated approach are close to those learned from the tree bank, and we get broad coverage of the verbs observed in the corpus, then this would provide an argument that the technique works quite well for Arabic, and we could continue to use it as we acquire more textual data for the sub-resource-rich languages."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and future work", "text": "And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,"}], "references": [{"title": "Towards Automatic Extraction of Verb Frames", "author": ["Ond\u0159ej Bojar"], "venue": "Prague Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics,", "citeRegEx": "Bojar.,? \\Q2003\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bojar.", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Automatic extraction of subcategorization from corpora", "author": ["Briscoe", "Carroll1997] Ted Briscoe", "John Carroll"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the fifth conference on Applied natural language processing,", "citeRegEx": "Briscoe et al\\.,? \\Q1997\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Briscoe et al\\.", "year": 1997}, {"title": "Valence extraction using em selection and co-occurrence matrices.
