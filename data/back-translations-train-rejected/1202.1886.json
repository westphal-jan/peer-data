INTRODUCTION", "text": "One of the problems for a computer network intrusion detection system that passively monitors a network connection is the ability of an experienced attacker to evade detection by exploiting ambiguities in the traffic flow seen through the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). [1] [3] The traffic normalization mechanisms are among the wide range of tools that help in mapping, controlling resources in TCP / IP networks, and the base system to improve NIDS reliability. [3] Many techniques can be used to classify network traffic by its attack traffic."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "In recent years, IDS alarm processing techniques have received considerable attention in the research community. [5] Some researchers have also proposed a method of machine learning to normalize and classify IDS alarms to reduce the number of false alarms. In 1999, the KDD conference held a classification learning contest in which the learning task was to develop a predictive model for distinguishing attacks from normal connections. Participants trained and tested their classifiers using a break-in data set provided by MIT laboratories. All of this work exceeds the features of the KDDCUP 99 training and test data. Sung et al. use SVMs and neural networks to identify key features for 1998 DARPA intrusion detection data. The most related work is done by Dongxi Liu, Chi-Hung Chi and Ming Li. [3] Their goal is to add a thin layer of data to either a packet from the network layer or a packet from each packet during the connection layer."}, {"heading": "3. PROBLEM STATEMENT", "text": "We need intelligent IDS, but the system that takes the first step is the classification and normalization of traffic. First, the normalization of the packet level would disappear in a breath of logic. However, there is not one implementation, but many, and each can behave uniquely under identical stimulation. First, we make normalization data by using normal traffic. In evaluating normalization, we pay attention to completeness, correctness, and performance [4]. The evaluation is a difficult problem, since most of the functionalities of normalization by definition relate only to unusual or impossible traffic, and the results of a normalizer are generally invisible to connection endpoints. The problem here is getting test traffic that exhibits the behavior we want to normalize; once this is done, we must make sure that the normalization normalizes it correctly. TTL setting to an attacker's incoming packets causes some packets to be dropped after a verification by the NIDS. Endsystem only sees TTL with longer packets."}, {"heading": "4. SOLUTION", "text": "In this case, it is possible to obtain the protocol, which is characterized by a mentioned, inserted and sunk package."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we proposed a method for detecting the occurrence and intensity of Smurf attacks based on the change in self-similarity in network traffic and the normalization of network traffic. Selection of parameters depends on the type of attack. Basic Smurf attack parameters are logged in, guest flat login, etc. We improved the normalization method from the experimental results. Normalization is calibrated by the KDDCUP dataset and our normal campus network traffic. We used support vector engine with KDDCUP dataset and campus network traffic in WEKA and DTREG tools. Our proposed system can detect Smurf attacks in the network with an accuracy of 99.6%."}, {"heading": "6.
