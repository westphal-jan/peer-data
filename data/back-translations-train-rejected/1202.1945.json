INTRODUCTION", "text": "The problem is how to maintain this data and also the extraction of the required knowledge. Data mining techniques can be considered as the result of the natural evaluation of information technology. [12] It is the process of analyzing the observational data that allows you to find further unexpected relationships and summarize the data in a novel way that is both understandable and useful to use the user's data, which is called data mining. [12] It is the achievement of relevant knowledge that allows you to make strategic decisions that allow you to move forward. Techniques used in data mining are more difficult to understand than the general user. [13] A system that performs the process autonomously needs more user interaction by selecting the appropriate attribute. Automated data mining technologies minimize this problem by selecting attributes. It also selects the best data mining technique for extraction."}, {"heading": "3.1 Need of the Approach for the Proposed Framework", "text": "The development of a user-friendly data mining system with intelligent agents through an automated approach is the objective function of this mining technique.

Approach to proposed methodologies5.Intelligence AgencyArtificial intelligence and agent systems have been closely linked for several decades [15] [17] [6] [37]. Artificial intelligence is the study of components intelligence, but agents deal with the integration of these components. Agent is therefore defined as a unit that vaguely uses software that uses artificial intelligence techniques to help a human user of a particular application [11] [30] [8] [27] [33]. According to the definition of agents, agents have the following characteristics: 1. Agents are autonomous: operate without direct control with the user and other agents. 2. Agents are also referred to as social communicators among agents. 3. Agents move themselves towards their defined goal."}, {"heading": "5.1 User Interface Agent", "text": "The user interface agent interacts with the user to help him perform data analysis and data mining activities [35] [10] [15] [24].

[23] [36] The relationship between data mining and visualization process can be explained with few conditions. Data set visualization can be defined as a combination of different methods or user priority over an approach of selecting and specifying the patterns to be displayed.

PROPOSED FRAME WORK FOR AUTOMATED DATA MINING USING INTELLIGENT AGENTS", "text": "From this framework, the automated data mining system receives the necessary data from the given database. In addition to obtaining data from the given database, it also obtains the user information (new or old user). The developed system selects the appropriate data mining techniques, which are provided on the basis of the objective functions. The algorithm considered in this developed system is the partitioning of algorithms. At the same time, if the user has already used the automated data mining system, the results are recorded by the intelligent agent and stored in the database. The end result is also transmitted by the intelligent agent to the next user. This makes the agent technology more user-friendly. Intelligent agents are used in the automated process of attribute selection, ranking process, clustering, cluster detection and visualization. The user interagent is responsible for receiving data from the specified user agent and the specifications."}, {"heading": "6.1 User Interface Agent", "text": "The automated system is executed by navigating and analyzing the user profile [38]. Based on the user behavior with the data mining system and also by locating the (new or existing) user profile, the productive attributes are degraded by the user agent through the data mining agent, where the actual mining process takes place. User identification is based on the selection of data sets such as number of records, number of attributes, data types, etc. The user interface agent analyzes all information related to the user behavior and transfers control to the data mining agent for further processing. 6.2 The data mining agent has two main roles: Clustering and clustering based on the parameters of the user profile agent."}, {"heading": "6.2a Cluster Formations", "text": "Clustering is defined as grouping objects that are similar within the same cluster and dissimilar to objects with other clusters.

In general, the most important difficult task in data mining is to create reports that should be comprehensible to all users. Manually, it is possible to create reports, but it is difficult to justify the report at any time. Under these aspects, an automated system is used to create reports based on cluster literature, regardless of time and data.
