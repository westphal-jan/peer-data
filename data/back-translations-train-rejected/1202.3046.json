An OCR system can be designed for both online and offline purposes. Online OCR systems collect input data by specifying the sequence of steps on an electronic bit pad, and they do the same by capturing the pixel image on a digital scanner. OCR has a wide range of applications covering document transcription, automatic processing of banknotes, faxes, etc. Offline OCR of handwritten words has the entire font."}, {"heading": "2. THE SEGMENTATION PROCESS", "text": "In order to collect data from a handwritten document, a conventional flatbed scanner with a resolution of 300 dpi is used. In the database collected for this study, words were written with a black pen on a simple white sheet of paper, resulting in a clear line with sharp edges. It is assumed that the collected data will be inclination corrected. As already mentioned, the proposed segmentation process consists of several structured modules. In the following subsections, these modules are discussed in detail."}, {"heading": "2.1. Pre-processing", "text": "Several pre-processing steps are performed on the composite raw image before the actual segmentation process begins. First, the scanned image is converted into its corresponding binary equivalence data. Subsequent submodules then attempt to classify the input data."}, {"heading": "2.1.1. Word Segmentation", "text": "The basic goal of this step is to segment each scanned image page into isolated words. A single scanned image can contain several rows of data, and each line subsequently contains several disjointed words. The basic word segmentation algorithm scans the input image horizontally; generates a horizontal pixel density histogram for the input data. Comparing the line-by-line intensity between consecutive lines of the histogram with a predefined threshold k1, individual lines are isolated (Fig. 3a). Each line is then scanned vertically and a vertical pixel density histogram is created. Comparing the column-by-column intensity of the histogram with a predefined threshold k2, word segmentation boundaries are identified (Fig.)."}, {"heading": "2.1.2. Format Analysis", "text": "Each of the isolated words is divided into four horizontal imaginary regions (Fig.4). The selection of these regions is based on the basic characteristics of Bengali writing. Experimental analysis shows that for most words in Bengali writing, character components or modified shapes extend over the headline or below the actual characters are called ascendants. Components that extend across the header are called ascendants, and the character components or modified shapes that lie below the actual character are called descendants. Ascendants are usually located in region-1, while the descendants are generally located in region-4, and the main character body in region-2 and region-3 region-3 region-4Fig.4. Format analysis of a handwritten example wordThe format analysis algorithm splits the entered word data into four equally wide regions. Line segmentation threshold k1 is carefully selected to classify between region-1 and region-4 following each other."}, {"heading": "2.2. Head-line Estimation", "text": "In Bengali writing, the header, which occurs in most characters, is considered the most prominent feature element. Bengali character occurrence statistics confirm that of the twelve most common characters, only one character has no header [4]. Therefore, it is likely that most Bengali words will also have a header. In continuous writing, these characters are often linked by headers and appear as a single component in a word.Correctly identifying this header is an all-encompassing task for character segmentation. Multiple modified shapes often circle the main character and the header. Format analysis of the input word data shows that the probability of occurrence of the header along the boundary of region-1 and region-2. The header estimation algorithm generates a horizontal histogram for the input word data. The maximum pixel density line within region-1 and region-2. This maximum line is greater than the MAX = the overendword (if the MAX is identified as the overendword)."}, {"heading": "2.3. Preliminary Segmentation", "text": "Each word is analyzed with the following characteristics to identify preliminary segmentation points. Table 1 shows the few important features used to calculate segment weighting along the header. If the calculated segment weighting of a point along the header is greater than a predefined threshold \u03b4, the column strip along the header is considered a preliminary segmentation point. Once the preliminary segmentation points are identified, the input image along the header is segmented by vertical stripes depending on their segmentation weighting (Fig. 6)."}, {"heading": "2.3. Component Labeling", "text": "Preliminary segmentation points separate the characters, character components and modified shapes along the header. However, these components often surround each other, making the process of isolating the components more difficult. To isolate each preliminary segment (as shown in Fig. 7), the associated part labeling algorithm [8] is implemented."}, {"heading": "2.4. Segment Classification", "text": "In BengaliProc. of 28th IEEE ACE, pp. 171-174, Dec-2002, Science City, Calcutta. Only a few characters (classified in Fig.8) generate fragmented character components through the preliminary segmentation process. These characters are segmented within these segments. Proper classification and reunification of these components using recognition-based segmentation is another challenging task for the segmentation of handwritten Bengal fonts."}, {"heading": "3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "The proposed algorithm was tested on a sample paper containing 218 ideal segmentation points. Inputs were selected to roughly reflect the diversity of input data. Text segmentation and header estimation modules resulted in 100% successful results on the test data. Example results for preliminary segmentation and final classification are shown in Fig.9. The overall segmentation process has a success rate of 97.7% on the sample data."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper describes several component modules and a system organization for the segmentation process of offline handwritten Bengali writing, and has demonstrated the system's ability to identify the majority of segmentation points of handwritten words. Future research could focus on analyzing a recognition-based segmentation approach by excluding the composite characters available in Bengal writing. Extensive analysis of these composite characters could lead to a general improvement in the process, and future work could include identifying overlapping pen strokes with an improvement of all existing modules."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "The authors thank the \"Center for Microprocessor Application for Training Education and Research,\" the \"Project on Storage Retrieval and Understanding of Video for Multimedia\" and the Faculty of Computer Science and Technology of Jadavpur University for providing infrastructure facilities during the work."}], "references": [{"title": "A Survey of Methods and Strategies in Character Segmentation", "author": ["R.G.
