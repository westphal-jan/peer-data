A refinement is like a bisimulation, except that from the three relational requirements only 'atoms' and 'back' need to be satisfied. Our logic contains a new operator 'forall' in additional to the standard modalities 'Box' for each agent. The operator 'forall' acts as a quantifier over the set of all refinements of a given model. We call it the refinement operator. As a variation on a bisimulation quantifier, it can be seen as a refinement quantifier over a variable not occurring in the formula bound by the operator. The logic combines the simplicity of multi-agent modal logic with some powers of monadic second order quantification. We present a sound and complete axiomatization of multiagent refinement modal logic. We also present an extension of the logic to the modal mu-calculus, and an axiomatization for the single-agent version of this logic. Examples and applications are also discussed: to software verification and design (the set of agents can also be seen as a set of actions), and to dynamic epistemic logic. We further give detailed results on the complexity of satisfiability, and on succinctness.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Feb 2012 09:13:18 GMT  (60kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3538v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 25 Dec 2013 09:29:30 GMT  (71kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3538v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["laura bozzelli", "hans van ditmarsch", "tim french", "james hales", "sophie pinchinat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3538"}, "pdf": {"name": "1202.3538.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Laura Bozzelli", "Hans van Ditmarsch", "Tim French", "James Hales", "Sophie Pinchinat"], "emails": ["laura.bozzelli@fi.upm.es", "hans.van-ditmarsch@loria.fr", "tim@csse.uwa.edu.au", "james@csse.uwa.edu.au", "Sophie.Pinchinat@irisa.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 120 2.35 38v2 [cs.LO] 2 5Table of Contents"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction 2", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2 Technical preliminaries 5", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3 Refinement 8", "text": "3.1 Refinement and its fundamental properties.................. 8 3.2 Game and logical characterization of refinement................... 10 3.3 Refinement as bisimulation plus model limitation................ 13 3.4 Refinement and action models.......................... 15 3.5 Modal specifications plus model refinement........................ 16 \u0445 Informa-tica, Universidad Polite \u0301 cnica de Madrid, Spain, laura.bozzelli @ fi.upm.es \u2020 LORIA, CNRS - Universite \u2012 de Lorraine, France, hans.van-ditmarsch @ loria.fr."}, {"heading": "4 Refinement modal logic 16", "text": "4.1 Syntax and semantics of modal refinement logic............. 16 4.2 Examples..................................... 19 4.3 Refinement quantification is bisimulation quantification plus relativization 21 4.4 Changing refinement relationships......................."}, {"heading": "5 Axiomatization RML 27", "text": "5.1 Solidity.........................................................................................................................................."}, {"heading": "6 Axiomatization RML\u00b5 37", "text": "6.1 Solidity................................................. 39 6.2 Completeness................................................"}, {"heading": "7 Complexity 45", "text": ""}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions and perspectives 56", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The semantics of modal logic uses the concept of \"possible worlds\" between which an actor cannot distinguish.

A refinement is like a bisimulation, except that from the three relational requirements only \u2018atoms\u2019 and \u2018back\u2019 need to be satisfied. Our logic contains a new operator \u2200 in addition to the standard modalities 2 for each agent. The operator \u2200 acts as a quantifier over the set of all refinements of a given model. As a variation on a bisimulation quantifier, this refinement operator or refinement quantifier \u2200 can be seen as quantifying over a variable not occurring in the formula bound by it. The logic combines the simplicity of multi-agent modal logic with some powers of monadic second-order quantification. We present a sound and complete axiomatization of multi-agent refinement modal logic. We also present an extension of the logic to the modal \u03bc-calculus, and an axiomatization for the single-agent version of this logic. Examples and applications are also discussed: to software verification and design (the set of agents can also be seen as a set of actions), and to dynamic epistemic logic.
