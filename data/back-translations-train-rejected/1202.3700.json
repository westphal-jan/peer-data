However, a similar approach can be taken for other network targets, such as achieving a minimum bandwidth or minimizing latency. Similar situations also arise not only in network environments. Generally, any domain in which a set of agents can collaborate on a task in which some subgroups of agents are successful and can accomplish the task while others cannot. Such a domain can be described as a simple game H over the set of agents, with a characteristic function v: 2N \u2192 {0, 1}. We call this game v the base game in which each agent i-N survives only with probability ri and is eliminated with probability 1 \u2212 ri. In other words, since coalition C is formed, each agent i-C only survives with probability ri, the coalition is converted into the coalition."}, {"heading": "5 The Core of Reliability Games", "text": "A natural question is how stability (in terms of strategic behavior) is affected as reliability declines. Although, in general, various effects are possible, we give a coherent answer in terms of convex and simple games. We show that if a simple or convex base game is stable (i.e. has a non-empty core), any reliability extension Hr has a non-empty core. Conversely, if H is not convex, then there is at least one expansion with an empty core. Proof: A game v is convex if and only if each sub-game of v has a non-empty core.

The solution of cooperative games was well studied and solutions were offered for various representations [10, 6, 8] and even for games with uncertain utility [21]. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to take into account arithmetic problems in cooperative games with uncertain rewards due to independent errors. Although calculating the Shapley value in various areas is difficult, several approaches have been proposed [10, 9, 11]. Our sampling approach to approximating the Shapley value [3], however, does not assume a method for calculating the characteristic function of a coalition in polynomic time (as mentioned, for the network reliability game is calculating the value of a coalition # P-hard). We also showed how to calculate the core when the base game has a veto agent and for limited reliability games has important differences between the core and its extension."}], "references": [{"title": "Power indices in spanning connectivity games", "author": ["H.
