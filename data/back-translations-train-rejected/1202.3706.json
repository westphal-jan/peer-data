The matching process uses these values to assign a series of articles to users. For the reasons mentioned above, the aptitude values are not fully specified. As we do not want to restrict the matching process to known reviewer-paper pairs, these must be predicted in some way. We formalize the matching problem as follows: Let us refer to users or reviewers, p-P to articles or papers, and let us know that each user-item pair has a aptitude scale. The summary of all results can be regarded as an aptitude matrix S-RN-M. Only a subset of aptitude criteria is observed, namely those collected by reviewers."}, {"heading": "3.2 Learning Methods", "text": "We have researched a number of learning methods for predicting the suitability of reviewers for essays. Here, we focus on three methods, each of which provides different information for predicting. (D) We use the contents of the submitted essays and archived essays for predicting, but do not use simple language models to represent the predictions of essays and reviewers. (D) Our language model (LM) is based on these, and predicts the suitability without the use of predetermined reviewer preferences; rather, it builds a model in word (feature) that links the distance in that space with suitability. (D)"}, {"heading": "3.3 Matching Objectives", "text": "We articulate several different criteria that can influence the definition of \"good\" matching, and explore various formulations of the optimization problem that can be used to adjust these criteria. We also discuss how these criteria can interact with our learning methods. Of course, one wants to assign the papers submitted to their most suitable critics; of course, this is almost never possible, since some reviewers will be suitable for many more papers than others. In general, limiting the paper load increases the likelihood that certain papers will be assigned to very unsuitable reviewers. This indicates that only assignments with a score srp above a minimum number of points are made. This ensures that each paper is checked by a minimally suitable reviewer, but that it may not be feasible."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results", "text": "We start by describing the data sets used in our experiments. The rest of the section is divided into three parts: the first looks at the score predictions with the different learning models; the second focuses on matching quality and examines the soft constraints on the number of papers summarized per reviewer. Finally, the third part evaluates a transformation of the matching target and shows how the use of a transformed learning target can increase the performance of the transformed matching problem."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data", "text": "The results of the study show that the evaluations we have submitted are not the results of proposals, but the results of proposals made by the applicants themselves. We have used only the top 1000 words for our experiments to evaluate them using TF-IDF papers. (wp) The evaluations of the evaluations range from 0 to 3, with the paper being outside my expertise. (1) The evaluations can be reviewed if necessary; 2 means \"qualify for a review\" and 3 means \"highly qualify for a review.\""}, {"heading": "4.2 Score Predictions", "text": "We are particularly interested in how individual countries behave with regard to training, and we agree that they are capable of creating the best conditions for successful training."}, {"heading": "4.3 Match Quality", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "4.4 Transformed Matching and Learning", "text": "We will now consider a nonlinear transformation of the values reflecting the view that it is much better to assign reference pairs with a suitability of 2 and 3 than pairs with 0 and 1; as discussed above, this can be achieved by allowing \"usefulness\" xrp to be non-linear in terms of the suitability of reference papers srp. We will use \u03b2 = 4,5, which uses the following sigmoid function to effect this nonlinear transformation: \u03c3 (s) = 1 / (1 + exp (\u2212 (s \u2212 1.5) \u03b2))))); here 1,5 is the middle of the valuation range objective. We will use \u03b2 = 4,5, which results in: \u03c3 (0) = 0.001; \u03c3 (1) = 0.095; \u03c3 (2) = 0.90; \u03c3 (3) = 1.0. We will first show how this transformation affects the matching performance without learning without learning without learning; then we will discuss how to integrate the transformation into the learning goal, using the learning goal without using the transformatted results first."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We have developed a framework for assigning paper to reviewers in the context of scientific conferences, in which we can determine high-quality matches using one of several learning methods. Interestingly, page information in the collaborative filtering area is often only perceived as useful in the cold-start state, where few or no values are available. The performance of both the LM and LR, which use verbatim characteristics of reviewers and submitted work, shows that this is not the case in our field. We also investigated the trade-off between the match of quality and the distribution of paper loads, thereby avoiding the need to manually set limits on the burden on the reviewer. Finally, we showed that with the realistic assumption that usefulness is not linear in terms of the suitability of the results, we can discover better matches by using the same nonlinear transformation in the learning activity."}], "references": [{"title": "Formal models for expert finding in enterprise corpora", "author": ["Krisztian Balog", "Leif Azzopardi", "Maarten de Rijke"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 29th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Recommending papers by mining the web.
