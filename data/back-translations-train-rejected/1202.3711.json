In a causal system GC, a (minimal) conditional independence X-Y | Z implies that all causal pathways X-Y or X-Y or common causes of X and Y in GC are nodes in Z. For independent nodes X-Y-Y-Y, neither implies a cause of the other: (X-Y-X-X). Lemma 5 specifies the global structure (skeleton) of the PAG.

A transitive relationship from X to Y is a sequence of nodes [X, Z1,.., ZK, V1,.., Vm, Y], so that we can first introduce the following concept: - Zi \u2212 1, Zi \u2212 1, Zi + 1 | [Ui, Zi + 1], - Vj \u00b2, Vj \u00b2 (Vj + 1, S), with V1 = Vm + 1, Vm + 1, Zi \u2212 1."}, {"heading": "5 Reconstructing the PAG", "text": "In this section, we look at the logical follow-up process itself and provide an efficient anytime algorithm for deriving the PAG."}, {"heading": "5.1 Inference procedure", "text": "A nice feature is that the logical substitution / reduction steps take a particularly simple form: they are only statements that represent a logical disjunction of at most two causal relationships and a possible selection distortion, or a single term for the absence of a causal relationship. In other words, list L always retains the form in Section 3.1. Each step consists of substituting one statement in another followed by a reduction to this standard form. Furthermore, when more information becomes available, statements in the list of three to two or even one term can be simplified.

It leads to a remarkably simple characterization in which all identifiable causal relationships take the form of (inferred) minimal conditional independence, with both alternatives leading to the same conclusion. The resulting logical causal inference has been used in an efficient algorithm that is the first alternative to the augmented FCI algorithms, which are both solid and complete. LoCI algorithms are strikingly simpler than their counterpart in Section 2.3. Although they are not necessarily faster than the totality of complexity we dominate, the fact is that implementation is very simple and elegant."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This research was supported by the VICI grant 639,023,604 from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.
