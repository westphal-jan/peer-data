Economists treat ignorance like a ghostly object: \"You can talk about it, but you don't see it.\" For this concept, computer scientists have specific representations, the empty beliefs, and treat it like an ordinary state of faith. For this reason, the questions about dynamic consistency in decision-making suddenly become reasonable in the event of ignorance. I formalize the sequential consistency criterion by adapting the law of repeated expectation to plausibility measures. Based on Nehring-Doll's characterization [15] of a preference under ignorance by the conditions of independence (I) and continuity (C), I add a new requirement for sequential consistency. The necessary and sufficient condition for a sequentially consistent neural operator to implement this puzzle of uncertainty can be used as a puzzle of the preculium."}], "references": [{"title": "An optimality criterion for decision making under ignorance", "author": ["K.J.
