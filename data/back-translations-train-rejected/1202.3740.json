A result o is Pareto-optimality (PO) when there is no other result o, so that o is at least as preferred for all agents as o or incomparable with o for at least one agent. A result o implies Pareto-optimality (PO) weak Pareto-optimality (WPO). That is, if an alternative is PO, it is also WPO.

We have theoretically shown that POANCD leads rational actors to pareto-optimal agreements. We have also experimentally shown the significant reduction in search efforts and the number of dominance queries each participating actor must answer with the proposed protocol. A great advantage of POANCD is its extensibility to multilateral negotiations. We have presented POANCD for bilateral negotiations, but its extension to multilateral negotiations can be done with minor modifications. However, the negotiation scenarios with cyclical or contradictory preferences must be further investigated, as it can give more than one best possible agreement (BPA) of a node in a negotiation tree. Furthermore, the fairness of the outcome of the negotiation is an important aspect of the proposed use of the negotiation future."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work is partially supported by the ARC Discovery Grant DP110103671."}], "references": [{"title": "CP-nets: A tool for representing and reasoning with conditional ceteris paribus preference statements", "author": ["C.
