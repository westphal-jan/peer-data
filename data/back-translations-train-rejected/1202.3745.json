Parametric structure is composed of conditional probability distributions and utility functions that describe the decision-maker's preferences. Generally, the solution of an influence diagram depends on both types of information. However, we often have accurate knowledge of qualitative information, but only very rough (or inaccurate) estimates of quantitative parameters."}, {"heading": "2 INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS", "text": "An influence diagram is defined by a tuple < X, D, U, G >, where X = {X1,.., Xn} is a set of oval shaped nodes, which are characterized by the random variables that specify the uncertain decision environment, D = {D1,.., Dm} is a set of rectangular shaped nodes, which are characterized by the decision variables that contain the possible decisions that are made in the domain, U = {U1,.,., Ur} are diamond-shaped nodes that represent the preferences of the decision maker, and G is a directed acyclic diagram that contains all possible decisions that are made in the domain, U = {U1,.,., Ur} the any chance variable Xi-X is associated with a conditional probability table (CPT) Pi = (Xi), where (Xi), where (Xi), and (Xi)."}, {"heading": "3 FOUNDATIONS", "text": "Our approach to a qualitative theory of influence diagrams is based on the qualitative decision theory proposed by Wilson [14]. Wilson's theory defines a series of abstract quantities called extended real quantities, which are used to represent qualitative probabilities and utilities. Any extended real quantity is a rational function p / q, where p and q are polynomials, with coefficients in the rationals, which are a very small but unknown quantity, so that the extended real quantities can be used to represent information up to \"precision.\" For example, quantities such as 1 - and 2 can be used for probable and improbable qualitative probabilities and 1 for a high benefit. These quantities can then be combined by standard arithmetic operations between polynomials to calculate expected qualitative utilities, and the resulting utilities are then compared with each other using an overall order to R \u00b2 defined in [14]."}, {"heading": "3.1 ORDER-OF-MAGNITUDE CALCULUS", "text": "Instead of using explicitly extended calculations, we adopt a simpler calculation that allows us to think about the \"magnitude\" of the extended realities = > > > = = > = > = = > = = > = = = > \"magnitude\" of the extended realities [14].

The directed arcs in the OOM-ID represent the same dependencies between the variables as in the standard model.

Lopez and Rodriguez [7] proposed an influence diagram model that relies on random blurred variables to represent inaccurate information. Kikuti et al [6] allow creative probability approaches to represent inaccurate probability information and focus on precise utility values. The work closest to ours is that of Bonet and Pearl [1], which also considers qualitative MDPs and POMDPs on the basis of an order of probabilities and fully ordered tools."}, {"heading": "8 CONCLUSION", "text": "Our proposed influence diagram model is based on an order of magnitude that allows thinking with imprecise probabilities and partially ordered imprecise utility values. We also described a special variable elimination algorithm that performs efficient operations on partially ordered groups of consumer goods to solve this model. We considered a simple elimination algorithm with variable properties. One way to improve it is to efficiently exploit limitations (zero values of uncertainty and utility functions) by, for example, building on the work of [8]. We also plan to investigate other formalities to argue with imprecise information, such as interval-weighted consumer goods and multi-attribute consumer goods that allow for compromise."}], "references": [{"title": "Qualitative MDPs and POMDPs: an order-of-magnitude approximation", "author": ["B.
