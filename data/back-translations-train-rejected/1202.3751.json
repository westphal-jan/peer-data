Sales teams receive project contracts that are executed by the production teams. The problem that both teams have is that they outsource the projects (tasks) to the production teams (resources). The efficiency of the production teams and the workload of the projects is monitored by the management. This problem is reduced to the individual teams that have been well studied in the literature (Bertsekas, 2005). We name the efficiency levels and workloads together as states of tasks and resources. States are usually observed by the individual teams."}, {"heading": "2 Model and Background", "text": "The problem of the dynamic allocation of resources to resources is the selection of a subset from a pool of tasks and resources indexed by each resource.

The values of task holders (buyers) are not negative, while those of resources (sellers) are not positive (essentially it is costs), which constitute the environment of an exchange economy. We follow the definitions of the last section and modify slightly certain notation to address this more general attitude of dynamic mechanism design. Let's allocate at the time t, given the types of payments reported. Although the allocation policy is given by \u03c0, we will show that the allocation decision can be reduced to per-day decisions, which are due to the Markov nature of type development. Once the agents are assigned, their values match Vi perfectly (in the field of play)."}, {"heading": "4 The Generalized Dynamic Pivot Mechanism", "text": "Before introducing the proposed mechanism, let's look at other possible approaches to solving the problem by discussing an attempt to determine the allocation and payment itself. Fixed payment mechanism: A candidate for the above hiring is to select a group of agents and send them fixed payments. Allocation can be made on the basis of the agent's performance history, but it is immediately apparent that this fixed payment mechanism would not be truthful. Since the payment is fixed after selecting an agent, the agents would report a type that would maximize their chance of being selected. Since the allocation is based on the history of performance that is commonly known, agents with better history would take advantage of the system by reporting their type incorrectly. The above mentioned candidate mechanism suggests that in order to achieve an efficient allocation in a dynamic environment, one must consider the expected future development of the types of agents, which would be reflected in the allocation and payment decisions. Moreover, we do not have an interdependent set of values in our two."}, {"heading": "4.1 Stage A: Type Reporting Stage", "text": "In turn t, each agent observes its true type \u03b8i, t, i, N.

For brevity, we will choose a relatively small example, but analyze it in detail. Experimental Setup: Let us analyze the example of Section 1, where we will consider three agents: one project coordinator (task holder / buyer) and two production teams (seller).

An accurate characterisation of the (in) possibilities for the model we are examining would be more desirable. Other directions for future work would be to design mechanisms with additional desirable characteristics in this environment. If the impossibility is correct, then the limits of payment inconsistency and budgetary imbalance must be examined."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank David C.

Let us call the efficiency levels and workloads together as states of the tasks and resources. However, the states are usually observed privately by the individual teams (agents), who are rational and intelligent. They, therefore, might strategically misreport to the controller to increase their net returns. Hence, the problem changes from a completely or partially observable MDP into a dynamic game among the agents. We will consider cases where the solution of the problem involves monetary transfer. Hence, the task owners pay the resources to execute their tasks. A socially efficient mechanism would demand truthfulness and voluntary participation of the agents in this setting. The reporting strategy of the agents and the decision problem of the controller is dynamic since the state of the system is varying with time. In addition, the above problem has two characteristics, namely, interdependent values : the task execution generates values to the task owners that depend on the efficiencies of the assigned resources, and exchange economy: a trade environment where both buyers (task owners) and sellers (resources) are present. An exchange economy is also referred to as a market. The above properties have been investigated separately in literature on dynamic mechanism design. Bergemann and V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki (2010) have proposed an efficient mechanism called the dynamic pivot mechanism, which is a generalization of the Vickrey-ClarkeGroves (VCG) mechanism (Vickery, 1961; Clarke, 1971; Groves, 1973) in a dynamic setting, which also serves to be truthful and efficient.", "startOffset": 209, "endOffset": 1567}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "Athey and Segal (2007) consider a similar setting with an aim to find an efficient mechanism that is budget balanced.", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 23}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "Athey and Segal (2007) consider a similar setting with an aim to find an efficient mechanism that is budget balanced.
