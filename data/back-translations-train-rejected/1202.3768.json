If other types of agents are strategically relevant, our analyses generally look at what agents from their own types can deduce about others, a possibility that only arises when the types are interdependent. Such interdependencies typically arise from the way in which the information of each agent relates to an underlying state of the world. In this case, we can refer to the type of an agent as a signal about that state. Treatment of signals is a central element of theoretical analysis for many classes of multi-agent interactions. Specifically, signals play a central role in formal models of auctions, adjustments, and many other social mechanisms. Canonical theoretical results about these problems take the form of the relationship of properties of signal distributions (e.g., balances) to signal solutions."}, {"heading": "2 Representation of Information Structure", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Bayesian Games", "text": "In a game of incomplete information, at least some agents do not know some strategically relevant aspects of the game. In order to play or predict the outcome of such a game, it is crucial to model which private information agents have these uncertain aspects. In his groundbreaking work, Harsanyi [1967] used types to capture the private information of agents and defined a game in which the payout functions of agents depend on the types of all agents. It is assumed that each agent knows his own type, but not others. Their beliefs about the types of other agents are given by a probability distribution of possible types of other agents that depend on their own type. Harsanyi called this a Bayesian game. The Bayesian game formulation has since become the standard framework for games of incomplete information. The treatment of types in Bayesian games is useful and elegant, but does not take into account the origins of private information. These types of agents may depend on each other, but the structure of their state may depend on each other."}, {"heading": "2.2 Graphical Models", "text": "Probabilistic graphical models [Koller and Friedman, 2009, Pearl, 1988] express a distribution over the states of the world bordered by a product range of random variables. The defining feature of such models is their explicit representation of probable dependence in relation to graph structure.2 Formally speaking, a Bayesian network is a commented directed acyclic graph consisting of: 1. Node {X1,.., Xn} representing n random variables, 2. Directed edges between nodes, where Pa (X) denotes the parents of X: nodes with directed edge to X, and 3. A conditional probability function Pr (Xi | Pa (Xi)). 1Everywhere we adopt notation for discrete probability and finite summaries and ask the reader to recognize that the basic concepts of density and integralities are generalizable. 2See the references for comprehensive and in-depth treatments."}, {"heading": "2.3 Example: Interdependent Values in Auction Games", "text": "To illustrate the use of graphic models to express dependencies in the signal structure, we present Bayesian networks that capture some basic patterns of interdependent values in auction games. Some classic results in auction theory [Krishna, 2010], such as Vickrey's original analysis [Vickrey, 1961], assume independent private values (IPV): that the types of agents (valuations for a good at auction in this environment) are likely to be independent. However, auction theory recognizes that the value of an agent for a good can generally depend on other valuations. For example, the valuation of an expert (e.g. if the good is art or antique furniture) could affect the value of others because it provides evidence of basic common values in authenticity, craftsmanship and other uncertain characteristics of the good. This has direct implications for the bidding strategy in three respects."}, {"heading": "3 The Origin of Signals", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Generated and Interpreted Signals", "text": "The distinction depended on the relation of the signals to a focal variable, v, which we call a variable of interest or result. In some cases, there may be individual result variables for each agent, v1,.., vN. The letter \"v\" evokes the value of variable in our auction example (\u00a7 2.3), but this is only a specific case. Signals generated are often motivated by inaccurate measurements or distortions of a result. The example in Figure 1 (a) is an instance of generated signals in our auction example. A generated signal is characterized by its distribution based on the variable of interest, Pr (s). if signals for each agent are conditional independent given results (or individualized results), we have for all i, Pr (si | vi, s \u2212 i) = Pr (si | vi), which is exactly the information required by the Bayes representation."}, {"heading": "3.2 Independence of Interpretations", "text": "The attribute representation of the state facilitates thinking about dependence between the respective interpretations. The interpretations of the agents i and j are independent, although for all values of \u03c0i and \u03c0j, Pr (\u03c0i, \u03c0j) = Pr (\u03c0i) Pr (\u03c0j). This independence implies that the interpretation of one agent does not provide information about the interpretation of the other: Pr (\u03c0j | \u03c0i) = Pr (\u03c0j). From the Bayes network of Figure 2 (b) we see that predictions are d-separated even without the interpretations associated with them. In view of the graph structure, independence of interpretations implies independence from predictions. However, the reverse is not true, since it is possible to construct scenarios in which predictions prove to be statistically independent, even if interpretations depend on [Hong and Page, 2009]."}, {"heading": "3.3 Correctness of Predictions", "text": "The prediction associated with an interpreted signal is correct if it coincides with the actual result. We can express the accuracy in another random variable, \u03b4, also a function of the underlying state: \u03b4 (\u03c9) = {1 (correct), if \u03c6 (\u03c9) = v (\u03c9), 0 (false) others.The accuracy of an interpreted signal \u03c6 can then be defined as the probability of its underlying B value. We say that two predictions are independently correct if the knowledge that one agent's prediction of the result is correct does not indicate whether the other's prediction is correct.Figure 3 (b) clearly shows that the accuracy depends on predictions (due to the path through v), even if the predictions themselves are independent; this structural dependence confirms another result from Hong and Page [2009]. In the case of binary signals, they show that independent and negative (the probability of correctness is greater than the probability of correctness of the 1 / 2 prediction in the two of their results)."}, {"heading": "4 Signal Structure in Prediction Markets", "text": "The previous section showed that the distinction between generated and interpreted signals consists of qualitatively different belief patterns (e.g. dependence on predictive accuracy) and can therefore have a significant impact on strategic behavior. These distinctions are well understood by Bayean networks, a characteristic that is also mentioned in the example of interdependent values in auctions (\u00a7 2,3), which also illustrates the strategic implications of independence. In this section, we examine another scenario based on a predictive market. We use graphic models to explain the results of Chen et al. [2010], which provides another example of strategic behavior that relies qualitatively on signal dependence."}, {"heading": "5 Qualitative Reasoning", "text": "In fact, the fact is that you are able to hide, in the way that you are able to do, in the way that you are able to do, in the way that you are able to do, in the way that you are able to do, in the way that you are able to do, in the way that you are able to do, in the way that you are able to do, in the way that you are able to do, in the way that you are able to do, in the way that you are able to do, in the way that you are able to do, in the way that you are able to do."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "Graphic models provide a language for describing and arguing about the qualitative structure of a decision or game situation, including the private signals on which agents base their decisions. By explicating the signal pattern, we gain insights into the abstract properties of these games. In this paper, we have identified some of these properties that are directly reflected in the graphic structure. In particular, we have shown how the framework of the signals interpreted by Hong and Page can be recast in terms of distinctions about the graphic structure, arguing that this representation facilitates reflection on their implications. Perspective also captures key distinctions in the strategic analysis of prediction markets and auctions. Qualitative models of auction games that extend the independence of Annex A. Structure with monotonicity relationships capture important patterns of reasoning in these domains and suggest generalizations for known outcomes. Graphic models can also be used to solve cases of incomplete information games."}, {"heading": "A Example: Affiliation with Interpreted Signals", "text": "The groundbreaking paper by Milgrom and Weber [1982] noted several auction theoretical results assuming affiliation: In essence, the higher the signals of an agent are, the more likely are also the signals and values of other agents. We show by way of an example that the affiliation requirements of the interpreted signals can be more flexible than the standard generated signal model. Let it give two bidders and a common value object. The common value, which is designated by v, can assume two possible values, 0 or 1. Prior to bidding, each agent receives a signal si [0, 1}. The common distribution of the signals and value is described as follows.

Specific insights about bidding games in classical auction mechanisms derive from qualitative graphical models.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
