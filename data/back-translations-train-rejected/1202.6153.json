This theory of Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) has made significant contributions to many theoretical, philosophical, and practical AI questions. In a series of papers culminating in book (Hutter, 2005), an exciting sound and complete mathematical model for a super intelligent agent (AIXI) has been developed and rigorously analyzed. While nowadays most AI researchers avoid discussing intelligence, the award-winning PhD thesis (Legg, 2008) provided the philosophical embedding and investigated the UAI-based universal measure of rational intelligence, which is formal, objective and non-anthropocentric. Recently, effective approximations of AIXI have been derived and experimentally investigated in JAIR paper (Veness et al. 2011). This practical breakthrough has resulted in some impressive applications, finally muting earlier critique that UAI is only a theory. For the first time, without providing any domain knowledge, the same agent is able to self-adapt to a diverse range of interactive environments. For instance, AIXI is able to learn from scratch to play TicTacToe, Pacman, Kuhn Poker, and other games by trial and error, without even providing the rules of the games.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2012 09:19:32 GMT  (45kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6153v1", "20 LaTeX pages"]], "COMMENTS": "20 LaTeX pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marcus hutter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.6153"}, "pdf": {"name": "1202.6153.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Marcus Hutter"], "emails": ["RSCS@ANU", "SML@NICTA"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 120 2.61 53v1 [cs.AI] 2These achievements give new hope that the great goal of Artificial General Intelligence is not difficult to attain.

Some facets have already been formalized, some are essentially built in, but the majority must be XI XI XI XI. Some of the assertions have been proven in [Hut05], but the majority has yet to be addressed. Generalization is essentially an inductive inference [RH11] that deals with predicting future observations (often based on models of the learned world) from past observations. Solomonoff's theory of prediction [Sol64, Sol78] is a universally optimal solution to the prediction problem [Hut07, RH11]. Since it is a key term in the AIXI model, it is of course to expect that AIXI is an optimal predictor when predictors are rewarded for weak prediction problems."}, {"heading": "5 Social Questions", "text": "Just think of the beginnings, as if they had been able to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight."}, {"heading": "6 State of the Art", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion", "text": "In this case, it is possible to examine philosophical concepts related to intelligence and to examine them mathematically.

This theory of Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) has made significant contributions to many theoretical, philosophical, and practical AI questions. In a series of papers culminating in book (Hutter, 2005), an exciting sound and complete mathematical model for a super intelligent agent (AIXI) has been developed and rigorously analyzed. While nowadays most AI researchers avoid discussing intelligence, the awardwinning PhD thesis (Legg, 2008) provided the philosophical embedding and investigated the UAI-based universal measure of rational intelligence, which is formal, objective and non-anthropocentric. Recently, effective approximations of AIXI have been derived and experimentally investigated in JAIR paper (Veness et al. 2011). This practical breakthrough has resulted in some impressive applications, finally muting earlier critique that UAI is only a theory. For the first time, without providing any domain knowledge, the same agent is able to self-adapt to a diverse range of interactive environments. For instance, AIXI is able to learn from scratch to play TicTacToe, Pacman, Kuhn Poker, and other games by trial and error, without even providing the rules of the games. These achievements give new hope that the grand goal of Artificial General Intelligence is not elusive. This article provides an informal overview of UAI in context. It attempts to gently introduce a very theoretical, formal, and mathematical subject, and discusses philosophical and technical ingredients, traits of intelligence, some social questions, and the past and future of UAI.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
