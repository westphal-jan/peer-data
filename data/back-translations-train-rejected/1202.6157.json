We model the network as a parallel Gaussian interference channel and we introduce a fully decentralized algorithm (based on trial and error) able to statistically achieve a congiguration where the performance demands are met. Contrary to existing solutions, our algorithm requires only local information and can learn stable and efficient working points by using only one bit feedback. We model the network under two different game theoretical frameworks: normal form and satisfaction form. We show that the converging points correspond to equilibrium points, namely Nash and satisfaction equilibrium. Similarly, we provide sufficient conditions for the algorithm to converge in both formulations. Moreover, we provide analytical results to estimate the algorithm's performance, as a function of the network parameters. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical conclusions.

GAME FORMULATION", "text": "In this section, we will model the scenario presented in Sec 1 in two different formulations: a normal game and a satisfaction form (11) A.

(3) Here, K represents the number of players, A is the common action, that is, A = A1 \u00b7 A2 \u00b7... \u00b7 AK, where Ak = C \u00b7 P and we introduce the usefulness function uk: A \u2192 R defined by: uk (a) = 11 + \u03b2 (PMAX \u2212 pk PMAX + \u03b21 {SINRk}), where it is a design parameter discussed in Sec V.

MAIN RESULTS", "text": "The next two theorems allow us to link this result to the original global design problem (2).Theorem 4: Let's present our results on the basis of the previous analysis (2).Proofs are omitted due to space constraints (2).Based on the game theory formulation in Sec. III and the algorithm properties in Sec. IV we find the following problem: Let N 6 = 4 be the set of NE of G, let \u03b2 > K and let's specify the number of players who are satisfied with the NE-th NE, where Kl is maximized. This theorem states that if \u03b2 > K, then TE changes to a state in which the greatest possible number of players are satisfied and interested in the NE-th NE. \u03b2 represents the interest of a network designer in satisfying the greatest number of players by minimizing network usage. The next two theorems allow us to link this problem to the original global design (2).Theorem:"}, {"heading": "VI. SIMULATION RESULTS", "text": "The purpose of this section is threefold. Firstly, we run simulations to numerically validate the DTMCs introduced in Sec. V. Secondly, we validate the results on more general channel models, then we evaluate the performance of the algorithm in terms of satisfaction and performance used. The first two experiments were performed for two different parameters. The first set consists of: K = 3, C = 4, = 0.02 and 6 \u2264 Q \u2264 10. The second set consists of K = 4, C = 5, = 0.02 and 6 \u2264 Q \u2264 10. In our first experiment, we perform 107 iterations to estimate those in two different channel models: the simple channels expressed in (14) and a Rayleigh channel. The results are summarized in Figure 3, as we can see, the analysis applied to specific channel models proves to be sufficiently accurate."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this thesis, we investigated a problem of power control in a self-configuring decentralized network. We presented a new decentralized algorithm that is capable of steering the network to an operating point where the maximum number of pairs of transmitters achieves a sufficient SINR while minimizing the power consumption of the network. The algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the network and can learn an efficient balance with only one bit of feedback. Assuming a certain channel realization, we analytically estimated the expected performance of the algorithm through a Markov chain description of algorithm behavior. Finally, we have shown through Monte Carlo simulations that the analysis is approximately correct even for general channel models."}, {"heading": "VIII.
