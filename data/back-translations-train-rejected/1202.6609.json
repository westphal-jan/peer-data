INTRODUCTION", "text": "Since the 1960s, the term urban model has generally been related to simplifications and abstractions of real cities, as opposed to its earlier use in ideal cities (Foot, 1981).Today, accurate models can be used, for example, to perform urban simulations (Waddell et al, 2008), to investigate the energy consumption of the city (Jones et al, 2006) or to estimate air quality (Moussiopoulos et al, 2006).Urban models are used by urban planners and designers to explore them before they act."}, {"heading": "1.1 Visualization techniques for data in 3D Virtual Environments", "text": "Enriched 3D city models can be considered as 3D virtual environments (3DVEs), which contain not only geometric elements, but also abstract information. Abstract information is any data that is imperceptible without bringing a visual abstraction into the user's point of view. Visualization techniques for data in 3D virtual environments have been developed together with the development of techniques for 3D virtual environments. They are widely used in simulation environments, video games, tutor systems, etc. Nevertheless, few authors have attempted to classify and compare and evaluate these techniques. Bazargan (2011) has examined the area of abstract information integration in interactive 3DVEs. He emphasized that there are many different approaches in which abstract information can be added to 3D scenes, in order to help the user to perform specific tasks. Elements that should be considered for the description of these methods are the visualization of 1986 - the type of visualization (the data to be visualized by Mackingan), the visualization of the space (the visualization of the product to be visualized in 1996)."}, {"heading": "1.2 Visualization techniques for enriched 3D city models", "text": "Although enriched 3D city models can be considered 3DVEs, they have some peculiarities. In fact, the use of enriched 3D city models for urban decision-making involves tasks performed by the user of such models and for which he / she must navigate in or through the 3D model. Typical tasks are the evaluation of urban projects in terms of the quality of life (including visual aspects), the evaluation of the impact of projects on the urban landscape, and other factors. Such tasks imply the visualization of data coming from different areas such as transport, construction, etc. - they are of different types such as quantitative measurement of noise, qualitative soundscapes,... - take different forms (from structured information systems to unstructured documents)."}, {"heading": "1.3 Visualization ontologies", "text": "The Top Level Visualization Ontology (TLVO) defined by Brodlie et al (2004) aims to provide a common vocabulary to describe visualization data, processes, and products. Building on an analysis of visualization taxonomies and recent work in visualization ontologies, Morell P\u00e9rez et al (2011) propose some modifications to the TLVO to better represent the visualization process and data models. Voigt & Polowinski (2011) aim to develop a unifying ontology applicable in visualization systems. By systematically reviewing existing models and classifications, they found in particular that most visualization knowledge is informally stored in terminologies and taxonomies - and thus does not directly represent the knowledge present in the visualization systems, while it is not sufficient for compatibility."}, {"heading": "2. METHODOLOGY", "text": "The global goal of this research is to develop tools to help virtual city designers integrate the visualization of abstract data. The approach we have chosen is to create a visualization selection framework that includes an ontology of 3D visualization techniques, a knowledge base on the applicability of these techniques, and selection tools based on this knowledge base."}, {"heading": "2.1 Integrated visualization selection framework", "text": "The research methodology we used to create the ontology and the knowledge base consists of the following main phases: - Collection of the most relevant models and taxonomies of 3D visualization techniques described in the literature, then adaptation, extension, etc., of this knowledge to define a conceptualization of 3D visualization techniques for enriched 3D city models; - Formalization of these conceptualizations in the OWL 2 language (OWL Working Group 2009) to obtain an ontology of 3D visualization techniques, which represents the terminology used to describe domain concepts with detailed axioms. - The Ontology editor Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 2005) was used to define the required OWL classes, properties and axioms; - Popularization of ontology based on either formal or informational descriptions of 3D visualization rules, and thus 3D-based visualization techniques, etc."}, {"heading": "2.2 Design principles for an ontology of 3D visualization techniques", "text": "Our ontology of 3D visualization techniques aims to find the relevant visualization techniques (1) for specific urban data and (2) for different data that must be visualized within the same 3D model in order to perform a particular task in a particular context. Therefore, ontology must not only contain a collection of visualization techniques, but also represent their applicability relative to the context and to a task. As expressed in Figure 2, this ontology consists of four modules. The first module refers to the representation of visualization techniques; the second module focuses on the evaluation of these techniques; the third module describes the relationship with a particular 3D model; and the fourth module is dedicated to the representation of the various tasks that a user can perform."}, {"heading": "3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "In this article we focus on the module for the representation of visualization techniques in ontological form."}, {"heading": "3.1 Ontology of visualization techniques", "text": "We describe the main concepts of our ontology of visualization techniques1, in particular the concepts that describe data and visualization techniques."}, {"heading": "Data concept", "text": "A data type is specified by: - a data type that can be, for example, a text, an audio or video element, a scalar, a vector or a combination of these elements; - a data format: jpg, pdf, rdf, xml... - the environmental problem to which it relates: air quality, noise... - the urban objects to which it relates (see Figure 3); - a geolocation in the 3D model that can be related in the form of coordinates, a geoname, an object... A data type is represented in ontology as a concept that relates by properties to the previous elements that defined themselves as concepts (see Figure 3); - a specific data type is represented as an instance of the data concept. Figure 4 gives two examples of the representation (in OWL) of data, a scalar value with a 3D location (left) and a numerical value with a 2D value (right) for a current location (see Figure 1):"}, {"heading": "Visualization_Technique concept", "text": "A visualization technique is characterized by the following elements: Data, a layout technique, a visualization technology, an abstraction, some visual attributes, a reference and examples (Figure 5): \u2022 Data: It is the input to the technique and is converted into an output view based on different criteria of layout manipulation and definition. Any data can be used as input for many visualization techniques. \u2022 Layout technique: The layout technique describes the characteristics of representation. It is specified in terms of: space, shape, location (position and orientation), interaction and scale. It also represents the placement of the visualization abstraction in relation to the object and the virtual environment: whether it is attached to the object, whether it is displayed on the ground or above the user, etc. \u2022 Visualization abstraction. The visualization technology represents an object abstraction before it is displayed on the screen."}, {"heading": "3.2 Usage of the Ontology", "text": "The first query (left) retrieves all the visualization techniques described that are relevant to the visualization of air quality data; the second query (right) retrieves all the visualization techniques described (1) that are relevant to the visualization of numerical air quality data; and (2) a layout technique that is localized in a terrain as a 2D interface. Advanced applications include the Evaluation, Task, and Context modules. For example, in the same localization in the 3D model, we can have three data that relate to the same building: (1) a short text (string type) that describes the name of the building; (2) a set of scalar values that represent air quality; and (3) a set of scalar values that represent noise in the same place. Two data have the same type, so they may be visualized with the same technique."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES", "text": "In this article, we have described a framework for an integrated visualization of the abstract information of enriched 3D city models. Our approach implies the construction of a 3D scene that plays the role of a \"readable document\" for the user. In order for such a \"document\" to be fully understandable and contribute to decision-making processes, relevant visualization techniques must be chosen. Such a choice depends not only on the type of abstract information or data that augment the 3D geometric model, but also on context and task. In order to represent the various 3D visualization techniques associated with the potentially heterogeneous data and information, we have defined an ontology of 3D visualization techniques. Such an approach (1) allows a common description of visualization techniques that can come not only from the urban area, but also from other areas such as 3D video games. (2) provides a formalized description that can be used to automatically select the relevant criteria from the description of the techniques."}, {"heading": "5.
