In this paper, we also model the mind as a place where a circuit grows, starting as a collection of primitive components at birth and then progressively from the bottom up. A new node arises from a simple composition of previous nodes when we go through a repetitive experience that can be described by this composition.

It is also the subject of modern fields such as neuroscience [15] and artificial intelligence [13, 9]. Some of the early studies of psychology and philosophy approach the question by looking at mental phenomena subjectively from the point of view of experiences and perceptions. Others, such as neurobiology or artificial intelligence, approach the subject from the other end by looking at the mind as a neural network [12], where each neuron is a primitive binary circuit. Simplicity theory [4, 5] (and other older works [11]) emphasize the principle of \"simplicity\" in cognition - using the concept of Kolmogorov complexity [8], it shows that several cognitive functions can be understood as composite concepts that can constitute a certain sensory stimulus."}, {"heading": "1.1 Sensations, Emotions and Experience", "text": "In fact, it is a mere red herring."}, {"heading": "2 Repeated experience creates concepts", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to survive themselves without there being a process in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process, and a process."}, {"heading": "3 Concepts grow like circuits hierarchically", "text": "This is only a matter of time before we arrive at a terminology based on a new concept that is remembered. It is then interpreted as a composition of a small number of previous concepts, as if they were very quickly incorporated into the \"fast path.\" Concepts in the slow path are based on a new concept. The circuits or functions underlying these common concepts can be calculated very quickly as if they were in the \"fast path.\" Concepts in the slow path must be evaluated consciously and slowly. Concepts in the fast path are evaluated automatically, without a conscious experience of computation.The concept graph operations can be described as follows: For each new experience from external events, we must evaluate the components consciously and slowly."}, {"heading": "3.1 Emotions", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive on their own are not able to survive on their own, and so are others who are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "4 Experiences as learning an ensemble of func-", "text": "One can compare the formation of concepts with the learning of an ensemble of functions. Let's say there are many functions - and we get certain inputs, pairs of output for each of these functions. Our goal is to learn these functions. In order to distinguish these functions, we will say that these functions have different colors - let's say that the output pairs of the different functions arrive in arbitrary order. A single function can be complex and therefore one cannot learn the function from its examples. But, if these functions form a hierarchy in which the function can be expressed as a simple composition of a few lower functions in the hierarchy, it can be interwoven in arbitrary order. A single function can be complex and therefore one cannot learn the function from its examples."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank Alexander Andoni, Ollie Williams and Aviv Zohar for the insightful discussion."}], "references": [{"title": "The search for simplicity: A fundamental cognitive principle", "author": ["N.
