In their work, the authors present the CF2 semantics as a response to difficulties arising from the semantic handling of odd and even loops through dung semantics. In our paper, we outline our equation theoretical approach to argumentation networks and show how CF2 semantics can be derived from disturbances of the equations associated with the networks. This approach provides additional methodological support for CF2 semantics while at the same time demonstrating the power of the equation theoretical approach. We offer our own loop-busting equation semantics LB, which incorporates CF2 as a special case.

The reason for this is that when we start with a mathematically minimal relative set B, we can replace its elements one by one according to the protocol of LB4 semantics and we never blow up all loops until we replace the last element, because the set is minimally relative.

We saw that the Equational Approach makes us associate a system of equations with any reasoning network.2. Finding a solution to the equations equates to an extension of the reasoning network.3. If a system of the equation is difficult to handle, there is a well-known and widely used methodology in the Equational Area of Perturbations to make it easier. 4. In the reasoning, the odd and even the loops are cited from a problematic side. 5. The counterpart to the loops in the Equational Area of Perturbations is a cycle of variable dependencies in which they are located. 6. Subsequently, they will be able to hide."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "I am grateful to Martin Caminada, Sarah Gaggl and Stefan Woltran for their helpful discussions.
