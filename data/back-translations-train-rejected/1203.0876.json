The success of the commercially available OCR system is not yet extended to handwritten text. It is mainly due to the fact that numerous variations in inscripts inwriting styles of individuals make the recognition of handwritten characters from handwritten characters difficult. Fora specific language, which is based on some alphabets and numbers, are OCR techniques that aim at printed text or handwritten text. Current work aims at the latter.Proc. 2.

Following the training, it is tested whether an MLP classifier can generalize from test data what it has learned from training data. To prepare the training and test sets of samples, a database of 6,000 Bangla digits is created by collecting optically scanned, handwritten samples with 10-digit symbols of 600 people of different ages and genders each. A training set of 4,000 samples and a test set of 2,000 samples is then created. In total, three such pairs of training and test sets are created with the original database for cross-validating the results at the time of the experiment. All samples are scaled to 32x32 pix32 pixel images and then converted into binary images by threshold values. For the present work, a single layer of MLP is formed, i.e. an MLP with a hidden layer of 4000 training samples and hidden samples."}, {"heading": "No of Hidden neurons Percentage recognition rate of the MLP on test samples", "text": "Curves showing a variation in the detection performance of the MLP, for the test samples of the three groups, the hidden intelligence is observed, with the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the MLP increasing so that it can show the optimal detection performance on the test group. Detection performance of the MLP for group # 2, as observed from the curve in Figure # 8, initially increases when the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the MLP is increased and falls after the same limits are exceeded, reflecting the fact that the learning and generalization capabilities of the MLP improve as the number of neurons in its hidden layer increases to certain limits, and any further increase of neurons in the hidden layer."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The authors are grateful to the \"Center for Microprocessor Application for Training Education and Research,\" the \"Project on Storage Retrieval and Understanding of Video for Multimedia\" and the Department of Computer Science and Technology of Jadavpur University for providing infrastructure facilities during construction, and the CVPR unit ISI Kolkata for providing the necessary set of handwritten Bangla numbers.
