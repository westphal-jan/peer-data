Introduction", "text": "The Rex is a dynamic process of collecting, storing, analyzing and utilizing data relating to safety situations (accident or incident). It consists of an analytical examination of various causal factors that play a role in the origin of incidents or accidents. Rex enables a better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to events of uncertainty. Its purpose is to benefit from the lessons of past experience in order to improve the level of safety through the implementation of preventive measures and corrective measures to prevent accidents and incidents. [1] The methods of acquiring knowledge applied to the field of safety analysis have shown an interest in extracting and formalizing historical knowledge about safety situations."}, {"heading": "2.

Types of ontology", "text": "Depending on their use, there are in this case five categories of ontology [11]: generic name, domain, application and presentation of the method: - generic ontology: describes general concepts, regardless of a field or problem. Examples of concepts of time, space and event.- Domain ontology: defines a standpoint on a particular area, using vocabulary that refers to a domain of generic knowledge. - Application ontology: describes the structure of knowledge that is necessary to accomplish a particular task. [11] A domain ontology consists of a description of the extension of the vocabulary domain, a typology and hierarchy, or a grid of classes. - Application ontology: describes the structure of knowledge that is necessary to accomplish a particular task."}, {"heading": "5. Proposed approach", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1. Conceptual Model", "text": "In other words, the more reusable an ontology is, the more it loses its accuracy, and thus its usefulness, and moves away from the application scenario. And an ontology is more specialized the closer it gets to the concerns of an application. [12] Ontology in our context uses two levels of abstraction of knowledge, which we can qualify by knowledge of surfaces and deep knowledge. Surface knowledge is generally defined by what we call a generic ontology, and knowledge is defined by domain ontology. - Generic ontology: An ontology contains generic concepts such as safety: background, components, hazardous, hazardous events, causes of accidents, etc. - A domain ontology: This ontology describes the field of railway safety, in the context of the specific system, the human operator, and the environment. Most of these concepts are epts that are epicenters destined for the use of other elements."}, {"heading": "5.2. Construction of the ontology", "text": "Knowledge engineering in the production of machine-readable ontologies. Responsible for \"modelling ontological\" is the definition of the primitives of representation and meaning used for formal modelling of knowledge, a precursor to formal modelling, that is, representation in formal linguistic domain knowledge. [14] Although there are several construction methods of ontology, we adopted the method of Stanford University, which was implemented with the proprietary publisher. We made our choice on the basis of two arguments described below: 61. Stanford University's method is detailed and promotes the easy development of ontologies for both professionals and beginners; 2. The protector of the ontology publisher is the most widely used; its popularity forced the publishers of other ontologies (OntoStudio) to develop several gins that will execute their ontologies. Protection is more flexible and better ensured by their community because it is an open source software studio (as opposed to the OntoStudio 7.)"}, {"heading": "5.3. Extracting knowledge from the ontology", "text": "The model developed is based on a WEB approach. In fact, a team of German scientists has recently developed a tool for using XML files: where a file extension obtained after the creation of an ontology is an RDF / XML file (actually a file XML file), we have selected this tool for the operation of our ontology.The eXist-DB tool is an open source management database based on XML technology. It enables the use of the RDF file using the supporting XQuery query language. XQuery is a query language for XML files with a syntax very similar to the SQL language. Fig.8. presents the functional architecture of the developed model, which focuses on three main tasks: acquiring, archiving and consulting in the event of an accident; Fig. 9. presents the steps to acquire a case. This is the first module of the system in which the user accesses experts."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "The treatment of an accident scenario requires several important phases: an acquisition phase, a modelling phase, a phase of capitalization and an operational phase. To date, and to our knowledge, there are no formal and systematic approaches to the use of knowledge related to accident scenarios. Research is generally limited to the phases of capitalization in the operational phase, especially in the context of rail transport, and is generally limited to a purely statistical phase. In order to improve and exploit this Rex process, it is essential to develop a formalism of knowledge representation that is best suited and most semantic to prepare the ground for the next phase of operations and to formulate and identify recommendations that can assist experts in their task of certification and accreditation."}], "references": [{"title": "Contribution of case based reasoning (CBR) in the exploitation of return of experience. \u201cApplication to accident scenarii in rail transport", "author": ["A Maalel", "H Hadj-Mabrouk"], "venue": "SIIE'2010, 3rd International Conference on Information Systems and Economic Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Apprentissage automatique et acquisition des connaissances : deux approches compl\u00e9mentaires pour les syst\u00e8mes \u00e0 base de connaissances", "author": ["H.
