INTRODUCTION", "text": "Myanmar is an agglutinative language with a very productive inflationary system, which means that for any NLP application in Myanmar to succeed, some degree of functional analysis is required. Without it, the development of grammatical relationships would not be feasible due to the sparse data problem tied to Myanmar in order to exist in the training data. It is the process of analyzing an input sequence to determine its grammatical structure in relation to a particular grammar. Grammar relationships operate at word level with the assumption that input sentences are tagged and chunk in Myanmar. The natural language processing community is in a strong position to have many available approaches to solving some of its most basic problems [1]. We have taken Myanmar language for information processing. They use two components. They are function markers and grammatical relationships. Function markers are useful for any application that tries to follow the thread of the text - find \"who does what of each sentence.\""}, {"heading": "2.

Features of Myanmar Language", "text": "Unlike the English language, Myanmar is a syntax of relatively free phraseology, which is easily illustrated by the example in Table 1. All are valid sentences [12]. In all cases, the subject is: \"He,\" \"Object\" is \"Book,\" \"Place\" is \"(Places), and the verb\" (Places). From the above example, it is clear that the phrase order does not determine the functional structure of Myanmar's language and allows for cramping. Myanmar language follows subject-object-verb commands in contradiction to the English language."}, {"heading": "3.2.

Syntacic Structure of Myanmar Language", "text": "It is well known that many postal positions can be used in a sentence from Myanmar. If the words in a sentence can be misplaced, the sentence can be abnormal. There are two types of sentences as a sentence construction: simple sentences (SS) and complex sentences (CS). In the simple sentence, additional sentences such as object, time and place can be added between subject and verb. In a complex sentence, there are two types of clauses called Independent clause (IC) and Dependent clause (DC). In a sentence, there must be at least one independent clause, but there may be more than one dependent clause in it. IC contains the last particle (sfp) at the end of a sentence [15]. SS = IC + sfp CS = DC... + IC + sfpIC + sfpIC + sfpIC can contain a noun phrase or a verb or a combination of both."}, {"heading": "4. PROPOSED SYSTEM", "text": "Step 1.

CORPUS CREATION", "text": "We have collected several types of Myanmar texts to construct a corpus. Our corpus is to be built manually. We have expanded the POS-marked corpus proposed in [3]. Chunk and function marks are added manually to the POS-marked corpus. The number of sentences is about 3000 sentences with an average word length of 15 and it is not a balanced corpus that is somewhat distorted in Myanmar middle school textbooks. Corpus size is always larger because the tested sentences are automatically added to the corpus. In Table 2, Myanmar grammar books and websites are text collections. Exemplary corpus sentences are shown in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "6. FUNCTION TAGSET", "text": "Function markers are a process of assigning syntactic categories such as subject, object, time and place to each word in the text document. They are conceptually responsive by encoding an event in the format \"Who has what with whom, where, when,\" which provides useful semantic information about the sentences.

NAIVE BAYESIAN CLASSSIFIER", "text": "Before you can build a na\u00efve Bayesian classifier, you must collect training data, which is a series of problem cases. Each instance consists of values for each of the defined features of the underlying model and class, i.e., in our case, functional data. Developing a na\u00efve Bayesian classifier involves learning how much to trust each functional sign for the decisions it makes [17]. In the probability estimate for na\u00efve Bayesian classifiers, namely, that the attribute values are conditionally independent when the target value is given. Naive Bayesian classifiers are well attuned to the functional marking problem. The na\u00efve Bayesian classifier is a term in Bayesian statistics that deals with a simple probabilistic classifier based on the application of Bayes' theorem with strong (na\u00efve) assumptions of independence. It requires independence between input features. Therefore, its target class can be found by selecting an input with the highest probability."}, {"heading": "8.1.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we examine the function name of the word depending on the sentence structure of the Myanmar language. We used the naive Bayesian technique for assigning function names. We use context-free grammar for the grammatical relationships of the function names. The parse tree can be built up by using function names. Since function names are a pre-processing step for grammatical relations, the errors that occurred in the task of the function name affect the relationships of the words. The corpus can be balanced because the naive Bayesian frame probability simply describes uncertainty. In this work, we have considered a limited number of Myanmar sentences to create the grammar for the English translation system and we expect that the corpus will be continuously expanded in the future because the tested sentence can be inserted into the corpus. In this work, we have considered a limited number of Myanmar sentences in order to construct the grammatical phrases as we can construct future sentences as well as some other grammatical phrases may be limited in the language as we need to construct for some future sentences."}], "references": [{"title": "Function tagging", "author": ["Don Blaheta"], "venue": "Ph.D. Dissertation,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Assigning automatically Part-of-Speech tags to build tagged corpus for Myanmar language", "author": ["Phyu Hnin Myint"], "venue": "The Fifth Conference on Parallel Soft Computing,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Chunk Tagged Corpus Creation for Myanmar Language", "author": ["Phyu Hnin Myint"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the ninth International Conference on Computer Applications,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Statistical parsing with a context-free grammar and word statistics", "author": ["Eugene Charniak"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Fourteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 1997}, {"title": "Three generative, lexicalized models for statistical parsing", "author": ["Michael Collins"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 35th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 1997}, {"title": "Assigning function tags to parsed text", "author": ["Don Blaheta", "Mark Johnson"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Meeting of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2000}, {"title": "Naive Bayes and Decision Trees for Function Tagging", "author": ["Mihai Lintean", "Vasile Rus"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the International Conference of the Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society (FLAIRS)", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Korean Syntactic Analysis using Dependency Rules and Segmentation ", "author": ["Yong-uk Park", "Hyuk-chul Kwon"], "venue": "Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Advanced Language Processing and Web Information Technology(ALPIT2008),", "citeRegEx": "9", "shortCiteRegEx": "9", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Parsing Non-Recursive Context-Free Grammars", "author": ["Mark-Jan Nederhof", "Giorgio Satta"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL ANNUAL'02),", "citeRegEx": "10", "shortCiteRegEx": "10", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Are Efficient Natural Language Parsers Robust?", "author": ["Kyongho Min", "William H.
