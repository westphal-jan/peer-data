MASPAR System Limits", "text": "The biggest disadvantage of such a system is the time it takes for agents to communicate and interact with each other. 4 \u00e8me atelier international sur l'amazighe et les TICOne could also note that the MASPAR system does not detect errors in conjugation and also has a non-ergonomic user interface."}, {"heading": "3. Proposed System", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. General Description", "text": "Our system (Figure 1) is designed to detect errors in spelling, structure and conjugation in a non-vowelized Arabic text. It consists of five phases, each of which uses the information obtained from the previous phase to finally obtain a text that contains the least number of errors. The segmentation phase consists of dividing the text into sentences and then words. The lexical phase then receives the word and verifies its existence in the word database. After verifying that this word belongs to the language, the phase label associates the word it has received with the possible morphic syntactic terms, making the word ambiguous, thus assigning that word the most appropriate designation when applying certain rules. To correct the word \"Wc,\" we need to ambiguity it with the database of words we have, hence the need to eliminate this ambiguity by assigning the most appropriate designation to that word."}, {"heading": "3.2. Detailed Description", "text": "This phase begins with the identification of the text \"sentences based on punctuation marks then on the words in each sentence. Subsequently, the words in each sentence are sent one by one into the lexical phase.This will verify whether the word belongs to the language or not by verifying its existence in our word database. Afterwards, the word is sent to the next phase. The phase name is responsible for providing possible morphic syntactical properties of each word received (from the lexical phase).This means that a word cannot go into the naming phase unless its affiliation to our database has been within the lexical phase.Because each word can have multiple names, the analysis of the word can have a certain ambiguity (from the lexical phase).That is why we need to use rules to reduce this ambiguity of the database."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. Segmentation", "text": "This phase consists in dividing the text into sentences and sentences into words based on markers at the beginning and end, such as dots, semicolons, colons..."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Lexical Analysis", "text": "At this stage, the affiliation of each word to the language obtained from the segmentation phase based on the available word database is checked. Check the existence of the database in the lexicon: We need to make sure that the introduced words represent the basics of the Arabic language. Therefore, we check the existence of the database in the lexicon. We need to consult the database of Arabic words if the extracted database matches a word from the database; we conclude that the word exists in Arabic."}, {"heading": "3.2.3. Labelling", "text": "This operation aims to add linguistic information of morphological or syntactic character to the words in order to identify them. We have presented several possible terms for the word minimum (prefix + base + suffix): However, the lack of vocalization does not exactly determine the correct label of the word, which causes a certain ambiguity. To reduce this ambiguity, we proceed to the next step."}, {"heading": "3.2.4. Disambiguation", "text": "Compatibility rules: You can reduce the ambiguity of a word by associating it with one type each, so that the sentence containing the ambiguous word has more than one structure based on the number of names of that word. Subsequently, the system associates the word with the type that is suitable according to the structural rules."}, {"heading": "3.2.5. Detecting faults", "text": "For the detection of errors, we can use rules of grammar. These rules describe correct grammatical patterns. Therefore, we have defined a basic structure rules and a different basis for the conjugation rules. If a text does not correspond to a rule, a structural or conjugal error is detected. To detect structural errors, we will compare the structure of our sentences with the basic structural rules, if this structure does not correspond to a rule, then a lack of structure will be detected if the structure is correct and contains a verb, since the combination applies only to the verb, our system will have access to our database conjugation."}, {"heading": "4.1. Experiments", "text": "Our experiments on the system refer to texts of Arabic literature in various fields. - > We introduced those related to medicine, marketing, economics and Arabic grammar.

Results and interpretations:", "text": "We find that our system has a good detection of spelling and structural errors (indicator accuracy = 1 for detecting spelling errors and 0.75 for structures). In fact, we get a quick response if the word entered is wrong or the structure is wrong. We therefore have a very high percentage of errors actually detected. We can also determine the good accuracy of the wrong word or the wrong structure, which facilitates the colouring of errors. We can also find that our system has an average detection for errors in conjugation (indicator accuracy = 0.56).This is for several reasons: 4 \u00e8me atelier international sur l'amazighe et les TIC020406080100Errors detection of orrors Detection of spelling errors Detection of structural correction detection of conjugation errors. Detection of conjugation errors Let us first detect the difficulty of the Arabic language, especially with regard to the current conjugation system, and then only conjugate there."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion and Perspectives", "text": "We are interested in this work to develop an application to detect errors in spelling, structure and conjugation in Arabic text. The development of this project has allowed us to become familiar with Java, a language in the promising field of programming technologies. It has allowed us to consolidate our knowledge of various techniques, including manipulation of XML. The work we have done is a response to the objectives set at the beginning of the project. However, it can develop by incorporating several extension elements. We can consider adding suggestions for the wrong words to improve the performance of our system. We can also add more functionality to our tool, such as translating the input text from one language to another according to the user's choice. We can also handle the case semantics and textual vowels."}, {"heading": "6. Bibliographie", "text": "Aloulou C., Belguith H., Hadj Kacem A., and Hamami M.
