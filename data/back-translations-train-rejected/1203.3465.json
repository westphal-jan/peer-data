Using the product form of conditioning, we obtain a possibilistic network that is close to probabilistic and has the same theoretical and practical results. However, this is not the case with min-based networks. In this paper, we are interested in the inference problem in multiplied networked networks, which is known as a hard problem (Cooper, 1990). Specifically, we propose three compilation methods for min-based possibilistic networks. Composition of Bayesian networks is always considered an important area."}, {"heading": "2 BASIC CONCEPTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 POSSIBILITY THEORY", "text": "This subsection briefly reminds us of some elements of the theory of possibility, to which we refer for further details (Dubois and Prade, 1988). Let us let V = {X1, X2,..., XN} be a series of variables. By DXi = {x1,.., xn} we denote the domain associated with the variable Xi. By xi we denote every instance of the discourse, that is the Cartesian product of all the variable domains in V. Each element is denoted as a state of change. The concept of the distribution of possibility, which is denoted by \u03c0, is an assignment from the discourse universe to the interpretation of unity [0, 1]. Two interpretations can be assigned to this measure, a quantitative one if values have a real meaning and a qualitative one if values reflect only an order between the different states of the world. This paper focuses on the qualitative interpretation of the theory of possibility."}, {"heading": "2.2 POSSIBILISTIC LOGIC", "text": "A possibilistic logic (Dubois et al., 1994) treats qualitative uncertainty in a logical setting. A possibilistic logic formula is a pair (p, a) in which p is a propositional formula and its degree of uncertainty, which estimates to what extent it is certain that p is true. The higher the weight, the safer the formula. A possibilistic knowledge base \u03a3 is composed of a finite set of weighted formulas, i.e., \u03a3 = {(pi, ai), i = 1,.., n} (2), where ai is the lower limit of N (pi). Each possibilistic knowledge base induces a unique distribution of possibilities, in such a way that both formulas are indifferent (pi, ai)."}, {"heading": "2.3 POSSIBILISTIC NETWORKS", "text": "A min-based possibilistic network over a series of variables V, denoted by \u0421Gmin, consists of: - a graphical component that is a DAG (DirectedAcyclic Graph) in which nodes represent variables and edges, encoding the connections between the variables. The parent of a node Xi is denoted by Ui = {Ui1, Ui2,..., Uim}. For each ui of Ui we have ui = {ui1, ui2,..., uim} where m is the number of parents of Xi. In the following, we use xi, ui, uij to denote possible cases of Xi, Ui and Xi respectively - a numerical component quantifying different linkages. For each root node Xi (Ui = \u2205) uncertainty is represented by the a-priori possibility degree (xi) of each instance xi-DXi, so that maxxivalent (xi) = 1. For the rest of the uncertainty Xi (Umin = the condition) condition becomes the condition 1 (condition)."}, {"heading": "2.4 COMPILATION CONCEPTS", "text": "A target compilation language is a class of formulas that can be traced for a series of transformations and queries. Compilation languages are compared in terms of their spatial efficiency on the basis of conciseness criteria, and also in terms of the set of logical queries and transformations that they support in polynomial time (see (Darwiche and Marquis, 2002), for further details. Within the most effective target compilation languages, we cite the Decomposable Negation Normal Form (DNNF) (Darwiche, 2001). This language is universal and presents a set of properties (determinism, smoothness, etc.) that make it of great interest. It supports a rich set of polynomial-temporal logical operations. To define DNNF, the starting point is the Negation Normal Form (NNF), which represents a set of propository formulas where possible connective connections are connections, disformations and negations. A set of properties NNtimes cannot be conjunctions (that conjunctions are not conjunctions)."}, {"heading": "3 POSSIBILISTIC ADAPTATIONS", "text": "In this section, we will first propose an adaptation of the arithmetic circuit method of (Darwiche, 2003), then we will study one of its variants proposed in (Wachter and Haenni, 2007), namely the logical compilation of Bayesian Networks.DNNF was introduced for the pronunciation of words.

In the case of DNNF-PKB, the number of additional variables corresponds to the number of weights that are different. Although, in the case of VP-DNNFPF, variables are both those associated with the degree of possibility of each distribution and those that refer to the instances of the variables. The number of clauses for each method is related to the CNF encoding itself. Figure 4 shows the results of these experiments. Each approach is characterized by a curve for the average number of variables and a curve for the average number of clauses. It is clear that the higher the number of nodes considered in the possible network, the higher the number of variables and clauses is. Figure 4 shows that DNNF-PKB has the lower number of variables and clauses than in comparison with VP-DNNFPF, which confirms the theoretical results described above."}, {"heading": "5.2 DNNF PARAMETERS", "text": "Once we have obtained the CNF encodings, it is important to compare the number of nodes and edges for each compiled base. Figure 5 represents the average size of the compiled bases for the two methods in terms of the number of nodes and edges. We note that the number of nodes and edges strongly depends on the CNF parameters. Specifically, the number of nodes and edges in DNNF-PKB is considered narrow compared to HDNNFPF-DNNFPF. This can be explained by the lower number of variables and clauses about CNFs and the local structure that shrinks the size of the compiled bases. Comparing DNNF-PKB with HNF-DNNFPF, the behavior of DNNF-PKB is important."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "This work proposes algorithms that ensure conclusions about possible networks by means of compilation techniques. First, we have proposed possible adaptations of two probabilistic methods based on compilation, namely \u0430-DNNFPF and \u0430-DNNF. Then, we have developed a new method of possible inference DNNF-PKB, which is based on a transformation phase from a possible network into a compiled possible knowledge base. We have shown theoretically that DNNF-PKB and \u0430-DNNF share the same number of variables and clauses, even though they are based on different calculations in their inference process, since the first is based on degrees of need and the second on degrees of possibility. Furthermore, we have shown that DNNF-PKB is more compact than the entire DNNFPF, proving the importance of the possible attitude towards the probable environment. All these results have been confirmed by experimental results. Future work will consist of using these algorithms with the known algorithm of multiconnecting results (another 2000)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank the anonymous reviewers for many interesting comments and suggestions.
