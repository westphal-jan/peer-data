Although many equivalent definitions have already been proposed (Lifschitz, 2008), the study of alternative definitions often leads to new insights. In particular, as we will see in the next section, our possible approach to ASP will then of course be generalized to PASP.The core of our idea is to translate a normal program to a set of limitations on possible distributions. The least specific possibility distributions compatible with these limitations will then correspond to the program's replies. For example, a fact of the form \"a0 \u2190\" expresses the constraint that only interpretations in those \"a0\" should be possible. The rule \"a0\" implies the constraint N (>) in which N (>) applies, i.e. it is necessarily the case that a0."}, {"heading": "4 Semantics of possibilistic ASP", "text": "This semantics can easily be extended to the case of PASP.

Intuitively, the certitude of the head a0 can depend both on the certitude that the body is true, and on the certitude that the rule is actually valid. The former certitude can be calculated as for normal rules and is given by the right side of the (5), the latter certitude is explicitly asserted that the necessity of a conjunctive statement corresponds to the minimum of the necessities of its conjunctions."}, {"heading": "5 Possibilistic reduct", "text": "In this section, we close this gap by introducing a generalization of the answers of the Gelfond-Lifschitz group, which leads to a purely syntactical approach to the search for possible answers.

Within this semantics, the rules of a classical normal program set a series of limitations of possibility distributions; the classical response theories then correspond to the least specific possibility distributions that meet these limitations and adhere to some general limitations; we then extended this idea to the possible ASP. The central observation was that the certainty of the conclusion of a rule should be given by the certainty that both the rule body and the rule itself are valid; and we have introduced a syntactical reduction that corresponds exactly to the proposed semantics for PASP. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we have shown how possible normal programs can be simulated by classical normal programs."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their useful comments, especially for pointing out the connection between our work and residual logic programs."}], "references": [{"title": "Probabilistic reasoning with answer sets", "author": ["C.
