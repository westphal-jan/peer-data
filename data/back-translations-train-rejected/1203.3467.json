Whenever a variable X is binary, we call its states x and x. Consider the influence chart in Figure 1 [Seyller, 2008]; in this case, there are no explicit decisions in the model. DM owns an oil field and believes that the amount of oil (A) is independent of the price of oil (O), but the price of gold (G) and the price of oil are dependent. Utility node U explicitly indicates that it will reap profits from oil production as determined by the price of oil and the amount of oil. We will discuss later why the DMmight care about the price of gold, even though it currently does not add value."}, {"heading": "2.2 Arithmetic and Decision Circuits", "text": "There is an indicator representing each possible instantiation x of each network variable X.

He refers to the variation of a parameter and the calculation of the specific equivalent of a fixed strategy as open loop analysis; if the strategy is allowed to vary by re-evaluating the decision situation, it is a closed loop analysis. Closed loop results require a re-evaluation of the influence diagram, which can be done as efficiently as possible using decision circuits. Nevertheless, open loop DM results can provide important insights using information already computed in the original circuit. Preparations in sensitivity analysis in influence diagrams include different parameters such as conditional probabilities and finding intervals over which the current strategy remains optimal [Nielsen and Jensen, 2003; Bhattacharjya and Shachter, 2008]."}, {"heading": "2.4 The Value of Perfect Hedging", "text": "Seyller [2008] writes,... \"in the late 17th century Japan, in Dojima, near Osaka, a futures market for rice was developed... It was the first recorded case in which such a market was created.\" Seyller defines the value of hedging from a decision-analytical perspective, and it is this approach that we use in this paper. In a decision situation, hedging occurs through a deal that is already relevant to us. Suppose we have a coin toss deal in which we receive $50 for heads or $50 for tails. Now, consider another deal in which the payouts are reversed, i.e. we pay for heads and receive for tails. If we believe that heads and tails are equally likely, then these two deals have identical value when viewed separately. In addition, we are a negative certain equivalent for both transactions."}, {"heading": "3 COMPARING STRATEGIES", "text": "Decision circuits contain indicators like \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" \"s\" s \"s\" s \"\" s \"s\" \"s\" s \"s\" \"s\" \"s\" s \"s\" \"\" \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" \"\" s \"s\" \"\" s \"\" s \"\" \"s\" \"\" \"\" s \"\" \"\" \"\" s \"\" \"\" \"s\" s \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" s \"\" \"\" \"\" (s \"s\" (s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"(s\") \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" (s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" \"s\" s \"\" \"\" s \"s\" \"\" s \"\" s \"\" \"\" \"\" s \"\" \"\" \"s\" \"\" \"\" \"\" s \"s\" \"\" \"s\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" s \"\" \"\" \"\" \"s\" \"\" \"\" \"s\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"s\" \"\" \"s\" \"\" \"\" \"\" s \"s\" \"\" \"\" \"s\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" s \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\""}, {"heading": "4 SENSITIVITY TO RISK AVERSION", "text": "It is often difficult to assess the utility function of the DM, and therefore sensitivity analysis is an instructive method to understand the impact of the risk problem on the optimal strategy and CE. Local risk aversion for the benefit function u (.) is a measure of the risk problem of the DM at a certain dollar value and is in this case also defined as global risk aversion (i.e. it does not depend on v) and is referred to as such. For small decision problems, CE is typically used against the multiple evaluation of the decision problem. Sensitivity to risk aversion is also global risk aversion (i.e. it does not depend on v) and is referred to as such. We will focus our attention on this important specific case. CE is typically directed against the multiple evaluation of the benefit problem. Sensitivity to risk aversion for major decision problems is primarily due to two reasons: 1) A change in the utility function alters all designs."}, {"heading": "5 THE VALUE OF PERFECT HEDGING", "text": "The value of perfect hedging (VoPH), previously reviewed in Section 2.4, is a compelling new technique for assessing the decision situation. It supports a proactive DM in assessing the value of other transactions that are relevant to the current decision situation and can offset \"risks\" from the existing distribution of value creation. Although the VoPH is a useful concept, the calculation can be extremely challenging. By Lemma 4, Note that finding the perfect hedge and the VoPH entails solving a difficult nonlinear optimization problem, since the CEPH is a nonlinear function of hedging. Seyller [2008] employs an exhaustive search method by sampling several possible values of perfect hedging. The topic in this paper is to avoid a reassessment of the decision situation for calculations; through the theorems in this section we show that there is a very efficient way to calculate the VoPH using partial derivative information."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Sensitivity analysis is critical to decision analysis, helping the DM to consider the value of further information gathering and the benefits of greater parameter precision. In this paper, we presented three sensitivity analysis methods that can be easily applied within decision-making circuits and do not require a re-evaluation of the decision situation, making them easily accessible to potentially major decision-making problems. We showed how a DM should examine the impact of switching to a different policy or more flexible solution, as well as find agreements that can effectively safeguard its current portfolio. We showed that DMs can draw valuable insights from the partially derived information available in decision-making circuits."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Thomas Seyller, Le'a Deleris and three anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback."}], "references": [{"title": "The theory of risk aversion, In Aspects of the Theory of Risk-Bearing, Lecture 2, Yrjo Jahnssonin Saatio: Helsinki", "author": ["K.J.
