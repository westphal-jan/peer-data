The definition of the marginalization of mixed potentials is applied to discrete non-association of multiplications and addition in the definition of the combination of potentials and utility potentials.Variables and states concern us with a finite set of variables and utility potentials.

We will say that f is a k-piece (without the 0 parts) and n-degree (assuming ani is 6 = 0 for some i) MOP functions. The main motivation for defining MOP functions is that such functions are easy to integrate in a closed form and that they are closed under multiplication and integration.

Two main problems in solving hybrid IDs are the marginalization of continuous random variables and the marginalization of continuous decision variables. For decision problems that do not involve divisions, one solution is to approximate PDFs with MOP functions. MOP functions are closed by multiplication, addition, integration and differentiation; they are not closed by divisions. MOP approximations could be used to mitigate the problems associated with the marginalization of continuous and decision variables."}], "references": [{"title": "R\u0131\u0301os.
