It is the dataset of the OAEI1 conference track and consists of several ontologies that model the domain of academic conferences. The ontologies were designed by different groups and therefore reflect different conceptualizations of the same domain. Reference alignments (gold standard alignments) for seven of these ontologies are provided by the organizers. These 21 alignments contain correspondences between concepts and properties, including a large number of non-trivial cases. Of the 7 reference alignments, we chose the EKAW (77 concepts), SIGKDD (49 concepts), ConfTool (38 concepts) and CMT (36 concepts) ontologies. The signature and formulas of the MLN are identical to those introduced in Example 2.1."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "The presented column generation algorithm is tailored to the problem and is particularly efficient for cases where (a) a priori weights are given for soil atoms or (b) it is a priori known that the number of active soil atoms in a MAP state is small in relation to the number of all soil atoms of hidden predicates. Typical instances are one-to-one and functional alignment problems. The approach is also suitable for distributed computing strategies as the individual substance problems are independent of each other. We will try to use existing software platforms for distributed calculations to implement distributed probability calculations. The presented algorithm can also be converted into an approximate inference algorithm by adapting the optimization problems."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Many thanks to Christian Meilicke, Sebastian Riedel and Heiner Stuckenschmidt for helpful discussions and to the anonymous reviewers for valuable feedback."}], "references": [{"title": "Ontology matching", "author": ["J.
