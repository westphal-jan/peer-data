Our long-term goal is to improve the usefulness of these devices by enabling them to perceive their environment and actively assist their users. We work with a multidisciplinary group that studies the use of roller walkers. We have access to a roller equipped with various sensors and cameras to monitor the user. We develop automated techniques to detect the activities of their users (e.g. walking, standing, turning, etc.) This problem is significant for kinesiologists who study the use of roller blades."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "In [1] Alwan et al. describe a method for assessing basic gait characteristics supported by the roller, including heel strokes, toe-off events, as well as step time, double support, and individual support phases to the right and left. These statistics are based on measuring the weight transfer between the user and the roller through two load cells in the handles of the roller. This work focuses on low gait statistics, where we are interested in recognizing complex behaviors at a high level. Hirata et al. [3] instructed a roller with sensors and actuators. They detect three user states: walking, stopping, and emergency (including falls). These states are derived based on the distance between the user and the roller (measured by a laser rangefinder) and the speed of the roller."}, {"heading": "3 Experimental Setup", "text": "We have access to a roller developed by Tung et al. [9]. An image of the roller can be seen in Fig. 2. The roller is equipped with various sensors, including a 3-D accelerometer in the seat, a load cell in each leg, and a wheel encoder that measures wheel displacement. Sensor values vary from 0 to 216 \u2212 1. Data is transmitted via Bluetooth to a PDA for detection at 50 Hz. In addition to these sensors, two cameras are located on the roller, one facing backwards and providing the video feed of the user's legs, the other facing forward and providing the video feed of the environment. The video frame rate is approximately 30 frames / second. To collect data for our models, we have designed and implemented two exhibits, which are described below:"}, {"heading": "3.1 Experiment 1", "text": "17 healthy young subjects (aged between 19 and 53 years) were asked to complete the course shown in Figure 1 twice with the roller. Participants \"behaviours are shown in Table 1."}, {"heading": "3.2 Experiment 2", "text": "In a second experiment, we asked 8 regular Rollator users (ages 84 to 97) to follow the course shown in Figure 3. This experiment was conducted in the Village of Winston Park (retirement community in Kitchener, Ontario) and the participants were residents of this facility. In addition, we asked 12 adults (ages 80 to 89) who do not live in a retirement community and are not regular Rollator users to follow the same course. Behaviors shown during this experiment include those shown in Tables 1 and 2."}, {"heading": "3.3 Recognizing Behaviours", "text": "We expect people's behavior to be based on the non-video sensors.1 Since the accelerometers, load cells and wheel encoders only indirectly measure the person's activities, it is not obvious which activities can be easily detected. We formulated the following hypotheses. However, the use of video data is the subject of future work. The person should be easy to predict as there is no load on the roller and the roller does not move. Standing (ST) should be distinguished from load cell measurements as load fluctuations when the person touches the roller. Walking forward (WF) and walking backward (WB) should be differentiated."}, {"heading": "4 Activity Recognition Models", "text": "We assume that the set of all possible behaviors is B, the cardinality of which is m. The behavior at the time t is represented by the random variable Bt. The measurement at the sensor k at the time t is given by the random variable Skt, where k-value {1,..., n}. For the convenience of writing we denote the sequence of behaviors from the time i to j by Bi: j and the observation sequence at the sensor k by Ski: j. The measurements at all sensors observed between the time i and j are denoted by S1: ni: j and the actual observed sequence is denoted by s1: ni: j. The total length of a sequence is T. The actual behavior at the time t is denoted by b-value and the predicted behavior at the time t by b-value. Lower case letters denote the assignment of a value to a random variable."}, {"heading": "4.1 Hidden Markov Model", "text": "We construct a hidden Markov model in which the behavior is the hidden variable and the sensor values are the observations (Fig. 4). Parameters include \u03b8b \u2032, b \u2261 Pr (Bt = b \u2032 | Bt \u2212 1 = b) (probability that the behavior is at the time t b \u2032 because the behavior is at the time t \u2212 1 b), \u03c6s, k, b \u2261 Pr (Skt = s | Bt = b) (probability that the value measured by the kth sensor at the time t is s that the behavior is b) and \u03c0b \u2261 Pr (B0 = b) (probability that the initial behavior is b)."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Maximum Likelihood (ML) Learning", "text": "For supervised learning, we manually mark the data based on the video feed.

However, in some of our experiments we use a simple transition model to avoid bias, which reflects the fact that behavior is times more likely to change than not."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Bayesian Learning", "text": "We start from a previous distribution and update it with the help of the Bayes rule, in order to obtain the complete posterior distribution over the variables of interest. By looking at the complete posterior distribution over the parameters, we hope to avoid the overfitting problems that are often experienced by the EM algorithm. In most cases, the posterior distribution over the parameters does not have a tractable form, so we cannot fall back directly on it. Consequently, we resort to methods based on the simulation of a Markov chain, whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution of interests. A convenient choice of a previous distribution over the parameters is a product of the Dir 1 Dirichlet distribution."}, {"heading": "4.2 Conditional Random Field", "text": "We consider the particular case of the linear chain CRFs. A CRF defines the distribution of a sequence of thresholds (B1: t) conditioned on a sequence of observations (S1: n1: t). In our experiments, the labels are considered the behavior of the user, and the observations are the sensor measurements at any time. The probability of B1: t = b1: t conditioned on S1: n1: n1: t: t = s1: t is given."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "We present the results for the HMM and the CRF for both experiments. We have only half the behavior of the participants in Experiment 2 (2), we have only half the behavior of the participants in Experiment 2 (2), we have the entire bandwidth from 0 to 216 (1), we divide the bandwidth into 20 intervals and represent its length in such a way that the same number of measurements falls into each interval. Since the participants also normalize the weight differences between the load cell measurements as follows: normalizedV alue = (value \u2212 min)."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it will be able to put itself at the top, \"he said in an interview with the\" Welt am Sonntag. \""}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "This work presented a novel and significant application of activity detection in the context of instrumented rollers. We developed several algorithms based on HMMs and CRFs and tested them with real users in the Village of Winston Park (retirement community in Kitchener, Ontario). A comprehensive analysis of the results showed that behaviors associated with the use of rollers tend to result in loads, speed, and acceleration patterns that are sufficient to distinguish them with reasonable accuracy. In the future, we would like to further improve detection accuracy by using the video data and studying various trait extraction techniques. We are also working to improve the battery life and storage capacity of the rollers to capture data over long periods of time. In particular, this will allow us to lend the rollers to users, record their daily use, and learn realistic and personalized behavioral transition models. Finally, we hope to translate this work into a clinical tool to evaluate the likelihood of using them in the context of mobility patterns."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by funding from the CIHR, the NSERC, the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation (ERA by Pascal Poupart) and the Canadian government (postdoctoral fellowship by Mathieu Sinn), as well as the UW-Schlegel Research Institute for Aging and the Village of Winston Park, as well as all volunteers participating in the experiments."}], "references": [{"title": "Passive derivation of basic walker-assisted gait characteristics from measured forces and moments", "author": ["M.
