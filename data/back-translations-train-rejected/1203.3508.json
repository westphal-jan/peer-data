Many merging operators have been proposed to deal with this problem in possibilistic logic, a weighted logic which is powerful for handling inconsistency and deal- ing with uncertainty. They often result in a possibilistic knowledge base which is a set of weighted formulas. Although possibilistic logic is inconsistency tolerant, it suers from the well-known \"drowning effect\". Therefore, we may still want to obtain a consistent possi- bilistic knowledge base as the result of merg- ing. In such a case, we argue that it is not always necessary to keep weighted informa- tion after merging. In this paper, we define a merging operator that maps a set of pos- sibilistic knowledge bases and a formula rep- resenting the integrity constraints to a clas- sical knowledge base by using lexicographic ordering. We show that it satisfies nine pos- tulates that generalize basic postulates for propositional merging given in [11]. These postulates capture the principle of minimal change in some sense. We then provide an algorithm for generating the resulting knowl- edge base of our merging operator. Finally, we discuss the compatibility of our merging operator with propositional merging and es- tablish the advantage of our merging opera- tor over existing semantic merging operators in the propositional case.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT  (353kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3508v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["guilin qi", "jianfeng du", "weiru liu", "david a bell"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3508"}, "pdf": {"name": "1203.3508.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Merging Knowledge Bases in Possibilistic Logic by Lexicographic Aggregation", "authors": ["Guilin Qi", "Jianfeng Du"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The fusion of faith is an important but difficult problem in artificial intelligence, especially when sources of information are imbued with uncertainty.

First, we have proposed a novel merge operator in a possible logic based on the lexicographic order. A crucial difference between our merge operator and existing one is that we do not require that the weighted information be retained in the merging knowledge base. Finally, we have proposed some new logical postulates for a possible merger, and have shown that our merge operator can be reduced to the operator that GMin [7] operator has defined in the case of proposition, and it satisfies postulates (IC0-IC8) given in [11]. We have also shown that our merge operator can be reduced to the operator that GMin [7] operator has defined in the case of proposition, and it satisfies postulates postulates postulates (IC0-IC8) given in [11]. We have also shown that it is possible for our merge operator to use the original C4 operator as a common basis for some of our knowledge."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Guilin Qi is partially supported by Southeast University's Excellent Youth Scholars Program under grant 4009001011 and the National Science Foundation of China under grant 60903010.

problem in Artificial Intelligence, especially when sources of information are pervaded with uncertainty. Many merging operators have been proposed to deal with this problem in possibilistic logic, a weighted logic which is powerful for handling inconsistency and dealing with uncertainty. They often result in a possibilistic knowledge base which is a set of weighted formulas. Although possibilistic logic is inconsistency tolerant, it suffers from the well-known \u201cdrowning effect\u201d. Therefore, we may still want to obtain a consistent possibilistic knowledge base as the result of merging. In such a case, we argue that it is not always necessary to keep weighted information after merging. In this paper, we define a merging operator that maps a set of possibilistic knowledge bases and a formula representing the integrity constraints to a classical knowledge base by using lexicographic ordering. We show that it satisfies nine postulates that generalize basic postulates for propositional merging given in [11]. These postulates capture the principle of minimal change in some sense. We then provide an algorithm for generating the resulting knowledge base of our merging operator. Finally, we discuss the compatibility of our merging operator with propositional merging and establish the advantage of our merging operator over existing semantic merging operators in the propositional case.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
