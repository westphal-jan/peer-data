A standard method of formalizing coherence is (cf. Walley 1991, \u00a7 2.5, also for justifications): definition 1.

In addition, the last two constraints on the coefficient vectors are troublesome to verify in practice. We will improve this impractical formulation here. If we add all singleton indicators to the set of games of chance K, the requirement that each component of the increase must generate an increase of max < p > K, results in a selection of coefficients that makes < p > K, id > K.

Generally, Definition 9 still generates redundant sets of constraints. Therefore, the use of a redundancy removal algorithm is advisable to speed up the Fourier-Motzkin elimination and the enumeration of vertices. As a warm-up exercise and to illustrate some basic ideas, we first consider cases with few - one, two or three - games of chance (\u00a7 3.1), then increase the number of games of chance and focus on combinatorial aspects (\u00a7 3.2 and \u00a7 3.3)."}, {"heading": "3.1 SMALL SETS OF GAMBLES", "text": "For completeness, let us first consider the almost trivial case in which K essentially consists of just one game of chance, PGP f = 0P f = 1 Pae.g., f: = (1,1 / 2.0) on: = {a, b, c} (output, 1on3). The one-dimensionality of this case inevitably leads to two irredundant constraints and two branches. (13It is a mathematical generalization and a historical descendant of the example of lower probabilities of Walley (1991, A3).Two games of chance The toy example of sub-section 2.2 belongs to this class. We found four irredundant preferences and branches relative to some events.

If K consists of all the indicators that are the degenerated previsions and the empty lower previsions, the resulting class of lower previsions is defined by a lower probability mass function (Output, l). If K consists of all | Singleton complementary indicators, the resulting class of lower previsions is defined by a lower redundancy number (Output, u). The resulting class of lower previsions is defined - by conjugation - by a higher probability mass function (Output, u). There are 2 \u00b7 1 irredundant previsions (Output, u)."}, {"heading": "3.3 VALUES-BASED GAMBLES", "text": "To complete our analysis, we vary the number of games of chance for the case from one to six (Output, vb).16 We find (for k equal to one, see above): k 2 3 4 5 6 | K | 12 18 24 30 36 # 15 (178) 21 (699) 27 (1796) 33 (3685) 39 (6582) # P 49 180 455 928 165314This is due to the fact that generally a sensible natural extension of the convex set of coherent lower predictions for a given set of games of chance to a larger one does not retain its convexity. 15Calculations for higher cardinalities are too uncompromising (for current PCs, i.e. it takes more than a few days on an Intel T7200 processor from 2006, or requires more than Gievevel \u00b7 B \u00b7 The results of these RAMK tests are largely irrelevant)."}, {"heading": "4 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we have derived a harmless coherence criterion (Definition 9) to define coherent lower premises based on an endless number of possibilities. In this definition, this sentence is limited to a subset of a specific standardized class and contains singleton indicators. But we have also shown that both limitations are substantial: the first, because the extension of the entire class is an isomorphism, the second, because Fourier-Motzkin elimination can be applied. In this sense, we have given a very general characterization of the concept of low previsions. Of the combinatorial data we have received, the set of constraints that are still redundant, but the irredundant propositions may be relatively small."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This research is supported by a Francqui Fellowship of the Belgian American Educational Foundation.
