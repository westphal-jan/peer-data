An important subclass are the Associative Markov Networks which are used in a wide variety of applications. For these networks a good approximate minimum cost solution can be found efficiently using graph cut based move making algorithms such as alpha-expansion. Recently a related model has been proposed, the associative hierarchical network, which provides a natural generalisation of the Associative Markov Network for higher order cliques (i.e. clique size greater than two). This method provides a good model for object class segmentation problem in computer vision. Within this paper we briefly describe the associative hierarchical network and provide a computationally efficient method for approximate inference based on graph cuts. Our method performs well for networks containing hundreds of thousand of variables, and higher order potentials are defined over cliques containing tens of thousands of variables. Due to the size of these problems standard linear programming techniques are inapplicable.

However, most of these research efforts focus on conclusions about paired Markov networks. Of particular interest are the families of associative paired potentials (Taskar et al., 2004), where associated variables are considered more likely than not to share the same label. Consequence algorithms that target these associative potentials include linked convex costs (Kumar and Torr, 2008), metrics (Boykov et al., 2001), and semi-metrics (Kumar and Koller, 2009), which often bear the costs of solving a set within the limits of a given cost."}, {"heading": "2 NOTATION", "text": "Consider an amn defined by a set of latent variables x = {xi | i \u0445 V}, where V = {1, 2,..., n}. Each random variable xi can take a label from the label setL = {l1, l2,..., lk}. Let C stand for a series of subsets of V (i.e., cliques) that define the amn. The map solution of an amn can be found by using an energy function E: Ln \u2192 R. These energy functions can typically be written as the sum of potential functions: E (x) = [xc] = [xc], where xc represents the set of variables contained in each clique c. We refer to functions defined by clicks of size one as simple potentials and designate them as [i]: L \u2192 R, where the subscript i denotes the index of variables, the variables defined by the potential."}, {"heading": "3 ASSOCIATIVE HIERARCHICAL NETWORKS", "text": "(2004)), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), (2008), ("}, {"heading": "4 INFERENCE", "text": "It is.

In a standard swap move, the set of all motions under consideration is the one in which a subset of variables currently taking the designation \u03b1 or \u03b2 shifts either to \u03b2 or to \u03b1. In our range swap, the motions under consideration allow all variables taking the designations \u03b1, LF, or \u03b2 to change their state to any of \u03b1, LF, or \u03b2. Similarly, a normal expansion train allows each variable to shift to any state \u03b1 or LF.

To do this, we create a Qpb function defined to 4 variables c1, c2, i1 and i2. We associate the states i1 = 1, i2 = 1 with xi, i1 = cp = 0 with the current state xi = Qpb, and i1 = 1, i2 = 0 with the state LF.

From (6) if an auxiliary variable xc may take label \u03b3 or LF, and one of its children xi | i \u0435c take label \u03b4 or LF, the cost associated with assigning label \u03b3 or LF to xc is independent of the label of xi in relation to a given move.Under a swap move, a clique currently taking label \u03b4 {\u03b1, \u03b2} will continue to do so. This follows from (4) as the cost associated with taking label \u03b3 or LF's is only dependent on the weighted average of the child variable's state; and this remains constant. Therefore, the only clique variables that may have a new optimal label under the swap are those that currently state \u03b1, LF or \u03b2, and these can only transform into an archical, LF or \u03b2 hierarchy."}, {"heading": "6 EXPERIMENTS", "text": "We evaluate \u03b1-expansion, \u03b1\u03b2-swap, trw-s, Belief Propagation, Iterated Conditional Modes, and both the expansion and swap based versions of our unordered range moves on the problem of object class segmentation over the MSRC data-set (Shotton et al., 2006), in which each pixel within an image must be assigned to a label representing its class, such as grass, water, boat, or cow. We express the problem as a three-layer hierarchy. Each pixel is represented by random base layer variables. The second layer is formed by performing several unattended segments over the image, and associating one variable with each segment."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSION", "text": "This work shows that higher order amns are closely related to pairs of hierarchical networks.

An important subclass are the Associative Markov Networks which are used in a wide variety of applications. For these networks a good approximate minimum cost solution can be found efficiently using graph cut based move making algorithms such as alphaexpansion. Recently a related model has been proposed, the associative hierarchical network, which provides a natural generalisation of the Associative Markov Network for higher order cliques (i.e. clique size greater than two). This method provides a good model for object class segmentation problem in computer vision. Within this paper we briefly describe the associative hierarchical network and provide a computationally efficient method for approximate inference based on graph cuts. Our method performs well for networks containing hundreds of thousand of variables, and higher order potentials are defined over cliques containing tens of thousands of variables. Due to the size of these problems standard linear programming techniques are inapplicable. We show that our method has a bound of 4 for the solution of general associative hierarchical network with arbitrary clique size noting that few results on bounds exist for the solution of labelling of Markov Networks with higher order cliques.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
