Nodes correspond to variables, uncertainties drawn as ovals, decisions drawn as rectangles, and values drawn as rounded rectangles. We refer to variables by uppercase letters (X) and their possible states by lowercase (x). A bold letter (U) indicates a series of variables that we refer interchangeably to a node and its corresponding variables, which simply refer to them as uncertainties, decisions, and values. If X is a node with parents U, then XU becomes a family of X. The parents of an uncertain or valuable node we call its probability distribution or expected value, while the parents of a decision node are observed."}, {"heading": "3 DECISION CIRCUITS", "text": "Decision-making processes are modified arithmetic circuits [Darwiche, 2003] for efficient evaluation and analysis of influence diagrams. Specifically, they have a maximization operator in addition to sum and product operators [Bhattacharjya and Shachter, 2007], and they perform an evaluation with an upward swing and a downward differentiation. In this paper, we also introduce a branching operator that deals with conditional independent sub-problems and additional value functions. The branching operator requires that we evaluate two functions simultaneously while sliding upwards through the decision circuit, one for the expected value weighted by the probability of the evidence and another for the evidence we present three sets of partial derivatives. A sequential decision can be presented as a dynamic programming function (e), whereby the calculation of the maximum expected value is weighted by the probability of the variables."}, {"heading": "3.1 A New Branching Operator", "text": "We add a branching node to the decision circuit to combine conditional independent subproblems with their own additive value functions and fragmented proofs. Branching node x works differently for the two functions: gx (ex) = g1 (e1) g2 (e2) and gx (e) = g1 (e) g2 (e2) + g1 (e1) g2 (e), the cross-product of the two child branches [Shachter and Peot, 1992; Dittmer and Jensen, 1994]. This distinction is necessary to normalize the different values of gi (e) before summing, so that the combined gx (e) function contains all the proofs from both branches 1 and 2. (This can be generalized to more than two branches, but it is more efficient to create a binary tree of branching nodes x.) The partial derivatives of g (e) and g (e) can then be calculated by branching the branch into a branch."}, {"heading": "4 BUILDING DECISION CIRCUITS", "text": "In this section, we show how to build a decision circuit that takes advantage of the global structure of an influence chart using a target variable elimination order. After building a directed chord graph from the morality graph using the target order, we build a \"decision circuit backbone\" to determine the decision circuit."}, {"heading": "4.1 Directed chordal graphs", "text": "The theory of chordal graphs and nodes is well developed and we build on these results [Golumbic, 1980; Tarjan and Yannakakis, 1984; Shachter and al, 1990]. We define an acyclic graph that is chordal when there is an arc between two nodes with a common child. A particularly useful result is that there is a unique minimum chordal graph by aligning its edges to one of its \"perfect\" orders, and the undirected graph is always chordal."}, {"heading": "4.2 Decision circuit backbones", "text": "A decision circuit backbone is a compact representation for a decision circuit that shows the branching as well as sum, product, and maximum operators. It is compact because it represents a general path through a symmetrical decision circuit. At any time in the build process, there are a number of variables W that have been introduced and are still available, and for each w there is a corresponding operator node in the decision circuit. An uncertainty X is introduced via \"+ X | W,\" which represents a sum above x for each possible w. Likewise, a decision variable X via \"maxX | W\" is introduced, which represents a maximum value above x for each possible w. On the other hand, no variable is introduced via \"X | W,\" which represents a product with neighborx | u, and vice versa via x for each possible w, and it is necessary that the entire X family, including X, is contained within the W branches in the circuit."}, {"heading": "4.3 Constructing the decision circuit", "text": "In this section, we construct the decision circuit from the backbone decision circuit. The backbone organizes all the information needed for the process. We describe the construction of the decision circuit starting from the root node with W = {}. During the process, an operator node is created for each possible w. The sum entry \"+ X | W\" and the maximum entry \"maxX | W\" generate a sum (or maximum) operator node for each possible w with a child corresponding to each possible x. The product entry \"X | W\" creates a product operator for each possible w with three children: the next operator as a child and the other children (where u w are the parents of X in the original influence diagram). For example, the decision circuit for the example in Figure 1 and backbone in Figure 3 corresponds to the following system corresponding to that in Section 3."}, {"heading": "4.4 Comparing Branching and Linear Decision Circuits", "text": "In this section, we compare the new branching method presented in this paper with the linear method presented in Figure 1 [Dittmer and Jensen, 1997] and Figure 2 [Jensen, et al, 1994], counting the number of arcs in the decision circuits for each approach. We consider three examples of influence diagrams presented in Figure 1 [Dittmer and Jensen, 1997] and the oil drilling problem [Raiffa, 1968]. For the first two, we construct circuits on the assumption that all variables are binary and also on the assumption that all variables have either three or four states. The target variable elimination orders (shown in the captions in Figure 1 and Figure 2) were selected to minimize the size of the linear decision circuit with the combined multiple values to a single value. The results are in Table 1. For the influence diagram shown in Figure 1 with a single value node and only two benefits, when the benefit is most present in the two, and the benefit is most limited to the possibility of the two, in this paragraph of the overhead, we compare the new branching method presented in this paper with the linear method presented in Figure 1 [Dittmer and Jensen, 1997] and Figure 2 [Jensen, 1994], counting the number of arcs in the decision circuits in the decision circuits for each approach."}, {"heading": "5 DECISION CIRCUITS AND LOCAL STRUCTURE", "text": "In this section we discuss some types of local structure in influence diagrams and how we can use them to compile more compact decision circuits. Influence diagrams naturally represent symmetrical decision situations at the graphical level, while asymmetry at the local level is represented within the distributions. Bielza and Shenoy [1999] compare how different graphical models handle asymmetry. For real-world decision problems, it is natural to have asymmetry, with many zeros in CPTs. To take advantage of the local structure when putting together a decision circuit, it depends on whether a particular parameter could change. For example, if we want a certain zero to remain always zero, even during sensitivity analysis, we call it a hard zero. The presence of hard zeros and zeros allows us to trim the decision circuits with a decision circuit by eliminating nodes and circular arcs with a hard decision [we can have a hard decision with either a hard one in 2008, or a tough one]."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "In this paper, we have shown how significantly smaller and more efficient decision circuits can be built than with the linear vertex elimination method in Bhattacharjya and Shachter [2007]. Faced with a target variable elimination order, we are able to use separate value nodes and conditionally independent sub-problems to construct a branch structure over sub-problems. We introduce a branch operator and a decision circuit backbone as a compact graphical representation for a symmetrical decision circuit. We show how the influence diagram and target order determine a directed chord graph to guide the construction process. The resulting circuit can be compiled using the local structure. The promise of decision circuits is that by assembling the basic operations applied in node tree methods, conditional independence and separable values can be used with local operations that exploit asymmetry, we should be able to execute some of the advances that others should be able to make."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank the anonymous referees for their suggestions."}], "references": [{"title": "Decision Circuits: A graphical representation for efficient decision analysis computation, Ph.D Thesis, Stanford University", "author": ["D.
