Almost every e-commerce site uses a so-called reputation mechanism that collects and publishes customer reviews, and it is instructive to distinguish between different types of reputation mechanisms that they collect and publish in accordance with the role they play: those employed by online opinion forums such as Amazon Reviews or Ciao4 are built to eliminate asymmetrical information from their customers. They are called signaling mechanisms, since they collect and publish feedback on the quality of products, signaling the previously hidden quality of future customers. This is different for the reputation mechanisms used on online auction platforms, such as as1www.amazon.com ebayebayebayebay.com collaboration with Santioner4ance4.com, by referring to them as a threat to the Santiontioner4.com collaboration www.Santioner4ance4.com."}, {"heading": "2 THE MODEL", "text": "Before we examine the design space of feedback mechanisms for online auction sites, we explain the basic procedure together with the game theory model."}, {"heading": "2.1 PROCEDURE", "text": "The idealized approach of a single transaction is as follows: The seller describes the quality of a good he wants to sell and interested customers submit their bids. At some point, the auction platform determines the buyer who then pays for the good. Once payment is received, the seller sends it in the prescribed quality. Unfortunately, this idealized procedure is prone to fraud: since the buyer must pay the good before the seller sends it, the seller is better off through fraud, i.e. either not at all or in a lower quality than described. In anticipation, the buyer does not pay for the good at all. This is called a dilemma because it leads to a non-trade situation, even if both buyer and seller benefit from the trade if the seller could credibly commit to cooperate. In the following, we limit ourselves to environments with numerous expenditures but only binary signals. The interpretation of a signal is whether the contract, i.e. the description of the good together with the promise to send it, has been fulfilled."}, {"heading": "2.2 SELLER BEHAVIOR", "text": "We typically assume for the sanction mechanisms that the seller is a long-term player facing a sequence of short-term buyers, i.e. buyers who are interested in the seller's product in a one-step game only. Each buyer responds best to the seller's belief in the seller's action. That is, a buyer decides to pay for the good when the belief that the seller is cooperating exceeds a certain threshold. In the usual literature on reputation mechanism design, the efficiency of a design is evaluated by deriving upper or lower limits for the balance payout. Limitations are considered instead of actual balances, because it is not always clear which of several existing balances are chosen. Below, we assume that - given truthful feedback - the seller plays the balance that maximizes his payout. This is weakly justified, as some of the low payout balances are unreasonable: Once the buyer's feedback is asked for, the buyer's feedback is unreasonable."}, {"heading": "2.3 COMMITMENT TYPES", "text": "Our game theory model of the online auction is that of Dellarocas (2005), expanded to include the possibility that players of cooperative \"connection types\" can be. Connection types have a long history in the game theory literature on reputation building: For example, Kreps and Wilson (1982) showed that - when the actions of long-term players are perfectly observed - a small early belief that the long-term player is committed to cooperation is sufficient to induce even a \"strategic\" long-term player to cooperate. The intuition behind this finding is that a strategic player \"masks\" himself as a committed player, that is, builds a reputation as a cooperative player. After a sufficiently long history of cooperative play, the belief of short-term players that the long-term player is a connection type is enough to approach 1 and they play the best response to cooperation. Fudenberg and Levine (1992) find a similar result for environments in which long-term players are only incompletely observed online as in the case of the auction."}, {"heading": "2.4 THE FEEDBACK GAME", "text": "It is about the question of whether the game is a game that is a complete game with imperfect and imperfect information. It is about a game with imperfect and imperfect information. It is about a game with imperfect and imperfect information. It is about a game with imperfect and imperfect information. It is about a game that identifies the seller, the seller and the second buyer. It is about a game that begins with the nature that selects the seller. It is about either a \"strategic\" or \"commitment.\""}, {"heading": "3 MECHANISM FRAMEWORK", "text": "In order to get truthful feedback and get sellers to cooperate, we allow the mechanism to pay buyers for their feedback. Before we come to the description of the payment scheme, we clarify the applied solution concept and show how the conditional beliefs that the payment scheme requires can be calculated."}, {"heading": "3.1 SOLUTION CONCEPT", "text": "In order to have a unified solution for both the seller (who is supposed to cooperate) and the buyer (who is supposed to be truthful), we include the seller in the definition of truthfulness. We are aware that there are other concepts that capture both the disclosure of information and the robustness of rational manipulation. However, it is important to distinguish between the objectives of the sanction mechanism of reputation and the feedback mechanism: the sanction mechanism (which is given to us) leads to a certain degree of cooperation between sellers, even if the feedback is truthful. It is important to distinguish between the objectives of the sanction mechanism of reputation and the feedback mechanism: the sanction mechanism (which is given to us) leads to a certain degree of cooperation between sellers if the feedback is truthful.The aim of the feedback mechanism is to provide the sanction mechanism with the true buyer feedback mechanism."}, {"heading": "3.2 BELIEF COMPUTATIONS", "text": "One way to verify whether a strategy profile is a truthful prediction method is to select each player, fix the remaining truthfulness strategies, and verify that the truthfulness game of the selected player is the best answer. If the selected player is the selected buyer, we have the situation of the truthfulness buyer for whom we know the seller will play q.12. If the selected player is one of the buyers, the situation is more difficult. To achieve this, we have the other buyer designated r (i). To get the best answer, it must be true that - given the seller plays q.12 and the buyer plays r (i) truthfulness - buyer i is also truthful. To achieve this, we allow the buyer i for their feedback and the condition of payment to the feedback report of r (i). For pure signaling mechanisms (without a strategic seller), this \"pre-nick\" strategy is used by Miller."}, {"heading": "4 THE PAYMENT SCHEME", "text": "We follow Jurca and Faltings (2006) and formulate the payment scheme as a linear program (LP) that minimizes the required budget. Technique for solving a mechanism design problem by means of mathematical optimization is called automated mechanism design and was first introduced by Conitzer and Sandholm (2002)."}, {"heading": "4.1 THE LINEAR PROGRAM", "text": "The limitations of the LP are divided into two groups. The first group consists of the honesty limitations, which require that an honest signal announcement by the purchaser i is the only best response to a truthful report by r (i) and a truthful seller. For every possible signal observation, there is a dishonest announcement aij 6 = a). We want the expected payment of a truthful report by the purchaser i to be greater than the expected payment of the other possible report. Specifically, including external lie incentives, we want it to be larger than the respective (\u00b7). Note that the assessment of the purchaser for a signal can be omitted, since the received signal is independent of the signal announcement: 2 x k = 1 gi (sk | sj) (sj, sk) \u2212."}, {"heading": "4.2 FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS", "text": "It is clear that LP 1 is limited as all factors in the objective function are not negative. To investigate if and when it is feasible, we first prove three lemmas, which ultimately enable us to prove our main message that LP 1 is feasible if and only if both types of sellers are more likely to do so. The intuition for this result is that if there is only one type of sellers whose strategies are generally considered to be prioritised, the belief of one buyer in the experience of another buyer does not change. LP 1 is feasible if and only if (h | h) 6 = (h | l) does not change for the experience of another buyer. For clarity, we will first reduce the feasibility of LP 1 to the feasibility of its honey limitations without any external benefits."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSION", "text": "We have shown that the peer prediction method can be used to design a truthful feedback scheme for sanction mechanisms. Building on the literature on game theory and reputation building, we have introduced a binding seller who is fully cooperative and has shown that its existence is critical for the applicability of the methodology. In future work, we will reduce the conventional assumptions of our mechanism. In particular, we will modify the payment scheme so that instead of (possibly unknown) specific numbers, limits are taken into account in probabilistic parameters. For example, it should be sufficient to know that high sales efforts are followed by a high signal with a probability of at least 90%. Another difficulty in applying the mechanism is the assumption of a durable seller. We will therefore examine mechanisms that no longer rely on a long history of past feedback reports, but instead pay a seller an amount that is directly dependent on the reported quality and only after the transaction."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank Malte Helmert, Sven Seuken, Boi Faltings and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.
