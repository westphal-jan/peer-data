Many algorithms are designed to solve influence diagrams [2, 3, 8, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21]. Most of these algorithms, whether they build a secondary structure or not, are based on the dynamic programming approach proposed from the bottom up. They start by solving small, low decision problems and gradually build on these results to solve major problems until the solution to the global decision problem is found. The disadvantage of these methods is that they can waste computation in solving decision scenarios that have zero probability or that they are unattainable by following an optimal decision policy. This disadvantage can be overcome by adopting a two-band approach to solving an influence diagram that uses all possible decision-making scenarios."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "We start with a brief overview of influence diagrams and algorithms for their solution.

Figure 1 shows four examples of the problem. Shaded tiles represent walls, white tiles represent moving space, and white tiles with an asterisk represent target states. An agent is randomly placed in a non-target state. He has five available actions that he can use to move toward the target: he can move one step in one of the four compass directions, or he can stay in place. The effect of a motion action is stochastical. The agent successfully moves in the intended direction with probability 0.89. He does not move with probability 0.089, he moves sideways with probability 0.02 (0.01 for each side), and he moves backwards with probability 0.001. If motion in any direction would lead him into a wall, this motion has zero probability, and the remaining probabilities are normalized."}, {"heading": "2.3 Evaluation algorithms", "text": "In this case, it is a purely reactionary project, capable of achieving the aforementioned objectives."}, {"heading": "3 Computing bounds", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to move to another world, in which they are able, in which they are able to integrate, and in which they are able, in which they are able to change and change the world."}, {"heading": "4 Branch-and-bound search", "text": "In this section, we will describe how to use the top influence chart to calculate the boundaries for a deepest bifurcated search algorithm that solves the original influence chart. We will begin by showing how to present the search space as an AND / OR tree. A naive approach to calculating boundaries requires evaluating the entire top influence chart at each OR node of the search tree, which is mathematically prohibitive. To make an industry and boundary-based search feasible, we will rely on a step-by-step approach to calculating boundaries proposed by Yuan and Hansen [20] to solve the MAP problem in Bayesian networks using industry and bound search.

A naive approach is to determine the states of instantiated variables as evidence and to perform a full join-tree evaluation, but this is too costly. We can use an efficient incremental join-tree evaluation method to calculate the probabilities and upper limit-specific tools based on the incremental join-tree evaluation method proposed by Yuan and Hansen to solve the MAP problem. The key idea is that we can choose a specific order of variables that meets the limitations of Equation (5) so that an incremental join-tree evaluation scheme can be used to calculate the information. Given such an order, we know exactly which variables were searched for and which variable will be searched next at each search step. We just need messages from the join parts of the tree are connected to the ones already searched in the next one."}, {"heading": "4.3 Efficient backtracking", "text": "We use depth-first branch-and-bound (DFBnB) to take advantage of the efficient incrementally bound computation. Depth-first search ensures that the search does not have to jump to another search branch before tracing is required. In other words, the join tree only needs to work with one search history at a time. We need to return to a previous search node once we have completed a search branch or realize that a search branch is not promising and should be trimmed. We need to withdraw all newly created evidence since generating that search node and return the join tree to its previous state. One way to achieve this is to reinitialize the join tree with correct evidence and perform a full join tree evaluation, which we have already pointed out is too costly. Instead, we store the potentials and delimiters along the message propagation path before changing them, either by rewriting them with backtracking or simply rewriting them to the evidence last."}, {"heading": "5 Empirical Evaluation", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take a few days until it is so far, until it is so far."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We described the first implementation of a two-part search algorithm to make the approach mathematically feasible. Specifically, we described an efficient approach to using the join-tree algorithm to calculate upper limits for truncating the search tree. The idea is to create a superficial influence chart by conditioning each decision variable on additional information that does not require the remaining history, thus simplifying the impact chart. Then, a join tree of the superficial influence chart is used to gradually calculate upper limits for the deepest first two- and bound search. We also described a new approach to constructing the search tree based on the structure of the strong join-tree shape of the superficial influence chart. Experiments show that the resulting two- and bound search algorithm exceeds the boundaries of NASA. This search tree is based on the structure of the strong Join tree shape influence chart of the superficial influence chart."}], "references": [{"title": "An algorithm for finding minimum d-separating sets in belief networks", "author": ["S.
