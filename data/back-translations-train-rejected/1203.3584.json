Related works", "text": "The following subsections review these key trends and their relationship to IR purposeses.2.1 Word representation levelThere is no general agreement of the representation level of the representation level, direct versus rule based lexicons in IR systems. Two levels were debated; root level and stem level. Motivated by the power of Arabic roots, the first approach represents words in their root forms. Historically, a root to traditional Arabic lexicons has been used. Almost every word in Arabic comes from a root."}, {"heading": "4. POS tagging phase", "text": "There are many morphological analysis methods for the auxiliary practices used to auxiliarize auxiliary rules and synthetic rules; some of them are available as an open source for research and evaluation, while the rest only serves as proprietary commercial applications. (The list of basic terms that are acquired in the language and basic algorithms is not complete.) The list of terms consists of 3800 trilateral and 900 trilateral literary roots. Khoja also recognizes a list of 168 Arabic stopwords that support the analysis of algorithms that apply different knowledge resources of the Arabic language in our implementation phase: prefixes, suffixes, patterns and rules."}, {"heading": "5. Lemma Generation phase", "text": "The main contribution of this paper is the development of a lemmas generator that filters out and possibly replaces the lemmas of an Arabic word. (The next two subsections describe the procedures used to generate the verb and noun lemmas.) The purpose of the second phase of the lemmas algorithm is to generate the abstract lemmas of a word. (The next two subsections describe the procedures used to generate the verb and noun lemmas.) In other cases, removing prefixes and suffixes is not enough to generate the lemmas of the problem. In our implementation, rules are applied at the pattern level to deal with such cases. (2) The table shows examples of analysis."}, {"heading": "6.
