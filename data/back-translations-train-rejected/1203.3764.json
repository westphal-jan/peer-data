According to the Pew Internet Project report [1], 78% of Internet users (or 59% of U.S. adults) seek health information online, and about one in five who seek health information uses social media. Resources range from purely patient-oriented discussion forums to question-and-answer forums with patients and qualified physicians. Our goal is to provide valuable and effective means to connect patients with the experiences of other patients like them, harnessing the power of the big data distilled from the original information. Figure 1 illustrates a subsection (for the brevity) of the information provided to a patient in response to a search for \"Tarceva\" (the treatment of patients)."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Distillation Pipeline", "text": "At the heart of SHIP is a distillation pipeline illustrated in Figure 2, driven by technologies such as machine learning, automated natural language processing, and ontologies [2,3]. Submissions from patient experiences (for consistency reasons, we will call an entire discussion a \"thread\" and individual contributions in this thread a \"post\") go through various extractions and classifications in the pipeline, and finally through a (brief) aggregation step, by the end of which we have distilled approximately 50 facts and expressions from such a post. These facts and expressions flow into a structured big data database or what we call our experiential meta database. The steps of the distillation pipeline along with the aggregation module to create a structured metadata base of facts and expressions from the text in the papers are described:"}, {"heading": "Elementary Extraction", "text": "The very first step is to perform basic word processing for each thread and post. This includes providing a unique ID for each post and thread, parsing using HTML and extracting HTML-based information such as number of responses, time of last update, etc."}, {"heading": "Entity Extraction", "text": "The next step is to acquire medically relevant units that are relevant to health, such as medicines (including chemotherapy drugs and therapies, pain medications and other medications), side effects, treatments and procedures, side effects, hospitals or sites, etc. We have used the XAR system, which in turn uses open source systems (such as \"GATE\" and \"UIMA\") [2]. We have further expanded XAR by integrating ontologies from the UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) [3] and other lexicographs and ontologies for units such as side effects and pain medicines."}, {"heading": "Expression Distillation", "text": "The third step in the concept distillation pipeline is to classify each post into one of {Y, N} (yes or no), depending on whether or not the post contains a particular expression of interest. Specifically, we have designed and implemented classifiers for five expressions of interest: (i) Personal experience, i.e., whether or not the post expresses that someone has personally experienced something of interest (e.g. a particular condition, treatment, medication, etc.); (ii) Counseling, i.e., whether there is an expression of encouragement and / or support in the message (e.g. \"good luck, my thoughts and prayers are with you!\"); (v) Information, i.e. whether there is any informative reference (websites, books or other resources) mentioned in the message; (iv) Support, i.e., whether the message contains an expression of support and / or support (e.g. \"good luck, my thoughts and prayers are with you\" according to a post), i.e., according to any result (v) of a medical result."}, {"heading": "Aggregation", "text": "Aggregation is the process of synthesizing information distilled from posts in a thread to the parent thread. In entities, say, age group or stage of cancer, a union of all entities is made in each post and attributed to the parent thread. However, in a secret expression such as counseling or personal experience - the presence of one in each individual post in a thread - the presence is attributed to the parent thread."}, {"heading": "Elementary Facts", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Extracted Entities", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Classified Expressions", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Information Retrieval over Experience Meta-base", "text": "As a first step, we have developed a Lucene [5] -based (text) search interface to the information, which has been enhanced with optimizations for indexing, dynamic score enhancement and local caching."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Evaluation", "text": "We have applied our system to four major discussion forums - Inspire 1, Medhelp 2 and two other forums, as well as to data for six major cancers (breast, lung, skin, prostate, brain and blood); the basic data comprises almost 50,000 discussion threads, which in turn comprise almost 400,000 discussion contributions; the resulting metadata database contains over 20 million facts and expressions distilled from this data; we have also built an initial version of an information search engine that allows us to provide (i) analytical insights; (ii) offer a better filter search; consider patients suffering from severe coughing after starting chemotherapy Tarceva as a use case; and search the Tarceva website 3 and a page on a clinical trial related to Tarceva. While both pages talk about the primary side effects of Tarceva, cough (as a possible side effect) is not mentioned at all."}, {"heading": "Distillation Accuracy", "text": "The accuracy of extraction, in terms of precision and retrieval, for each of the elementary facts and extracted units is in the range of 0.9% and 90%, respectively. Table 2 below shows the accuracy of the classified expressions (first letter of the classifier for brevity)."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "In the medical field, there are several efforts to automate the distillation of information from (natural) text data. [6] Our work differs from such efforts in that (i) we distill expressions such as personal experience, advice, and results in contributions that are not taken into account by previous work. (ii) We provide selective insights into the aggregated data in an automated manner."}, {"heading": "Address for correspondence", "text": "Naveen Ashish, 365 San Juan Place Pasadena CA 91107 USA. naveen.ashish @ abzooba.com Tel: 408 757 7284"}], "references": [{"title": "XAR: An Integrated Framework for Semantic Extraction and Annotation.
