However, there are some reports of surrogate modeling that automate this task. Surrogate modeling is usually considered black box modeling. In its pure form, this assertion may be correct, but in available toolboxes such as SUMO, iSight, etc., it is also possible to overwork the modeling toolbox using some limitations that experts suggest."}, {"heading": "Validation Process:", "text": "These problems usually fall into one of four types: Model Approximation, Design Space Exploration, where a visual view of the system is sought, Problem Formulation, where the meta-model helps the engineer choose appropriate optimization criteria and appropriate boundaries for constraints, and finally Optimization Support, where the environment model is used as a substitute for classic gradient-based optimization. Successful implementation of this last use represented a good picture of surrogate modeling that led to meta-modeled design optimization (MBDO). To finish this line, we must understand that Fig.3 is not the only iteration loop."}, {"heading": "4.3 Uncertainity in Metamodeling", "text": "Metamodeling can be used to filter noise in computer simulation. On the other hand, uncertainty in metamodeling brings new challenges in design optimization. If optimization problems are limited, it becomes apparent that the limited optimum is very sensitive to the accuracy of all metamodeling when both limitations and objective functions are complex to calculate and metamodeling is applied. Mathematically rigorous methods must be developed to qualify the uncertainty of a metamodeling."}], "references": [{"title": "Pattern recognition and machine learning,", "author": ["Christopher M.
