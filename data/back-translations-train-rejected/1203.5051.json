Introduction", "text": "Essentially, TimeML prescribes the marking of expressions that refer to times, expressions that denote events and expressions that signal temporal relationships between times and events or events and events; it also allows to add associations between units that are labeled with the temporal relationship between them. Existing TimeML tools can be divided into two categories: those that create or modify markers, for example, to support annotation, and those that perform analysis. Few tools have been developed for TimeML to date, with most focusing on the annotation task, such as TTK (Verhagen and Pustejovsky, 2008) that do not support analysis. In the second category, in the absence of other software, TimeML use by the community is limited to generic XML analysis tools, such as Section Xaira (Burnard and Dodd, 2003) or LT-XML1, as well as similar format-specific tools (TimeVaS) that require strong efforts to use this system."}, {"heading": "2. Overview of the tool", "text": "CAVaT is an open source tool built from a set of Python modules and a database. It uses NLTK3 and MySQL4. The user interface is a text-based interactive prompt, and all operations are performed using text commands. Command syntax strives to be simple, flexible, and close to natural language. After loading and pre-processing a TimeML corpus, it can be analyzed using built-in reporting functions and data validation with one of many test components."}, {"heading": "2.1. Preprocessing", "text": "CAVaT can work on any TimeML-annotated corpus that is stored as a collection of uncompressed files in a single directory by importing it into a series of database tables. First, the corpus is processed by an XML parser (using Python's minidoms and expat implementations) that retrieves the document-level data as well as any chronologically annotated information and places it in a MySQL database. Temporarily annotated data includes all TimeML tags and their attributes, as well as all included tokens for EVENT, SIGNAL, and TIMEX3 tags. TimeML displays events with the EVENT tag, and time expressions with the TIMEX3 tag. These intervals are the elements that CAVaT and the rest of this paper assume as time-limited primitives, unless otherwise specified. Temporary relationships between intervals are described."}, {"heading": "2.2. Querying", "text": "The report part of CAVaT makes analyzing TimeML corpora easier and easier than working directly with a set of XML documents, allowing flexible queries and requests that are specific to chronologically annotated data. CAVaT's development was driven by studies of TimeML corpora. Many of the operations performed against a corpora had common elements that often revolved around retrieving class distributions or token frequencies. A TimeML corpus research tool could include all the operations required while accessing a wider range of reports.CAVaT uses a report generation system in which you can see any number of predefined characteristics that match the conditions of the user's choice. Queries can produce reports at different levels of granularity - you can choose to examine data at the set, document or corpus level."}, {"heading": "2.3. Checking", "text": "The largest TimeML corpus is TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) with less than 200 documents and about 65,000 tokens. Due to the complexity of time annotation, errors can occur beyond those that can be detected using an XML DTD. CAVaT is both a reporting and validation tool, and attempts to automatically detect high-level and complex errors that are rarely immediately apparent. Part of the motivation behind this part of the tool is similar to writing tool tests that highlight errors in an application: improving quality by automatically detecting previously seen errors. In this section, we describe some checks that CAVaT can perform on a TimeML corpus. Error checks are defined as Python modules, so that one can describe an error detection method and share it with other researchers without modifying the CAVaT code; the source code can be displayed in the view."}, {"heading": "2.3.1. Inconsistent closure", "text": "It is possible to create an inconsistent configuration of temporal links. < < / p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p"}, {"heading": "2.3.2. Disconnected sub-graph detection", "text": "When concluding a temporal closure (Verhagen, 2005) of a document, one is usually left with a single contiguous temporal graph in which nodes are TIMEX3s or EVENTs and edges represent TLINKs. However, after closing, separate groups of links may exist, which should be brought to the user's attention; it often suggests that annotating a small number of additional links can significantly increase the amount of data that is not verifiable by closing, and that one annotation is incomplete. CAVaT's sub-graph identification module, Split Graph, works by processing TLINKs from a document. We maintain a list of sets that contain interconnected time intervals, starting with an empty list. For each TLINK document, we check whether one of its arguments (which are both intervals) can be found in any set of intervals. If one argument is added to our list, but the other argument is not."}, {"heading": "2.3.3. Superfluous TLINKs", "text": "An example: < TLINK lid = \"l67\" relType = \"IDENTITY\" eventInstanceID = \"ei1241\" relatedToEventInstance = \"ei1241\" / > In this case, the only information transmitted is that ei1241 is identical to itself, which makes it a redundant TLINK. CAVaT includes a check that identifies TLINKs where both arguments point to the same event or event. Although such TLINK loops can be detected by consistency checks, those that specify a SIMULTANEOUS or IDENTITY relationship are not detected. Below is a sample output that shows some superfluous TLINK type type: cavat > check tlink _ p in 165 159 143 # TLINK loop checker # Checking ABC19980304.1830.1636.1636.163DEID: LINK link match > tloop check 164.165event _ 165p _ event _ 164243p) (ABC19943030event _ event _ event)"}, {"heading": "2.3.4. Orphaned object details", "text": "There is no definition yet of the completeness of TimeML annotations that specify a minimum level of annotation for a document. In the absence of such a definition, it is not a mistake to comment on entities without appending them to anything else in the document. However, we believe that, wherever possible, each interval should be associated with at least a different interval, and that the annotations of entities that do not contribute to or refer to other commented information are superfluous. For example, if you decide to mark text as a temporal signal, a linked link or event instance should point to the signal. In this example, if no temporal information is provided, the signal should not contain any annotations. To this end, CAVaT includes a module that knows five cases in which objects that are described that are not tied to anything else, and reports such orphaned objects. First, any TIMEX3 element that is not related to any link will be considered independent."}, {"heading": "2.4. Limitations", "text": "CAVaT is currently limited to the number of objects (based on TimeML tags) that it can store for a single corpus. Objects are stored in MySQL tables, and these are limited by the maximum file size of the operating system. The maximum number of corpus that CAVaT can store is limited to the operating system limit of files in a single directory."}, {"heading": "3. Syntax", "text": "At this point, we will briefly introduce the basic commands of CAVaT and some of its more useful functions. A complete specification of the syntax of CAVaT can be found at http: / / code.google.com / p / cavat."}, {"heading": "3.1. Corpus manipulation", "text": "Commands for manipulating TimeML corpora within CAVaT start with corpus. You can view a list of available corpus using corpus list and use a name from the resulting list to select a corpus for query or verification using the corpus use command. It is also possible to view all notes associated with the currently selected corpus using corpus info. However, before using a corpus, a directory of TimeML files must be imported into CAVaT using corpus import. You can also choose to fold the corpus on import (see Section 2.1); if this is done, a note will be appended to the database."}, {"heading": "3.2. Querying", "text": "The show command generates reports from the current corpus 1.2. Reports focus on a tag type and give information about its attributes. You can view all values for a tag with \"List\" reports or the distribution of values with \"Distribution\" reports, or just see how many instances of that tag use a specific field with \"State\" reports. The general format for report creation is: show < report type > of < tag > < field > [as < format >] From the example above < tag > corresponds to a TimeML tag and is one of the events, instance, timex3, signal, tlink, slink or alink. As well as the attributes < field > available for each tag, the TLINKs can display signal text references to the text enclosed by the start and end tags of an associated signal. \u2022 For EVENTs, all attributes of a MAKEINSTANCE tag can be displayed."}, {"heading": "3.3. Browsing", "text": "To enable this, CAVaT includes the Browse command. Browsing allows the user to select a document (with browse doc, followed by a document ID or filename) and then display any tag within that document. Related data is also displayed; for example, when browsing an EVENT tag, all associated MAKEINSTANCE tags are also listed; you can view the tag in three formats - screen, the default; csv as two lines of commands with separate values (the first with attribute names as column headers); or timeml, specifying a valid TimeML for the object you are requesting; the syntax for these is the same as for Show commands; just append as < output type > to the browse command. The document selected for browsing is also used as the default document for checks detailed in Section 2.3."}, {"heading": "4. Example tasks", "text": "Below are some examples of how to use CAVaT to solve real-world research problems. All are based on TimeBank v1.2."}, {"heading": "4.1.

Dealing with ambiguous \u201cpart of speech\u201d values", "text": "The distribution in Table 4 can be viewed with the command: cavat > show distribution of event posAfterwards, we would like to consider event text classified as different by using the following query: cavat > show list of event text where pos is other # 10.86 # 39.8 million # 54.8 million $1 $1.05 (abbreviated) The result suggests that there are at least some numerical values for these event texts, as well as the more typical verbs. As a result, all currency and numerical event texts have been replaced by representative tokens as a feature of a CRF classification, resulting in an increase in performance in the TLINK classification (in unpublished results)."}, {"heading": "4.3. Which signals does the BEFORE relation use?", "text": "To determine the signal texts used BEFORE TLINK, you can query: cavat > show distribution of tlink signaltext where ereltype is before Results in Table 5 indicate that the symbol \"before\" suggests a BEFORE relation, but that the majority of commented BEFORE relations do not use this signal (Table 3 has a total of 1408 such relations, of which only 24 use the signal), suggesting that it is not useful to build a relation classifier based solely on such signals."}, {"heading": "4.4. Superfluous TLINK checking", "text": "We have an error checker module for this, tlink loop: cavat > check tlink _ loop in WSJ910225-0066.tml TLINK ID l383 matches, type IS _ INCLUDED, event ei1482 TLINK ID l376 matches, type AFTER, event ei1454 TLINK ID l345 matches, type AFTER, event ei1356One can explicitly search for similar errors in all."}, {"heading": "5. Validation of a sample corpus", "text": "Now that we can load and process any TimeML corpus and have a series of advanced validation tests, it is logical to test and examine existing TimeML commented corpus. In this section, we present the results of operating the CAVaT test modules on TimeBank v1.2. This corpus is not new and has been added and improved by the community (Boguraev et al., 2007), so it may contain much less errors than freshly commented documents."}, {"heading": "5.1. Checking for loops", "text": "We used the Tlink Loop module (Section 2.3.3.) on the corpus, which identifies TLINKs that are the same event or instance of an event. Of the 183 TimeBank documents, 19 have at least one TLINK that contains such a loop, and there are a total of 26 loops, 10 of which are on SIMULTANEOUS or IDENTITY-type TLINK. Such TLINK does not make a graph inconsistent, but is certainly redundant, and the remaining 16 loops of other types cause inconsistency. All but one of the loops found are temporal associations in which both arguments point to the same instance of event; only one refers to two different instances of the same event (TLINK L23, in document ABC19980304.1830.1636.tml)."}, {"heading": "5.2. Checking for consistent graphs", "text": "Since the Consistency Checker uses a new method (see Section 2.3.1), we verified its output by comparing it with SputLink's and CAVaT's loop detection and found explanations for each inconsistency. A small corpus of TimeML documents is also included in CAVaT to ensure the accuracy of this tool. SputLink would not report inconsistency with a TLINK loop that is not of the SIMULTANEOUS or IDENTITY type; many of the inconsistent documents were found to be faulty by both SputLink and CAVaT. Some documents had a faulty original TLINK configuration; most errors were more subtle than this and their discovery required a closure attempt."}, {"heading": "5.3. Checking for split graphs", "text": "No single document in TimeBank has a fully connected time graph with a traceable path between each interval. The \"best connected\" document (least broken) is wsj 0144.tml, which has 34 intervals divided into only two sub-diagrams, one containing 32 intervals, the other two. The most broken document is wsj 1033.tml, which is divided into 12 sub-diagrams with an average graph size of only 2.7 intervals (a single TLINK that is not connected to any other creates a graph of size 2. Although a total of 32 intervals are to be connected, the largest sub-diagrams in this document contain only 4 intervals."}, {"heading": "5.4. Replication", "text": "The above results can be easily replicated by downloading CAVaT v1, collecting a copy of TimeBank v1.25, importing the data / timeml / subdirectory from TimeBank and running the whole checktest in CAVaT, where test is the name of the desired test module."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion and future work", "text": "We have described CAVaT, a language-independent tool that adds a layer of abstraction between TimeML markup and human researchers, facilitating data analysis and pattern recognition. It also helps identify trouble spots in annotations. TimeML corpora are currently only available in Romanian (Fora scu et al., 2007) and English, making multilingual testing of the tool difficult. However, markup is not language-specific, and the results are likely to be equally useful in many languages; this can be demonstrated by test corpora published for TempEval 26, which includes English, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and French. Future work CAVaT may be able to provide repair suggestions, including fixes for inconsistent graphics, as well as suggestions for missing fields based on lexical resources, tools for third-party hay modules, or an open database of error messages."}, {"heading": "7.
