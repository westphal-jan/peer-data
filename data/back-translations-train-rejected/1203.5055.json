A difficult problem with time information extraction is the arrangement of events. Although the exact arrangement of events has been the subject of much research [1, 10, 5, 8], work with the temporal signals present in the text - for example, phrases such as afterward, for the duration, and during - is limited and often yields only minimal benefit [11]. These words clearly contain temporal arrangement information that human readers can access. This paper examines the augmentation of a current, powerful time link classifier with information about time signals. Our hypothesis is that signals provide information useful for TLINK classification."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "At this point, we will present the notes used in this paper, present problems with temporal signals, and discuss some of the relevant literature."}, {"heading": "2.1 Temporal Annotation", "text": "A sophisticated annotation scheme is required to capture temporal information well: we use the TimeML scheme [12], which contains tags for annotating events and time expressions (< EVENT > and < TIMEX3 >, respectively) and temporal relationships between intervals (< TLINK >) and signal expressions (< SIGNAL >); the two largest resources of TimeML-annotated text are TimeBank [13] and the AQUAINT TimeML corpus1, which we merge into a corpus for this work."}, {"heading": "2.2 Temporal Links", "text": "Temporal links (orTLINKs) describe a temporal relationship between two intervals, each of which is either an event or a time expression. Allen [2] describes a number of relationship types related to the interval endpoints. As our work is based on data commented on by TimeML, we use a set of TimeML relationships similar to Allen's. Each temporal link can optionally refer to a signal."}, {"heading": "2.3 Signals", "text": "Signals in TimeML are used to indicate multiple events (time quantification) and also to indicate words indicating the nature of the relationship between two intervals. We are only interested in this latter use of signals for the order of events. \"A University Grammar of English\" [14] lists a subset of these words in Section 10.5, \"Time Relaters.\" For example, in the sentence John smiled after he ate, the word specifies an order of events. This example could be represented in TimeML as follows: John < EVENT id = \"e1\" > smiling < / EVENT > < SIGNAL id = \"s1\" > after < / SIGNAL > he < EVENT id = \"e2\" > ate < / EVENT > Signal is a signal indicating such a signal. < TLINK id = \"l1\" eventID = TolatrelatEvent = \"> TAFTER = TAFNAL =\" is not the signal. \""}, {"heading": "2.4 Previous work", "text": "In the temporal order of events, it is intuitively likely that signal information can be useful. In previous automated TLINK classification work, the trend was not to use signals directly as the primary source for ordering information, although other attributes of commented TLINKs and EVENTs were used as training features. For example, the most popular automatic TimeML annotation tool (TARSQI [15]) operates without SIGNAL annotation. Lapata and Lascarides [7] worked with signals and used a limited reference list of signal tokens instead of extracting signal text from human annotated data. This work related only to concurrent temporal associations. Their accuracy in classifying time relations was 70.7%. Bethard and Martin [3] included some characteristics that described signals, with the full-word function (the signal text) being the eighth most important in their characteristics for classifying time."}, {"heading": "3 Method", "text": "To explore whether signal information can be successfully used for the TLINK classification, we proceed as follows: First, we implement a well-known TLINK relation classifier with state-of-the-art accuracy; then we add various signal-related characteristics to the classifier to investigate their impact on classification performance; the approach we replicated as accurately as possible was taken from Mani et al. [9] In short, the method was as follows. First, the set of possible relationship types was reduced by applying a mapping; second, the following information from each TLINK is used as characteristics: event class, aspect modality, voltage, event sequence, event sequence in any relation to a previous relationship; this simplifies the training data and provides more examples per time relationship class; and second, the following information from each TLINK is used as characteristics: event class, aspect modality, tension, event sequence, event sequence of events, event sequence for each event, and whether we have the same event, as well as two Boolean characteristics, both of which indicate the same event, third aspect."}, {"heading": "3.1 Replicating Previous Work", "text": "Table 3 shows the results of the replication of the previous experiment using event event TLINKs. The listed baseline is the most common class in the training data. [2] Available at http: / / sourceforge.net / projects / carafe /. We achieved a similar accuracy of 60.32% compared to 61.79% in the previous paper. The differences can be traced back to the non-standardized corpus they used. TLINK distribution via a merger of TimeBank v1.2 and the AQUAINT corpus is different from the one listed in the paper."}, {"heading": "3.2 Introducing Signals to the Feature Set", "text": "To add information about signals to our training instances, we use the additional features described below; the two arguments of a TLINK are represented by e1 and e2 - signal phrase. This shows the actual text marked as SIGNAL. From this, we can begin to guess temporal orders based on signal phrases. However, the mere use of the expression is insufficient. For example, the two sentences Run before sleep and Before sleep, run can be equivalent in time, as they both specify two events in the order run-sleep that were previously signaled by the same word. - Textual order of e1 / e2. The textual order of linked events can be reversed without affecting the temporal order. Therefore, it is important to know the textual order of events and their signals, even if we know a temporal order. This feature assumes that the order event-signal-text event-value occurs most frequently in either e1 or e2."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "When switching to a feature set that adds SIGNAL information, including signal event word order / distance data, you achieve a predictive accuracy of 61.46%. The increase is small compared to an accuracy of 60.32% without this information, but TLINKs that use a SIGNAL in are a minority in our corpus (possibly due to subcomments).It would be interesting to see the performance difference if you only classify TLINKs that use a SIGNAL. In total, there are 11783 TLINKs in the combined corpus, of which 7.6% are listed including a SIGNAL; for TimeBank v1.2, the value is higher at 11.2% (see Table 2).The percentage of signaled TLINKs in our data is the lowest at 5.1%.The results of extending the feature set through a split of signaled and unsignaled links are shown in Table 5, from a third / two thirds rating / training split."}, {"heading": "5 Analysis", "text": "From Table 1, we can estimate the probability that a word or word sequence can be commented as SIGNAL with a TLINK classification. This can be useful when commenting on signals, especially in the AQUAINT TimeML corpus. Suppose that our feature set could only be helpful for 5.1% of event links in the ATC corpus (Table 2), the maximum performance increase in predicting signaled links can be estimated. Let's assume that we have a perfect signal discrimination and association. Let's assume that our additional features will not help TLINS without SIGNALs, and that the performance increase is solely due to a better accuracy classification of TLINs using signals. Let's assume that accuracy in classifying this minority is one. Given the percentage of signaled TLINs and the predictive accuracy of our classifier when using features that do not depend on signals (Table 146 = P60.1) (P6) (P1 = 380.n)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "This suggests that signals are useful when it comes to providing information for classifying temporal links, and that the features we have used to describe them are effective. Future work will focus on improving signal and TLINK annotation. We need to explore how we can differentiate whether or not a string is used as a temporal signal in the text. Next, after finding a temporal signal, we need to determine which intervals it connects in time. Finally, we can try to comment on a temporal link based on the signal."}], "references": [{"title": "Towards task-based temporal extraction and recognition", "author": ["D. Ahn", "S.F.
