We refer to these as S, E or R. Speech time is when the verb is pronounced. Event time is when the action described by the verb occurs. Reference time is a point of view from which the event is perceived. A summary of the relative positions of these points is given in Table 1. While each tense verb contains a speech, event and reference time, several verbs may share one or more of these points. For example, all narratives in a news article usually have the same speaking time (that of document creation). Furthermore, two events connected by a temporal conjunction (e.g. after) are very likely to share the same reference time. From Table 1 we can see that conventional English only distinguishes six periods of time. Therefore, some English tenses will suffer from this ambiguity more than an arrangement of S, E and R. Reichenbach's tense names."}, {"heading": "2.1 Special properties of the reference point", "text": "The reference point R has two specific uses: when sentences or sentences are combined, grammatical rules require adjustment of tenses. These rules work in such a way that the reference point is always the same in order. Reichenbach refers to this principle as the permanence of the reference point. Second, when temporal expressions (such as a TimeML TIMEX3 of type DATE, but not DURATION) occur in the same sentence as a verbal event, the temporal expression does not (as expected) specify the event time E, but is used instead to position the reference time R. This principle is called the positional use of the reference point."}, {"heading": "2.2 Context and the time points", "text": "In the linear order in which events and times occur in the discourse, language and points of reference remain until they are changed by a new event or time. That is, the reference time from one sentence will pass into the next until it is explicitly repositioned by a tense verb or time. To take into account subordinate clauses in cases such as the reported speech, we add a caveat - S and R persist because a discourse for each context is read in textual order. We can define a context as an environment in which events occur, such as the main part of the document, the reported speech, or the conditional world of an if sentence (Hornstein, 1990). For example: (4) Emmanuel had said \"This will explode!\" but changed his mind."}, {"heading": "2.3 Capturing the time points with TimeML", "text": "TimeML is a rich, evolved standard for temporal annotation. There are valuable resources that have been commented on with TimeML and have withstood considerable scrutiny. However, TimeML does not address the issue of annotating Reichenbach's tense model with the aim of understanding reference time or creating resources that allow a detailed examination of the connections between verbal events in the discourse. Although TimeML allows annotating tense cases for < EVENT > s, it is not possible to clearly map their tenses to Reichenbach's model, which limits how well we can argue about verbal events with TimeML-annotated documents. From the usable information for mapping TimeML annotations to Reichenbach's points of time, TimeML describes the tense attribute as the relationship between S and E, and its aspect attribute can distinguish between PERFECTIVE and NONE - i.e., between an E; an E and an English R =."}, {"heading": "3 Overview of RTMML", "text": "The RTMML annotation scheme is designed to describe the verbal event structure detailed in Reichenbach (1947) in order to allow the relative temporal positioning of reference, event and speech times. A simple approach is to define a markup that describes only the information we are interested in and can be integrated with TimeML. For meaningful clarity, we use our own tags, but it is possible (with minor modifications) to incorporate them into a discourse, such as T1.. Tn or V1.. Vn. We mark times to resolve positive uses of the reference point (e.g. TimeML TIMEX3s and such EVENTs whose lexical implementation is a verb). We mark times to resolve this reference point. For each verbal event Vi we can describe VltS or assign three dates VltS, Ei and Ri. < < In addition, we will define a point, &ltT, and we can each set a reference point < E in relation to each other."}, {"heading": "3.1 Annotation schema", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "3.2 Reasoning and inference rules", "text": "Our three relationships <, = and > are all transitive. A minimal annotation is acceptable. S, E and R of all verbs, SD and all T can represent nodes on a graph that are connected by edges that are labeled with the relationship between the nodes. To position all times in a document with maximum precision, i.e. to label as many edges as possible in such a graph, one can generate a conclusion by deriving relationships using an age-related algorithm such as that specified in Setzer et al. (2005)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Integration with TimeML", "text": "To use RTMML as an ISO TimeML extension, we recommend that instead of < timerefx > s, reference is made to < TIMEX3 > elements with their tid attribute; references to < doc > instead to < TIMEX3 >, which describes the time of document creation; the attributes of < verb > elements (except xml: id and target) can be added to < MAKEINSTANCE > or < EVENT > elements, and < rtmlink > s refer to event identifiers or event identifiers."}, {"heading": "4 Examples", "text": "In this section we will give developed examples of RTMML notation and show how it can be used to arrange events and position events on an external time scale."}, {"heading": "4.1 Annotation example", "text": "Here we demonstrate RTMML annotations to two short pieces of text."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Fiction", "text": "From David Copperfield by Charles Dickens: (6) When he hung up his things for the night, he took out his flute and blew on it until I almost thought he would blow his whole being into the big hole at the top and burn on the keys. We give RTMML for the first five verbal events from Example 6 RTMML in Figure 1. The fifth, v5, exists in a context initiated by v4; its reference time is defined as such. We can use a connecting element to show that v2, v3, and v4 all use the same reference time as v1. The temporal relationship between event times from v1 to v2 can be derived from their common reference time and tensions; that is, given that v1 is anterior past and v2 is simple past, we know Ev1 < Rv1 and Ev2 = Rv2."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Editorial news", "text": "From an editorial in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) (AP9008150044.tml): (7) Saddam seemed to accept a border demarcation treaty he rejected in peace talks after the August 1988 ceasefire with Iran. < doc time = \"1990-08-15T00: 44\" / > < verb xml: id = \"v1\" target = \"# token1\" view = \"simple\" tense = \"past\" / > < < verb xml: id = \"v2\" target = \"token9\" target = \"# token10\" term \"tense\" past \"/ > rtmlink xml: id\" past \"< rtmlink xml: id =\" l1, \"rtmlink xltmlink xml: id =\" in the end. \""}, {"heading": "4.2 Linking events to calendrical references", "text": "RTMML allows us to accurately describe the nature of the linkages between verbal events and times via the positioning use of the reference point.

In some cases, it is possible to resolve such ambiguities. Even if view and tension cannot be clearly determined, it is possible to define relationships between S, E and R; for example, for arrangements that correspond to the simple future, S < E. In cases where ambiguities cannot be resolved, one can comment on a separation of relationship types; in this example, we could have \"S < R or S = R\" with sr = \"< =.\" Contexts seem to have a common speaking time, and the S \u2212 R relationship seems to be the same in a context. Sentences that run counter to this (e.g. \"At the time I ran, John will have arrived\") are rather clumsy. RTMML comments are not bound to a particular language, and as long as a segmentation scheme is agreed upon (e.g. Wordg-1 and a particular system)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Development", "text": "The ability to recognize and represent reference time in the discourse can help to clearly define temporal references, determine temporal relationships between events, and generate reasonably tense expressions. A first step in creating computational tools to this end is to develop an annotation scheme to record the relevant temporal information in the discourse. To this end, we have presented RTMML, our annotation for Reichenbach's model of tension in natural language. We do not intend to compete with existing languages that are well equipped to comment on temporal information in documents; RTMML can be integrated with TimeML. What is new about RTMML is the ability to capture the abstract parts of tension in language. We can now comment on Reichenbach's points in a document and then process them, for example, to observe interactions between temporal expressions and events, or to track reference time through discourse."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors would like to thank David Elson for his valuable comments and the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council for their support in the form of a doctoral fellowship."}], "references": [{"title": "Towards task-based temporal extraction and recognition", "author": ["Ahn et al.2005] D.
