Introduction", "text": "The task of automatically determining the temporal relations that exist between the events described in a text is a specific challenge that concerns researchers in the processing of data (Setzer and Gaizauskas, 2000; Pustejovsky et al., 2004; Verhagen et al., 2010). The mechanisms used to communicate temporal information are complex and include temporal orders and specific lexical links; and, of course, readers and authors express their knowledge of probable event sequences and interactions."}, {"heading": "2. Temporal Signals", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Linguistic Characterisation", "text": "Signal expressions explicitly indicate the existence and nature of a temporal relationship between two events or states, or between an event or state and a point in time or interval. Therefore, a time signal has two arguments that are the temporal \"entities\" that are related to each other. One of these arguments can be deictic instability directly related to an event or time; anaphorical temporal references are also allowed; for example, the temporal function and arguments of the afterlife are clear and available in the immediately surrounding text after a long working day. Afterwards, he quickly finished his meal and left us to locate the second argument. Sometimes, a signal seems to lack an argument; for example, sentence beginning signals with only one event in the sentence are clear and available (\"Later they have eased.\") They relate an event in their sentence to the present temporal concentration of the discourse."}, {"heading": "2.2. TimeML and TimeBank", "text": "TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2004) is a temporal annotation language. It can be used to annotate events, time expressions or timeframes (times, dates, durations), temporal relationships between events and times (such as before or during), and signal expressions - words or phrases (such as conjunctions, adverbials) that provide information about temporal relationships. TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) is currently the largest TimeML commented gold standard corpus available, including over 6,000 timeframe annotations, as well as events, times, and signals. It consists of approximately 65,000 tokens of English message wire text. TimeML provides the following definition of the temporal signal. Of the annotation guidelines 1: A signal is a textual element that explicitly identifies the relationship between two entities (timeframe and event, timeframe and event) as a time signal."}, {"heading": "2.3. Previous Work", "text": "Signals help to generate a well-structured discourse. Temporal signals can enable context shifts and orders (Hitzeman, 1997), so these signal expressions function as discourse segmentation markers (Ho-Dac and Pe-ry-Woodley, 2008). However, the correct inclusion of such explicit markers has been shown to facilitate the processing of texts for human readers (Bestgen and Vonk, 1999). Some previous work has approached the linguistic characterization of signals. Bre'e et al. (1986) conducted a study of temporal conjunctions and prepositions and proposed rules for distinguishing temporal and non-temporal uses of signal expressions that fall into these classes. However, this work is purely theoretical and not a corpus-based study. Schl\u00fcter (2001) identifies signal expressions that are used with the present perfect and compares their frequency in British and US English when presented as a modified signal framework in 1993 (see 2.semantic framework)."}, {"heading": "3. Signals in TimeBank", "text": "In this section we give a detailed profile of the temporal signals in the TimeBank corpus. Statistics are generated using the CAVaT tool (Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2010a) for TimeML commented corpus analysis. First, we note that TimeML signals can be divided into three classes depending on the type of relationship they signal: temporal (tlink), subordinate (slink) or aspectional (alink)."}, {"heading": "3.1. Additional Annotation", "text": "Because we were certain of some annotation errors in the source data, we re-examined the original annotations. A subset of signal words was selected to remark, which consisted of signals that were ambiguous (occurred about 50% of the time) or that we expected to result in a number of missed temporal annotations based on informal observations. TimeML re-commented on all temporal instances of these words, adding EVENTs, TIMEX3s, and TLINKs where necessary to generate a signaled TLINK. A single annotator reviewed the source documents and commented on 70 additional signals, as well as 34 events, a time expression, and 49 additional time associations."}, {"heading": "3.2. Proportion of Temporal Relations with Signals", "text": "The TimeBank contains 6,418 TLINKs (6,467 after re-annotation), of which 718 (787) are explicitly identified by a time signal - 11.2% (12.2%) - which answers the first question we posed in Section 1. So while the ability to successfully detect time signals will not solve the problem of time relationship mapping, it is likely to make a noticeable difference (see Derczynski and Gaizauskas (2010b)). Perhaps more interesting is that so few time relations are explicitly signaled - we need to look elsewhere for explanations of how time relations are transmitted in natural language."}, {"heading": "3.3. Temporal vs Non-temporal Uses", "text": "The semantic function of a temporal signal expression is to correlate two temporal entities, but the words that can act as temporal signals also play a different role. Table 4 describes the distribution of expressions that occur as temporal signals more than twice (after re-annotation) in TimeBank. The most common signal word was \"in,\" which accounts for 24.8% of all signals that use TLINKs. However, only 13.3% of the occurrences of the word \"in\" have a temporal meaning. The word \"after\" is far more likely (91.7% of all occurrences) to have a temporal meaning. Overall, TimeBank contains 62 distinct signal words and phrases (disregarding the case) and of these, over half (36) are also found in Table 4. Apart from this, any notion that temporal signals could be easily selected based on the word class can be dispersed by studying the distribution of temporal signals of possessed speech parts - see Table 3."}, {"heading": "3.4. Relation Ambiguity", "text": "The nature of the temporal relationship described by a signal is not constant, although each signal tends to describe a particular type of relationship most frequently. Table 5 shows an extract of data showing which temporal relationships are explicitly made by each signal expression. The variation of the relationship type associated with a signal is not as great as it may seem, since the mapping of the temporal relationship type has an element of arbitrariness - one can comment on a pre or post-relationship for the same pair of events, for example, simply by reversing the argument order of the temporal link. Nevertheless, it is possible to extract useful information from the table; one can see, for example, that it is now much more likely to imply some kind of temporal overlap between events than a sequence in which arguments occur discreetly."}, {"heading": "4. Per-expression details", "text": "In fact, it is a purely reactionary project, which is about being a reactionary project, about realizing a reactionary project that is capable of getting involved in a reactionary situation."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "We have presented a characterization of temporal signal expressions. In an analysis of the TimeBank corpus, we have shown what proportion of temporal relationships are explicitly signaled by these expressions, and provided quantitative descriptions of how ambiguous these expressions are, both in terms of their temporal / non-temporal senses and the nature of the temporal relationship they convey."}, {"heading": "5.1.
