Gold standard temporally-annotated resources are limited in size, which makes research using them difficult. Standards have also evolved over the past decade, so not all temporally annotated data is in the same format. We vastly increase available human-annotated temporal expression resources by converting older format resources to TimeML/TIMEX3. This task is difficult due to differing annotation methods. We present a robust conversion tool and a new, large temporal expression resource. Using this, we evaluate our conversion process by using it as training data for an existing TimeML annotation tool, achieving a 0.87 F1 measure -- better than any system in the TempEval-2 timex recognition exercise.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Mar 2012 18:45:07 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5076v1", "Proc.

Since some things commented as TIMEX2s are no longer considered part of temporal expressions in TimeML and are instead assigned to other functions, T2T3 creates not only TIMEX3s, but also additional TimeML elements. T2T3 is evaluated with TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) and 50 ACE TERN documents.

In this section, we detail our handling of the source data sets and our solutions to linguistic and technical shortcomings of the original T2T3 when applied to these records. Our general approach consists of three phases. First, we prepare the source data sets in a uniform format, running T2T3 over each document individually. Finally, we wrap the resulting annotations in TimeML headers and footers and validate them. This process produces a corpus based on gold standard annotations, although it cannot be called the gold standard as the machine-generated annotations have not all been manually checked and corrected."}, {"heading": "3.1.

Nested expressions", "text": "As discussed in Section 2, TIMEX2 generates annotations larger than 3 that may be nested (as in Example 2) and T2T3 does not handle them; they must be mapped to multiple TIMEX3 annotations, possibly with an associated anchorTimeID attribute or temporal relationship. This would look like: (8) < TIMEX3 tid = \"t1\" type = \"DATE\" value = \"1999-W23\" > the week long duration, two single specific days, and the temporal relations between all three. This would look like: (8) < TIMEX3 tid = \"t1\" type = \"DATE\" value = \"1999-W23\" > the week < SIGNAL sid = \"s1\" of < / SIGNAL sid > of < / SIGNAL > T2 \"type =\" t2. \""}, {"heading": "3.1.3. Brevity", "text": "We automatically shorten long periods of time. TIMEX3 annotations are minimal - that is, including the minimum amount of words that can describe a temporal expression - where TIMEX2 can contain whole phrases. Even after reducing the length of annotations that contain temporal substructors, in some cases a significant amount of text may remain. To accomplish this, we implement the reduction of long TIMEX2s to only the TIMEX3 functional part. This is done by measuring the distribution of TIMEX3 token lengths in gold standard corpora and determining a section. This distribution is shown in Table 2. All TIMEX2s of six tokens or more not yet covered by the above algorithms are analyzed syntactically, and are then reduced to the largest constituting chunk that is shorter than six tokens and contains a time bar word, giving preference to the left arguments. Example 9 shows a long TIMEX2 days (shortended from these days to four)."}, {"heading": "3.1.4. Technical changes", "text": "To speed up processing, we switched to NLTK5 for PoS tagging, a maximum entropy-based tagger trained at Penn Treebank. We also discontinued lemmatization, as it is never used in practice. To further speed up, we implemented a timex phrase PoS tagging cache, which has reduced execution times by two orders of magnitude. Generally, the tool has become more robust and now handles a wider range of texts and provides more precise TimeML annotations. Our work has led to a publicly available tool ranging from a public mercurial repository 6.5See http: / / www.nltk.org /. 6See http: / / bitbucket.org / leondz / t2t3."}, {"heading": "3.2. Document post-processing", "text": "After conversion of the body of text into TIMEX3, each document in TimeML is provided with an XML header and packed into < TimeML > elements.

Resource creation", "text": "In this section we describe the results of the conversion of all of the above mentioned corpora. Table 3 shows the scope of TIMEX3 and other TimeML element annotations generated by the conversion of TIMEX2. The number of TIMEX2 annotations is generally somewhat smaller; this may be caused by the removal of nested temporal expressions where the outside time is removed during the conversion. To show the time composition of the resulting corpora, Table 4 shows the distribution of the timex type in native and converted corporations; they introduce 18,803 new TIMEX3 annotations, of which 4,343 are in \"web-grade\" data - i.e. data from blogs, forum newsgroups and Wikipedia, including 2,676 from Wikiwars (Wikipedia) and the remainder from ACE2005 - 675 from newsgroups, 20 from community forums and 972 from text crafted for automatic web development, which is an important resource for the consistent web."}, {"heading": "5. Evaluation", "text": "We evaluate the impact of our new resources by measuring the performance of a state-of-the-art time detector, TIPSem-B (Llorens et al., 2010), which achieves competitive performance when trained via the TimeBank and AQUAINT corpora. We extend its training set to include our newly generated data. Our assessment includes time detection (both detection and interpretation) using the following data: 1. New (T2T3) data when trained on the basis of previous data (TimeBank + AQUAINT) to show the \"difficulty\" of the new data in light of current TIMEX3 training resources; 2. A mixture of previous and T2T3 data with an 80 / 20 training / test split to show how the detection method handles the new data (TimeBank + AQUAINT); 3. Prior data with an 80 / 20 training test / split to show how the detection method handles the new data; and 2."}, {"heading": "5.1. General recognition", "text": "The Timex detection performance of our T2T3 data from systems trained with previous Newswire-only corpora was low, with an F1 measurement of less than 50%. This suggests that existing resources are insufficient to develop generic Timex detection models that are effective outside the Newswire genre. However, existing detection methods are able to adapt to the new corpora as some of the training data from itas is available; an 80 / 20 training / test split of combined Newswire / T2T3 periods led to F1 measurements in the 1970s."}, {"heading": "5.2. Improving performance on newswire", "text": "It is useful to measure performance against a TempEval-2-like task - the detection of time intervals in the TimeBank / AQUAINT TimeML corpora. To this end, we determined an 80 / 20 training / test split of TBAQ (TimeBank + AQUAINT) and measured system performance against a model learned from the training data. Subsequently, the large T2T3-generated resource is added to the training data, re-learning the detection model, and evaluating performance. As the results show, the larger set of more varied training data represents an improvement over the TimeBank set. Recall increases significantly at the expense of some precision between both evaluation measures, which is consistent with what would be expected given a much broader range of expressions in the training data. The end result for TempEval-2 F1 is greater than the best value achieved during the TempEval-2 evaluation task."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "In order to detect and overcome problems with the TIMEX2 / TIMEX3 conversion, we have developed a robust tool for converting TIMEX2 resources to TimeML / TIMEX3. Thus, we have created a TIMEX3 resource of an order of magnitude that contains more annotations than all previous resources put together. It contains new information about time expressions and is useful for training automatic time lapse annotation systems. We have made both the transfer tool and the TIMEX3 annotation results available as part of a public repository. Version 1.0 of the data is available as a single release on the project page (distribution licenses apply)."}, {"heading": "6.1. Future Work", "text": "Since TIMEX2 resources exist in languages other than English (especially Spanish and German), T2T3 can be expanded to accommodate these and English. Furthermore, the wide variety of phrasing of temporal expressions in the corpora presented in this essay, together with its TIMEX3 annotations, is a significant boon to those who deal with the problem of Timex normalization."}, {"heading": "6.2.

Gold standard temporally-annotated resources are limited in size, which makes research using them difficult. Standards have also evolved over the past decade, so not all temporally annotated data is in the same format. We vastly increase available human-annotated temporal expression resources by converting older format resources to TimeML/TIMEX3. This task is difficult due to differing annotation methods. We present a robust conversion tool and a new, large temporal expression resource. Using this, we evaluate our conversion process by using it as training data for an existing TimeML annotation tool, achieving a 0.87 F1 measure \u2013 better than any system in the TempEval-2 timex recognition exercise.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
