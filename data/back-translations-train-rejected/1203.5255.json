RELATED WORK", "text": "In this context, various error correction methods exist, the purpose of which is to detect and correct erroneous words generated by ASR systems. Generally, they can be divided into several categories: manual error correction, error correction based on alternative hypotheses, error correction and error correction generated by the ASR system. This is to some extent time-consuming and error-prone, as the human eye can overlook some errors; another category is alternative error correction, in which an error is replaced by an alternative word correction called hypotheses. The main drawback of this method is that the hypotheses are usually derived from a lexicon of words; and hence it is susceptible to achieving a high vocabulary rate."}, {"heading": "IV. PROPOSED SOLUTION", "text": "This paper proposes a new approach and algorithm for ASR error correction based on Bing's spell-matching technology [7], the idea being to use Bing's enormous indexed data to detect and correct genuine word errors that occur in ASR-detected output text. In other words, the error correction is applied to verify the final text resulting from the conversion of the input wave to text, and therefore referred to as post-processing error correction. The algorithm starts by splitting the ASR output text into multiple word marks, and then each token is sent as a search query to Bing's web search engine. If this query contains a misspelled word, Bing suggests a spell-correction for it, and as a result the algorithm replaces it with the spell-suggestion."}, {"heading": "A. Bing\u2019s Spelling Suggestion", "text": "Bing's Spelling Suggestion Technology can suggest alternative corrections for common typos, spelling errors, and keyboard errors. However, at its core, Bing has a colossal database of billions of online web pages that contain trillions of collections of terms and N-gram words that can be used as the basis for all kinds of linguistic applications such as machine translation, speech recognition, spell checking, and other types of word processing problems. Basically, Bing's Spelling Suggestion Algorithm is based on the probabilistic N-gram model originally proposed by Markov [22] for predicting the next word in a particular sequence of words. In short, an n-gram is simply a collection of words that are N-words long. For example, \"The boy\" is a 2-gram phrase also referred to as Bigram, \"The boy scout\" is a 3-gram phrase that is also referred to as a trigram, \"The car keeps asking for every possible gram, and the next one is an algorithm.\""}, {"heading": "B. ASR Model", "text": "The proposed error correction method is carried out during the post-processing phase of an ASR system and is based on Bing's spelling suggestion. Prior to post-processing the detected text with the proposed algorithm, a standard ASR system is fed with an input waveform representing the language to be detected. Subsequently, the signal is digitally processed to extract its spectral characteristics and audible telephones. Subsequently, the probability of an observed phoneme containing an extracted spectral feature is calculated by the acoustic model (AM) and its Hidden Markov model (HMM) and the phonetic lexicon. In parallel, the speech model (LM) calculates the probability that the received phone will appear in the language. Finally, a decoding module statistically infects the spoken words and generates the final output texture."}, {"heading": "C. The Error Correction Algorithm", "text": "The proposed algorithm includes several steps that need to be performed to detect and correct ASR spelling errors. The algorithm starts by dividing the recognized output protocol into several tokens T = {t1... tn}, each consisting of 6 words, ti = {w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5}, where ti is a specific token and wj is a single word or term in that token. Subsequently, each ti is sent to be validated using the Bing search engine. The search results returned by Bing are then evaluated to determine whether or not they contain the \"inclusion results for ci,\" where ci is the proposed correction for ti. If applicable, then Token ti must contain a specific misspelled word; and therefore ti is replaced by ci. Ultimately, after all tokens are validated, all original correct tokens O = {t1} plus the text {tk} are then presented as corrected with {1}."}, {"heading": "D.

EXPERIMENTS EVALUATION", "text": "The experiments conducted with the proposed ASR error correction algorithm apparently showed a 458% improvement in the error correction rate for English and 537% for French. In other words, approximately 4.5 times more English errors were detected and corrected, and 5.3 times more French errors were detected and corrected. On average, the proposed algorithm improved the error correction rate by I = (458% + 537%) / 2 = 497%, increasing the overall error detection and correction rate by a factor of 4.9. Table 1 summarizes the experimental results obtained for the proposed ASR error correction algorithm before and after editing. In this paper, a new ASR method for post-processing error correction based on Bing's online spelling suggestion technology was presented. The backbone of this technology is a large set of words and phrases extracted from bining and online documents, such as original and online sources."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This research was funded by the Lebanese Association of Computer Sciences (LACSC), Beirut, Lebanon, as part of the Web-Scale Speech Recognition Research Project - WSSRRP2011."}], "references": [{"title": "Fundamentals of Speech Recognition", "author": ["L.
