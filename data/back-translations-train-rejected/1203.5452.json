INTRODUCTIONIndividuals and groups cooperate by producing, manipulating, and organizing knowledge, and by building and refining new collective knowledge. Organizations increasingly see their intellectual capital as strategic resources that need to be managed effectively to gain competitive advantages."}, {"heading": "A. Knowledge Management", "text": "Knowledge is a somewhat elusive concept [2] with many different definitions. For example, [3] describes knowledge under five different perspectives: state of mind, object, process, access to information and skills. Knowledge is considered to be the sum of information in the context that depends on the social group that creates it [4]. In this paper, we adopt the definition proposed in [5]: Knowledge as a fluid mixture of framed experience, values, contextual information and expert knowledge that provides a framework for the evaluation and inclusion of new experiences and information. Knowledge management is widely regarded as a process that combines different activities. Following a literature study of KM practices, generic KM activities are synthesized as follows: creating (developing new understandings), collecting (acquiring and recording knowledge), organizing (establishing and contextualizing so that aggregated knowledge can be made easily accessible), using (applying knowledge to a task)."}, {"heading": "B. Collaboration", "text": "We have two perspectives on collaboration: the first is that collaboration can be seen as the combination of communication, coordination and cooperation [9] and [10]; communication is related to the exchange of messages and information between people; coordination is related to the management of people's activities and resources; and cooperation is related to production taking place in a common space; and the second is that collaboration is a coordinated activity that attempts to construct and maintain a common conception of a problem [11]; Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) is seen as an attempt to understand the nature and characteristics of collaborative work [12]; it demonstrates the scientific study and theory of how people cooperate; how computers and related technologies influence group behavior; and how technology (groupware) can best be designed and built to facilitate group work [9]."}, {"heading": "C. Collaborative Knowledge Management (CKM)", "text": "KM and collaboration are complementary [13]. We identify several terms used to denote the convergence of KM and cooperation: Shared Knowledge Management can be considered a process of collective problem solving, in which it is useful to remember the process of collective decision-making and to structure group interactions to facilitate problem-solving and the exchange of ideas [14]. Shared Knowledge Building can be defined as a sequential social process in which participants jointly construct knowledge through social interactions and which includes several distinct phases that constitute a cycle of personal and social knowledge building [15]. Shared Knowledge Building can be considered as the development of a shared knowledge repository on groupware, in which conflicts and dissenting opinions are an important source for communicating this knowledge and the resolution of which generates new cooperative knowledge [16]. Shared Knowledge Building can be explained as a learning process in which cooperative groups build on the new ideas of other people and express and modify disagreements."}, {"heading": "D. Proposal of generic framework of CKM", "text": "In order to synthesize the convergence of collaboration and KM, we propose a generic framework based on three spaces: Collaboration Space: concerns the management of collaborative tasks and includes communication, coordination, co-production and awareness. Through awareness, participants can be aware and receive feedback from their actions and from the actions of their companions through meta-knowledge. Awareness Meta-knowledge takes into account who (participant), what (collective knowledge), when and where (time and space) of this process. KM Space: concerns the management of (collective) knowledge and includes the strategies of KM: codification (which considers the computer as human interaction) and personalization (which considers the computer as human-human interaction). Actors Space: concerns the management and representation of the different actors and their roles. There are three types of actors: individuals (who work independently in a private context), groups (dependent individuals who work together in a common context and explicitly commit themselves to achieve a common goal)."}, {"heading": "A. MDM specification", "text": "Our goal is to focus on multimodal decision-making processes."}, {"heading": "B. MDM Formal description", "text": "To formalize and organize the MDM process, we propose a formal description using the vector model as follows: < A, P, S, D >. Where A contains actors involved in the different activities of the MDM, and thus A = < Ap, As, Ad >: Ap represents the actors involved in problem conception, | Ap | = nbr (problem formulator).A, a = < a1, a2,..., a > where ai represents attributes of such a profile. Then, P represents the problem description: P = < p1, p2,..., pm > where Pi represents attributes of P.S, when ai represents the profile of a.Then, P represents the problem description: P = < p1, p2, pm > when P.S represents the solution space."}, {"heading": "C.
