An intelligent interactive interface design for folksonomies should consider the contextual design and inquiry based on a concurrent interaction for a perceptual user interfaces. To represent folksonomies a new concept structure called \"Folksodriven\" is used in this paper.

The user is able to dynamically modify the pie chart as he or she deems appropriate without having to fill in tables or tables and calculate the data values beforehand. To reduce the effort for the developer and not require the user to download additional software, the current implementation does not use proprietary technology for developing the graphical pie chart - such as Flash or Silverlight. Data from the chart can simply be linked to a table, while the pie chart event handler can be performed using mouse interaction. Thus, the canvas element will be part of the HTML5 standard, so that this interactive pie chart will ultimately be available to all browsers. Data processing in the browser has been encoded in JavaScript so that it can be easily developed and encapsulated. However, calling the function of the pie chart on the page of the pie chart (the pie chart) is designed with the help of the pie chart (the pie interaction) in the browser is not."}, {"heading": "B.
