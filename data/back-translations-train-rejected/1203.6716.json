Fig. 3 shows that if the knowledge \"computer can store, retrieve, and process information,\" then the three concepts of storage, retrieval, and processing are incoherently linked to the computer concept. 2) Each knowledge unit is a concept: Each knowledge unit is like a concept, and each concept can be represented by a KNN, i.e. each concept is a KNN.3) Assignment of performance properties a) Additive / Subtractive: Some of the concepts add additional information to other concepts, in these cases the connection that connects these concepts is additive."}, {"heading": "B.
