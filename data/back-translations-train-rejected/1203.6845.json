Introduction and Characteristics of the Biomedical Domain", "text": "The proliferation of documentation and the urge to find relevant answers make biomedical literature an excellent candidate for applying textual treatment techniques for information retrieval (IR). Indeed, the query of biomedical data capable of identifying themselves varies widely. Indeed, the query of biomedical data used in biomedicine usually takes place in other areas. Techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Extraction (IE) and Data Mining have become indispensable in order to identify and interpret these enormous amounts of data. These techniques, which are usually referred to as text mining in biomedical literature, are applied to IR systems (Table 1), and they take on certain characteristics when applied in this area, due to the domain's own characteristics and terminology."}, {"heading": "2.

Conclusions", "text": "Biomedicine has many peculiarities in terms of the techniques and resources used to gather information, which are very diverse and pose many problems for IR systems, where the lack of terminological consensus and patterns in the terminology used are two of the most important. The former concerns the construction and integration of knowledge organization systems and their application on IR systems, while the latter restricts the use of machine learning techniques. Given the traditional consensus problems in biology, both in terms of nomenclature and organization, the use of the Internet and the standardization of resources prevail, with formats and construction rules. Initiatives to normalize terminology, such as those undertaken by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO, http: / / www.hugo-international.org), and standardized tagging methods can contribute to improving success rates in data collection, as well as the effective use of semantic tagging tools to support a corporate tagging process."}], "references": [{"title": "Text Mining for Biology and Biomedicine", "author": ["Ananiadou S", "McNaught Je"], "venue": "Artech House; 2006.
