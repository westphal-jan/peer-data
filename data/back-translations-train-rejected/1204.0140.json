Today, there are many ways to obtain large-format dictionaries: search terms on the Internet (Turney, 2001), use large corporations such as the Wall Street Journal or the British National Corpus, as well as information from machine-readable dictionaries (Wilks et al., 1996), or use electronic lexical databases such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). Which of these methods is the best? Our intuition presented in this dissertation is that computational linguists should expand and computerize the work of lexicographers, professionals who take concrete decisions about words, their senses and how they should be arranged. Computer programmers have unimaginable ideas that they can do without linguists. To investigate this conjecture, I have implemented an alarming electronic lexical knowledge base based on the 1987 Penguin issue of Roesauget."}, {"heading": "1.2 Electronic Lexical Knowledge Bases", "text": "In fact, most people are able to decide for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "1.4 Goals of this Thesis", "text": "I expect it to be an effective alternative to WordNet.

Most of the known WordNet-based implementations of lexical chains consider only nouns. This may be due to limitations in WordNet, in particular the fact that the IS-A hierarchy, which is indispensable for must systems, is only comprehensively developed for nouns and self-concepts.

To achieve this, several sub-goals had to be achieved: the first is the design and implementation of the ELKB; the second is the conduct of NLP experiments, the results of which are compared with those of WordNet-based systems; the third is the quantitative comparison of bothlexical knowledge bases.Chapter 1 presents the context, objectives and organization of these theories. Chapter 2 describes a brief history of how computer-based linguists have used Thesauri in NLP; discusses the different versions of Rogets and explains the reasons for selecting the 1987 editionof Penguin's Thesaurus of English words and phrases as the source for the ELKB. Thischapter discusses several applications of Rogets Thesaurus and WordNet."}, {"heading": "7.2 Conclusions", "text": "This dissertation has shown that it is possible to computerize Roget's Thesaurus 7.0 so that it maintains all the functionality of the printed version and allows manipulations that are suitable for NLP applications. I have used the ELKB in a few experiments, but these are not enough to determine whether it is a credible alternative to WordNet. I offer a few ideas for those who intend to use the ELKB or want to build a similar knowledge base. 7.2.1 Building an ELKB from an existing Lexical ResourceBuilding at ELKB is a very attractive alternative to WordNet. Computerlinguist can save a lot of time by using the structure and lexical material tasks contained in existing dictionaries and thesauri. I have encountered two major problems that are not known about the implementation of the ELKB systems. The lexicographer guidelines are not known and it is very tedious to understand the organization of paragraphs and semicolon decisions without explanations for the semicolon decisions."}, {"heading": "7.2.5.1 Retrieval of Phrases", "text": "The ELCTB does not perform morphological transformations when searching for a phrase. If, however, it does not provide the exact string contained in the index, no result will be returned. For example, the phrase \"sixty-four thousand dollar question\" will not be found because Chapter 7 Summary, Discussion, and Future Work contains 81 precise strings in the ELCTB \"the sixty-four thousand dollar question.\" Giving access to all of Roget's phrases is a difficult problem to solve, but one that deserves attention. The thesaurus contains many phrases, some of which are very strange, such as \"Cheshire Catgrin,\" \"Homeric Laughter,\" or \"the smartest fool in Christianity.\" It may be an area where the ELCTB is superior to WordNet. I have not examined this. An ideal solution would be to incorporate into the index a method that filters out all phrases that contain certain words."}, {"heading": "7.2.5.2 Displaying the Semicolon Group Which Contains a Variant of the Search Word", "text": "As described in Chapter 3, when searching for a word, morphological transformations are performed to find all the matching entries included in the index. For example, when a user types in the word tire, the ELKB finds the words tire and tire in the index. The reference fortyre is wheel 250 N. The system finds the Head 250 Circularity: Simple Circularity: Simple Circularity and finds the paragraph of the wheel name. The ELKB searches the paragraph sequentially until the word tire is found. Since tire is the word in the paragraph, the correct semicolon group is not returned. This causes a slight problem in calculating the semantic distance. For example, the system determines the distance between the words hub and tire to 2 instead of 0, since the words do not appear in the semicolon group; hub, felly, felly, tire;. This is not difficult to correct, but awkward, so I have left it as one of several future adjustments."}, {"heading": "7.2.5.3 Original vs. New Index", "text": "The ELKB uses an index that is generated from all the words and phrases it contains. Pearson Education provides an index that is about half the size of the one automatically generated, and the system stores both in separate files that cannot be used at the same time. I would have reproduced Roget's thesaurus more faithfully if the entries in the index had been marked as original and new. Chapter 7.

Performance can be improved by loading the text of the 990 heads into memory and storing absolute references to paragraphs and semicolon groups as described in Chapter 3.

A comparison with other versions of Roget's Thesaurus, namely the 1911 edition, FACTOTUM and Roget's International Thesaurus, should be avoided. Until this is done, I cannot say how good this version of Roget is compared to all the others. Future research should conduct further benchmark experiments with the ELKB, namely WordSense Disambiguation.

To answer correctly dog: bark, a system must know that meowing is the sound a cat makes, and bark the sound a dog makes. Both of these applications can be implemented with the ELK.

It has been accepted and used extensively by computational<lb>linguists ever since it was released. Some of its applications include information retrieval,<lb>language generation, question answering, text categorization, text classification and word sense<lb>disambiguation. Inspired by WordNet's success, we propose as an alternative a similar resource,<lb>based on the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases. Peter Mark Roget published his first Thesaurus over 150 years ago. Countless writers, orators<lb>and students of the English language have used it. Computational linguists have employed<lb>Roget\u2019s for almost 50 years in Natural Language Processing. Some of the tasks they have used it<lb>for include machine translation, computing lexical cohesion in texts and constructing databases<lb>that can infer common sense knowledge. This dissertation presents Roget\u2019s merits by explaining<lb>what it really is and how it has been used, while comparing its applications to those of WordNet.<lb>The NLP community has hesitated in accepting Roget\u2019s Thesaurus because a proper machine-<lb>tractable version was not available. This dissertation presents an implementation of a machine-tractable version of the 1987 Penguin<lb>edition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus \u2013 the first implementation of its kind to use an entire current<lb>edition. It explains the steps necessary for taking a machine-readable file and transforming it into<lb>a tractable system. This involves converting the lexical material into a format that can be more<lb>easily exploited, identifying data structures and designing classes to computerize the Thesaurus.<lb>Roget\u2019s organization is studied in detail and contrasted with WordNet\u2019s. We show two applications of the computerized Thesaurus: computing semantic similarity<lb>between words and phrases, and building lexical chains in a text. The experiments are performed<lb>using well-known benchmarks and the results are compared to those of other systems that use<lb>Roget\u2019s, WordNet and statistical techniques. Roget\u2019s has turned out to be an excellent resource<lb>for measuring semantic similarity; lexical chains are easily built but more difficult to evaluate.<lb>We also explain ways in which Roget\u2019s Thesaurus and WordNet can be combined.
