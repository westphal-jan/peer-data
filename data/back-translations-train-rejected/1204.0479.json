Collaborative planning is used to coordinate individual plans of self-interested decision makers with private information in order to increase the overall benefit of the coalition. The method consists of a new search graph based on encoded solutions. Distributed and private information is integrated via voting mechanisms and via a simple but effective collaborative local search procedure. The approach is applied to a distributed variant of the multi-level lot-sizing problem and evaluated by means of 352 benchmark instances from the literature. The proposed approach clearly outperforms existing approaches on the sets of medium and large sized instances. While the best method in the literature so far achieves an average deviation from the best known non-distributed solutions of 46 percent for the set of the largest instances, for example, the presented approach reduces the average deviation to only 5 percent.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 2 Apr 2012 17:44:45 GMT  (179kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0479v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DC", "authors": ["tobias buer", "j\\\"org homberger", "hermann gehring"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.0479"}, "pdf": {"name": "1204.0479.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Tobias Buer", "J\u00f6rg Homberger", "Hermann Gehring"], "emails": ["tobias.buer@uni-bremen.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 120 4.04 79v1 [cs.AI] 2A prKeywords: Group Decisions and Negotiations; Metaheuristics; Joint Planning; Ant Colony Optimization; Lot Size"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction and literature review", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "2 A distributed multi-level uncapacitated lot-sizing problem", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Classical centralized problem formulation", "text": "The distributed batch size model examined in this paper covers the well-known multi-stage, uncapacitated batch size problem (MLULSP, cf.

The distributed solution approach is called a collaborative ant colony metaheuristic (CACM). An overview is given by Alg. 1. The metaheuristic CACM works on an encrypted representation of a DMLULSP solution, which is described in Sect. 3.2. Components of an encrypted solution are represented by a searchgraph G, which is traversed by artificial ants to construct encrypted solutions. Sect. 3.3 presents the searchgraph G and Sect. 3.4 presents the stochastic ant building method. Each constructed solution is improved by a collaborative local search (cf. Sect. 3.5). Both, the graph structure used and the local search heuristic integrate new concepts in comparison to the metaheuristic solutions (2011) and (cf. Sect. 3.5)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Representation of a solution", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Solution encoding", "text": "The binary decision variables yit represent the setup decisions indicating whether item i is produced at all in period t. Due to the structure of the MLULSP, it is possible to determine the optimal lot sizes xit when the optimal setup decisions yit are known (Dellaert and Jeunet, 2000). Therefore, the proposed CACM focuses its search efforts on approximating the optimal setup decisions. However, the CACM does not work directly on the Yit, but indirectly on a coded representation of the setup decisions. For each binary setup decision variable yit there is a coded binary setup decision variable eit, which follows the suggestion of Homberger (2008). Both variables are related as follows: (eit = 0), (11) (eit = 1) (yit = 0)."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Solution decoding", "text": "A coded solution e- {0, 1} m \u00b7 n is converted into a DMLULSP solution in a two-step procedure.

That is, the requirements for the end products (level 0) are first determined, the requirements for level 1 items are calculated next and so on (cf. Homberger (2008). Therefore, the items are considered in the order of their non-decreasing product level. If article i is an end product (level 1), then the demand is calculated for all articles 1 \u2264 j \u2264 T.

However, in the scenario with five agents, both voting rules lead to the best results for ballot sizes of only one. In the two agent scenarios, ballot sizes lead to the second-best results.

The three variants are compared against the instances from groups s1, s2 and s5. Instances s1 correspond to the non-distributed MLULSP for which optimal solutions are known.

The search process is conducted by a mediator who is unaware of the agents \"local costs. Furthermore, agents do not have to disclose private cost information when searching. However, in order to control the search process, the mediator tries to find preferences through coordination and a new collaborative local search method. Results are used to update the pheromone information that guides the solution process. Solutions are constructed on the basis of a new graph structure based on encrypted solutions that are less complicated and therefore easier to search. The new approach CACM is evaluated on 356 benchmark instances from the literature and surpasses all existing distributed planning approaches on the basis of middle- and large-scale instances. For future research, it appears interesting to examine non-collaborative issues with a large-collaborative approach."}], "references": [{"title": "Computational complexity of uncapacitated multi-echelon", "author": ["E.

The one studied by Lee and Kumara (2007b,a) is based on auctions and has been tested on small size instances. For the other, the distributed MLULSP, several metaheuristic approaches that integrate concepts from group decision making are known in the literature: a simulated annealing approach (SA, Homberger, 2010), an approach based on an evolutionary strategy (ES, Homberger, 2011) and one based on ant colony optimization (ACO, Homberger and Gehring, 2010, 2011). These approaches differ by the used metaheuristic principle, the applied negotiation or voting mechanisms, and the relevant objective functions (minimizing total global cost or maximizing fairness). ES is especially useful for maximizing fairness. SA and ACO strive to minimize total global cost. In terms of solution quality, ACO outperforms SA on medium sized instances (40 and 50 items with 12 and 24 periods) but not on small or large instances (500 items, and 36 or 52 periods). Furthermore, ACO is significantly slower than SA on small, medium, and large instances. The aim of this paper is to present a new collaborative ant colony metaheuristic (CACM) for solving the DMLULSP under global total cost minimization.
