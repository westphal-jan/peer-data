Concluding remarks and perspectives", "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first time that the resolution of units is treated as a calculation model for functions with domain partial assignments to Boolean variables. We believe that this model is suitable to characterize the inference power of unit resolution in satellite solvers. By showing that the contradiction of units has the same significance as the propagation of units, we offer a theoretical insight into the field of coding constraint satisfaction problems in cnf for their solution thanks to satellite solvers. The underlying scientific problem is nothing less than determining the scope of application of satellite solvers: What problems can reasonably be solved by satellite solvers, what not and why? We are currently working on the characterization of matching functions that can be efficiently calculated by unit resolution, and therefore on the constraints for which there are polynomic upi and upac encodings. The next step will consist of checking the booleum for a general method to match the resolution in algorithms."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.
