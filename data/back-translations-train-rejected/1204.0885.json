But there are some cases where we cannot apply these two tuning methods, i.e. the dynamic plants whose parameters are constantly changing. In these types of systems, we have to perform real-time retuning, which cannot be applied by the tuning methods, because we first have to take the systems offline to set their parameters. In this work, we extend our previous work [1] to include the implementation of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine the PID controller parameters in order one (FOLPD) and compare the results with the Iterative Method and Non-Ziegler Rule."}, {"heading": "2.

DELAY COMPONENT", "text": "Delay in control systems can be defined as the time interval between an event that begins at one point with its output at another point within systems (49.)

APPLYING THE GENETIC ALGORITHM", "text": "There are several variables that are used as standard to measure the performance of systems. In general, input signals are used in standard steps to test the systems, and output signals are characterized by some standard power measurements: billing time, percentage overrun, error signal, rise time, peak time, and stability margin. All of these measurements are defined in time domain response, e.g. 1% criterion, 2% criterion, and 5% criterion. Here, we use 5% criterion sampling time. And for the rise time in general, the time required by systems is measured to reach from 0 to 100% of the end value or from 10% to 90% of the end value. But, for simplicity of measurement, we use nitude-nitude time as the point at which the maximum value is reached (overrun) at 3.2 systems, with the difference between the output signal and the output signal always being 1."}, {"heading": "6.

Here is the difference between two tuning methods and GA methods: While tuning methods have almost the same pattern, their value decreases with increasing time delay, except for a small delay where the Ziegler-Nichols rule indicates increasing values, GA methods give almost constant values, about 10%, as long as the time delay is not too small, except in cases optimized by ITAE, where the excess percentage fluctuates and decreases with increasing time delay. Table 1 shows that GA produces much better percentages than two other tuning methods, especially when optimized by IAE criteria. From this it can be concluded that GA can be used to optimize percent exceedances."}, {"heading": "Settling Time", "text": "The value of the settling time (5% criterion) over the entire time delay is summarized in Figure 3 (b), where it is evident that almost all methods, with the exception of the settling time optimized by IAE and ITAE, are below the same straight line with positive slope, which means that the settling time increases linearly as the delay increases. In Table 1, we see that the average settling time value is not that different between all methods in the range of 1.37 seconds to 1.54 seconds, with the exception of the settling time optimized with ITAE 0.745 seconds and IAE 1.01 seconds. However, since the other settling time results agree with two settling methods, we cannot really differentiate these results. Thus, it can be said that the settling time is not optimized by GA methods."}, {"heading": "Rise Time", "text": "The third variable is the rise time, which is shown in Figure 3 (c) using the logarithmic scale in the y-axis. We can see a strong pattern that shows almost the same value for all results, except the iterative method, over the entire time delay, and it should come as no surprise if we get almost the same average for all results, about 0.44 seconds to 0.59 seconds, with the exception of the iterative method, 0.912 seconds. Another interesting thing is that the curves generally remain unchanged in almost all time delay ranges, with the order of the greatest value: iterative method, ITAE, IAE, ITSE, ISE, MSE and Ziegler-Nichols rule. From the average (Table 1), the best result is obtained by the Ziegler-Nichols rule, 0.444 seconds, and the worst is the iterative method, 0.912 seconds, and all GA methods produce almost the same average. But because the GA non-optimization results cannot be inferred from the Ziegler rule, it is impossible to conclude that the increase is very much."}, {"heading": "Peak Time", "text": "With the exception of the iterative method, which is 3.43 seconds, all other methods have a peak time of about 0.57 seconds to 0.83 seconds. The best values are given by the GA optimized by MSE and ISE, 0.576 seconds. Like the rise time in general, the curves remain unchanged in almost all areas of the time delay, with the order depending on the largest value: Iterative Method, ITAE, IAE, Ziegler-Nichols, ITSE, MSE and ISE. And because the GA methods produce peak time charts that are only better than the Iterative Method, not Ziegler-Nichols, the peak time cannot be optimized by GA methods."}, {"heading": "Stability Margin", "text": "The stability margin is the maximum gain that can be adjusted before the response of the system changes into a sinusoidal cycle. In simulations, this is achieved simply by increasing the value of Kc until a sinusoidal cycle occurs, and the stability margin of the corresponding system is Kc in the sinusoidal cycle. This is the first result to show consistency over the entire time delay range, in which all curves fall almost under the same line. So, this is the strongest pattern, and because the stronger the pattern, the less the ability of GA methods to optimize corresponding performance metrics, we cannot use GA methods to optimize the stability margin. Conversely, GA methods are likely to result in less stable systems. Like rise time and peak time in general, the curves remain unchanged in almost all time delay ranges, with the order starting from the largest value: Iterative Method, ITAE, Ziegler, IASE and MITSE."}, {"heading": "6.2. Performance Indices", "text": "We distinguish the term standard performance metrics and performance indices here, where standard performance metrics have already been discussed above, and the performance indices are: MSE, IAE, ISE, ITAE, and ITSE. Table 2 below summarizes performance indices from simulation results. As expected, the averages of GA's performance indices are always smaller than the corresponding Ziegler-Nichols and Iterative Method. In addition, Ziegler-Nichols Rule produces smaller average performance indices than the Iterative Method for all Time Delay Values. Although it can be seen that the MSE has the smallest averages for all three methods, and IAE has the largest averages for Ziegler-Nichols and GA methods, and only in second place in the Iterative Method, it does not imply that the MSE as an objective function in GAE must be avoided because these performance indices, as shown by equations (1), have different definitions and cannot be compared with each other."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "1. The genetic algorithm used in PID control improves the transient response of FOLPD compared to two tuning methods. This is evidenced by an average percentage exceeding the threshold, which is above 70% and 30% compared to the Ziegler-Nichols rule and the Iterative method, while the rise time and peak time remain virtually unchanged and the billing time is improved. However, there is a benefit in the stability margin, which is slightly reduced compared to two tuning methods. 2. The average values of the GA performance indices are expected to be always smaller than the corresponding Ziegler-Nichols and the Iterative method. In addition, the Ziegler-Nichols rule produces smaller average performance indices than the Iterative method for all time delay values. However, the differences between the GA method and two tuning methods result, with the exception of the ITAE objective function, where the differences increase with the time delay, are not impressive enough to conclude that these two methods are always better than the GA method, although the results from the 3."}, {"heading": "Shinichiro Yoshii", "text": "Masashi Furukawa"}], "references": [{"title": "Approximation and Compensation of Delay in Analog Control Systems, \u7cbe\u5bc6\u5de5\u5b66\u4f1a\u5317\u6d77\u5ea6\u652f\u90e8\u5b66\u8853\u8b1b\u6f14\u4f1a", "author": ["Andri Mirzal", "Shinichiro Yoshii", "Masashi Furukawa"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2006}, {"title": "On-line PID Controller Tuning using Genetic Algorithms", "author": ["Ian Griffin"], "venue": "Dublin City University,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2003}, {"title": "The Estimation and Compensation of Processes with Time Delays", "author": ["A.
