Discussion: How often the solution is 0 or \u221e?", "text": "An important question is: What is the probability that the solution to the problems examined in this section is 0 or \u221e? Unsurprisingly, the answer depends on both the voting rule and the type of voting operations, and the probability may be high for some voting rules. For example, in a voting rule that always selects a certain alternative d as the winner, the solutions for CVO (or DVO) are always 0 (or \u221e) for c = d and always the same high (or 0) for c 6 = d. However, with all current voting rules, the alternatives are treated almost equally (except in cases with a tie). Therefore, we can expect that in a preferential profile whose votes are generated i.i.d., each alternative is almost as likely to be chosen as the winner. This is indeed the case with all current voting rules, including consent votes, all position rating rules (which include Borda, plurality and veto), plurality in the runoff, i.i.i.i."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2012, "abstractText": "In this paper, we propose a framework to study a general class of strategic<lb>behavior in voting, which we call vote operations.
