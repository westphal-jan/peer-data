IntroductionMachine Learning and Data Mining techniques have recently been developed to implicitly find meaningful patterns and ease the knowledge-acquisition bottleneck. Among these approaches, deriving conclusions or association rules from educational examples is the most common [9,12,13]. Faced with a number of examples and counter-examples of a concept, the learning program attempts to induce general rules that describe all or most positive educational instances and none or few of the counter-examples [6,7]. If the educational instances belong to more than two classes, the learning program will induce general rules that describe each class. Recently, the coarse theory has been used in argumentation and knowledge acquisition for expert systems [4,14]. It was proposed by Pawlak in 1982, using the concept of equivalence classes as a basic principle."}], "references": [{"title": "Mining fuzzy b-certain and b-possible rules from quantitative data based on the variable precision rough-set mode", "author": ["T.P", "Hong", "T.T", "Wang", "S.L"], "venue": "Expert System with Application,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2007}, {"title": "\u201dKnowledge-base reduction based on rough set techniques\u201d, Canadian conference on electrical and computer engineering", "author": ["L.T", "P Germano", "Alexandre"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1996}, {"title": "\u201dExpert systems\u2014knowledge ,uncertainty and decision", "author": ["I.Graham", "P.L", "Jones"], "venue": "Boston: Chapman and Computing,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 1988}, {"title": "Knowledge acquisition under uncertainty: A rough set approach", "author": ["J.
