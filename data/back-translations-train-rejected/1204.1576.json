Representation of Knowledge", "text": "Each knowledge base contains rules for a specific area. For the natural treatment of the diabetes expert system, the knowledge base contains rules relating to certain natural treatments of diabetes such as massage, acupuncture, plant / correct nutrition and vegetables. ESTA has all the possibilities to write the rules that make up a knowledge base. In addition, ESTA has an inference engine that can use the rules in the knowledge base to determine what advice should be given to the user of the expert system or to initiate other measures.The representation in ESTA is the rule based on the logical paradigm of simple if-then rules in the backward or forward concatenation. We have here the backward concatenation for the presentation of knowledge with simple if-do pairs instead of ithen rules."}, {"heading": "A.
