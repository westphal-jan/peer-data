INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED SYSTEM", "text": "Normally, when the Mobile Station leaves one MSC service area to another, all information relating to the user of the Mobile Station (based on subscribers IMSI or TMSI) will be deleted depending on a decision made after an analysis in a specific timeframe: 1) The VLR will have observed the mobile station's roaming habits for a few days, for example \"n'days.\" 2) The VLR will also observe the time at which the mobile station migrates to the MSC area. Depending on this data, a query will be made and the result of the query will help in deciding whether the mobile station information will be stored or deleted within the VLR. The purpose of the query is to find those mobile users who have visited the MSC service area at least once regularly during the observation period. The established regular visit to the mobile station is referred to as an ordinary mobile station."}, {"heading": "A. Proposed Model Scenario", "text": "Consider a mobile station user who travels 115 km a day. He lives in \"Nellore\" and goes to his office in \"Rajampet,\" which is 115 km away from his home. As he has to drop off his wife and daughter in \"Podalakur\" or \"Rapur,\" he has to travel the same route every day. Now, the VLR1 will find that the person leaves this area at 8 am and returns at 8 pm. And the VLR2 of the MSC service area will find that the person enters this service area at 8: 30 am and leaves at 8: 40 am daily. Similarly, we assume that the possible roaming time will be in another MSC service area (here in this Kadapa area, MSC1 / VLR1 and Rajampet will enter the MSC2 / VLR2 area). The same information will be used for the call delivery strategy. In this essay, we propose an intelligent location management scheme that we will find in certain mobile phone users frequently visited above."}, {"heading": "B. Decision making of intelligent database VLR using Fuzzy Logic", "text": "Now, during the \"m'days of observation period, the number of roaming users is\" N'on all (week) working days or in Mobile Switching Center service area. Then, the observation table for each day can be viewed as follows. For example, a mobile subscriber moves frequently from LA1 to LA2, intelligent system processes are automatically deleted, and the identity of the subscriber is sent to LA3. Suppose, when the subscriber revisits LA2, reads the subscriber profile of HLR and sends to VLR for identity, which we are presented in the scenario model. But here, we need to remember one thing, how often the mobile subscriber visits or roams are mentioned in a particular LA. In this paper, we present the blurred decision-making for such subscribers."}, {"heading": "C. Algorithm for Intelligent VLR", "text": "The site management algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the average mobile user has only a limited number of frequently visited places. Usually, it is an activity such as work, school or shopping that takes place in a particular place. For example, the shopping locations are located in certain places, and for most users, the work, school and residential locations are set. We are looking at an observation period of \"m\" days for a VLR to find its common mobile station, and the search must be based on IMSI of the visited MS during that period. A possible algorithm is given below: Integer get _ common _ MS ()"}, {"heading": "D. Algorithm for Intelligent call delivery using fuzzy Logic", "text": "s identity is confirmed and accepted by HLR or not, but in our proposed system, if the subscriber is a known visitor to that particular location, the calls will be registered in the VLR and not immediately deleted from the VLR register after the subscriber has left the VLR, as we have shown in Figure 7, the records visited will be stored in a blurred VLR, we will give each subscriber time to store their profiles in the VLR database, if they do not visit that location within the specified time, the subscriber entry will then be deleted from the VLR as well as Fuzzy VLR. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the site management algorithm to intelligently determine such information. The intelligent algorithm determines these locations based on the individual user's frequent visits at a particular time."}, {"heading": "E. Proposed call delivery algorithm", "text": "In this system, VLR maintains two entries for storing the data, as we have shown in Figure 8. One is for the high-tier database is called VLR and another is for the low-tier database is called Fuzzy VLR for storing fuzzy related values. If the participant does not visit the same place in a certain period of time, the record is automatically deleted; it is not necessary to retrieve the subscriber record from HLR for Identity, the record will be present in our proposed system in Fuzzy VLR database up to a certain period of time. If the participant does not visit the same place within a certain period of time, the record will be automatically deleted. Call database will have two databases, one as HLR and another as VLR, in our proposed system the VLR database will be divided into two-tier architecture, which have a high database as VLR and a low-tier database as VLR fuzzy database."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "We felt that we had the following advantages with the proposed approaches to site management: because we understand that the proposed schemes reduce the transition between VLR and HLR database, because search / update / delete operations of subscriber profiles occur from the HLR database each time subscribers arrive at the same location or if they are already searched earlier by subscribers. However, this proposed mechanism also reduces the transition between MS and MSC. Call delivery algorithm, which can reduce the latency of call delivery in the intelligent registration scheme because subscriber data is already available in the VLRFuzzy database hierarchy, avoids multiple registrations for call delivery. As we have said before, fuzzy databases are more flexible than traditional databases to query data from the databases. Therefore, the proposed approaches will also reduce call costs, as fuzzy databases also support data retrieval and data retrieval structures very quickly."}], "references": [{"title": "Mobile cellular Communications: Analog and Digital systems, McGraw-Hill, Inc., 2 edition", "author": ["William C.Y Lee"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1995}, {"title": "Bernhard\u2019s, \u201cAn estimate of network database transaction volume to support personal communication service", "author": ["C.N Lo", "R.S.
