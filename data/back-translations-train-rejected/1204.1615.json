Elimination of dots", "text": "The challenge is the presence of eight different types of diacritic characters representing Arabic or Latin letters. In the written text, they are considered special letters, each of which, as with normal letters, is assigned a single code. In fully diacritized text, a diacritical sign is added after each consonant of the Arabic word. These diacritic signs play a very important role in determining the meaning of words, but these diacritic signs can cause problems in recognizing and extracting lines. As the diacritics can leave the upper limit of the line or the lower limit in some writing styles, this can lead to poor line recognition. Their diacritics are removed by morphological erosion, followed by morphological diction."}, {"heading": "B. Line detection", "text": "In order to separate words from text documents, we must first start with the recognition of lines. There are several methods suggested by authors such as [7, 11]. However, since we work with Arabic and Latin and our basic document consists of text (without images and background), we opted for the horizontal projection method. This method is also reliable without the inclination of lines. Figure 2 shows the application of horizontal projection."}, {"heading": "C. Word detection and separation", "text": "Recognizing and separating words from a text document is a conventional step in automatic document processing. This step makes it difficult in the case of multilingual documents. This difficulty is due to the large difference between the Arabic script and the Latin script. The Arabic script is italic. It is written where the letters are linked to each other. This is not only in the case of handwriting; it is also the case of printed letters. The Latin alphabet is not italic in the case of printed letters. In Arabic, the script is always attached, even with the printing. This fraction is a problem in the step of separation between words; since both languages are grouped in the same text. Figure 3 shows the difference in the distribution areas in the case of Arabic (AR) and Latin (LA) fonts. To see this difference, we have a Latin text and its similarity in Arabic, they have almost the same amount of information."}, {"heading": "D.
