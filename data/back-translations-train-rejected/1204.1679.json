In this paper, we propose to use new approach combining distance tangent, k-means algorithm and Bayesian network for image classification. First, we use the technique of tangent distance to calculate several tangent spaces representing the same image. The objective is to reduce the error in the classification phase. Second, we cut the image in a whole of blocks. For each block, we compute a vector of descriptors. Then, we use K-means to cluster the low-level features including color and texture information to build a vector of labels for each image. Finally, we apply five variants of Bayesian networks classifiers (Na\\\"ive Bayes, Global Tree Augmented Na\\\"ive Bayes (GTAN), Global Forest Augmented Na\\\"ive Bayes (GFAN), Tree Augmented Na\\\"ive Bayes for each class (TAN), and Forest Augmented Na\\\"ive Bayes for each class (FAN) to classify the image of faces using the vector of labels. In order to validate the feasibility and effectively, we compare the results of GFAN to FAN and to the others classifiers (NB, GTAN, TAN). The results demonstrate FAN outperforms than GFAN, NB, GTAN and TAN in the overall classification accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Apr 2012 20:52:10 GMT  (964kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1679v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["khlifia jayech", "mohamed ali mahjoub"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.1679"}, "pdf": {"name": "1204.1679.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Clustering and Bayesian network for image of faces classification", "authors": ["Khlifia Jayech"], "emails": ["jayech_k@yahoo.fr", "Medali.mahjoub@ipeim.rnu.tn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to put itself at the forefront in order to pave the way for the future."}, {"heading": "A. Definition", "text": "Bayesian networks represent a series of variables in the form of nodes on a directed acyclic graph. It maps the conditional dependencies of these variables. Bayesian networks bring us four advantages as a data modeling tool [20-22-24]. First, Bayesian networks are able to process incomplete or noisy data, which is very common in image analysis. Second, Bayesian networks are able to determine causal relationships by conditional dependencies, which allows for modeling relationships between variables. Finally, Bayesian networks are able to incorporate existing knowledge or already known data into their learning and provide more accurate results by using what we already know. Bayesian networks are defined by: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) G = (V, E), where V is a set of nodes of G, and E of G is the computational ability of G; a probable space B."}, {"heading": "C. Parameters learning", "text": "In this case, the structure is a priori fully known and all variables can be observed from the data. Learning conditional probabilities associated with variables (network nodes) can be done either randomly or using a Bayesian approach. Statistical learning requirements in the training data are based on the Maximum Probability (ML), which is defined as follows: Where is the number of events in the database for which the variable in the state of its parents is located in the configurationThe Bayesian approach to learning from complete data is to find the most likely data based on the data observed using the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) method, where: With the conjugate before distribution; est la distribution de Dirichlet: And the parameter at the back:"}, {"heading": "D. Structure learning", "text": "Structure learning is the finding of a plausible structure for a graph based on data input. However, it has been proven that this is a NP-hard problem, and therefore any learning algorithm that would be suitable for use on a data set as large as microarray data requires some form of modification to be feasible. Spirtes et al. (2001) explain that it is a major problem to find the most suitable DAG from sample data, since the number of possible DAGs grows superexponentially with the number of nodes present. The number of possible structures is superexponential in the number of variables. The number of possible combinations G of DAGs from n variables can be calculated by the recursive formula [20] In practice, we use heuristics and approximation methods such as the K2 algorithm."}, {"heading": "E. Bayesian network as a classifier", "text": "1) Na\u00efve Bayes is one of the most effective and efficient classification algorithms. The assumption of conditional independence in na\u00efve Bayes is rarely true in reality. In fact, na\u00efve Bayes have been shown to work poorly for regression problems (Frank et al., 2000) and produce poor probability estimates (Bennett, 2000). One way to alleviate the assumption of conditional independence is to expand the structure of na\u00efve Bayes so that they explicitly represent dependencies between attributes by adding arcs between attributes. Construct TAN procedures are described in our previous paper [5].3) FANTo improve the performance of TAN, we have added a premature stop criterion based on a minimum value of increasing the score in search algorithms."}, {"heading": "A.

These characteristics are very used in texture synthesis. The average represents the average (or moderate) grayscale of all pixels in the interesting region (ROI). This parameter represents the position of the histogram on the grayscale of grayscales. The images that have a higher average appear brighter. The standard deviation expresses the clustering (or dispersion) by the mean value. The values are more dispersed, the greater the standard deviation is, the greater the standard deviation is the standard is the greater the standard is the grayscale of grayscales.

In this paper, we propose to use new approach combining distance tangent, k-means algorithm and Bayesian network for image classification. First, we use the technique of tangent distance to calculate several tangent spaces representing the same image. The objective is to reduce the error in the classification phase. Second, we cut the image in a whole of blocks. For each block, we compute a vector of descriptors. Then, we use K-means to cluster the low-level features including color and texture information to build a vector of labels for each image. Finally, we apply five variants of Bayesian networks classifiers (Na\u00efve Bayes, Global Tree Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes (GTAN), Global Forest Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes (GFAN), Tree Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes for each class (TAN), and Forest Augmented Na\u00efve Bayes for each class (FAN) to classify the image of faces using the vector of labels. In order to validate the feasibility and effectively, we compare the results of GFAN to FAN and to the others classifiers (NB, GTAN, TAN). The results demonstrate FAN outperforms than GFAN, NB, GTAN and TAN in the overall classification accuracy.
