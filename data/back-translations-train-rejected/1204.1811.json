INTRODUCTION", "text": "Finding and tracking skin-colored pixels through an image is a tool used in many facial recognition and gesture tracking systems [13] [8]. Skin information contributes a lot to object recognition [18]. Adult videos are uploaded that may not be allowed by service providers, so how to effectively categorize and block such videos is a serious concern for service providers. The most commonly used approach to blocking content on the Internet is based on contextual keyword patterns that categorize URLs by Web site context or video name and then capture the web pages [11]."}, {"heading": "2. PREVIOUS WORK", "text": "Their work includes three colour spaces; RGB, YCbCr and HSI are of central importance. They have compared the algorithms based on these colour spaces and therefore cannot help achieve better discrimination of skin and non-skin colour. In [16], colour spaces and their results for skin recognition are discussed. Furthermore, they believe that excluding colour from the classification process is not helpful. In [19] and [20], screens based on skin information are described."}, {"heading": "3. SKIN COLOR MODELING", "text": "The main goal of skin color recognition or classification of skin contents is therefore to form a decision rule that distinguishes between skin pixels and non-skin pixels. Identifying skin-colored pixels involves determining the value range for which most skin pixels in a particular color space would be used. It can be as simple as explicitly classifying a pixel as skin pixels when red, green, and blue color channels have a specific value distribution. Other techniques use Neural Networks and Bayesian methods for which most skin pixels in a particular color space are used. RGB Color SpaceIn the RGB Color Space, each color appears in its primary spectral component of Red, Green, and Blue. Images represented in the RGB space consist of three components, one for each primary color."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS", "text": "To evaluate the skin recognition algorithm, we use a series of 30 challenging videos. Figure 1 shows sample images from these video sequences. The sequences cover a wide range of environmental conditions. People of different ethnicities and skin tones are represented. Sequences also include scenes with multiple people and / or multiple visible body parts and scenes shot both indoors and outdoors with moving cameras. Lighting varies from natural light to directional stage lighting. Sequences include shadows and minor obfuscations. Videos in which the background color matches the skin color are also included in the test set. Sequences collected vary in length from 100 frames to 1,300 frames. These videos are divided into three categories and serve as basic truths for the algorithm. Eleven videos are referred to as LSKIN, nine videos are referred to as PSKIN, and ten as SKIN.On the test set, 28 of 30 videos are presented as skin."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this work, we have developed an approach to categorizing videos based on skin color. We tested our algorithm on 30 test sequences and achieved a true positive rate of over 90%. In the next step, our goal is to acquire larger video collections to verify and improve the results."}, {"heading": "6.
