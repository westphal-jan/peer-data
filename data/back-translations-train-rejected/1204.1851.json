The input of our system is a set of time-stamped short-term activities (STA) detected on video frames. The output is a set of recognised long-term activities (LTA), which are pre-defined temporal combinations of STA. The constraints on the STA that, if satisfied, lead to the recognition of a LTA, have been expressed using a dialect of the Event Calculus. In order to handle the uncertainty that naturally occurs in human activity recognition, we adapted this dialect to a state-of-the-art probabilistic logic programming framework.

This dataset includes 28 surveillance videos of a public space. The videos are staged - actors walk around, sit down, meet each other, leave objects behind, fight, and so on. Each video has been commented on manually by the CAVIAR team to provide the basic truth for both STA and LTA. For this series of experiments, the input to our recognition system is as follows: (i) The STA walking, running, active (non-abrupt body movement in the sperm position) and inactive (Standing Still), along with their time stamps, that is, the video frame in which this STA took place.

To solve this problem, we need to address the question of whether it is even possible for it to be a real number in the range of 0, 1, and 2. ProbLog differs from Prolog in that the probability that it is a real number in the range of 0, 2, and 3 is given tacitly. ProbLog is a prolog fact that is not grounded, then the probability that it is all possible grounding of prolog facts. ProbLog facts in a ProbLog program represent random facts that represent random variables. Furthermore, ProbLog makes an assumption of independence on these variables."}, {"heading": "7 The Event Calculus in ProbLog", "text": "In this section we present the necessary transformations to make CrispEC ProbLog compatible - the result is Prob-EC.

For facts that do not belong to the knowledge base, such as an STA that is not part of an input stream, Problog does not fail implicitly and therefore reports a probability of 0 \u2212 pi (18) problog cannot be used where facts are not used in our EC axioms, we would lead to undesirable behavior."}, {"heading": "7.2 Inference", "text": "To illustrate Prob-EC's inference approach, we use two CAVIAR LTAs, one with multiple initiations and terminations and one with a single initiation and a single termination."}, {"heading": "7.2.1 Multiple Initiations and Terminations", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to go in search of a solution."}, {"heading": "7.2.2 Single Initiation and Termination", "text": "In this section, we will illustrate the behavior of Prob-EC in the case of fluents with a single initiation and a single termination.

In frame 11, she leaves the suitcase on the floor and walks away, which causes the suitcase to \"appear\" and triggers the termination of the tracking system expressed by rule (6). Suppose that this initiation condition has a probability of 0.6. In frame 20, Sarah picks up the suitcase, which makes it \"disappear\" and expresses the condition for termination.

As can be seen from this figure, the detection accuracy under \"strong\" noise is very similar to the \"intermediate\" noise within the threshold of 0.5. For Prob-EC, we need a range of false information to exceed the selected threshold - the introduction of false STA in the \"strong\" noise experiments is not so systematic and does not create problems for Prob-EC. Crisp-EC is very easily affected by the introduction of fake STA: it now has a number of additional FP, especially in the case of movement. Even a single initiation condition triggered by an uncertain foot, STA and some other CAVIAR-STA may be sufficient to create a number of FP."}, {"heading": "9 Summary and Future Work", "text": "We introduced Prob-EC, an event that is dialect for probabilistic reasoning. ProbEC is the first event that can handle uncertainty in the STA input, and this is the first approach that thoroughly evaluates event calculation in a probabilistic framework. Our experimental evaluation on a benchmark activity file shows that Prob-EC outperforms the Crisp EC when: a LTA has multiple initiations, and the LTA relies on a small number of probable conjunctions. If an LTA relies on a large number of probable conjunctives, Prob-EC is significantly affected, and its performance is close to that of Crisp-EC."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the EU project PRONTO (FP7-ICT 231738).

The constraints on the STA that, if satisfied, lead to the recognition of a LTA, have been expressed using a dialect of the Event Calculus. In order to handle the uncertainty that naturally occurs in human activity recognition, we adapted this dialect to a state-of-the-art probabilistic logic programming framework.
