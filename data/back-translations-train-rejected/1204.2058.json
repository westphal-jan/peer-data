THEORETICAL BACKGROUND", "text": "In recent decades, the fuzzy classification of text documents based on similarity has attracted a lot of attention and is considered an important area of research. Various techniques, models and methods are sought to design an optimal categorization system. Such a field is not only used in small organizations, industries and enterprises, but also covers a vast community around the world. New techniques, their collaboration and research always open up a new paradigm toward advancement. Recent research studies show that fuzzy logic and its scope provide an efficient basis for text categorization, dimension reduction, selection and extraction of characteristics and similarity analyzers. Fuzzy logic is considered as a branch of logic specifically designed to represent knowledge and human thought in a way that it can be processed by a computer [3]. The main concepts of fuzzy logic are fuzzy sentences, linguistic variables, distributions of possibility, and then blurred rules."}, {"heading": "2.1. Feature Clustering", "text": "The concept of feature clustering [10] [11] [22] - [24] improves the provision of text dimension critical solutions. It is an efficient way to compress the collected feature sets more so that the resulting data can be handled and used properly without loss. These clusters are either represented by the concept of maximum frequency in a group (or cluster) [22] [24] or can be found by a self-constructing feature clustering algorithm [23]. Feature clustering also occurs when using the pseudo-thesaurus, using each term [6] as a noun, pronoun, adverb, adjective, delimiter, etc. Researchers have shown that it helps to reduce the high-dimensional data adequately into smaller ones."}, {"heading": "2.2. Fuzzy Association", "text": "Fuzzy sets play an important and crucial role in text categorization. They are widely recognized because many real relationships are inherently blurred. Fuzzy association [24] [28] is used to discover important associations between different sets of attribute values. A fuzzy association rule AC is very strong when both A C and C A are strong."}, {"heading": "2.3. Fuzzy Production Rules", "text": "The novel method of rule construction and a rule weighting mechanism [19] [27] can lead to a rule base that contains rules of different lengths, which is much more useful when dealing with high-dimensional data sets."}, {"heading": "2.4. Fuzzy Clustering and C-Means", "text": "In fuzzy clustering [28], each point has a certain degree of cluster affiliation, as in fuzzy logic, rather than belonging entirely to a cluster. Therefore, points at the edge of a cluster may be in the cluster to a lesser extent than points at the center of the cluster."}, {"heading": "2.5. Fuzzy Signatures", "text": "Fuzzy signatures [26] are used in applications and key areas that require the handling of complex structured data and interdependent functional problems, but also in specific areas where data is missing. Thus, many areas are represented in which objects with very complex and sometimes interdependent characteristics must be classified in addition to the evaluation of similarities and dissimilarities, leading to a complex decision model that is difficult to construct effectively. Due to the nature of fuzzy signatures of flexibility, it can be used for many text mining tasks, with the advantage of hierarchical structuring; therefore, the classification models of text documents can be constructed [26]."}, {"heading": "3. A TECHNICAL COMPARATIVE STUDY ON DIFFERENT FUZZY SIMILARITY BASED MODELS", "text": "Research on blurred similarity models and techniques has taken a new turn for the tasks of text classification, taking into account several key questions related to blurred logic and blurred quantities. Therefore, these techniques offer better possibilities and solutions for categorization."}, {"heading": "3.1. A Comparative Description on Various Proposed Techniques", "text": "The comparative detailed description of the different techniques is described in Table 1. It defines the challenges and problems encountered in each model, which are the related key problems. These models focus on various relevant problems and necessities of the text classification domain. The similarity technique shows the efficient similarity criteria used in the model to incorporate easily evolving information and to handle missing information. Patterns among the index terms.

A Tour on Different Methodologies and Procedures", "text": "These methods are shown in steps. [22], [23], [24] and [25] show that text documents or web documents are eligible for text classification, which initially use a predefined set of classes during the training phase. In [22], [23] and [24], the text is pre-processed and cleaned to extract all important characteristics. In [25], a bag of words is used and edited to obtain the word patterns. Next, the fuzzy similarity techniques are applied, as shown in Table 1. Finally, the text is classified with the classifier. Different methods have different methods of categorizing the text.The use of the fuzzy signature for the text classification of the non-segmented text [26] shows that the non-segmentable text can be segmented and classified."}, {"heading": "4. AN ANALYTICAL DISCUSSION ON EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "Various blurred similarity models for text classification have been successfully implemented, the experimental results of which are presented and discussed in detail. Accuracy and performance parameters are evaluated and reviewed to see the benefits of the methods and the current state of the art."}, {"heading": "4.1. Experimental Results: Data Sets and Evaluation", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "4.2. Various Experimental Results on the Models", "text": "The experimental results of the different models show their good performance and accuracy concerns. In Figure 1, these models are discussed and their studies, results, comparisons of the experimental results are shown. The bars in the diagram are individual and independent in their identity. These results are not compared with each other; they only provide their data and the respective details.Fuzzy term category relationship [22] is shown by manipulating the membership degree for the training data and the degree of appreciation for a test site. Six measures are used and compared where the best performance of Einstein was achieved. Accuracy performance of these algorithms in decreasing order is shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Various research shows good results with the underlying techniques, mechanisms and methods. Experimental results provide good, fuzzy-based text classification with high accuracy. These models focus on new types of different classification problems and techniques. Therefore, these research studies and their collection contribute to providing information on advanced fuzzy classification, related models and techniques. Analytical verification provides a simple summary of sources in an organizational pattern and combines both summary and synthesis to give a new interpretation of ancient material. Therefore, it aims to review the critical points of current knowledge about research work, including substantive results as well as theoretical and methodological contributions. Furthermore, its experimental results and parametric data are sufficiently described and compared independently from each other. Such comparative studies and technical analysis diagrams provide a strong basis to understand the use of fuzzy finds and the related concerns. Various experimental results have thus proven to be good logic models for the use of fuzzy in whole areas of classification and fuzzy fields."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "Special thanks to Asst.

These models are discussed and compared to frame out their use and necessity. A tour of different methodologies is provided which is based upon fuzzy similarity related concerns. It shows that how text and web documents are categorized efficiently into different categories. Various experimental results of these models are also discussed. The technical comparisons among each model\u2019s parameters are shown in the form of a 3-D chart.
