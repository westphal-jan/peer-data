A lot of research work has been done in this field but there is a need to categorize a collection of text documents into mutually exclusive categories by extracting the concepts or features using supervised learning paradigm and different classification algorithms. In this paper, a new Fuzzy Similarity Based Concept Mining Model (FSCMM) is proposed to classify a set of text documents into pre - defined Category Groups (CG) by providing them training and preparing on the sentence, document and integrated corpora levels along with feature reduction, ambiguity removal on each level to achieve high system performance. Fuzzy Feature Category Similarity Analyzer (FFCSA) is used to analyze each extracted feature of Integrated Corpora Feature Vector (ICFV) with the corresponding categories or classes. This model uses Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVMC) to classify correctly the training data patterns into two groups; i. e., + 1 and - 1, thereby producing accurate and correct results.

Concept Mining", "text": "These concepts can be either words or phrases and depend entirely on the semantic structure of the sentence. When a new text document is introduced into the system, concept mining can detect a conceptual match between this document and all previously edited documents in the record by scanning the new document and extracting the appropriate concepts [5]. In this way, the similarity measure is used for concept analysis at the sentence, document and corpus level. Originally, these concepts are extracted by the semantic role marker [5] and analyzed in terms of sentence, document and corpus levels. Therefore, the similarity between these concepts is less likely in unrelated documents. If these concepts match in unrelated documents, they generate noise errors. Therefore, the concepts become insensitive to noise when calculating the similarity of text documents."}, {"heading": "B. Feature Extraction", "text": "In text classification, the dimensionality of the feature vector is usually enormous. Moreover, there is the problem of the curse of dimensionality, where the large collection of features takes up a great deal of dimension in terms of execution time and memory requirements. This is considered to be one of the problems of the vector space model (VSM), in which all features are represented as vectors of n-dimensional data. n represents the total number of features of the document. This feature set is huge and high-dimensional.There are two popular methods for feature reduction: feature selection and feature extraction. In the feature selection methods, a subset of the original feature set is obtained to form the new feature set, which is further used for text classification tasks using information gain [5]. In feature extraction methods, the original feature set is converted into another reduced set of features, but the number of projections are improved by the projection process."}, {"heading": "C.

Firstly, each text document TDi, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, is processed at its sentence level.

Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVMC)", "text": "The next step is to use the Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVMC). SVMC is a popular and better method than other methods of text categorization. It is a core method that finds the maximum margin hyperplane in the feature Space Paradigm, which separates the data from training patterns into two groups such as Boolean logic 1 and 0. If a training pattern is not correctly classified by the hyperplane, then the concept of flop measures is used to get rid of it.With this idea, SVMC can only separate two classes for h = + 1 and h = -1. For e-classes, one SVM is created for each class.For class cl, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 e, the training patterns of class cl for h = + 1 and for other classes are h = -1. The SVMC is then the aggregation of this SVMs.SVM method provides good results then the KNN method because it divides the training data directly by the hyperplanes."}, {"heading": "C. Text Classification Phase", "text": "The accuracy of this document is compared with the class of the learned SVMC. If the accuracy of the SVMC is acceptable and good, then it can be further used to classify the future invisible text documents for which the class label is not known. Therefore, they can be categorized into the appropriate and a suitable category group. IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPEText classification is expected to play an important role in future search services or in text categorization. It is an essential matter to focus on the main topics and the essential content. It is becoming increasingly important that the computing methods classify the automatically available text documents in order to obtain the categorized information or groups with greater speed and accuracy for the contents that represent mathematical matter. As the proposed FSCMM model for text categorization is made, it works well with high efficiency and effectiveness."}], "references": [{"title": "Artificial Intelligence, 3  rd ed", "author": ["Eliane Rich", "Kevin Knight", "Shivashankar B Nair"], "venue": "Mc Graw Hill,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, 2  nd ed", "author": ["Jiawei Han", "MicheLine Kamber"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2006}, {"title": "An Analysis of Constructed Categories for Textual Classification Using Fuzzy Similarity and Agglomerative Hierarchical Methods", "author": ["Marcus Vinicius", "C.
