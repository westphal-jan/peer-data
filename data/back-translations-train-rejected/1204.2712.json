Examining these reformulations shows that recommendations that precise the focus of a query are helpful, like those based on expansions of the original queries.

We propose a method to identify from the query logs of past users queries that either focus or shift the initial query topic. This method combines various click-based, topic-based and session based ranking strategies and uses supervised learning in order to maximize the semantic similarities between the query and the recommendations, while at the same diversifying them.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Problem Statement", "text": "Retrieving information is often an interactive process in which a user successively refines their original query, shifts focus, and moves closer to their destination in several steps. Helping users in this process makes it less cumbersome. Query suggestions are particularly useful on mobile devices and for Asian languages with complex character sets, where typing queries is particularly cumbersome and time consuming.Query recommendation engines should not limit themselves to suggesting more focused queries, but also suggest queries that represent a reasonable change in focus, as confirmed by the study of search engine query protocols, where the most common queries are for \"Tokota,\" \"Nischan,\" and \"Lexus,\" which do not directly refine the original query. Another example is the most frequent query for \"renewal of license,\" a \"light force of traffic laws\" that may prevent drivers from taking their driver's license renewal."}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "Query recommendations are often based on cluster methods with the inconvenience that queries that fall within the same clusters are some time more ambiguous and less helpful than the original query. Instead, in this work we formulate three different methods for extracting query recommendations from the click logs of a search engine. These methods lead to targeted links between queries that exist in the protocols, and thus have the potential to overcome the limitations of cluster methods.The first method is based on the position of the clicked URLs in the search ranking of the original query and their potential recommendations. The second is based on reformulations of the original query, which can easily be recognized in the query interfaces-forms Relationships-relationships-relationships-relationships-relationships-relationships-relationships-relationships reformulate queries for a variety of reasons: because the initial formulation of the query is ambiguous or carries other meanings they did not intend, or because the results returned by the machine are not sufficiently formulated relationships-relationships-relationships-relationships-relationships-relationships-relationships-based query. The third method, however, is also based on queries-relationships-relationships-queries."}, {"heading": "Assumptions", "text": "Since most useful recommendations are either specializations or parallel movements, it is better to use different methods to cover both types. Furthermore, it is necessary to exclude trivial synonyms and unrelated queries. We assume that in the semantic hierarchy of information needs, which focuses on the original user query, generalization queries are in the upper part of the hierarchy and specialization queries are in the lower part. Adjacent queries in the semantic hierarchy are generally useful. To identify such queries, we combine the referral candidates from three methods and learn the ranking function based on semantic similarities, which are reflected in the topological relationships in the semantic hierarchy."}, {"heading": "Contribution", "text": "One possible solution is to derive the intention of the user: does he intend to delve into the topic, or will he leave the current subtopic and move on to the next subtopic? This would undoubtedly be a very difficult task. Every query can lead to the user looking for more precise information from the outset or postponing the intention, depending, among other things, on the quality of the results the user finds on the results page. User decisions and successive searches depend not only on the query, but also on the user and context. Instead of trying to predict the state of mind of the user, we propose to minimize the risk of the user's dissatisfaction by carefully proposing different solutions. In terms of our previous assumption, we try to maximize the semantic similarity between the original query and recommended queries by combining different types of recommendations to make them more diverse."}, {"heading": "Organization", "text": "In Section 2, we present some related work that uses query and click logs. In Section 3, we present the methods used to extract the different types of recommendations. We demonstrate empirically that the session-based method is good at identifying changing queries, while the other two methods prefer focused faceted queries. We combine these three methods to maximize the semantic similarity measurement in Section 4. We describe the supervised learning algorithm we use in Section 5. In Section 6, we report the results of an empirical study based on the click logs of a popular Japanese search engine, and Section 7 concludes the work."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Click Log Analysis", "text": "Click logs typically contain information such as search string, timestamp, browser recognition, URLs clicked and ranking positions. Although the correct interpretation of clicks is not easy [14, 8], click information is often used as implicit feedback on the relevance of URLs. Beeferman and Berger studied web search logs and grouped click search data by iterating two steps: (a) the combination of the two most similar queries and (b) the combination of the two most similar URLs [4]. The clusters generated were used to improve query recommendations. Baeza-Yates et al. proposed a query recommendation technology based on the similarity of the URLs clicked [3]. Dupret and Mendoza also treated query recommendations using click search data, but focused on the document ranking [9] based on the X."}, {"heading": "Term Expansion Based", "text": "Jones et al. extracted query substitutions from the same user sessions by identifying correlated pairs of terms and replacing phrases [15]. Jones's work addressed query substitutions in sponsored search contexts where \"precise rewriting\" such as \"car insurance 7 \u2192 car insurance\" is predominantly preferred. However, current search engines yield very similar results to these two queries."}, {"heading": "Query Session Based", "text": "Spink et al. examined information related to successive web searches [16] and found that the information included changes and shifts in search terms, search strategies and relevance assessments. Jansen et al. analyzed successive queries in large web search logs [13], and he et al. attempted to detect session boundaries by search patterns and time intervals in query logs [12]. Fonseca et al. extracted query references by association rules from the same user sessions [10]. Boldi et al. analyzed user sessions in search, classified query reformulation types [5], and derived query flow diagrams for the extracted query recommendations. They pointed out that the typically useful recommendations are either specifications or parallel movements, while trivial variants or completely independent queries are not useful for this purpose. Cao et al. correctly based user suggestions are based on cluster awareness that they really contribute to the purpose of the cluster."}, {"heading": "3. GENERATING CANDIDATES", "text": "In this paper, we focus on generating query recommendations by using interquery relations in web search logs. As we have seen in the previous section, log-based query recommendations techniques fall into one of three approaches, namely click-based, term expansion-based, and session-based. Each approach aims to capture patterns of different user activity from the query logs. Queries are linked by a co-click relationship with respect to users clicking on the same URL in response to it. The following three methods extract these three types of interquery relations, which represent user behavior in the logs: either a specialization / refinement of information needs or a parallel shift from the original search intention. Methods are simple, though intended to thoroughly extract candidates so that they are appropriately combined and applied by a monitored algorithm to maximize manifest."}, {"heading": "3.1 Best Rank Directed Co-Click Relations", "text": "This method compares the positions in the search results of the documents that are clicked during a query session. If a query q q = q q results (according to an appropriate metric - the documents clicked on in a significant number of sessions of q, then q \u00b2 is a candidate query for a recommendation. There is a basic basis for considering the document rankings clicked on rather than the simple similarity of the page sets clicked on. Take, for example, the multi-faceted query \"Curry,\" the documents that a user selects can help identify a subsequent need for information: If he or she is interested in how to cook curry, he or she will select pages that are more related to cooking than those related to the origin of \"curry\" in Indian culinary history. The assumption is that more frugal users with the same need for information are likely to express the query less ambiguously and give that \"curry recipes\" are higher than those suggested by an earlier hypothesis, such as the one we hypothesized."}, {"heading": "3.2 Co-topic Relations", "text": "Commercial search engines often use extensions of the input string in logs as recommendations. In practice, a facet statement in Japanese can easily be identified as a word that appears as the last term in a significant number of different queries. In our experiments, if a word is the last of at least five different query strings, we can safely consider it a facet word as long as queries that appear less than ten times in the logs are eliminated. For example, we can remove queries from the split-topic query \"Curry,\" \"Curry-Restaurant,\" and other queries with different statements. \"We define a co-topic query as a query that is expanded by adding a facet statement\" Curry. \"In terms of co-click relationships, we define a weighting scheme that expresses qqqqs as qqs, a relationship between the topic and the original q1 (Cco-1)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Co-Session Relations", "text": "This last method identifies the query reformulations that were frequently observed during user sessions. Joint session queries are submitted one after the other by the same user at a time interval typically no longer than 5 minutes. (A more complete nomenclature of the relationships extracted in this way is found in [5].) We define the defined CSQq1 as a query set that shares a co-session relationship with q1. The strength of a co-session relationship between q1 and q2 is estimated as probability: PCS (q2 | q1) = cnt (q2, q1) cnt (q1), where cnt (q2, q1) shares the number of queries between q1 and q2 in the same session, if this method is relative to a small one, and q2 if it is relative to an error during a session."}, {"heading": "4. QUERY SIMILARITY", "text": "It is not easy to judge the quality of the query recommendations. To evaluate the three methods presented in the previous section, we use the semantic similarity of the queries after they have been placed in a category hierarchy. We assume a measurement of similarity between pairs of queries by Baeza-Yates and Tiberi [2], the semantic relationships between queries connected by an edge of their click coverage chart. To this end, they use the Open Directory Project2, where queries are matched against the directory content, to find the categories in which they belong. We apply the same methodology, but the use of the Yahoo! JAPAN Directory3 because it has more complete coverage of the Japanese query results. Baeza-Yates and Tiberi use the following similarity function in the categories in which they belong. We apply the same methodology, but the use of the Yahoo! JAPAN Directory3 because it has a Japanese completion coverage."}, {"heading": "5. COMBINING RECOMMENDATIONS", "text": "Determining user intent from contextual information is a very difficult task and does not guarantee effectiveness. Instead, we take a more conservative approach and combine the three methods described above. We try to exploit the strength of each method, but also guard against bad recommendations by offering some conservative specialization queries, some random queries, and some \"topic-changing\" queries. In other words, we diversify the list of recommended queries. We formulate the problem as a \"Learning to Rank\" task, using the similarity measure defined in Section 4. We use decision trees to increase the gradient (GBDT), which are described in [11] because of the robustness of revision, scalability, and ability to deal with highly nonlinear problems of this method."}, {"heading": "Training Data", "text": "For training and test pairs, we calculated the measure of similarity described in Section 4 as the target attribute. To do this, we adjusted the data and added random query pairs to increase the number of negative examples and balance the training set."}, {"heading": "Feature Set", "text": "In Section 3, we defined the quantities PCC (q2 | q1), PCT (q2 | q1) and PCS (q2 | q1). In addition, we defined 24 characteristics as described in Table 1. Facet extraction characteristics are extracted from the query logs. We adopted the query text characteristics used in [5]. Cosine-like similarities are calculated based on the bag of character bigrams and on chunks, i.e. contiguous strings divided by a white space. As a result of these click characteristics, we measure how multifaceted the queries are in terms of user behavior on the set of results. Click entropy is used to reflect query ambiguities as in Teevan et al. [17]. When query sessions occur at the same time, we derive characteristics from two consecutive queries in a user session starting with LR."}, {"heading": "Learning Models", "text": "As mentioned above, we use gradient-increasing decision trees (GBDT [11]). This is an additive regression model over an ensemble of flat regression trees. It fits iteratively to an additive model: Fm (x) = Fm \u2212 1 (x) + \u03b2mTm (x; ig m), where Tm (x; m) is a regression tree in iteration m, weighted by parameter \u03b2m, with a finite number of parameters, consisting of split regions and corresponding weights, optimized to minimize a certain loss function as follows: (\u03b2m, \u03bcm) = argmin\u03b2, \u0394i = 1L (yi, Fm \u2212 1 (x) + \u03b2Tm (x))))). In iteration m, tree Tm (x; m), the negative gradient in iteration (x) is induced to adapt to the negative gradient."}, {"heading": "6. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Evaluation Data", "text": "To evaluate our proposed combined method, we used a sample from the query log of a Japanese commercial search engine. Firstly, only once clicked URLpairs were removed that occurred only once. Secondly, identical query URLpairs with the same browser cookie (i.e. queries from the same client) were counted only once to improve robustness against spam. Thirdly, we selected from the log the 4,544 queries that contain one of the seven most common facet directives that occur in the Japanese web search. Table 2 shows the statistics of our evaluation data. Based on these initial queries, we extracted 188,737 query pairs, 70,041 of which are ranked in a co-click relationship with the best order, 77,991 pairs in a co-topic relationship and 66,612 pairs in a co-session relationship. From them, we excluded pairs where either one query could not be assigned to a category, and at the end we received an average of 86,544 pairs divided by two pairs in a combination."}, {"heading": "6.2 Evaluation Measures", "text": "For a Q query list ranking, the discounted cumulative gain (DCG) at the ranking threshold R is defined as follows: DCGR (Q) = g1 + R \u2211 r = 2gr log2 r, where gr is the value according to the ranking r in Q.We assigned five marks to the similarity of each pair of queries, namely \"perfect\" (above 0.75), \"excellent\" (between 0.75 and 0.5), \"good\" (between 0.5 and 0.25), \"fair\" (below 0.25 but above 0.0) and \"bad\" (at 0) according to the range of similarities. We assign values of 10, 7, 3, 0.5 and 0.0 to these five grades. The ideal ranking of the query list I results from the ranking of recommendations in descending order of their identification values. It is used to define the normalized DCG. Specifically, we use the normalized DCG at 5 (NDC5).The average ranking of the DCG (below the ranking I) is the order of its order."}, {"heading": "6.3 Ranking by a Single Method", "text": "Table 3 compares the NDCG5 and MAP values of each method and machine-learned combined methods. Also included are the results of a simple linear combination of query results for each method, which are calculated separately."}, {"heading": "Co-click Relations", "text": "The BRCCQs typically represent a drill down from the original query. They do not necessarily share any lexical part with the original query, but they do share at least one clicked document with the original query. They often represent specializations, but sometimes parallel movements (\"iPod\" 7 \u2192 \"itune\") or generalizations (\"ANA\" 7 \u2192 \"plane\")."}, {"heading": "Co-topic Relations", "text": "The CTQs also represent a drill down from the original query. Inevitably, they share a lexical part with the original query, but they do not necessarily share a clicked document with it. As expected by higher evaluation standards, they seem to be homogeneous because they share the left substring. However, coverage is limited, especially for longer queries that are already specific enough. They offer conservative recommendations, but strictly limited to specialization queries."}, {"heading": "Co-session relations", "text": "CSQs may be a departure from the original query, but they also include topic shifts. They do not necessarily share any lexical part or any document clicked on with the original query. As mentioned above, parallel queries of movements are characteristic of this method. Unlike the original query \"ANA\" 4, for example, all five top recommendations are either competing transport companies such as \"JAL,\" \"Skymark\" (the names of other airlines), JR (railway companies) or travel agencies such as \"JTB\" and \"HIS.\" This is useful for a seeker who creates a itinerary. In the case of the query \"JR,\" the names of three out of six regional JR railway companies as well as \"ANA\" appear."}, {"heading": "6.4 Combined Ranking", "text": "Once convergence is achieved, we use the model to evaluate the query. Since the combined ranking uses many more features than Pcc, Pct, and Pcs, the ranking is very different from a simple mix of three basic rankings. 4All Nippon Airways or ANA offers domestic flights in Japan.As shown in Table 3, the combined ranking learned from GBDT achieves the best scores. Improvements from each method range from + 1.8% to + 4.1% for NDCG5; all results are statistically significant according to a Wilcoxon test (p \u2264 0.01). For MAP, the conclusions are similar. In general, combining two methods is better than any single method, and the combination of the three methods further improves performance, especially with respect to the MAP. A visual inspection of Figure 2, in which the precision curves, does not confirm these small differences between each method."}, {"heading": "NDCG5 and MAP.", "text": "Finally, Table 4 shows the relative importance of the features listed in Table 1. Although BCos - the cosinal similarity between the letter bigram representations of two queries - is the most important feature partly due to the evaluation bias mentioned in Section 4, other nine features account for more than 10% of its meaning, which indicates that the proposed set of features is very effective for this task. BCos, as well as other textual features, tend to promote queries that share lexical elements with the original, i.e. typically found in the CTQ sets. On the other hand, the second, more important features LLR - the log probability ratio of observing q2 to q1 in the same session - and Next.Ent - the next query entropy of q1 - refer to CSQs."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The second method is based on the observation that users often refine their queries by adding terms. The third method uses the query sequences in search sessions and recommends some typical topic shifts from the query. We have conducted experiments in a query log of a commercial search engine in Japan to compare the three methods. We have observed that each method has its own advantages and disadvantages; the first method is based on the position of the documents clicked, which are difficult to understand at first glance."}, {"heading": "8.

Examining these reformulations shows that recommendations that precise the focus of a query are helpful, like those based on expansions of the original queries. But it also shows that queries that express some topical shift with respect to the original query can help user access more rapidly the information they need. We propose a method to identify from search engine query logs possible candidate queries that can be recommended to focus or shift a topic. This method combines various clickbased, topic-based and session based ranking strategies and uses supervised learning in order to maximize the semantic similarity between the query and the recommendations, while at the same time we diversify them. We evaluate our method using the query/click logs of a Japanese web search engine and we show that the combination of the three methods proposed is significantly better than any of them taken individually.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
