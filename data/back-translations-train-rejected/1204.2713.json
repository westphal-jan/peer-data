SEMANTIC FORMALIZATION OF USER BROWSING BEHAVIOR", "text": "We use the term browsing event to describe the basic component of user behavior when performing activities (actions) using the web browser directly.Definition 1 (event) We define a browsing event as tuples e = (l, T, P, t), where l is the full URL accessed is a set of event types for which this event qualifies, P = {p1,..., pm} is a set of parameters and t is the event time. For convenience, we refer to event time by ei.t and set of event types by ei.T. Each event that results from a user's interaction with a particular website serves a specific function (searches within a portal, searches in a search engine, browser information, booking, login, etc.) related to some content (e.g. flight booking, car rental, organization, hotel, etc.)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Web Browsing Activity Model", "text": "For the realization of the concepts defined above, we present a Web Browsing Activity Model (WAM) 5, which we formalize as ontology, illustrated in Fig. 2. Classes in WAM are divided into three groups: Core Classes, External Classes and Type Classes. External Classes are basic concepts that we reuse from established ontologies. Each wam: Event is a subclass of the concept event: Event from event ontology 6. Each wam: Session has a wam: StartEvent and a wam: EndEvent, both of the type wam: Event. Class wam: The user is simply identified by user IP address and ID, but the ontology allows flexible future extensibility with user profiles or other attributes (e.g. IP-based geographical location). To note the event timestamp and session interval, we use the basic concepts from OWL ontology, 7, which model knowledge of time as units."}, {"heading": "2.2 Formalization Approach", "text": "We treat each entry-level log as a browsing event, as described in Def. 1. These events are grouped into sessions based on user IP addresses, and the formalized browsing events represent semantic models of user browsing activity that we store in a repository, which is then used as the basis for semantic analysis of usage behavior, including the query response techniques we present in Section 3, and other potential semantic pattern-mining mechanisms."}, {"heading": "3. QUERYING USER BROWSING PATTERNS", "text": "It is important to think about the surfing behavior of users, not only using conditions related to enriched semantics, but also taking into account time constraints related to the dynamics of such behavior. To achieve this, we allow the formulation of queries to our knowledge base, including time operators such as, finally, until, always. This motivates us to deal with temporal logics capable of ontological reasoning. To support this temporal reasoning, we adopt an approach similar to that in [3], which presents the temporal descriptive logic ALC-LTL as an extension of ALC with linear temporal logic (LTL). Instead of ALC, we use in our approach SROIQ (as in [8]) the DL underlying our WAM ontology. We refer to this formalism as DL-LTL and use it to formulate queries to formalized browser preferences and sessions."}, {"heading": "3.1 Query Formulation", "text": "In our query approach, we consider the terms real time and abstract time. As mentioned in Def. 4 of a session, the arrangement of events within the session is used as the basis for abstract time to formulate time constraints. As an example, we consider the following query: Query q1: Let us find sessions in which the user starts the homepage of the website, and then finally perform the search in a machine (website) to then return to the website. Answer q1 requires the search for a session with a start time Te and an end time Te, and also the set of events ei s.t. Ts \u2264 ei.t \u2264 Te. Within this set of events, we filter only these events with the required URLs and order. The earlier part of the query deals with real time, whereas the latter part of time deals with abstract time (arrangement of events in a timeline).This query can be defined as a DL-LTL formula whose term we follow is: \u2022"}, {"heading": "3.2 Query Answering Approach", "text": "We present an answer to the question based on a matchmaking technique that allows us to automatically call this session to meet a set of semantic and temporal conditions. (The answer to the question about the formula defined in Def. 5 is an expression of Session S, formalized using the approach described in Section 2 and stored in a central repository.) To find the answers to the query, we apply a matchmaking mechanism that proceeds as follows: Step 1 - Checking Satisfiability of Session Constraints. These steps deal with the expression of Query q, which is exclusively related to the attributes of the session."}, {"heading": "4. IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to play by the rules we have set ourselves, \"he said in an interview with\" Welt am Sonntag. \""}, {"heading": "5. RELATED WORK", "text": "Interest in the characterization of online behavior began much earlier with works such as those by Catledge et al. [6], Montgomery et al. [13], which attempt to identify browsing strategies and patterns on the Web. Browsing activities have been studied and modeled, e.g. Bucklin et al. [5] and others that normally exploit server-side logs of visitors to a particular Web site. In terms of modeling web browsing behavior on multiple Web sites, Downey et al. [7] propose a state mechanical representation to describe search activities. Park and Fader [15] present a statistical model of browsing behavior in two Web sites.Ontologies in Web usage mining. There is an extensive work dealing with usage protocol analysis and mining, but we focus on combining these techniques with semantic technologies involving contributions from works such as those by Stumme et al. [16] and Oberet al."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We have implemented this formalization approach and conducted experiments with real data sets of usage protocols from two Linked Open Data Servers (DBpedia and Semantic Web Dog Food). Additional dynamic aspects of user browser behavior can be discovered when thinking is possible not only with semantic constraints, but also with time conditions. To this end, we are introducing a query formulation approach based on a time-limited description logic called DL-LTL, which combines SROIQ with Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Besides formalism, we present a query response mechanism based on a model verification technique that allows to automatically retrieve sessions of user browser events that satisfy a number of semantic and temporal conditions."}, {"heading": "7.
