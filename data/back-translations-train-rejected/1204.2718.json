RELATED WORK", "text": "The authors apply a customized version of the Random Surfer Model 7 - called Targeted Surfer - to mitigate the problem of presenting summaries that help domain experts, but not the average user. Our approach can be seen as a first step in this direction, as it focuses on using usage data to provide summaries. Our summaries are not tailored to each user, but present a consensus that has been achieved through similar behavior in the past. [7] Hierarchical links with a weighted lens analysis are used."}, {"heading": "4. DATASET", "text": "To prepare the first tests, we combined the usage data of the HetRec2011 MovieLens2k dataset [4] with Freebase.8 The usage dataset expands the original MovieLens10M dataset9 with additional metadata: directors, actors, countries and locations have been added to the original dataset. Although this dataset already contains valuable material to perform our tests without the use of LOD (i.e. Freebase), the search space for properties and objects is very limited, especially 26 properties (the four above plus 22 other properties such as the genre, year, rotate tomatoes10 rating, etc.), the range in Freebase will be much broader than - for example - more than 380 different genres (fb: film.genre) as opposed to the 20 fixed genres in the HetRec2011 MovieLens2k dataset.The HetRec2011 MovieLens2k dates.com"}, {"heading": "5. PRELIMINARY RESULTS", "text": "With the data set we were able to identify and classify characteristics that connect a unit to one of its closest neighbors. We do not plan to make a separate assessment at the neighborhood quality level, but we are currently making comparisons at the level of the quality of summaries. In this analysis, we are also conducting various similarity measures as well as an estimate of the optimal size of the neighborhood. At this stage of our work, no statistics have been produced for the presentation of these results. We will discuss our results with respect to neighborhood formation in Section 5.1. In addition, preliminary results of the unit summary approach are presented in Section 5.2."}, {"heading": "5.1 Neighborhood formation", "text": "One of the most important steps is the creation of neighborhoods solely dependent on usage data. An example of such neighborhoods is shown in Table 1. Generally, the neighborhood depicted in the film \"Beauty and the Beast\" corresponds to the perception of most observers and also overlaps with related films presented in IMDb.16. The values shown in Table 1 are all very close to each other, and each rating is also close to a perfect match (1.0). In this respect, the question arises whether the k-next neighborhood approach makes sense with such dense results. An alternative might be to introduce a threshold rather than simply selecting a fixed number of neighbors (e.g., any movies that have a similarity of more than 0.95). In fact, the duration of the SPARQL queries would turn into a game of chance, as it is not possible to decide in advance whether there are 10 or 500 neighbors that cross the threshold. Another approach to address this question would be to introduce different or additional similarity measures that will expand the reach - the result - while extending the neighborhood."}, {"heading": "5.2 Neighborhood-based entity summarization", "text": "In general, most of the examples presented have the genre as one of the strongest components. In this area, one of the real advantages of LOD can be illustrated, i.e. the wealth of data: genres such as \"costume drama,\" \"crime fiction\" or \"parody\" are missing from the HetRec2011 MovieLens2k record and cannot be described. It is interesting to see that the property fb: film.written _ is influenced by all the films presented. As a result, the film \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" shares with its neighbours that the scene is set in the UK, while Walt Disney as a production company is certainly important for the film \"Beauty and the Beast.\" It is also worth noting that \"Pulp Fiction\" is heavily influenced by its director."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "In the following, we will summarize the main findings of this early phase of research. We have presented an approach that attempts to use usage data to place entities in space. This part of semantic web research is linked to a variety of fields, including semantic user modeling, and information ranking.The goal of our research is to create significant summaries of entities, which is the task of identifying characteristics that \"not only represent the main requirements for the underlying entities, but also identify the underlying entities.\""}, {"heading": "7. FUTURE WORK", "text": "Given the simplicity of our current approach and the subjective quality that has already been achieved, we plan to pursue this path of research. In our next contributions, we plan to make the following improvements: \u2022 A comprehensive evaluation of the approach will be carried out: the analysis will include an intrinsic and an extrinsic evaluation using user surveys. \u2022 Features that represent a scalable solution (and are not shared with others) will be included in future versions of this approach. It must be evaluated whether usage data can help in this task. \u2022 The problem of intermedia nodes must be addressed in order to provide a scalable solution."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The research that led to these results was funded by the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union (FP7 / 2007-2013) under Funding Agreement 257790."}], "references": [{"title": "Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art and Possible Extensions", "author": ["Gediminas Adomavicius", "Alexander Tuzhilin"], "venue": "IEEE Trans. on Knowl. and Data Eng", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Latent dirichlet allocation", "author": ["David M.
