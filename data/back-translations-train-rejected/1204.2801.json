(2011), an approach to the use of a visual language model to improve the recognition of visual structures in a generative visual domain is to think about the raw recognition rate of the partial detectors - analogous to the way speech recognition systems represent a human speech model to improve recognition characteristics in a generative linguistic domain. (CSP) In this approach, a complex object is constructed from a collection of parts that come from a small part of the inventory. A language model that arises in the form of a stochastic limitation of the image (CSP) shows that it is the recognition rate of phoneme detectors (1978), characterizes the object parts that result in an entire object and significantly characterizes the recognition rate of the entire structure over the infinite recognition rate of recognition characteristics resulting from the unreliable application of the unreliable partial detectors."}, {"heading": "3 Visibility Estimation", "text": "This year, as never before in the history of a country in which it is a country in which it is a country in which it is not a country in which it is not a country, but a country in which it is a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country"}, {"heading": "4 Structure-Estimation Confidence", "text": "While we regard the structure of this distribution, H (Z | I), as a measure of reliability, it is intractable to calculate and compute this distribution and other intractable distributions.

Natural language, for example, can be integrated into our approach to extract additional evidence for estimating the structure from statements describing the structure in question. A sentence or sentence describing a structure does not need to clearly specify the structure. Similar to additional images from novel angles, supplementary but partial evidence for estimating the structure can be provided, sentences that provide incomplete descriptions of structural features can also provide complementary but partial evidence for estimating the structure. We have explored this possibility by using a small domain-specific language to describe some common features present in assembly toys. This language has: two nouns (windows and door), four spatial relationships (left of, right of, perpendicular to, and coplanar to), and a conjunction (and). Sentences constructed from these words can easily be placed in a series of Asian analogies, such as a valid assembly."}, {"heading": "7 Results", "text": "eiD rf\u00fc nlrfhUeae\u00fccnlrf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the"}, {"heading": "8 Related work", "text": "Our work shares three general objectives with previous work: estimating the 3D structure from 2D images, determining when there are closures, and active vision. However, our work examines each of these problems from a novel perspective. In contrast, our work focuses on restoring the constituent structure of an assembly: which parts are used to make the assembly and how such parts are combined. Existing state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods (e.g. Make3D et al., 2008) are unable to determine the surface structure of an assembly, and how these parts are combined."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "We have a general framework for (a) seeing the unpredictable, (b) seeing the unpredictable, (c) seeing the unpredictable, (c) a rational basis for determining confidence in what one sees, and (d) a decision-making process of active vision to determine rational behavior in the presence of unpredictability. We have initiated and evaluated our general framework in the LINCOLN LOG domain and found that it is effective. This framework has many potential extensions. You can construct random variables to represent uncertain evidence in other modalities such as language and language, and you can expand the stochastic CSP to limit these variables along with the current random variables that represent visual evidence and latent structures, so that a latent utterance describes a latent structure. You can then use the same highly probable estimation techniques to prove the most probable imaging is consistent with a structure that produces the most likely appearance."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work has been supported in part by the NSF Grant CCF0438806, the Naval Research Laboratory under contract number N00173-10-1-G023, the Army Research Laboratory under cooperation agreement number W911NF-10-2-0060, and computing resources provided by Information Technology at Purdue through the Rosen Center for Advanced Computing.
