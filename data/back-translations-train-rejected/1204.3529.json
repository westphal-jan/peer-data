Second, we build on this first extension and prove that a similar limit is used in trying to determine a literal minimum of pure horn 3-CNF representation.

In the polynomial time setting, we get a hardness of the pure horn factor of 2log 1 \u2212 o (1) n and if subexponential computing time is available, we show a factor of O (log\u03b2 n), where \u03b2 > 0 is a small constant and n is the number of variables of the pure horn function. All these results hold even if the input CNF formula is almost linear, namely if its size is O (n1 + \u03b5) for some small constants. We have also managed to achieve a factor of the O function (log n) among more stringent, if the input CNF formula is even the size of the input formula (n2)."}], "references": [{"title": "Computational Complexity: A modern approach", "author": ["S.
