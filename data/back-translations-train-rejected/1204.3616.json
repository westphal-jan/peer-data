However, it is unreliable solely as a means of characterizing the coarse motion of a participant object because it simultaneously has a high false-positive and a high false-negative rate. Furthermore, there is not a single detection threshold that correctly distinguishes the false-positive and false-negative rate in a class- or video-independent manner. Furthermore, the raw detection trustworthy or even their ranking generated by the detector alone cannot be used on isolated frames to select the desired detection. Furthermore, the detector alone cannot distinguish between false-positive and multiple objects of the same class at narrow positions in the field of view. Likewise, the detector alone does not provide time-corresponding information."}, {"heading": "3.1 Optimal selection of object tracks", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "3.2 Entering and leaving the field of view", "text": "The previously described algorithm constructs tracks that cover the entire video from the first frame to the last frame. We allow objects that enter and leave the field of view by simply applying this algorithm to a subinterval of the video. The only difficulty here is determining the subinterval boundaries. We take the subinterval to start with a detection security above a certain threshold at the first frame and end at the last such frame. To derive this threshold, we calculate a (50 bin) histogram of the maximum detection security in each frame, across the entire video. It is expected that this histogram will be bimodal, since frames in which the object does not exist will have lower confidence values, since all detections will be false positive. We assume the threshold to be the minimum of the value that maximizes the variance between classes (Otsu, 1979), if we match this histogram and the learned detector concentrator threshold, which is mostly a small amount of the interference threshold (in practice)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Multiple instances of the same object class", "text": "We detect multiple traces of the same class of object by repeatedly using the above method, and we must prevent subsequent iterations from rediscovering traces created by previous iterations; the naive way to do this would be to remove detections associated with previous traces. Detection boxes can be associated with previous traces if their centers are located in detection boxes contained in those earlier traces. However, eliminating all of these detections carries the risk of eliminating overlapping traces, as would happen when objects pass each other in the field of view. Therefore, instead of removing detections, we use them with the maximum detection value in the lower quartile of the results for this frame. Given the distortion process toward false positives in the detection source, boxes in the lower quartile are likely false positives and undesirable to include them in a coherent track."}, {"heading": "3.4 Nonrigid motion and out-of-plane rotation", "text": "Felzenszwalb et al. \"s part-based object detector is unreliable as a detection source when there is no rigid motion and rotation outside the plane. Our tracking framework can provide resilience in the face of such unreliability by integrating detection boxes from multiple detection sources. We do this by combining multiple models for Felzenszwalb et al.\" s part-based object detector for different object results under non-rigid motion and off-plane rotation, and combining the resulting detections. As discussed in Section 3.1, we need to ensure that the confidence values allow comparison between detection sources, by matching the confidence values for each detection source around the threshold calculated in Section 3.2.The C-D1a corpus, and that the resulting detections have little off-plane rotation, thus not affecting the reliability of the detection source of non-rigid body motion, namely a corpus containing a change."}, {"heading": "3.5 Smoothing", "text": "Boxes with recovered object tracks suffer from jitter. We remove this jitter by adapting piece by piece cubic splines to the width, height, and X and Y center coordinates of the tracked boxes. A simple selection of smoothing parameters is sufficient for the C-D1a corpus. Since the videos in C-D1a have a small frame length variation, a constant number of spline pieces is sufficient. Box X and Y center coordinates are smoothed with 10 pieces, as they can move significantly when tracking accelerated objects, such as a bouncing ball. Box widths and heights are smoothed with 5 pieces, as object shape and size change less drastically."}, {"heading": "3.6 Results", "text": "Our tracker runs in time O (lm + lmn | df | 2) to restore n tracks with m detection sources, each delivering d detections per frame, with f images of the forward projection on videos with the length l. In practice, the runtime is dominated by the detection process and the dynamic programming step. Fig. 3 illustrates the functioning of our tracker and shows the output of each stage. From this video, one can clearly see the robustness of our tracker in the face of a confusing non-stationary background, a movement that is not perpendicular to the camera axis, an extremely high false positive distortion detection rate of the detection source, an occlusion resulting from overlapping tracks corresponding to interacting objects, non-rigid movements resulting from the change in the human body posture, objects entering and leaving the field of vision, and multiple distances of the same object class, in addition to the fact that the entire object class of our tracker would be represented optically, as the fact that the whole of the tracker is represented by an optical object."}, {"heading": "4 Classification", "text": "3. Aspects of Coordination: We formulate the problem of labeling a video with a verb as a time series classification problem, discarding all object and body placement patterns available in these tracks. For each video, we designate one track as an agent and another track (if it exists) as the patient. The agent is determined using a heuristic approach: humans are more likely to be agentorial than inanimate objects, motorcycles and SUVs are more likely to be agents than other inanimate objects because they are driven by people who are not recognized due to occlusion. A different track (if it exists) than the patient with the same heuristic approach. Ties are broken by selecting the track as an agent with the highest coherence."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "For each of the five cross-validation runs, we have trained the examples in four of the five partitions and tested them on the examples in the remaining partition. Figure 5 gives the recognition accuracy for each classification algorithm for each cross-validation run. Figure 7 and Figure 8 give the aggregated confusion matrices for each classification algorithm across all five cross-validation runs. Note the essentially identical performance of HMMs and DTW: HMMs have an aggregated bounce accuracy of 71.9%, while the DTW has a jump accuracy of 71.3%. In addition, we give them essentially the same performance of HMMs and DTW: HMMs have a jump accuracy of 81.9%, while the DTW has a jump accuracy of 71.3%."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "Our focus in this paper is on assessing the hypothesis that it is possible to label videos with verbs, using only information about the strongly changing motion of the event participants. There are numerous places where our calculation methods explicitly discard information available to evaluate this hypothesis. Since such information could correlate with the underlying event, one could expand our classifiers to use this information. For example, one might expect that the results of detector reliability would decrease significantly with occlusion, and thus correlate with the interaction of the object indicating the event class. Likewise, one might expect that the object class would correlate with the event class. In fact, as shown in Figure 6, such a correlation would significantly reduce the potential verb-label space, making the verb-label task almost trivial. Likewise, as discussed in Section 3.4, the time series of characteristic vectors could be used to supplement the human body posture by several conditional information relative to the use of the resistant product."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work has been supported in part by the NSF Grant CCF0438806, the Naval Research Laboratory under contract number N00173-10-1-G023, the Army Research Laboratory under cooperation agreement number W911NF-10-2-0060, and computing resources provided by Information Technology at Purdue through the Rosen Center for Advanced Computing.
