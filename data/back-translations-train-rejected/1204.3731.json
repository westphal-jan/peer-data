INTRODUCTION", "text": "Twitter users tweet not only about their personal problems or nearby events, but also about news and events that are of interest to a particular community. [5] Twitter has become a powerful tool for keeping up to date. Twitter users are known to share exhaustive messages about (all kinds of) events that they follow live, occasionally leading to related trending topics [9]. The user community tweets live about a particular event and generates rich content that describes sub-events that occur during an event (e.g. goals, red cards, or penalties in a football game), all of which share valuable information that allows live coverage of events [1]. However, this overwhelming amount of information makes it difficult for users to: (i) follow the full stream as they describe sub-events, and (ii) to find out the most important, aggregated information about events that happen during the event."}, {"heading": "2. DATASET", "text": "We are investigating the case of tweets sent during the matches of a football competition. Sports events are a good choice to explore the 42 tweets for summary purposes, as they are usually reported live by journalists and provide a comparison value. We set out to explore the Copa America 2011 championship, which took place from 1 to 24 July 2011 in Argentina, where 26 football matches were played. Selecting an international competition with a wide reach makes it possible to collect and summarize tweets in different languages. Official start times for the games were announced in advance by the organization.During the Copa America period, we collected all tweets containing any # ca2011, # copaamerica2011 and # copaamerica2011 that were set as official Twitter hashtags for the competition. For the 24 days of collection, we collected 1,425,858 unique tweets sent by 290,716 different users. These tweets are written in 30 different languages, with a majority of 76.2% in Portuguese, and 7.2% in Portuguese."}, {"heading": "3. REAL-TIME EVENT SUMMARIZATION", "text": "We define the real-time summary of events as a task that provides new information about an event each time a relevant sub-event occurs. To begin the task of summarizing events, we define a two-step process that makes it possible to report information about new sub-events in different languages. The first step is to determine at any time whether or not a particular sub-event occurred in the final seconds. Output will be a Boolean value that determines whether something relevant has occurred; if so, the second step is to select a representative tweet that describes the sub-event in the language preferred by the user. Aggregating these two processes, in turn, provides a series of tweets as a summary of the game (see Figure 1).2 http: / / uk.eurosport.yahoo.com / football / copa-america / matches-results /"}, {"heading": "3.1 First Step: Sub-Event Detection", "text": "The first part of the whole, which focuses on the essential, is the time in which the world changes, and the time in which the world changes, and the time in which the world changes. (...) The second part of the whole is the time in which the world changes. (...) The third part of the whole is time. (...) The third part of the whole is time. (...) The third part of the whole is time. (...) The third part of the whole is time. (...) The third part of the whole is time. (...) The third part of the whole is time. (...)

(...) The third part is time. (...) The third part is time."}, {"heading": "3.2 Second Step: Tweet Selection", "text": "The second and final part of the summary system is the Tweet Selection. This second step is activated only when the first step reports that a new sub-event has occurred. Once the system detects that a sub-event has occurred, the Tweet selector is provided with the tweets corresponding to the minute of the sub-event. From these tweets, the system must select a representative tweet describing what has happened. This tweet must provide the most important information about the sub-event so that the user understands what has happened and can follow the event. Here, we compare two tweet selection methods, one based only on the information contained within the minute of the sub-event, and another taking into account the knowledge acquired during the game. We test them using the output of the Outlier-based sub-event described and can follow the event. To select a representative tweet selection method, we get a sum of all the tweets we rank, each of which contains the result."}, {"heading": "4. RELATED WORK", "text": "Automatic summarization of events from tweets is still in its infancy as a field of research. Some have tackled the task offline after the events have ended. Hannon et al. [3], for example, present an approach for automatically generating video highlights for football matches after they have ended. They set a fixed number of sub-events that want to be included in the highlights, selecting as many video fragments with the highest Twitter activity. Others, such as Petrovic and al. [6], show the potential of Twitter for detecting and detecting events from tweets. While some events have been studied retrospectively, there is very little research that deals with the real-time study of events to provide immediate information. Zhao et al. [7] recognize sub-events that occurred during NFL games and use an approach based on the increase in Twitter activity. We use this approach as a baseline in our sub-event recognition process, rather than applying it to the sub-event lexicon."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Using simple text analysis methods such as KLD, our system generates real-time summaries with accuracy and retrieval values of over 80% compared to manually generated reports. The fact that users tweet simultaneously using overlapping vocabulary helps not only to identify a partial event, but also to select a representative tweet to describe it. Our study also shows that taking into account all previous information seen during the event is really helpful for this purpose and yields better results than taking into account only the most recent activity. The activity of the football matches studied in this paper varies from 11k to 74k tweets sent, showing that regardless of the audience tweeting about an event, our method effectively reports the most important sub-events during a game. Finally, all relevant types of sub-events, such as goals and game ending, are reported almost perfectly."}, {"heading": "6.
