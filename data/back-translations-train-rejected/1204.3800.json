The paper analyses the stages in the evolution of early writing systems which began with the evolution of counting in the ancient Near East. A stage anterior to the stage of syllabic representation of sounds of a language, is identified. Unique geometric shapes required for tokens to categorize objects became too large to handle to abstract hundreds of categories of goods and metallurgical processes during the production of bronze-age goods. About 3500 BCE, Indus script as a writing system was developed to use hieroglyphs to represent the 'spoken words' identifying each of the goods and processes. A rebus method of representing similar sounding words of the lingua franca of the artisans was used in Indus script. This method is recognized and consistently applied for the lingua franca of the Indian sprachbund. That the ancient languages of India, constituted a sprachbund (or language union) is now recognized by many linguists. The sprachbund area is proximate to the area where most of the Indus script inscriptions were discovered, as documented in the corpora. That hundreds of Indian hieroglyphs continued to be used in metallurgy is evidenced by their use on early punch-marked coins. This explains the combined use of syllabic scripts such as Brahmi and Kharoshti together with the hieroglyphs on Rampurva copper bolt, and Sohgaura copper plate from about 6th century BCE.Indian hieroglyphs constitute a writing system for meluhha language and are rebus representations of archaeo-metallurgy lexemes. The rebus principle was employed by the early scripts and can legitimately be used to decipher the Indus script, after secure pictorial identification.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Apr 2012 14:14:26 GMT  (1701kb,AD)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3800v1", "49 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "49 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["srinivasan kalyanaraman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.3800"}, "pdf": {"name": "1204.3800.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Meluhha (Mleccha", "Jules Bloch\u2019s"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city, where it has gone down in history as never before."}, {"heading": "Economic Court: Flora and Products from Flora", "text": "BirdInsectFaunaAnimated phenomena: birth, body, sensory perceptions and storyVisual phenomena, shapes and shapesNumbering and mensurationEconomic phenomena: natural phenomena, earth formations, products of the earth (excluding plants grouped in adistinc category) Construction, infrastructureWork, skills, work products and workers (fireworks, potters / blacksmiths / stonemasons, weavers, farmers, soldiers) Weapons and toolsLanguage fieldsKinshipSocial formations"}, {"heading": "Economic Court: Flora and Products from Flora", "text": "This year we have it in our hands to travel the world."}, {"heading": "Birds", "text": "bird blue jay cock crane cuckoo pigeon duck eagle feather vertiginous crest hawk heron kingfisher myna nest owl parrot pheasant quail robins shrikeskylark snipe sparrow teal weaver bird"}, {"heading": "Insects", "text": "Bat-caterpillar-chameleon-cockroach-crab-frog-insect-lizard-mosquito-scorpion-snake-spider"}, {"heading": "Fauna", "text": "animal antelope, goat, deer, marker hor, ram alligator bear buffalo bull camel dog elephant fish hare herd horse ivory lair lion roar lemon monkey musk deer octopus pony porpoise rhinoceros black squirrel tail tiger tortoise yak-tailAnimate phenomena: birth, body, sensory perceptions and action age amazed anger anus arrive attack back bald bathe hind beards beat his belly bile birth blindness blood beat body boil bonebreath bristles buttock care cheek chest chignon chin climb come copulate cross scream dance death doubt dream dumb dwarf echo elbows and excrements eye faeces fall fat fist fly frolic front funeralgenus give gore coarse hair heel beat beat beat beat hunt infertile creatures"}, {"heading": "Numeration and Mensuration", "text": "account agreement audit average balance (balance) bankers large wide center cheap coin collection contain count inadequately divide eight fingers five four half high increase common knot ease mark mark mark mark numbering one rest six seven ten two t hree twelve twenty measure weight zero economic court: natural phenomena, earth formations, products of the earth (except floraclustered in a unique category) barren basin borax brass bright bronze burst clay cloud cold collyrium crystal clear darkness dawn desert rise dry extinguish fire frost gem glitter gold (including soma) goods earth hail heat hill island lapislazuli lightning moon mud night northern sea ore pearl planetpleiaden rain rainbow river ruby sand salt sediment shell silk silver sky smoke solstice south starstone sun tank tin thunder waterwave wet wind zodiac"}, {"heading": "Building, infrastructure", "text": "[The lexemes relating to weapons and tools are so vivid and distinctive that the entire group has come together to give an overview of the skills developed, which are reflected in insemantic expansions related to types of weapons and their exercise.

Providing an example from the Indian Hieroglyphs used in Indus Script as a writing system, a stage anterior to the stage of syllabic representation of sounds of a language, is identified. Unique geometric shapes required for tokens to categorize objects became too large to handle to abstract hundreds of categories of goods and metallurgical processes during the production of bronze-age goods. In such a situation, it became necessary to use glyphs which could distinctly identify, orthographically, specific descriptions of or cataloging of ores, alloys, and metallurgical processes. About 3500 BCE, Indus script as a writing system was developed to use hieroglyphs to represent the \u2018spoken words\u2019 identifying each of the goods and processes. A rebus method of representing similar sounding words of the lingua franca of the artisans was used in Indus script. This method is recognized and consistently applied for the lingua franca of the Indian sprachbund. That the ancient languages of India, constituted a sprachbund (or language union) is now recognized by many linguists. The sprachbund area is proximate to the area where most of the Indus script inscriptions were discovered, as documented in the corpora. That hundreds of Indian hieroglyphs continued to be used in metallurgy is evidenced by their use on early punch-marked coins. This explains the combined use of syllabic scripts such as Brahmi and Kharoshti together with the hieroglyphs on Rampurva copper bolt, and Sohgaura copper plate from about 6 th century BCE.Indian hieroglyphs constitute a writing system for meluhha language and are rebus representations of archaeo-metallurgy lexemes.
