For convenience, head (qi), tail (qi), and len (qi) indicate the starting point, end point, and length of qi, respectively, the length of Qi. We define a slight misuse of notation, E (\u00b7) denotes the vertex clause and the undirected edge of the input parameter, which can be either a path, Qi, or a series of paths, such as Q. We define an intersection between two paths as a maximum sequence of vertices and edges that jointly belong to the two paths.

SCHEDULING DISTANCE OPTIMAL PATHS", "text": "In this section, we show that an arbitrary path on DQ (it can be more than one such path) can be converted into a scheduled path set to Q (Q = q Q = q Q). As mentioned in the introduction, time optimization is measured by the time it takes the last agent to achieve its goal (some call this measurement the Makespan) Our planning algorithm is fairly simple. In what follows, the DAG that comes closest to one of these standalone target vertices is Plan 5 (Sequential Transfer Schedule) for each time step t = i, 0 \u2264 i n \u2212 1, across all standalone target vertices (Corollary 4 guarantees at least one existing one), select an initial vertex that comes closest to one of these standalone target vertices.

CONCLUSION, FUTURE WORK, AND OPEN PROBLEMS", "text": "In this paper, we show that the formation control of graphs, as defined in problem 1, has optimal distance solutions that can be efficiently calculated. In addition, the shortest paths can be planned to achieve a control policy with a narrow convergence time warranty. The calculation of the control policy can be carried out very efficiently. Two threads of future work are currently being researched, one of which is to decentralize the algorithm, ideally without a global clock and limited local communication. Another natural next step is to extend the results of graphs to continuous areas of work. There are many ways to do this. For example, we can place a graph structure on a Euclidean space via discretion (see e.g. Figure 8), which is not limited to grid structures. Given arbitrary initial and target formations, we can design controllers by aligning the initial and target formations at different levels first."}], "references": [{"title": "Distributed memoryless point convergence algorithm for mobile robots with limited visibility", "author": ["H.
