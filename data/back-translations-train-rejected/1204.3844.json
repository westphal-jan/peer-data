This paper analyzes the role of the percolation threshold, a universal measure of connectivity in graphs, to analyze the convergence of swarm algorithms as a function of the expected number of neighbors in the initial phase, and therefore to develop a framework to compare the performance of hybrid PSO algorithms. Analysis of the performance of different hybrid PSO algorithms has been addressed in various papers [4,7,3]. However, in this work we focus on the concept of the percolation threshold as a useful tool to define the parameter space for which the performance of the basic PSO algorithms is improved."}, {"heading": "2 Analysis of goals as a function of the expected degree at initial step.", "text": "Applied equation (2), we examine the success of the PSO algorithm as a function of radius R (a) after a longitudinal study of the expected mean degree. - Dataset A: 0.000 \u2264 a \u2264 0.9, which means that only a fraction of individuals have a better neighborhood: from 0.0 to 0.9 with the maximum range of 0.1. Table 1 shows the corresponding neighborhood radius R (a). Each function is performed 20 times, so that for each R (a) 100 runs have been completed. - Dataset B: 1 \u2264 a \u2264 30, from the minimum (1 neighbor) to the maximum (29 neighbors) plus one, 30 neighbors with step 1. Neighborhood radius R varies in the interval 20,601 \u2264 R \u2264 112,838. - Best global value register at each run the best position that each agent remembers is the best global \u2212 f (t)."}, {"heading": "3 Exploring the disk percolation threshold", "text": "The values of R around the critical radius Rc were examined in varying degrees along the interval. [4,37, 4,515] just before the critical threshold ac = 4,512 with step 0.001. Therefore, R (a) varies in the interval [43.066, 43.775] in intervals of 0.01. Each instance of parameter R was executed 100 times, 20 for each function fi. Table 3 shows the means of the goals, the best global value achieved and final step. Compared to Table 2, the total number of successful runs corresponds to the goals of Dataset A, 88.5%, as well as the mean global value, 0.02. The difference to Dataset A lies in the number of steps: at critical radius Rc the performance of the PSO algorithm decreases to the mean of 42 iterations in successful runs, close to the 38 steps achieved in Dataset B. Mean steps, 197, are only in the middle of the 199 dataset S4. As a large dataset B = 4.5B.

The theory of plate leakage gives us a way to relate the expected number of neighbors a to the neighboring radius R of individuals, despite different parameter values of the world, population P, and square side S. In Table 6, we give values of R for different degrees a1 = 0.00151, a2 = 0.8, a3 = 29, and for a critical radius ac = 4.512, calculated according to (2). Table 6 shows that the conditions xmax = 100 = S 2 and P = 30 for each yield a corresponding radius R (a) in the intervals examined in previous sections: R (0.00151) = 0.8 [0.75, 0.9] analyzed in section 4, R (0.8) = 18.426 in datasets A and R (29) = 110.941 in datasets B of section 2 and critical radius R = 0.9]."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we show that the infiltration threshold is a tool for analyzing the convergence of swarms in relation to the expected number of neighbors in a first step. While the traditional PSO algorithm is based on the external calculation of the world's best convergence target, we present experiments here that suggest that, on the one hand, very small amounts of information translated into very low values of a are sufficient to provoke the convergence of PSO swarms. Furthermore, better values of convergence are found. On the other hand, a low degree ac = 4.512 is sufficient for both purposes: convergence to the minimum and to small runs. The steps required for convergence become constant from this critical value. Therefore, more neighbors do the same than ac neighbors. The infiltration threshold of disks is a measure of 2D systems. Efforts are being made to investigate the calculation of the infiltration thresholds for higher dimensions."}], "references": [{"title": "Percolation", "author": ["B. Bollobs", "O.
