Formalisation of the problem", "text": "In this thesis, we assume that an example base is defined that describes the expected behavior of the system under consideration. Examples are described by a vector value and by a label. A vector of attribute values describes the sample properties and the label, the concept we are trying to learn. In this thesis, we assume that the set of possible labels is finite. Figure 1 provides an example base that concerns the acquisition of procedural knowledge for a geomatic process: the goal is to learn knowledge in relation to the choice of the best operation to be applied to assemblies according to their geometric properties in order to create a 50k map. The goal of the supervised evaluation of attribute groups is then to calculate a quality value for the attribute set from the sample base."}, {"heading": "B. Evaluation of feature sets", "text": "In the literature, many methods have been proposed to evaluate a set of characteristics on the basis of an example base. These methods can be divided into two main groups: those that work on individual characteristics and those that consider all characteristics at the same time. As for the first groups of methods, many of them are based on classic metrics such as chi-square statistics or entropy gain. Other methods such as [1] suggest analyzing the relationship between the variations of a characteristic value and the associated label. For the second group of methods, a classic strategy is to evaluate the predictive model built from the example base (often by cross-validation [2]). Other methods imply calculating the degree of redundancy between characteristics [3]. Most of these methods seek to estimate the value of subsets of characteristics in order to be able to remove useless characteristics and thus facilitate learning. In this paper, we propose a method that focuses on consistency in order to add new characteristics."}, {"heading": "A. Selection of the pertinent features", "text": "To achieve this goal, we propose, as a first step, to remove irrelevant characteristics that only bring noise into the learning process. In fact, some characteristics may be completely independent of the concept we are trying to learn. For example, color information is useless for learning the concept of the square object. In the literature, many supervised filtering algorithms have been proposed (see [4]). These methods allow to select a subset of relevant characteristics from an example base, most of which are based on the measures outlined in Section II.B. Applying such algorithms on the example base makes it possible to obtain a new set of characteristics consisting of characteristics relevant to the concept we are trying to learn. Figure 2 provides an example of the filtering of characteristics."}, {"heading": "B. Discretisation of the selected features", "text": "In a second step, we propose the discretization of the numerical characteristics. Similar to the problem of the filtering of characteristics, numerous papers deal with the problem of the supervised discretization of characteristics (e.g. [5] or [6]). These algorithms propose, on the basis of example bases, to move from continuous characteristics to nominal ones, which are composed of groups of disjunction intervals. The aim is to reduce the size of the set of characteristics and to make the number of possible example descriptions finite. Indeed, some characteristics may allow slight deviations of their values that do not justify a different treatment of the examples. Figure 3 gives an example of the discretization of characteristics."}, {"heading": "C. Computation of the inconsistency from the resulting", "text": "An inconsistent sample base is a base in which examples with the same attribute values have different labels. An example base that is severely inconsistent means that additional features are required to characterize the examples. Let SB be the set of different attribute descriptions (corresponding to the attribute values) contained in examples Base B. Thus, the inconsistency rate of an example Base B contains a unique pattern in terms of attribute values, from each example that is contained in B. We define the function nb _ examplesB (s, l), which returns the number of examples in sample Base B that have s for attribute description and l for labeling. The inconsistency rate of an example Base B, for which the set of possible labels is L, is calculated by the following formulas: []), (_ (max 1)."}, {"heading": "A.
