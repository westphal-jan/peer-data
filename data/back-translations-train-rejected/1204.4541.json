However, for many processes, which require the appraisal of an expert or much computational time, only a small part of these objects can be taken into account. In this context, robust sampling methods become necessary. In this paper, we propose a sampling method based on clustering techniques. Our method consists in dividing the objects in clusters, then in selecting in each cluster, the most representative objects. A case-study in the context of a process dedicated to knowledge revision for geographic data generalisation is presented. This case-study shows that our method allows to select relevant samples of objects.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Apr 2012 06:35:41 GMT  (153kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4541v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["patrick taillandier", "julien gaffuri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.4541"}, "pdf": {"name": "1204.4541.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Automatic Sampling of Geographic objects", "authors": ["Patrick Taillandier", "Julien Gaffuri"], "emails": ["patrick.taillandier@gmail.com", "julien.gaffuri@ign.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Automatic sampling of geographical objects Patrick Taillandier 1, 2, Julien Gaffuri 31IRD, UMI UMMISCO 209,32 avenue Henri Varagnat, 93143 Bondy, FranceEmail: patrick.taillandier @ gmail.com2IFI, MSI, UMI 209, ngo 42 Ta Quang Buu, Ha Noi, Viet Nam3 IGN - COGIT laboratory - Paris-Est University73 avenue de Paris, 94165 Saint-Mand\u00e9 cedex, FranceEmail: julien.gaffuri @ ign.fr"}, {"heading": "1.

However, some processes only allow the consideration of a limited number of objects. This limitation may be due to the implication of an expert in the process (e.g. Musti\u00e8re, 2005) or to the computational complexity of the process (e.g. Taillandier et al., 2008). In this context, it becomes important to be able to select a relevant selection of geographical objects from among the available ones. In fact, extracting information from an unrepresentative object sample can lead to false or incomplete information."}, {"heading": "2.2 Classic sampling methods", "text": "The simplest scanning method is to randomly select the required object number. However, this approach, which is highly stochastical, can lead to unsatisfactory results. In fact, this approach can result in only \"similar\" objects being selected and certain important objects being overlooked. Another classic scanning method is to let a domain expert select a sample of representative objects. This method has two main disadvantages: first, it requires an expert's assessment; second, it can distort the expert's perception. In fact, it is difficult for an expert to have a global view of all objects when thousands of objects can be selected."}, {"heading": "3 Proposed method", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Description", "text": "The sampling method consists of three steps, which are then detailed: the values of the specified measurements. Figure 1 gives an example of such a set of objects of the class \"assembly.\" Step 2: Clustering of objects This step divides the object set into groups of similar objects. Defining such groups ensures that all types of objects in the object collection are represented. The object set is divided into groups thanks to cluster techniques used on the characterized object collection. Most cluster algorithms allow determining the probability that each object belongs to each group. This probability is used in the last step. Step 3: Object selection This last step consists of selecting an object sample in each group. The selected objects are the most representative of their group, i.e. those that have the highest probability of belonging to their group. The number of objects selected in a group i depends on the expected size of the sample and the relative size of the group as a whole."}, {"heading": "4 Sampling method evaluation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 General evaluation context", "text": "To evaluate the method, we propose an experiment in the context of the automatic revision of procedural knowledge for a cartographic generalization process. The generalization system we used for the experiment is based on the AGENT model (Barrault et al., 2001). It generalizes geographical objects using a local, step-by-step, knowledge-based method. Each object is evaluated by a satisfaction function whose values lie within [1, 10] (10: perfect generalization). Defining the relevant procedural knowledge for this system is a complex task. Therefore, we proposed an approach to its revision in (Taillandier et al., 2008). This approach is based on the analysis of past experiences. It requires an object sample that is used to build experiences."}, {"heading": "4.2 Case study: knowledge revision for building group generalisation", "text": "The case study we propose focuses on the generalization of assemblies. The initial data comes from BD TOPO \u00ae, a database with a resolution of 1 million. The target scale is 1: 50 000. The initial knowledge base reviews all possible measures for each state, thus ensuring that the best possible state is found for each sample, taking into account the limitations and available measures. However, it requires the exploration of many states by generalization and is therefore not efficient enough. Our sampling method requires the definition of various parameters. In terms of the measures defined, we define 11 measures to characterize assemblies (shown in Figure 1). For cluster techniques, we used the well-established EM algorithm (Dempster, 1977).Learning and testing areas used by the revision process were selected from a learning area consisting of 280 assemblies. Considering that we have chosen a sample of 50 assemblies for the revision process, the number of possible samples is the same."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "An initial experiment conducted as part of the process knowledge revision for a generalization process shows that our method is capable of selecting a relevant object sample. Applying the method of sampling is a necessity for many processes. As our method is a general method, an interesting perspective could be to test it for other application areas. Some processes require a strong use of expertise. In this context, the intervention of experts can become very important in selecting a selection of objects. Therefore, it might be interesting to adapt our approach to better take into account expert knowledge."}], "references": [{"title": "Integrating multi-agent, objectoriented, and algorithmic techniques for improved automated map generalization", "author": ["M Barrault", "N Regnauld", "C Duch\u00eane", "K Haire", "C Baeijs", "Y Demazeau", "P Hardy", "W Mackaness", "A Ruas", "R Weibel"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Barrault et al\\.,? \\Q2001\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Barrault et al\\.", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the em algorithm (with discussion)", "author": ["AP Dempster", "NM Laird", "DB Rubin"], "venue": "Journal of the Royal Statistical Society", "citeRegEx": "Dempster et al\\.,? \\Q1977\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dempster et al\\.", "year": 1977}, {"title": "Unsupervised Feature Selection Using Feature Similarity", "author": ["P Mitra", "C Murthy", "S Pal"], "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "citeRegEx": "Mitra et al\\.,? \\Q2002\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Mitra et al\\.", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Cartographic generalization of roads in a local and adaptative approach: a knowledge acquisition", "author": ["S Musti\u00e8re"], "venue": "problem.
