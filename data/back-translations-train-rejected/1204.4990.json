INTRODUCTIONArtificial systems are more effective than humans in solving many problems. One of the reasons is their computing capacity, which allows them to test many possibilities in a short period of time. However, in order to achieve good results, an artificial system needs to know what it is looking for, i.e., what kind of solutions are expected."}, {"heading": "II. CONTEXT", "text": "A. Optimization Problems and Objective FunctionsMany real-world problems can be expressed as optimization problems, and the solution to such a problem is to find the one that maximizes an objective function among all possible solutions, and its definition is a key point in solving optimization problems. [19] In fact, the goal of solving an optimization problem is to find the solution that maximizes (or minimizes) that function. Thus, if the objective function is not consistent with the real quality of a solution, the solutions that are found will never be good. Much work has been done to define such a function for specific problems. [14] But few proposed general approaches to supporting an optimization system to define them."}, {"heading": "III. PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "IV. APPLICATION TO CARTOGRAPHIC GENERALISATION", "text": "Generalization is the process that aims to simplify geographical data in order to meet the scale and purpose of a map. The aim of this process is to ensure the readability of the map while maintaining the essential information of the source data. Figure 5 provides an example of cartographic generalization. Automation of the generalization process is an interesting industrial context that is far from being solved. Furthermore, it interests cartographic agencies that want to improve their production lines. Multiplication of websites that allow the creation of their own map increases the need for reliable and effective generalization."}, {"heading": "C.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we presented an approach dedicated to defining user needs. Therefore, we proposed an approach based on a human-machine dialogue aimed at defining an objective function that represents users \"expectations of an optimization system.An experiment conducted in the field of cartographic generalization showed that our approach can help users formalize their needs, and can allow a lack of relevant metrics to be identified. Our approach is based on the application of comparison strategies. In this paper, we defined four different strategies. Other, more complex strategies could be proposed, such as strategies that take more account of the preferences originally formalized by the user. In terms of the exploration part as well as the partition part, we merely tested a search algorithm and a supervised learning algorithm. An interesting study could be to test other algorithms and compare the results obtained with the final perspective of an acquisition."}], "references": [{"title": "OXYGENE: An open framework for the deployment of geographic web services", "author": ["T.
