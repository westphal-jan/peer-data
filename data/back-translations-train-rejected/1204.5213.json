Coalitions can be with their characteristic vector.Definition 12. Let us be N = {1,., n} a series of n players. The characteristic vector ~ (S) of a coalition S N is the vector (1, S), the vector (vector) is the vector (vector), the vector (vector) is the language."}, {"heading": "2.2 Power indices", "text": "Power indices are used to measure the amount of influence a player has in a monotonous simple game. Power indices were originally introduced because it was observed that in weighted voting games the weight of a player is not directly proportional to the influence he has in the game. This is easily seen by the following trivial example of weighted voting games: [1000; 997, 1, 1, 1]. Here, each player is weighted in only one index: the grand coalition. All players must be present in that coalition to win, and can therefore be said to have the same influence, despite the fact that there is a huge difference between the weights of the first and the other three players. Many suggestions have been made to answer the question of what constitutes a good definition of power in a voting game. These answers are in the form of power indices, which are mathematical formulations for values that attempt to describe a player's \"true\" influence in a weighted voting game."}, {"heading": "3 The problem statement", "text": "In this section, we will introduce what we call the elective game design problem: the problem of finding a simple game that fulfills a certain requirement (or set of requirements) as well as possible. We will focus on the problem of finding games in which the power index of the game is as close as possible to a given target game index. (We define an elective game design problem as an optimization problem in which we are given three parameters.

In this section, we will give an overview of the conversion of representations of simple games into each other.

It is interesting to know which fraction of a class of games can be synthesized in which language, i.e., we are interested in the cardinalities of all these classes of simple games. This in itself is an interesting question, but we also need it to analyze the algorithms for the design problems of election games that we will present in the next paragraphs.

Therefore, we see that the number of monotonous simple games on n players is equal to the number of families of MWCs on n players. In a family of MWCs there are no two coalitions S and S such that S is a superset of S. In other words: all elements in a family of MWCs are pairs incomparable to the number of MWCs, or: A family of MWCs onthe group of players N = {1, n} is an antique in the poset (2N,)."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 The number of weighted voting games", "text": "To our knowledge, existing game theory is similar to weighted games, except that we are talking about a difference between the different functions. \"Fortunately, there is a closely related field of research called threshold logic (see, for example, [50]) that has some relevant results.

More importantly, weighted representation is the only representation that current election game design algorithms work with internally, and no other methods of representing a game have been considered. There is an infinite number of weighted representations for each weighted election game (resulting from Proposition 1), which makes it difficult to derive an accurate algorithm based solely on working with weighted representations, as there are no unique finite weight vectors that an algorithm can search through. 5Nevertheless, it turns out that fortunately we can answer this question positively: Exact algorithms for election game design problems exist. What follows in this section is a study of exact algorithms for some power index election game design problems."}, {"heading": "5.1 Monotonic simple game design", "text": "In this section we look at the power index matching problem for the class of monotonous simple games Gmon, max.) There are four representation languages that can be used for monotonous simple games: \u2022 LW, the winning coalition listed; \u2022 LL, the losing coalition listed; 5However, the literature gives us limits on the maximum weight needed in a holistic representation of a weighted matching game, and we could use this to create a list of algorithms based on the generation of a finite series of integer weighted representations. We are working on this in 5.2. \u2022 LW, min, the minimum winning coalition listing; \u2022 LL, max, the maximum losing coalition listing. From these languages we get the following four different power index matching problems: (g, Gmon, LW) -PVGD, (g, LL) -PVGD, which are practical situations."}, {"heading": "5.2 Weighted voting game design", "text": "After giving a simple but very slow algorithm for the PVGD problem for the very general class of monotonous simple games, we will now see that we can do much better if we limit the problem to smaller classes of simple games. Specifically, we will limit ourselves to the class of weighted voting games: Gwvg. This class is included in the class of linear games Glin and therefore also included in the class of monotonous simple games Gmon. Therefore, we can present a game in Gwvg, where f is either the Banzhaf index or the Shapley Shubik index that we introduced. As stated in Section 1.2, the well-known literature on voting problems in game design focuses on this particular variant (g, Gvwg, Lweights) PVGD, where f is either the Banzhaf index or the Shapley Shubik index. Here we will give an exact algorithm for this problem that is running exponentially."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Preliminary considerations", "text": "Before formally determining the algorithm, let us first address the question of what approach we need to take to design weighted election games.

We will focus only on the class of weighted voting games, since for each non-weighted voting game there is a canonical voting game that can be achieved by mere permutation of the players.

The way this algorithm works is very simple: just like in Algorithm 2, we have listed the complete class of games (weighted voting games in this case), and we calculate for each game (this is the output by the enumeration algorithm) the distance from the target power index.Recall the problem with Algorithm 2 was that the enumeration procedure is not efficient. By restricting it to weighted voting games, we are able to make the enumeration procedure more efficient. We will use Theorem 6 for this: The key is that it is possible to generate the minimum winning coalition."}, {"heading": "5.3 Improvements and optimizations", "text": "Algorithm 3, in its current state, is not particularly suitable for solving the (f, Gcwvg, Lweights) -PVGD problem in practice. In this section, we will make several improvements to the algorithm, resulting in a version of the enumeration algorithm that we expect to output canonically weighted matching games at constant speed. We will see that this will give us a practically always applicable algorithm for the (\u03b2, Gcwvg, Lweights) -PVGD problem for a small number of players. Section 5.3.1 shows how we can reduce the system of linear inequalities (4). In Section 5.3.2, we will improve Theorem 7 to find new potential minimum winning coalitions more quickly in order to expand our weighted matching games. Finally, in Section 5.3.3, we will give an output polynomial time algorithm to enumerate all ceiling coalitions in order to achieve a series of these roof coalitions.It is important that we combine three."}, {"heading": "5.3.1 An improved linear program for finding the weight vector of a weighted voting game", "text": "In the search for a weight vector for a weighted voting game in which we obtained the minimum winning coalitions and the maximum losing coalitions, we proposed in the previous section to do so by solving the system of inequalities (4). [56] points out that we can make this system much more compact, as follows. First, we can reduce the number of inequalities in our system by observing that a minimum winning coalition C, which is not a roof, always has a higher overall weight than at least one roof, in a canonically weighted voting game. This is because C is an excess of a leftward shift of any roof. Likewise, a maximum losing coalition, which is not a ceiling, can always have a lower overall weight than at least one ceiling. Therefore, the addition of inequalities w1 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 of our system of inequalities (4) allows us to remove a lot of other inequalities from (4), because they now consist of minimum winning coalitions only to ensure that all are equal."}, {"heading": "5.3.2 A better way of finding new minimal winning coalitions", "text": "Theorem 7 allows us to find potential minimum winning coalitions with which we can expand our weighted voting games.

Furthermore, as demonstrated by Polyme and Riquelme, a well-known problem needs to be solved, which can be solved in sub-exponential time, and it is not known whether it allows polynomial time algorithms. Finding an output polynomial algorithm for (Lroof, Lceil) -VGS is therefore a very interesting open problem, but due to its supposed difficulty we will instead investigate the (LW, min, Lceil) -VGS problem."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "Before we turn to the results of some relatively large experiments, let us visualize the results for only n = 3 players, since we can represent them in two dimensions.

As mentioned in the introduction to this section, our implementation solves the (\u03b2, Gwvg, Lweights) PVGD problem, where \u03b2 is the standardized Banzhaf index. This means that for each weighted election game issued by our enumeration algorithm, we must use a method to calculate the standardized Banzhaf index.

which the power of the players is as close as possible to a certain target distribution. Our goal is to find algorithms that solve this problem exactly. Thereto, we consider various subclasses of simple games, and their associated representation methods. We survey algorithms and impossibility results for the synthesis problem, i.e., converting a representation of a simple game into another representation. We contribute to the synthesis problem by showing that it is impossible to compute in polynomial time the list of ceiling coalitions (also known as shift-maximal losing coalitions) of a game from its list of roof coalitions (also known as shift-minimal winning coalitions), and vice versa. Then, we proceed by studying the problem of enumerating the set of weighted voting games. We present first a naive algorithm for this, running in doubly exponential time. Using our knowledge of the synthesis problem, we then improve on this naive algorithm, and we obtain an enumeration algorithm that runs in quadratic exponential time (that is, O(2 2 \u00b7 p(n)) for a polynomial p). Moreover, we show that this algorithm runs in output-polynomial time, making it the best possible enumeration algorithm up to a polynomial factor. Finally, we propose an exact anytime algorithm for the power index voting game design problem that runs in exponential time. This algorithm is straightforward and general: it computes the error for each game enumerated, and outputs the game that minimizes this error. By the genericity of our approach, our algorithm can be used to find a weighted voting game that optimizes any exponential time computable function.
