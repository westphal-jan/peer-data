What we are striving for in the ULiS project is a universal linguistic system (ULiS) through which multiple actors with interlingual knowledge bases can interact in multiple controlled (i.e. limited and formal) natural languages. Any controlled natural language (dictionary, grammar rules) would be described in a part of a universal linguistic knowledge base (ULK).

In the MTT, two kinds of lexicographic definitions of an LU are thought of: i) in a natural language (i.e., in the phonological level of representation) or ii) using a semantic representation format (i.e., in the semantic level of representation). We maintain that both approaches consist in the generative instantiation (or construction) of a semantic decomposition of the ILUc (i.e., in the semantic level of representation). In our approach, we clearly want to separate the ILexikon layer from the ISem layer. We therefore propose ways to represent (or construct) the lexicographic definition of an ILUc without ILUi a semantic decomposition of the ILU."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Interlingual lexical units (classes and instances) and interlingual semantic relations", "text": "They are instances of the ILexicalUnit meta class from the ILexiMOn (c.f., Figure 1).

In our notation, the symbol < the ILUc person is a subclass of the ILUc class Entity, and the ILUc entity is the parentage of the ILUc person < Entity, Alive < State, Cause < Event). The ILUc person is a subclass of the ILUc class Entity, and the ILUc entity is the parentage of the ILUc person < Complex ILUcs can be constructed by owl: intersectionOf and owl: unionOf."}, {"heading": "4.2.3 From interlingual lexical primitives to projected minimal semantic decomposition.", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and discussions", "text": "We introduced and illustrated a three-layered architecture that describes ECD-compliant interlingual lexical ontologies using semantic web formalisms; we introduced the core of an interlingual lexical meta-ontology (ILexiMOn) that constitutes the top level of architecture; this ILexiMOn describes the interlingual lexical ontology called ILexicOn, which describes classes of interlingual lexical units (ILUcs); and finally, interlingual semantic representations are part of the third layer. We introduced a novel approach to the formal definition of ILUcs: we let ILUcs support a projection of their semantic decomposition, keeping their definition in the same conceptual layer of representation; we introduced a humanly readable notation to represent ILexicOn, and we used this notation to illustrate our approach with a simple lexical model."}], "references": [{"title": "The berkeley framenet project", "author": ["C.F.
