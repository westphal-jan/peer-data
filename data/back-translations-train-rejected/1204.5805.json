Clients are diagnosed with the aid of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packet traces, by (i) observation of anomalous artifacts occurring as a result of each fault and (ii) subsequent use of the inference capabilities of soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The IACD system features a modular design and is extendible to new faults, with detection capability unaffected by the TCP variant used at the client. Experimental evaluation of the IACD system in a controlled environment demonstrated an overall diagnostic accuracy of 98%.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Apr 2012 01:49:57 GMT  (1188kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5805v1", "2011 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC)"]], "COMMENTS": "2011 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.AI", "authors": ["c widanapathirana", "j li", "y a sekercioglu", "m ivanovich", "p fitzpatrick"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.5805"}, "pdf": {"name": "1204.5805.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Intelligent Automated Diagnosis of Client Device Bottlenecks in Private Clouds", "authors": ["Chathuranga Widanapathirana", "Jonathan Li", "Y.

CLASSIFIER TRAINING", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Data Collection", "text": "The diagnostic accuracy of the classifier depends to a large extent on the effectiveness of correctly replicating the error and the consistency of the artifacts collected. Using standard packet capture libraries, we collect two tracks, one on the client and one on the server. Both tracks are captured using 100MB bidirectional packet flows to ensure that most connection details are intercepted."}, {"heading": "B. Trace Signature Creation", "text": "The two collected packet traces are analyzed separately, and their extracted features are combined to form a m-dimensional feature vector x (in Equation (1). We have developed a technique for extracting signatures based on an open source trace analysis tool \"tcptrace\" [20], which extracts 140 different statistical parameters for each trace, forming a total of 280 parameters for each signature. For example, a raw feature vector xi from a faulty link prior to data preprocessing may look similar to {249256, 295, 0, 32, 39, 1, 1,...}, (3), where each numerical value represents an aggregated statistic from the trace, such as total pct, packet, reset, Rexmt data pct, zero-window probe-pkts-pkts. This statistical trace characterization technique forms a packet stream into a number of numerical values containing the sample, the connecting characteristics, the Rexkt, and the comprise the composite pects."}, {"heading": "C. Data Pre-Processing", "text": "This step improves overall classification accuracy by increasing data coherence and consistency within classes. First, categorical attributes such as the cf0 and cfj class names are converted into numerical data as inyi \u2261 cf0 \u2261 \u2212 1, (4a) yi \u2261 cfj \u2261 + 1 for j = 1,..., p. (4b). Subsequently, the data is shifted along each attribute and linearly re-scaled to the 0-1 range. Re-scaling of the data avoids numerical difficulties and avoids features with a larger numerical range dominating the smaller one."}, {"heading": "D. Feature Selection", "text": "Although the signature format is identical in each sample, only a certain subset of features contributes to the artifact. We use a simple automated method for selecting the most suitable features for a particular classifier. Our proposed feature selection method is shown in Figure 3. This algorithm follows a hybrid approach (between filter and wrapper) to automatically isolate the best feature subgroups, similar to that discussed by Xing et al. [21] and Das et al. [22]. We first use a filter, Studential t-Test (two samples t-Test) (implemented similarly [23]), to assess the significance of each feature for separating the two classes. Next, the features sorted in order of their significance are cross-validated, by incrementing the number of features selected for each class (wrapper technique) with the test samples to determine the best number of features required for each classifier, reducing the selection process to the characteristic-q (the diameter 1)."}, {"heading": "IV. FAULT DIAGNOSIS", "text": "Once the training phase is complete, each classification module contains (i) filter parameters (scale factors) determined during pre-processing, (ii) a feature list selected during feature selection, and (iii) a classifier created using SVMs. During the diagnostic phase, the packet tracks are recorded on the undiagnosed client using the trace collection program, and the tracks are then sent through the IACD system, which feeds the tracks into the CFclassifier network. Each CF classifier then identifies if the respective error is present in the track. Collective output of n CF classifier determines the errors that exist in the client, but at this stage the system is unable to diagnose unknown errors in a track."}, {"heading": "V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Network Emulation and Experiment Criteria", "text": "As proof of the concept, the data was collected in a network test bed that enabled an access connection, a client computer and the access server, as shown in Figure 4. The client and server used Linux 2.6.32 systems (with Ubuntu distribution) running multiple TCP variants, and the access link was emulated with 80Mb / s bandwidth, without packet losses and without packet reordering."}, {"heading": "B. Diagnostic Performance", "text": "Figure 5 shows the diagnostic accuracy of the CFD classifier, which takes into account the collective decision made using the output of the CF classification network. Tested with the CUBIC training and test data sets, the system was able to read the customer's disabled SACK option, the disabled D-SACK option, the buffer limit and write buffer limits with high accuracy. Similarly, in tests with TCP-BIC and TCPNewReno, variants not used during the training phase, the four client errors were diagnosed with 100% accuracy. These results suggest that the proposed CFD classification design could be independent of the TCP variant. The healthy clients were identified during the first two tests of TCP-CUBIC tensile and test data sets with 94.81% and 93.5% accuracy, respectively. If samples of healthy clients with CTBIC-9TIC-9TIC and NewTIC-9TIC-9TIC-9TIC cases were detectable with 1.10% accuracy and 1.71% accuracy."}, {"heading": "VI. SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS AND COMPARISON WITH THE SIMILAR WORK", "text": "For the root cause diagnosis of client performance problems, the proposed IACD system offers many advantages over the other available trace inference methods. \u2022 The system provides a fully automated, comprehensive framework that is extendable to diagnose a variety of errors, as opposed to the limited capabilities of tools that use TCP traces to capture and measure information [9], [11], [33]. \u2022 The system's diagnostic capability evolves with the variety of error signatures databases, the instability of the inference algorithm. Users can collaborate to create common signature repositories covering a wide range of errors, networks and client platforms. \u2022 Most rule-based systems are limited to a specific set of errors and lack generality to work effectively in a dynamic environment [7], [10], [34] the system relies exclusively on package-based systems that can be collected and implemented as endpoints."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "text": "We have proposed and evaluated the IACD system, an automated client diagnostic system for private cloud environments. The IACD system uses an intelligent inference-based approach to TCP packet tracking systems to identify artifacts generated by client errors. The CFD classifier performs a complex multi-level classification of client errors, using a parallel network of SVM-based CF classifiers. The modular design of the CFD classifier provides expandability to diagnose new errors by training CF classifier modules independently. Our results show that with a small number of training samples, CF classifier modules collectively generate a high level of diagnostic accuracy in all tested scenarios, including clients with different errors, TCP variants, the extremely complex system for researching multiple client types of I- and D- classified traffic."}], "references": [{"title": "A view of cloud computing", "author": ["M.

environments: the Intelligent Automated Client Diagnostic (IACD) system. Clients are diagnosed with the aid of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packet traces, by (i) observation of anomalous artifacts occurring as a result of each fault and (ii) subsequent use of the inference capabilities of soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The IACD system features a modular design and is extendible to new faults, with detection capability unaffected by the TCP variant used at the client. Experimental evaluation of the IACD system in a controlled environment demonstrated an overall diagnostic accuracy of 98%.", "creator": "Adobe Acrobat 9.5.1"}}}
