INTRODUCTION", "text": "In this research program, we aim to contribute to understanding the long-term impact of location-based media (e.g. public shared displays and mobile personal terminals) on the random social aspects of remote collaboration (e.g. the current status of the work of remote partners in a joint project and the highlighting of hot topics) by applying a longitudinal assessment of the ICT used. In terms of measurement, we construct whether \"social presence\" is improved by the use of local media. Communication media differ in their degree of \"social presence\" and this is one factor shaping the interaction. In short (1976), social presence defined as the feeling of the presence of an interaction partner in a mediated environment. It is noteworthy that social presence has been associated with improved social interaction (Tu and McIsaac 2002). It is expected that the proposed system could have a positive impact on the core activities of cooperation."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Among the broad lines of research in this interdisciplinary field, there are some interesting results that frame the motivations of the current research program in 2001. Adams (1992) examined the phenomenon of television being described by people and considered by media researchers as a physical place. Wildman (2001) indeed traces the historical impact of communication technologies (radio, TV, telephone) on the design of houses and reports that each of these technologies is slowly but boldly transforming the design of the home space. Furthermore, media researchers found that the design of the home space has an impact on the way people watch television (Pardun and Krugman 1994). Although television is implicitly accepted as a domestic technology, there are also several uses of television in the public space (McCarthy 2001). Ambient ITV is defined as a rich audiovisual user experience that encompasses physical places (private, public) and devices (TV, mobile, public display)."}, {"heading": "3. DESIGN", "text": "The main element of the connection is a hemispherical television coupled with a hemispherical satellite camera. A major requirement in our design was to move away from the traditional \"boxy\" form of televisions. The spherical television is metaphorically adapted to the shape of the earth and provides a suitable \"placeholder\" for the remote location that is displayed on the screen. In addition, next to the TV there is a small sphere that looks like a satellite planet and houses a mobile camera that can be moved around. From the participant's point of view, the television screen is always on the display of content, while the back of the hemispherical and semi-transparent structure is illuminated from the inside, creating a bluish effect in dark environments reminiscent of the planet Earth floating in space. Finally, there is a permanently installed landscape camera at each end of the connection."}, {"heading": "3.1 Three types of content: Live, fresh and canned bits", "text": "The telecommunications link has three types of bits: live bits streamed by a fixed or mobile camera; the fixed camera provides a constant awareness of the landscape and weather conditions (weather is always a great icebreaker and conversation starter!) surrounding the remote node; the mobile camera delivers a reporter-style video that is useful for real-time collaboration; so participants could use the mobile camera to work together on a common task, such as a performance or a recording device; participants collect media from any recording device and upload it to their mobile phones or computers; once uploaded, fresh bits (videos, photos, text) take precedence in the carousel; and the TV screens switch from the camera to the carousel; between two remote schools, canned bits consisting of edited versions of fresh and live bits, after being stored for a few minutes, the most important information may be transferred sufficiently quickly into the landscape over the weekend."}, {"heading": "3.2 Scenario of use", "text": "Two secondary schools in Linz and Corfu are participating in a cultural exchange program run by the European Commission (e.g. eTwinning1). Educators have chosen the topic of castles: A Linz student sends a mobile text message via a castle that appears on the television screen (Action), which may have been uploaded by an educator or another pupil. When the same content reappears on the screen, it is accompanied by this text message (Representation) that appears on the synchronized TV screen and immediately attracts the attention of the students in Corfu. The latter responds by sending back a text or even a multimedia message (Reaction). The next time the respective content appears on the screens, it is accompanied by these representations of joint actions, thereby promoting mutual understanding (about culture, history or other topics) between distant groups.1 The etwinning web portal offers a wide range of topics. http: / / www.etwinning.net (b), remote students respond to the message and both messages accompany the respective contents.1"}, {"heading": "3.3 Conceptual model", "text": "The conceptual model of the system is built on the familiarity and ease of use of television. Just like the traditional television program, the system's screens always stay on, broadcasting the same audiovisual content through interconnected schools, creating a shared experience. There are only two television channels: 1) Live and 2) Shared Carussel. The live channel delivers a real-time feed from a remote location, and it is (metaphorically speaking) like opening a window to a remote location. The default feed comes from the fixed outdoor camera (which overlooks a wide landscape) until the mobile camera is turned on. Then, the mobile camera can be used as a portable teleconferencing terminal to set up the rules of cooperative activity and, most importantly, as a remote control of a shared task. Most noteworthy is that the shared carousel provides a broadcast-style channel that is synchronized across all participating TVs. The carousel consists of fresh and online video scanning, and it is worked around a simple web album-style, or a surface."}, {"heading": "3.4 Ongoing work", "text": "We are developing a detailed system design and implementation, led by an empirical study of remote schools. We have collected an extensive dataset by using the methodology of culture probes in a dozen secondary schools on remote Greek islands."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSION", "text": "The ultimate research question behind this research program concerns cultural aspects of the viability of remote communities and whether technological support could make remote everyday life as inclusive as life in urban or centralized areas. For example, in Greece, the main motivation for supporting small and understaffed educational institutions in remote areas and islands was to support local development and prevent population loss (Oswalt and Rieniets 2006) on the islands. The latter is a very worthwhile goal in Greece, where half of the population lives in Greater Athens (capital). Could communication technologies guided by a user-centered interaction design approach (McCollough 2004) overcome the distance barrier between distant partnerships. Several teleconferencing systems have been developed by scientists and various telecommunications arrangements, but we find that most of this work either affects the privacy of users (e.g. cameras that overlook the public space) or is very difficult to use (e.g. video telephony)."}, {"heading": "5.
