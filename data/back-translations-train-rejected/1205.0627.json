Introduction", "text": "Random generation of combinatorial objects is one of the natural applications of enumerative combinatorics. Following general principles outlined by Wilf, Flajolet et et al. [8] was proposed as a fully automatic algebraic approach to the comprehensive class of decomposable combinatorial objects. This groundbreaking work was later completed by the introduction of Boltzmann samplers, an alternative family of random generation algorithms based on the underlying generational functions [7]. However, this work dealt only with the uniform distribution of random generations (e.g. in bioinformatics) requiring non-uniform distributions that can be modelled. Denise et al. [4] -weighted the non-uniform grammar, but a non-uniform form of random generations."}, {"heading": "2. Definitions", "text": "A context-free grammar is a 4-level G = (\u03a3, P, S) in which the alphabet, i.e. a finite series of terminal symbols, is also referred to as letters. \u2022 N is a finite series of non-terminal symbols. \u2022 P is the finite series of production rules of formN \u2192 X, whereas N is a finite series of non-terminal symbols. \u2022 N is the finite series of production rules of formN \u2192 X, where N is a finite series of non-terminal rules of formN (G) n the set of all words of length n generated by G. This set is generated by iteratively applied production rules on non-terminals until a word in the non-terminal form obtained.Note that the non-terminals are assumed on the right side of a production rule that can be independently derived."}, {"heading": "3. Any terminal-weighted distribution can be obtained using a rule-weighted grammar", "text": "Theorem 3.1. For each final weighted grammar G\u03bb, L, P, S there is a constructive proof for this theorem. Consider for each grammar the rule weighted grammar defined by G\u03bb: = (\u03bb, \u03a3, P, S), so that \u03bb (N, t) = final weighted and \u03bb (\u00b7) = 1 otherwise. The rules of production and axioms of G and G are clearly identical, hence one has L (G) = L (G, P, S) and in particular L (G) n = L (G) n, n (G) n, n (G) n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, w, n, n, w, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, w, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n,"}, {"heading": "4. Any rule-weighted distribution can be obtained using a terminal-weighted grammar", "text": "Theorem 4.1. For each rule-weighted grammar G\u03bb there is an end-weighted grammar G\u03c0 = \u2192 end-weighted grammar G\u03c0 = \u2192 end-weighted grammar G\u03c0 = \u2192 end-weighted grammar G\u03c0 = \u2192 end-weighted grammar G\u03c0 = = end-weighted grammar. This leads to an identical probability distribution. Proof. Let us first remember the definition of the Greibach Normal Form (GNF), which can convert any rule-weighted grammar in the Chomsky-Normal form into a GNF grammar that generates the same language and induces the same distribution. Let us then assume, without loss of generality, that the grammar used G\u03bb = (in practice, N, P, S) is identical."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "Using a trivial modification of the Flower and Koch algorithms [1], we showed that weighting rules in the terminal or in weighting have the same significance, i.e. that any distribution captured by the earlier formalism is also captured by the other and vice versa. Although both proofs are relatively trivial, the transition from rule-weighted grammars to final-weighted grammars proved more complicated than the alternative, which could lead to an increase in the number of rules. However, this observation could be deceptive, since the choice of the Greibach normal form as intermediate form is only one of many alternatives, and more efficient grammar transformations that capture the same distributions could be conceived. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that even if one chooses to use GNF grammars, there is still a gap between the size of the O (| P | 4) of the grammar supplied by the Flower and Koch algorithms and the minimal search for a better GO (P) for the grammar."}], "references": [{"title": "Greibach normal form transformation revisited", "author": ["Norbert Blum", "Robert Koch"], "venue": "Information and Computation", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1999}, {"title": "Multi-dimensional Boltzmann sampling of languages, Proceedings of AOFA\u201910 (Vienna)", "author": ["O.
