INTRODUCTION", "text": "We have taken Myanmar language for information processing. Myanmar is an agglutinative language with a very productive flexible system. This means that for any NLP application in Myanmar to be successful, some level of functional analysis is required. Without it, the development of grammatical relationships would not be feasible due to the sparse data problem that will inevitably exist in the training data. Our approach is part of the Myanmar to English machine translation project. If a high quality translation is to be achieved, language understanding is a necessity. One problem in Myanmar language processing is the lack of grammatical regularity in the language. This leads to very complex Myanmar grammar, in order to achieve satisfactory results, which in terms increases the complexity in the parsing process, it is desirable that simple grammar be used. Our proposed method uses two components. They are function tagging and parsing."}, {"heading": "2.

MYANMAR LANGUAGE", "text": "Myanmar (formerly Burma) is one of the Southeast Asian countries. Myanmar is home to 135 ethnic groups that speak more than one language and use different scripts to represent their respective languages. In total, the people of Myanmar speak 109 languages [11]. Myanmar's language is the official language and is more than a thousand years old."}, {"heading": "3.1. Features of Myanmar Language", "text": "In general, the sentence in Myanmar follows the subject, object and verb pattern. However, the exchange of subject and object is acceptable. In contrast to the English language, Myanmar is a syntax of a relatively free phrase order language. Myanmar phrases can be written in any order as long as the verb phrase is at the end of the sentence. This can easily be illustrated by the example of \"The verb lays the book on the table,\" as in Table 1. All are valid sentences [12]. In all cases, the subject is one (He), the object one (the book), the place one (on the table) and the verb one (the places). It is clear from the above example that the phrase sequence does not determine the functional structure in Myanmar and allows for tingling."}, {"heading": "3.2. Issues of Myanmar Language", "text": "The highly agglutinative language such as Myanmar - nouns and verbs are flexed. - In many cases, we have to rely on syntactical function or context to decide whether the word in question is a noun or adjective or an adjective position. - This leads to the complexity of grammatical relations in Myanmar. - A noun can be classified as general, correct or compound. - Likewise, the verb can be finite, infinite, German or contactable. - The subject or object of the sentence can be skipped, and it remains a valid sentence. Example:"}, {"heading": "3.3. Grammar of Myanmar Language", "text": "Grammar examines the rules behind languages."}, {"heading": "3.4. Syntacic Structure of Myanmar Language", "text": "It is well known that many postal positions can be used in a sentence from Myanmar. If the words in a sentence can be misplaced, the sentence can be abnormal. There are two types of sentences as a sentence construction: simple sentences (SS) and complex sentences (CS). In the simple sentence, additional sentences such as object, time and place can be added between subject and verb. In a complex sentence, there are two types of clauses called Independent clause (IC) and Dependent clause (DC). In a sentence, there must be at least one independent clause, but there may be more than one dependent clause in it. IC contains the last particle (sfp) at the end of a sentence [15]. SS = IC + sfp CS = DC... + IC + sfpIC + sfpIC + sfpIC can contain a noun phrase or a verb or a combination of both."}, {"heading": "4. CORPUS STATISTICS", "text": "Corpus is a large and structured text collection, used to perform statistical analysis, verify occurrences, or validate linguistic rules in a particular universe. It is also a fundamental foundation of much research in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The structure of the corpus will be helpful for the development of NLP tools (such as grammar rules, spell checking, etc.) However, there is very little creation and research of corpus in Myanmar that is compared to other languages such as English. We collected several types of texts from Myanmar to construct a corpus. Our corpus is to be created manually. We are expanding the corpus proposed in [3] with POS markings. The corpus and functional labels are added manually to the body marked with POS markings. The number of sentences is about 3900 sentences with an average word length of 15 and it is not a balanced corpus, the textbook layer is somewhat distorted in Myanmar."}, {"heading": "5. PROPOSED SYSTEM", "text": "The procedure of the proposed approach is shown in the following figure."}, {"heading": "6. FUNCTION TAGSET", "text": "Function tagging is a process of assigning syntactic categories such as subject, object, time and place to each word in the text document. These are conceptually responsive by encoding an event in the format \"who has what with whom, where, when,\" which provides useful semantic information about the sentences. We use the function tags proposed in [16] because they are easier to maintain and can add new language functions."}, {"heading": "7. PROPOSED GRAMMAR FOR MYANMAR SENTENCES", "text": "The grammar rule can be very long, but we have to accept it. The grammar rule we have tried to make may not work for all sentences in the Myanmar language because we have not considered all kinds of sentences. Some of the sentences are listed below that are used to make the grammar rules."}, {"heading": "8. FUNCTION TAGGING", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "8.1 Naive Bayes Classifier", "text": "Before you can build a naive Bayesian classifier, you have to collect training data, which is a series of problem cases. Each instance consists of values for each of the defined features of the underlying model and the corresponding class, i.e., in our case, function marks. Developing a naive Bayesian classifier involves learning how much to trust each function sign for the decisions it makes [17]. It is well attuned to the function marking problem. Thus, the naive Bayesian classifier is a term in Bayesian statistics that refers to a simple probability classifier based on the application of Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) assumptions of independence. It assumes independence between the input marks. Therefore, its target class can be found by selecting the vector with the highest posterior probability. The probability model for a classifier is a conditional model.P (x1, xx2,...)"}, {"heading": "8.2.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We use context-free grammar for parsing because it is easier to maintain and can add new language characteristics; the parse tree can be built by using functional characteristics; because functional characteristics are a pre-processing step for parsing, the errors that occur in abandoning the functional characteristics affect the parse tree; the corpus can be balanced because the probability of the naive Bayesian framework simply describes uncertainty; creating the corpus is time-consuming; the corpus is the resource for Myanmar's development into the English translation system; and we expect the corpus to be continuously expanded in the future because the sentence tested can be inserted into the corpus; in this work, we have looked at a limited number of sentences from Myanmar to construct the grammar rules; in future work, we need to consider as many sentences as possible, and some more tags for constructing the grammar rules because Myanmar is a language that is freely ordered by phrases."}], "references": [{"title": "Function tagging", "author": ["D Blaheta"], "venue": "Ph.D. Dissertation,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Assigning automatically Part-of-Speech tags to build tagged corpus for Myanmar language", "author": ["Phyu Hnin Myint"], "venue": "The Fifth Conference on Parallel Soft Computing,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Chunk Tagged Corpus Creation for Myanmar Language", "author": ["Phyu Hnin Myint"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the ninth International Conference on Computer Applications,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Statistical parsing with a context-free grammar and word statistics", "author": ["Eugene Charniak"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Fourteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 1997}, {"title": "Assigning function tags to parsed text", "author": ["D.
