RESULTS, DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION", "text": "We first extracted the closely matched character training sets from the full dataset and divided them into two equivalent training and test sets with an extracted N. We calculated the discrete Fourier transformation coefficients (DFT) and discarded half of the coefficient and created a feature vector for each of the closely matched character sets. We used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to develop the classification tool. SVMs use an improvement in n-dimensional plane separation achieved by traditional artificial neural networks."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "The authors thank Ms. K. G.
