Clearly the task of designing protocols for these networks is less difficult if the environment allows waiting (i.e., it provides the nodes with store-carry-forward-like mechanisms such as local buffering) than if waiting is not feasible. No quantitative corroborations of this fact exist (e.g., no answer to the question: how much easier?). In this paper, we consider these qualitative questions about dynamic networks, modeled as time-varying (or evolving) graphs, where edges exist only at some times.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 13:19:46 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1975v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.CL", "authors": ["arnaud casteigts", "paola flocchini", "emmanuel godard", "nicola santoro", "masafumi yamashita"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.1975"}, "pdf": {"name": "1205.1975.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Expressivity of Time-Varying Graphs and the Power of Waiting in Dynamic Networks", "authors": ["A.

In other words, we prove that when waiting is no longer forbidden, the power of the accepting automaton (the difficulty of the environment) to become not as powerful as a Turing machine but that of a finite state machine drastically diminishes. This (perhaps surprisingly large) gap is a measure of the computing power of waiting. We also examine the limited waiting; that is, when waiting at a node is allowed only for most d units of time. We prove the negative result that Lwait [d] = Lnowait; that is, the expressivity only diminishes when waiting is finite but unpredictable (i.e. under the control of the protocol designer and not the environment)."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "1.1 Highly Dynamic Networks", "text": "In fact, the structure of the network is relatively poorly understood.

Clearly the task of designing protocols for these networks is less difficult if the environment allows waiting (i.e., it provides the nodes with store-carry-forward-like mechanisms such as local buffering) than if waiting is not feasible. No quantitative corroborations of this fact exist (e.g., no answer to the question: how much easier?). In this paper, we consider these qualitative questions about dynamic networks, modeled as time-varying (or evolving) graphs, where edges exist only at some times. We examine the difficulty of the environment in terms of the expressivity of the corresponding time-varying graph; that is in terms of the language generated by the feasible journeys in the graph. We prove that the set of languages Lnowait when no waiting is allowed contains all computable languages. On the other end, using algebraic properties of quasi-orders, we prove that Lwait is just the family of regular languages. In other words, we prove that, when waiting is no longer forbidden, the power of the accepting automaton (difficulty of the environment) drops drastically from being as powerful as a Turing machine, to becoming that of a Finite-State machine. This (perhaps surprisingly large) gap is a measure of the computational power of waiting. We also study bounded waiting; that is when waiting is allowed at a node only for at most d time units. We prove the negative result that Lwait[d] = Lnowait; that is, the expressivity decreases only if the waiting is finite but unpredictable (i.e., under the control of the protocol designer and not of the environment).", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
