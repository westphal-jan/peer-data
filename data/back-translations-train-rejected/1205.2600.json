We also adopt two of the three axioms, consistency and scale invariance proposed in this paper. We replace the Richness paper of [Kle03] with its version for the case of the fixed number of clusters, k-Richness. Another axiomatic approach is the work of Jardine and Sibson [JS75]. They restrict their view of cluster functions and consider only hierarchical functions. They show that single linkage is the only function that satisfies a number of properties; however, this is primarily a consequence of the fact that one of their properties is an implicit optimization criterion that is optimized solely by single linkage. Our collection of properties differs drastically from [JS75] and does not restrict formalism to taking only hierarchical functions into account. Moreover, none of our properties implicitly reduces the single linkage criterion optimizing, and we do not show all of our characteristics to uniformity."}, {"heading": "Formal Preliminaries", "text": "A partitioning function acts on a set of S of n \u2265 2 points together with an integer k > 0, and pairs of distances between the points in S. The points in S are not assumed to belong to a particular group; the pairs of distances are the only data that the partitioning function has about them. Since we want to deal with dot sets that do not necessarily belong to a particular group, we identify the points with the set S = {1, 2,..., n}. We can then define a distance function that each function d: S \u00d7 S \u2192 R has in such a way that for different i, j \u0432 S, d (i, j) \u2265 0, d (i, j) = 0 if and only if i = j, and d (i, j) = d (j).In other words, d must be symmetrical and two points have distance zero if they are just the same dot.

Specifically, we aim to develop a set of abstract properties of clustering that will bring about a taxonomy of clustering. Such a taxonomy should serve to use previous domain knowledge to enable an educated selection of a cluster method that is suitable for a given clustering task. At this point, we present a unified axiomatic basis for clustering, and in this context, we offer a set of concrete properties that characterize the single linkage cluster algorithm. Our contribution provides new insights into the connection between minimum spanning trees and the single linkage cluster functions. This uniqueness result is set within a framework that resembles the purpose of demonstrating impossibility, and shows that there is no inherent impossibility in the formalization of clustering. By looking at the listing in Table 1, we show the type of cluster functions desired on the basis of the cluster functions."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Thanks to Avrim Blum, Margareta Ackerman and Nathan Schneider for very valuable discussions.
