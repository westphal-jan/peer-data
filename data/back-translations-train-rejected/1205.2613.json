The language LV is generated with the connectors \u00ac, and on the letters in V in the usual way. We shorten the conjunctions A-B by AB and negation \u00ac A by the binary variable, i. e, it is Dom (V) = {true, false}, we shorten V = true by only V and V = false by V.

Therefore, for a specific knowledge base R we are interested in determining whether R is consistent (if there is at least a distribution PR with PR | = R) or inconsistent (if there is no such PR).In the following, we reduce this problem to a satisfaction problem similar to the approaches in (Hansen and Jaumard, 1996; Andersen and Pretolani, 2001), which consider purely propositional knowledge bases without conditional limitations."}, {"heading": "4 Measuring Inconsistency", "text": "The simple information that a knowledge base R is inconsistent is not always sufficient for knowledge engineering and analysis. To repair the knowledge base, more detailed information about inconsistency is needed. There is much work on analyzing inconsistency in qualitative frameworks, see e.g. (Knight, 2001; Wong and Besnard, 2001; Hunter and Konieczny, 2006), but there is very little work on analyzing inconsistency in quantitative frameworks, especially in probabilistic frameworks such as the one discussed here (Finthammer et al., 2007).

However, first, we consider the following remarks. [0, 1], so that R = [A1, B1], [Bn]} of the qualitative conditions (neglect of probability values), there are reals d1,., dn. [0, 1] that R = (A1, B1), [d1],. [Bn)} of the qualitative conditions (neglect of probability values). This is easy to see because any probability distribution can be considered as P and assign di: = P (Ai, Bi). Since we only consider self-consistent constraints, each value is compatible."}, {"heading": "5 Determining the Causes of Inconsistency", "text": "In Example 2, it was shown that the first constraint (A | B) [1] had to be modified to restore the consistency of the knowledge base R2, which might lead one to believe that this constraint alone is responsible for the inconsistency in R2. However, if one looks more closely at R2, one can see that the situation is symmetrical in all three constraints; the optimization problem has more than one solution, such as \u03b7 2 = 1 also solves the inconsistency (equal to zero for all other values) with the same inconsistency measure. In fact, most inconsistent knowledge databases exhibit this behavior because it is best for the optimization problem to change as few values of the probability constraints as possible. Normally, one is not only interested in determining a simple value of consistency, but in determining the causes of the inconsistency and ultimately restoring consistency. In Example 2, all three general constraints are equally responsible for the rule 2 (where we are responsible for consistency)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Coalition Game Theory", "text": "The game theory of the Coalition refers to games where players can form coalitions to maximize their own payout of the game (= coalition).

Since this payout must be distributed among the members of C, each player must evaluate for himself which coalition must be formed to maximize his own expected payout. Not every player must expect the same payout for himself, as the players may be more or less important for the formation of coalitions.

We used this measurement and the known Shapley value to define a more differentiated measurement that gives the Knowledge Engineer the means to restore the consistency of a knowledge base by identifying the causes of the inconsistency. Due to its inheritance from the Shapley value, the Shapley inconsistency measurement fulfills several beautiful characteristics. The examples in this work were calculated by a prototype implementation of the Inc. * and SRInc. function in Java that uses the free optimization software OpenOpt2 to address the optimization problems of the OPTR.The inconsistency measurement and inconsistency measurements described here are generally useful when it comes to data from heterogeneous sources, such as information fusion or faith revision (Bloch, Hunter, 2001, Albero, R\ufffd n)."}], "references": [{"title": "On the logic of theory change: Partial meet contraction and revision functions", "author": ["C.E.
