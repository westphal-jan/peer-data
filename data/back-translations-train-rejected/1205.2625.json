Therefore, the TRW-S summary product case is particularly interesting. In this case, the relevant boundary is bound to the faithful log partition introduced in [12]. Generally, the message delivery algorithm proposed in [12] does not converge. In contrast, the TRWS summary product algorithm is guaranteed to converge.

Therefore, much research in recent years has focused on the development of convergent algorithms. Typically, these newer algorithms are either Max Product or Summary Product, and their evidence of convergence is algorithmically specific. Here, we have also presented a unified framework for convergent messaging algorithms and demonstrated the importance of enforcing consistency in both sum products and maximum products. This analogy allows us to provide a unified derivative for existing algorithms, and it provides an easy way to derive new algorithms from existing ones by replacing maximizations and sums. Although many converged algorithms are instances of our framework, it is worth pointing out two converged algorithms that are not converged."}, {"heading": "Appendix A MPLP as a TCBO", "text": "AlgorithmMPLP can be derived as an instance of the maxproduct version of Heskes \"algorithm, and thus represented as a TCBO.

Each star Si corresponds to a node i and all its neighbors in the original graph, with the edges in between. The layer of intersectional regions would be all edges < ij >.

"Interestingly, the tree based updates in [9] do monotonically decrease an upper bound but seem not to satisfy maxconsistency.", "startOffset": 41, "endOffset": 44}], "year": 2009, "abstractText": "Message-passing algorithms have emerged as powerful techniques for approximate inference in graphical models. When these algorithms converge, they can be shown to find local (or sometimes even global) optima of variational formulations to the inference problem. But many of the most popular algorithms are not guaranteed to converge. This has lead to recent interest in convergent message-passing algorithms. In this paper, we present a unified view of convergent message-passing algorithms. We present a simple derivation of an abstract algorithm, tree-consistency bound optimization (TCBO) that is provably convergent in both its sum and max product forms. We then show that many of the existing convergent algorithms are instances of our TCBO algorithm, and obtain novel convergent algorithms \u201cfor free\u201d by exchanging maximizations and summations in existing algorithms. In particular, we show that Wainwright\u2019s non-convergent sum-product algorithm for tree based variational bounds, is actually convergent with the right update order for the case where trees are monotonic chains.", "creator": null}}}
