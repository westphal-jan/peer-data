For this problem, we propose an accurate hierarchical move making strategy where each move is computed efficiently by solving an st-MINCUT problem. Unlike previous move making approaches, e.g. the widely used a-expansion algorithm, our method obtains the guarantees of the standard linear programming (LP) relaxation for the important special case of metric labeling. Unlike the existing LP relaxation solvers, e.g. interior-point algorithms or tree-reweighted message passing, our method is significantly faster as it uses only the efficient st-MINCUT algorithm in its design.

Given a number of random variables along with a neighborhood relationship defined through them, an MRF provides an accurate representation of the probability of each label (i.e. a specific mapping of labels to the variables) in terms of potentials defined through the cliques of random variables. Due to the central role of MRFs in various applications, algorithms that perform efficient and precise inference on them are highly desirable. An important and well-studied class of inferences called a posteriori maximum (MAP) estimation seeks the labeling with the maximum probability."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "The most commonly used semimetric labeling algorithms can be roughly divided into two categories: message forwarding and motion generation. Message forwarding algorithms attempt to minimize approximations to the free energy associated with MRF [10, 14, 15, 29, 34, 36]. Among them, the algorithms of [14, 15, 34] are closely related to the linear programming (LP) of semimetric labeling [7, 17, 25, 33]. Although message forwarding algorithms provide precise MAP estimates, in certain cases they can be computationally expensive [30]. Motion approaches refer to a large class of iterative algorithms that move from one label to another, ensuring that the probability of labeling never decreases. Movement space, i.e. the search space for the new label, is limited to a subrange of the original search space that can be efficiently explored. Typically, the CINUT-UT algorithm is used to investigate the motion space, for example."}, {"heading": "3 Preliminaries", "text": "Consider an MRF defined by a series of random variables V = {v1, v2, \u00b7 \u00b7, vN} (for each of which a value can be taken from a discrete marker L = {l1, l2, \u00b7 \u00b7, lH}.

A natural way to address these deficits is to use a mixture of r-HST metrics instead of a single r-HST.5.1 Learning a mixture of r-HSTs. Given a distance function d (\u00b7 \u00b7), we would like to learn a set of r-HST metrics D = {dt, \u00b7 T} along with a probability distribution on them in such a way as to minimize the distortion, which is (D).argmin D, (max i6 = j)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Approximating Semi-Metric Labeling", "text": "Once the mixture of r-HSTs is learned, the original semimetric labeling problem parameterized by \u03b8 cannot necessarily be approximated by a series of r-HST labeling problems which succeeds by the parameters, t = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, T, where\u03b8ta (i) = \u03b8a (i, j) = wabd labeling t (i, j).

Therefore, in order to solve the semimetric labeling problem, we solve the set of r-HST labeling problems to obtain the labels f t.

Our approach provides the guarantees for LP relaxation for the metric labeling problem. Together with the work of [5, 20], this provides further evidence for a link between randomized rounding techniques used with convex relaxations and move-making algorithms. We believe that further investigations in this direction would help to develop algorithms for more complex relaxations, such as [19, 28]. In practice, the results for both synthetic and real data experiments show that our method reduces the gap in performance between move-making algorithms and measurement-passiving approaches, especially in applications where the simple potentials do not specifically target the potential of the previously specified ARF (i.e. the good ARP pairing potentials)."}], "references": [{"title": "On approximating arbitrary metrics by tree metrics", "author": ["Y.
