In attempting to decipher the underlying structure of a system, we ultimately want to know the rules that govern its behavior, which means not only knowing its activity patterns, but knowing what is responsible for this activity would lead to a richer understanding of the system and the ability to better predict future events. In biological systems, one example is discovering dependencies between genes and finding those that influence others. These networks provide a model of biological processes that can then be tested and validated by knock-out experiments.The work in this area has primarily used graphically based methods (Friedman al, 2001 al, al, al, al, al) to present strong networks as complex ones."}, {"heading": "2 BACKGROUND", "text": "The study of causality has a long history in philosophy dating back to ancient Greece. Since then, there have been a number of explanations, the primary of which do not occur in terms of regularities, processes, counterfactors, and probable relationships. However, most modern explanations of causality can be traced slightly to Hume's regularities of observation, in which C causesE follows whenever it happens, and we recognize this relationship through observation of C and E. However, Hume has also described this problem as \"if C had not happened, E would not have happened.\" This statement is known to be counterproductive; these earlier theories do not necessarily limit cause and effect to be constant or even close to space. Process theories rerepresent the problem in terms of the transfer of conserved quantities (e.g. as dynamics), where this transfer requires locality in space-time. However, when it comes to inferences, we need a concept of probability, since few relationships are actually deterrent."}, {"heading": "3 PROBLEM OVERVIEW", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own, without being able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "4 METHOD", "text": "Our main problem can be formalized as follows: In view of a series of time series data representing the activities of a system in which we hypothesize that a causal structure may exist, we try to infer the underlying relationships that form this structure. In order to represent and derive these relationships, which can be much more complex than an event that causes another, we use a probable temporal logic. In general, the approach of our method is to present the possible causal relationships as logical formulas, to determine whether they are satisfied by the system using model checks, and then to determine by a measure of their significance and the control of false discoveries at which level something is causally significant. Before describing how this representation relates to probable causal concepts, we give a brief overview of the temporal logic and the specifically applied logic, PCTL."}, {"heading": "4.1 TEMPORAL LOGIC", "text": "Temporal logic modifies traditional modal logic to allow a description of when a formula is true. That is, instead of just \"necessity\" or \"possibility,\" a formula can be true at the next point in time or at some point in the future. Unlike a linear time logic, for which there is only one possible future path, we can express whether a property applies to all possible paths (A), or whether there is at least one path for which it is true (E). The truth values of these formulas are determined relative to a Kripke structure, a graph with a series of states, transitions between states, and labels that probable propositions within the state.We will use a probable extension of the CTL, Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL), as by Jonsson 1994 and Hansson."}, {"heading": "Gf \u2261 fU\u2264\u221efalse, and", "text": "Finally, we will also use the \"leads-to\" operator (Hansson and Jonsson, 1994): f1; \u2264 t \u2265 p f2 \u2261 AG [(f1 \u2192 F \u2264 t \u2265 pf2)]. (2) This formula implies that for each path from the current state, if we are in a state in which f1 then passes through a series of transitions, we will take time, with the probability p will eventually reach a state in which f2 applies. One difficulty with this formulation is that \"leads-to,\" as defined, also takes into account the case in which f1 and f2 are true in the same state, as one that fulfills this formula. We will have to specify that there must be at least one transition between f1 and f2. In addition to our priority temporal condition for incidence, this is also consistent with what is naturally said about the term \"leads to.\" We would therefore like to write: f1; more formula t1, the more time, the more time that this system must be considered simple (p), if there is a problem between 1 and 2 (p)."}, {"heading": "4.2 CAUSES AS LOGICAL FORMUL\u00c6", "text": "Our goal now is to describe the conditions for causality and to present the causes themselves as PCTL formulas. We can also remember that the formulas are defined in relation to a probable structure, as described above. While these graphic structures consist of designated nodes and edges, note that unlike the previously described causal models, such as BNs, the arrows between states do not have a causal interpretation; they merely imply that it is possible to pass from the state at the tail to the state at the head with a probability that is not zero (which is used to label this edge in diagrams). Also, note that there may be several states with the same designations. For example, there may be two states labeled with identical sets of propositions, but which are reached in different ways and which have different paths that are possible for them. Thus, this graphic model is fundamentally different from the Bayesian networks, in which each has a variable in general, and each one with a starting node."}, {"heading": "4.3 TESTING FOR SIGNIFICANCE", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of us are able to go in search of a solution that is in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position to be in, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position to take matters into their own hands."}, {"heading": "5 EXAMPLES", "text": "While biological examples, such as gene expression data from microarrays, are of great importance, the conclusion from these data cannot be validated against a certain basic truth, that is, we can never be sure that the inferred relationships really correspond to the relationships of the system. In order to validate our methods, we first tested them on synthetic data sets, where the true causal relationships could be uncovered after the conclusion of the inference process. At this point, we discuss such a data set, which represents the firing of a series of synthetic neurons over time. Then, we discuss a data set in which the causal structure is not known, the story told by the inferred relationships coincides with what is known about the system."}, {"heading": "5.1 SYNTHETIC MEA EXPERIMENTS", "text": "These data are in a position to put themselves in the world in which they exist, and not only in the world, but also in the world in which they exist, and in the world in which they exist, in which they exist, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they are, in which they live, in which they are, in which they are, in which they live, in which they are, in which they, in which they live, in which they are, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, are, in which they, are, in which they, in which they, are, are, in which they, are, in which they, in which they, are, are, in which they, in which they, are, in which"}, {"heading": "5.2 MICROARRAY DATA", "text": "To test our method using current data with an unknown causal structure, we used a dataset consisting of a set of time-limited gene expression profiles, as measured by microarrays. Microarrays allow the measurement of expression levels (indicators of whether genes are more or less active than some control mechanisms) for thousands of genes simultaneously. In a temporal experiment, these levels are measured at regular intervals, giving an idea of how the system behaves over a certain time.The data we have studied include the 48-hour intraerythrocyclic development cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Bozdech et al., 2003).An interesting feature of this segment of the P. falciparum life cycle is that all genes are active during its 48-hour cycle. These forms, which we call the \"cascade\" of activity, where one group of genes is regulated, others are downregulated."}, {"heading": "6 OPEN PROBLEMS", "text": "This general method points to a number of open problems. Firstly, we want to be able to think about a symbolic causality that does not involve finding general causal connections, such as the one between smoking and lung cancer, but rather finding the cause on a particular occasion - did smoking cause lung cancer for a particular person. Secondly, like most others, we assumed that our time series are stationary, while many systems may have reorganization periods in which the causal regime changes. Another direction of work is to integrate spatial information, perhaps through a different modal operator, which allows an idea not only of temporal locality, but also of spatial locality. Finally, abstraction has been an important topic in computer science and will have applications in causality. There was no natural method to determine at what level one should try to conclude causal connections (e.g. in the case of biology, we could look at humans, mechanisms linking organs that regulate individual genes and our pathways could help us to find these physical relationships, but below the classical problems)."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSION", "text": "Understanding complex causal structures is at the heart of many disciplines, especially those of biology and the social sciences, where theories explain interacting parts of a whole and are subject to missing and incomplete data and need to be revised when new experiments reveal new structures. Philosophy has a rich literature on what constitutes a causal relationship and how it can be identified. We have taken advantage of the fact that the conditions for causality in this philosophical tradition can easily be translated into the framework of temporal logic and model verification. By transferring these terms to PCTL, we enable the description of vital features that have hitherto been omitted in computational approaches to causal inference, namely the temporal component of the causal relationship and the explicit description of the conditions that make up a cause. While many of our derivative causes will be spurious, we treat the problem of sorting out insignificant causes as a multiple hypotheses problem using empirical zero."}], "references": [{"title": "Mining sequential patterns", "author": ["R.
