In the last ten years, researchers have begun to study compact representations of different game types, inspired by the success of probable graphical models. For imperfect forms of games, the most influential model is multi-agents influencing diagrams, or MAIDs. (Game networks are a very similar representation of various game types, inspired by the probabilistic graphical models.) MAIDs are compact when players flaunt their utility functions; such compactness can also be explicitly compatible for the benefit. (Game networks are a very representation and were invented cars console.) MAIDs were invented simultaneously."}, {"heading": "2 Representation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 AGG", "text": "An Action Graph Game (AGG) is a game played by a group of Agent N = {1,..., n} on a series of action nodes. To play the game, each Agent i simultaneously selects an action node Ai Ai, where Ai A. Each action node thus corresponds to an action node available to one or more agents. Once the agents have made their decisions, for each action node A A an action node is tallied, i.e. the number of agents who have chosen A. The action node is a directed graph on action node A. We say A \u2032 is a neighbor of A if there is an advantage from A \u2032 to A. The benefit of an agent depends only on the node it has selected, and the action counts on the neighbor of the chosen node. This allows us to represent the usefulness of the game by specifying a utility function UA for each action node A."}, {"heading": "2.2 TAGG", "text": "At a high level, each random variable is associated with an instantiated time; as soon as the AGG representation is expanded by the introduction of the terms time, uncertainty, and imperfect information. (Each individual term is formally defined) Each individual term is driven by an informal description of these concepts. (A TAGG describes a dynamic action that is carried out through a series of action steps.), T, on a series of action nodes A and A. At each step, a version of a static AGG is played by a subset of action players on A, and the action counts on the action nodes are accumulated action variables. Random variables via random variables in a Bayes network, a random variable is associated with a set of parents and a conditional probability table (CPT). Parents can be action nodes or other random variables."}, {"heading": "2.3 Strategies", "text": "We start with pure strategies, where pure strategies are generally not sufficient (for example, to guarantee the existence of the balance of Nash). We often want to consider strategies where players make decisions randomly. A player's mixed strategy i is a distribution of probability over a player's pure strategy i. However, the use of mixed strategies is problematic, as decisions can be correlated in different decisions, allowing a player to link his later choices to their earlier decisions, regardless of whether he respects those earlier decisions. In other words, mixed strategies allow a player to act as if he is observing more information than is specified in the game. We therefore limit our attention to behavioural strategies where options for action are randomized in different decisions."}, {"heading": "2.4 Expected Utility", "text": "Now we use the language of the Bayesian networks to formally define an agent that represents the expected usefulness in a TAGG solution. [D] The actual usefulness in a TAGG solution is replaced by a behavioral strategy that defines a new Profile 11. [D] Specifically, we define an induced BN that formally describes how the TAGG solution is played. [D] The induced BN is via a series of random variables that represent decisions, random variables, action variables and utilities. [D] Because a behavioral strategy, decisions, random variables and utilities can of course be understood as random variables. [D] On the other hand, action variables are time-dependent. Thus, we have a separate action variable for each action at each time step. Definition 10: Let's be an action and utility. [D] is an action variable that will represent a time. [The times that represent the number of actions]."}, {"heading": "2.5 The Induced MAID of a TAGG", "text": "We use a similar construction to the induced Bayesian network, but with two differences. Firstly, instead of decision variables with CPDs assigned by \u03c3, we have decision nodes in the MAID. Secondly, each decision payout variable u\u03c4D becomes a supply node for players pl (D) in the MAID. The resulting MAID describes the same game as the TAGG because it offers agents the same strategies and their expected benefits are defined by the same BN. We call this the induced MAID of the TAGG."}, {"heading": "2.6 Expressiveness", "text": "It turns out that TAGGs are at least as meaningful as MAIDs.Lemma 14: Each MAID can be represented as a TAGG with the same spatial complexity. As a result, TAGGs can represent any form of games that can be represented as MAIDs, including all perfect recall games and the subclass of imperfect recall games in which each amount of information does not include multiple time steps. Since the induced MAID of a TAGG is equivalent to the TAGG, it follows trivially that each TAGG can be represented by a MAID. However, the induced MAID has a large scope and can therefore be exponentially larger than the TAGG. In the games of Examples 1 and 7, for example, the induced MAID games show maximum indexes that are equal to the number of decisions, implying that the size of the GAID games for the MAID decisions grows, while the number of GAID decisions is not converted to AID-1."}, {"heading": "3 Computing Expected Utility", "text": "A compact game representation is not very useful if we cannot perform game theory calculations efficiently in terms of the size of the representation. In this section we consider the task of calculating the expected benefit EU\u03c3 [j] for a player j given a mixed strategy profile \u03c3. EU calculation is an essential step in many game theory calculations, such as finding the best answer given the strategy profile of other players and the iterated best response algorithm, which is guaranteed to not converge but will find a Nash balance when converging. In section 4 we discuss extending our methods in this section to a partial task in the GovidanWilson algorithm for calculating Nash balances, which are guaranteed to converge. Thus, we can achieve an acceleration of all of these calculations by accelerating their bottlenecks. An advantage of the formal definition of the EU in relation to BNs is that now the problem of calculating the EU is of course presented as a Bavarian network problem by allowing us to accelerate its inferences."}, {"heading": "3.1 Exploiting causal independence", "text": "The standard BN inference approach for calculating the EU does not make use of some types of TAGG structures. In particular, it should be remembered that in the induced network, every action number is variable and the parents are all previous decisions that have A\u03c4 in their action sets, which implies large in-degree foraction variables. However, if you look at the clique tree algorithm, for example, this means large clique sizes, which is problematic because runtime scales count exponentially in the largest clique size of the clique tree. However, the CPDs of these action variables are structured counting functions. Such a structure is an instance of causal independence in BNs [7]. It also corresponds to anonymity structures for static game representations such as symmetrical games and AGGs [8]. We can use this structure to accelerate the calculation of expected usability in TAGGs. Our approach is a specialization of Breckerman's method of exploiting and NAGG independence."}, {"heading": "3.2 Exploiting temporal structure", "text": "We present an algorithm based on the idea of eliminating variables in the temporal order. \u2212 For the remainder of the section, we will define D and a period of time in which we will determine property variables X with incentive time (D) and the calculation of nodes between decisions and actions based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables U \u03c4A. Since we only have origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variables based on origin variable on origin variables based on origin variable on the origin variable"}, {"heading": "3.3 Context-specific independence", "text": "TAGGs have action-specific utility functions that allow them to express context-specific payout independence: which utility function is used depends on which action is chosen in the decision. This is translated into context-specific independence structure in the induced BN, especially in the CPD of u\u03c4D. Depending on the value of D, u \u03c4 D depends on only one of their utility variable parents.There are several ways to use this structure computationally, including conditioning on the value of decision D [3], or exploiting context-specific independence in a variable elimination algorithm [19]. An especially simple approach that works for multiplexer utility nodes is to split the utility into a sum of utilities [18]. For each utility node parent U tk is equal to u t D, there is a utility function D, the utility depends on Utility-D, and Utility-D is equal to Utility-Utility-D."}, {"heading": "4 Computing Nash Equilibria", "text": "Since the induced MAID of a TAGG is equivalent to the TAGG, algorithms for calculating the Nash balance of MAIDs [11; 15; 2] can be applied directly to an induced MAID to find the Nash balance of a TAGG. However, this approach does not exhaust all the TAGG structures. We can do better by constructing a transformed MAID, similar to the transformed BN, taking advantage of the causal independence and CSI as described in Sections 3.1 and 3.3 and exploiting the temporal structure as described in Section 3.2 when using a solution algorithm that requires the calculation of probabilities and expected benefits. Govindan and Wilson [6] have presented an algorithm for calculating equilibrium games in perfect memory of extensive form games, when the algorithm for calculating probabilities and expected usefulness processes and the distribution steps of the parents are only one and the distributions of AIDs respectively."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "We implemented our algorithm for calculating the expected service life in TAGGs and conducted experiments on the efficiency and scalability of our algorithm. We compared three approaches for calculating the expected benefit in the face of a TAGGs: Approach 1 Applying the standard clique tree algorithm (as implemented by the Bayes Net Toolbox) to the induced BN; Approach 2 Applying the same clique tree algorithm to the transformed BN; Approach 3 Applying our proposed algorithm. All approaches were implemented in MATLAB. All of our experiments were performed with a computer cluster consisting of machines with dual Intel Xeon 3.2GHz CPUs."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "TAGGs are a novel graphical representation of imperfect formation games in an extensive form. They are an extension of simultaneous AGGs to the dynamic setting and can be thought of as a sequence of AGGs played over T-time steps, with the number of actions increasing over time. This process can be formally described by the induced BN. In situations with anonymity or CSI structure, the TAGG representation can be exponentially more compact than a direct MAID representation. We presented an algorithm for calculating the expected benefit for TAGGs that uses its anonymity, CSI, and time structure. We demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that our approach is significantly more efficient than the standard approach for direct MAID representation of the same game."}], "references": [{"title": "Computing Nash equilibria of Action-Graph Games", "author": ["N.
