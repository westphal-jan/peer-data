This article extends the set of graphs where MAP estimation is in P and where message passing recovers the exact solution to so-called perfect graphs. This result leverages recent progress in defining perfect graphs (the strong perfect graph theorem), linear programming relaxations of MAP estimation and recent convergent message passing schemes. The article converts graphical models into nand Markov random fields which are straightforward to relax into linear programs. Therein, integrality can be established in general by testing for graph perfection. This perfection test is performed efficiently using a polynomial time algorithm. Alternatively, known decomposition tools from perfect graph theory may be used to prove perfection for certain families of graphs. Thus, a general graph framework is provided for determining when MAP estimation in any graphical model is in P, has an integral linear programming relaxation and is exactly recoverable by message passing.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 15:34:09 GMT  (372kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2639v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DM cs.DS", "authors": ["tony s jebara"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.2639"}, "pdf": {"name": "1205.2639.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "MAP Estimation, Message Passing, and Perfect Graphs", "authors": ["Tony Jebara"], "emails": ["jebara@cs.columbia.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Finding the optimal configuration of a graphical model a posteriori (MAP) is an important problem that is often implemented using message delivery algorithms, and the optimality of such algorithms is well established only for simple linked graphs and other limited settings.

Graph G describes the dependencies between a series of random variables X = {x1,.,., xn} where each variable xi is associated with a vertix vi in graph vi. We assume that each xi-Z variable is a discrete variable with | xi settings4.

Therefore, only if the variables are involved in clique functions that are not nand-structured, the conversion from Xc to Xc to Xc should be implemented. Furthermore, we can offer the following two procedures that are useful to check the NMRF before verifying the perfection of the graph and / or the MAP estimation: The procedures are Disconnect and Merge. We stress that these can be applied to G optionally and hopefully simplify the NMRF to turn an otherwise imperfect graph NMRF into an equivalent perfect graph NMRF (for example, by exploiting additional structures in the WAP clique functions, which will allow MMRF functions to execute)."}, {"heading": "7 MESSAGE PASSING", "text": "While linear programming can be used to solve the MAP configuration when the NMRF contains perfect graphics, a faster approach is needed as such algorithms take more direct advantage of the sparse graphics topology (Wainwright & Jordan, 2008). A more convergent algorithm for the accuracy and convergence of max product problems was recently proposed in Globerson & Jaakkola, 2007, which is known as the converged message that is passed on. For binary MAP problems, it restores the solution to LP relativization, being investigated here as a natural competitor for linear programming for the NMRF. Applying this method to an NMRF with G = (E) graphics, it helps to rewrite the target as follows."}, {"heading": "8 EXPERIMENTS", "text": "To assess the optimum of message delivery, we examine the convergence of the following mountain graphs: two-sided graphs, complements of two-sided graphs, line graphs of two-sided graphs, and additions to these line graphs. We also look at arbitrary random graphs that may or may not be perfect. Message delivery was used to solve one-sided matching, as in Lemma 5 on these graphs, with random edge weights scanned evenly between [0, 1]. To show convergence to the MAP problem, the estimation of message delivery (i.e. LP) is compared with the exact solution using the Edmonds algorithm. Figure 2 shows the results obtained by message delivery on the vertical axis and by exact MAP estimation on the horizontal axis."}, {"heading": "9 DISCUSSION", "text": "The NMRF graph can then be efficiently diagnosed to determine if it is perfect. If it (or a truncated version of the NMRF) is perfect, the MAP estimate is in P and can be efficiently solved by linear programming (or message forwarding), extending the MAP estimate and message forwardations to a wider range of graphical models. If the resulting NMRF is not a perfect graph, it may be useful to investigate minor modifications of the MAP problem to create a perfect graph. Otherwise, insoluble MAP estimates can be replaced by exact MAP estimates (via linear programming or message forwarding) on a surrogate problem, which is a direction of ongoing interest. In addition, due to the special nature of the nand Markov random fields, it may be the case that simpler variants of message forwarding (for example, its predecessor, the Max Product Algorithm AP (Maximum AP Work 2007) is also a reference to the Jakola Constellation."}, {"heading": "10 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The author thanks M.

The optimality of such algorithms is only well established for singly-connected graphs and other limited settings. This article extends the set of graphs where MAP estimation is in P and where message passing recovers the exact solution to so-called perfect graphs. This result leverages recent progress in defining perfect graphs (the strong perfect graph theorem), linear programming relaxations of MAP estimation and recent convergent message passing schemes. The article converts graphical models into nand Markov random fields which are straightforward to relax into linear programs. Therein, integrality can be established in general by testing for graph perfection. This perfection test is performed efficiently using a polynomial time algorithm. Alternatively, known decomposition tools from perfect graph theory may be used to prove perfection for certain families of graphs. Thus, a general graph framework is provided for determining when MAP estimation in any graphical model is in P, has an integral linear programming relaxation and is exactly recoverable by message passing.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.96 Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software"}}}
