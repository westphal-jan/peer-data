Specified values for evidence variables E. It is convenient to represent the query in relation to a function w (H). Example: Assumption H = A, E = (B, Y), e = (b, y), andq (B) = P (A = a | B = b, Y = y) = E {w (A) | B = b, Y = y, \u0445}, where w (A) = 1 for A = a and w (A) = 0 otherwise.For discrete networks, query responses q (B = y) are usually estimated with q (B) estimable capabilities e, with E (E) being the rear mean of the parameter formula vector. This plugin estimation is usually slightly different from the rear query, which showed a variable of E (B) and derivatives (1992, 19) that the plug-q values are equal in D (E)."}, {"heading": "2.4 PREDICTIVE DISTRIBUTIONS", "text": "The predictive distribution of the network variables results from the integration of their common conditional distribution, which is given in relation to the posterior distribution of the variables. Global independence allows this integration to be performed separately for each conditional distribution of a variable containing its parents. Predictive distribution for a discrete variable B is a location-scaled version of the distribution of students t with degrees of freedom. We need the multivariate form of this distribution in section 3, so we define it here. SupposeT = \u03b7 + U \u2212 1 / 2 (Z \u2212 \u03b7), where Z and U are independent, Z solution Np (\u03b7, \u0432), U solution (1 / II), and we xII solution is a non-singular covariance matrix. It follows that T has the following density."}, {"heading": "3 NETWORK DOUBLING", "text": "In Section 2.3, we point out that E {q (land use plan) is usually replaced by the more than twice as high land use rate (land use plan) = twice as high (land use plan) = twice as high (land use plan) = twice as high (land use plan) = twice as high (land use plan) = twice as high (land use plan) = twice as high (land use plan) = twice as high (land use plan) = twice as high (land use plan) = twice as high (land use plan) = twice as high (land use plan) as before (land use plan); see Figure 1 (b). These medium and variable approaches can be improved by adjustments described in Section 4.Consider two replicated land use plans of the network variables, each independently and identically distributed. Use them to replace each variable in the original network with a pair of variables; e.g. B \u00b2 is replaced (land use plan =)."}, {"heading": "4 ADJUSTMENTS", "text": "We now limit our focus to discrete networks and look at the four mean and variance approximations in Table 1. The delta method approximation isv 1 = gTCg, (9) where g is the gradient vector of q and C is the covariance matrix of q, both of which are evaluated in this section. The second variance approximation v \u00b2 is that in Section 3. However, the simple adjustments (q \u00b2 3, v \u00b2 3) and more complex adjustments (q \u00b2 4, v \u00b2 4) are developed in this section. For concessionality, we suppress D in our expressions; i.e., we implicitly assume that the expectations for D. PutQ = q (H = h | E = e) and R = P (E = e) and R = P (E = e). We assume that R is an unconditional query, with hypothesis E = e and no evidence variables."}, {"heading": "5 NUMERICAL RESULTS", "text": "We evaluated the accuracy of approximate q-j and v-j using highly accurate empirical estimates of q-2-q networks (our estimates q-0 and v-0 were obtained by simulating k-106 replicas of q-2 numbers from the posterior distribution by evaluating q-2 values for each replication and then calculating the sample mean and sample variance. Calculation costs exclude the use of empirical variance estimates in practice. If m is large, the asymptotic normality of q-2 numbers implies that the distribution of v-0-2-q numbers is approximately (1 / k) with the variance 2 / k."}, {"heading": "6 COMPUTATIONAL ISSUES", "text": "Inference in Bayes networks is generally an NPcomplete problem (Cooper, 1990). Alarm 108, for example, is the complexity of the variable elimination algorithm (VE) O (dr), where d is an upper limit on the number of values a variable can assume, and r is an upper limit on the size of a factor generated by the VE algorithm (Koller and Friedman, 2008). Doubling the network essentially uses the same technique to calculate a variance as used to evaluate a query, resulting in corresponding computational complexity. Doubled CP tables are larger (squared number of rows and columns), increasing the computational complexity from VE to O (d2r). The Delta method retains O (dr) complexity (Van Allen et al., 2008), so the double CP table is typically faster in large networks."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSION", "text": "We plan to extend the implementation of network duplication and delta methods to continuous and hybrid networks. This should be easy for the duplication method if all continuous variables are evidence variables. We will then compare the accuracy of these methods.Our main contributions are summarized as follows. \u2022 Development of a network duplication method to approximate the query variants. This technique uses the Cooper-Herskovits formula (5) to approximate the query average.This theory also provides convergence rates for the approximations. \u2022 Numerical comparisons of network duplication and delta methods show superior accuracy of the former methods in simple networks. \u2022 Customizations to improve accuracy motivated by asymptotic theory for discrete networks. This theory also provides convergence rates for the approximations. \u2022 Numerical comparisons of network duplication and delta methods show superior accuracy of the former methods in simple networks. We do not recommend replacing network duplications in all applications."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We appreciate helpful comments from anonymous reviewers and thank NSERC, iCORE and the Alberta Ingenuity Centre for Machine Learning for their support."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2009, "abstractText": "A Bayesian belief network models a joint distribution with an directed acyclic graph representing dependencies among variables and network parameters characterizing conditional distributions.
