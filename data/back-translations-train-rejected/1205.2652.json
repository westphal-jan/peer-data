In ALC, we deal with individuals, concepts, roles, Boolean operators, and limited forms of quantification [1]. For example, the concept Fireman refers to the amount of firefighters and vegetarians u-buyFrom.Fireman refers to a set of individuals who are vegetarian and are purchased only by firefighters. We can also have assertions such as Fireman (John) stating that John belongs to Fireman. We start with credalALC, a probable description logic we introduced earlier [8, 33].Credal ALC, referring to CRALC, mixes constructs of ALC with features of relational Bayesian networks. In fact, most of this work can be read as a study of these relational Bayesian networks that can be expressed with (variants) of ALC."}, {"heading": "2 Probabilistic description logics", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them are able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves.

We have used the ACE engine for the probability calculations because it can take advantage of the logical conclusion [6] that is executed in a dual core Pentium 2GHz with 2GBytes of Memory. As we have shown, current technology can handle exact probability calculation only with small N; it does not appear that a comprehensive comparison between approximations and exact results is possible at the moment. We will analyze a few examples that well illustrate our method. In the following tables we present results of exact inference, then LBP, then our proposed method. Exact inference always resulted in results within two seconds, but not for N > 9 due to memory depletion. The results of LBP (on the grounded network) and parameterized LBP are identical in cases, but their results are different in BP (we present only in 45 minutes)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Dropping assumptions", "text": "In this very short section we comment on failures of the Bayian assumption. Suppose we have the uniqueness assumption = 50 = BP, but N is countable infinite and thus fails to accept the limited domain. As noted in Section 3, the results of Jaeger [23] show that in this case a unique common distribution exists. To get approximate conclusions for N = \u221e, we perform the propagation method with increasing values of N: There will be a point at which probabilities raised to N \u2212 M become less than machine precision, and at this point we will achieve approximations valid for N = \u221e. For example, for the network of Example 1, all messages referring to quantifiers are deterministic for N = 500, so the approximate value for P (a0) is 0.4050 for N =. This is a nice result, because in this example we can show that P (a0) is exactly 0.50% for N."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "Using novel complexity analyses and algorithms, this paper has contributed to the conclusion in a family of probabilistic description logic with interpretation-based semantics and assumptions of cyclicity and independence. Variants of Proposition 1 and Theorem 1 should be applied to other first-order relational / probabilistic models [16, 34]; we note that there are currently relatively few results on complexity for these models. In addition, our analysis produces a meaningful class of PEXP-complete problems that may be useful for other applications.With regard to algorithms, the contributions here revolve around a variation scheme that essentially splits the disrupted network into smaller units in order to apply logical conclusions whenever possible. This idea should be useful for other probabilistic logic. Experiments show that our techniques are better than existing and can handle problems of practical importance, and the method can be adapted to handle infinite and unlimited domains, as well as situations in which uniformity is violated."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Thanks to Cassio Polpo de Campos for discussing the complexity of the calculations.

Harshness: We resort to limited domino problems that relate to a limited number of tiles and a pair of compatibility relationships to D-D, while it is possible to cover the entire torus while respecting the limitations and initial conditions. Bo-rger et al [4, Thm.] shows that in the face of a limited machine (time / space) one can construct a limited domino system that reproduces its behavior, but its reduction is not parsimonious [32, Sec. 18.1] as the number of acceptances and the number of transformations one can construct oneself."}], "references": [{"title": "Description Logic Handbook", "author": ["F.
