We have shown novel complexity results that demonstrate this trade-off: While verification of the existence of plans in classical deterministic (flat) problems is NL-complete (via st-Reachability [35]), and verification of the existence of plans for Pomp models is EXPTIME-complete [21], we have found that verification of the existence of plans for Pomp plans with polynomial diameter NP is complete, and that for Pomp models in which actions are mutations with empty preconditions are allowed in NP."}], "references": [{"title": "Learning partially-observable deterministic action models", "author": ["E.
