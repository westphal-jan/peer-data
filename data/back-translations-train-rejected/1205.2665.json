However, the calculation of the marginal probability distribution of a variable that contains a set of observed variables (variables with evidence) is considered a conclusion in a Bayesian network. However, a special case of inference is the calculation of the upper probability distribution, which is the calculation of the marginal probability distribution of a variable (X | E1, EV) when all evidence is E1, EV (direct or indirect) precursor of the node X and an evidence node of an evidence node, is also proof that we have evidence."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "At present, the most important means of displaying and propagating lower and upper probability limits in Bayesian networks are faith networks, generalizing the concept of Bayesian networks by propagating convex sets of discrete probability distributions instead of dot probabilities (see e.g. [de Campos and Cozman, 2005]).Consequently, various approaches have been proposed (see [da Rocha et al., 2003, Ide and Cozman, 2008, Tessem, 1992]).We will use our method in Sections 4.3 and 5 to evaluate the performance of inference methods in credential networks with regard to the idea of focusing on specifying only lower limits instead of lower and upper limits, our method is closely related to the work of Finish and Breese [Finish and Breese, 1990]."}, {"heading": "3 LOWER BOUND BAYESIAN NETWORKS (LBBN)", "text": "This section introduces the Lower Bound Bayesian Networks. LBBN offers a novel way of approaching lower boundaries. They provide outer approximations similar to the methods mentioned in the previous section. Unlike these, LBBN does not require the implementation of new algorithms or the extension of predefined data structures. The reason for this is that they are in fact Bayesian standard networks, where only the interpretation of the entries in the CPT is modified."}, {"heading": "3.1 DEFINITION OF LBBN", "text": "First of all, let us briefly remember the definition of a Bayesian network, which is defined by a directed non-cyclic graph. Furthermore, there is a discrete conditional probability table (CPT) for each node Xi. Let us refer to the territory of Xi by Si.In an LBBN, the structure corresponds to the structure of a Bayesian network, but the meaning of the entries in the CPT states is not changed. First, each entry in the CPT P (X = x) is replaced by a lower bound P (X = x | X), after which the entries in a CPT are no longer any arbitrary state. Mass 1 \u2212 2 x P (X) is the degree of ignorance and it can also be interpreted as some kind of character."}, {"heading": "3.2 EXAMPLE", "text": "Consider the Bayesian network shown in Figure 1. Each node is binary, and the state spaces of the nodes E, F, and G are {e1, e2}, {f1, f2}, and {g1, g2}, respectively. Given the lower limits of the conditional probability distributions of each node, we are interested in finding the exact lower limit for P (G = g1). To distinguish the old nodes from the new nodes with an additional state, we add the symbol to the nodes, i.e., node E becomes E, and so on. The CPTs of this LBBN are then defined in accordance with Section 3.1, which shows in Table 2 that probability tables for the nodes X, Y, and Z are not specified because they are irrelevant to the calculation of P \"(G = 1), since we each have an exact sum of 1 = 7 nodes available for these nodes."}, {"heading": "4 MAJOR PROPERTIES OF LBBN", "text": "In this section, we demonstrate two important properties of LBBN: the first is that inference in LBBN yields outer approximations, which is a fundamental justification for our method; the second is that we can even provide accurate solutions if we limit the network to trees with binary variables; and we also comment on the computational complexity of inference in LBBN."}, {"heading": "4.1 OUTER APPROXIMATION", "text": "What we want to show is that when calculating P (X), we make the following assumptions without the loss of generality. We assume that we are not putting the network in order."}, {"heading": "4.2 EXACT LOWER BOUNDS", "text": "If we make the same assumptions as above, and additionally assume that the given network is a tree and all variables are binary, we will now show that our method has exact lower boundaries, i.e., P (X) is the chain from P (X) to Xr + 1, using the same notation as above. Since we have a tree and only take into account predictable conclusions, the only part of the network relevant for calculating P (X) is the chain from X1 to X1, where all predecessors of X1 are observed variables (variables with evidence). One way to achieve the exact lower boundary for P (Xr + 1 | E) is to use a sequence of \"node operations.\""}, {"heading": "4.3 COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY", "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before."}, {"heading": "5 EXPERIMENTS", "text": "To calculate the deviation from the exact solution, we used Cozman's Credal Network implementation for all experiments (see [Cozman, 2002])."}, {"heading": "5.1 BENCHMARK NETWORK", "text": "In [da Rocha et al., 2003], the accuracy of the A / R and A / R + algorithms is examined using the network shown in Figure 2.2. In this network, we make approximate values for the lower limits with our method and then use the induced upper limits to compare our results with those in [da Rocha et al., 2003]. Each node has 3 states, and the upper limit for each node is defined by 3 vertices. Random upper vertices for the definition of each credential set were then created in [da Rocha et al., 2003] 15 different instances of this network. For each of these networks, the upper limit for P (E = e1) was calculated using A / R and A / R +. These approximate upper vertices were then compared with the exact upper limits. The results can be seen in Table 4. To determine the test conditions for the approximation to the LBBN close to those used in [Roda et al, 2003], we use the probability that the three vertices are actual."}, {"heading": "5.2 RANDOMLY GENERATED NETWORKS", "text": "To compare our results with those in [Ide and Cozman, 2008], we have randomly generated Bavarian networks with the BNGenerator [Ide, 2004]. Apart from the number of nodes, the number of states and the number of edges, we therefore use the default parameter settings. These parameters were set to create five types of multi-connected networks with 10 nodes. The first 3 types have an edge density of 1.2 (i.e., 12 edges), 1.4 and 1.6, and each network contains only binary nodes. The last 2 types have an edge density of 1.2 and 1.4, respectively, and all their nodes have four states. We have randomly created 10 different network structures for each type, and for each network structure we have 100 instances with randomly selected lower limits. For each instance we have calculated the Mean Square Error (MSE) x. The averages for all structures of a type are set in Table 5."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this article, we introduced a novel method for propagating lower boundaries at conditional probabilities in Bayesian networks. We focused on prognostic conclusions and proved that our method guarantees to deliver outer approximations that we have proven competitive in terms of accuracy of existing approximations while offering the best computational complexity of all approximations. In the specific case of predictive inference in Bayesian binary variable networks, our method delivers accurate solutions even faster than the currently fastest method available for exact inference in Bayesian binary networks, the 2U algorithm [Ide and Cozman, 2008]. In large networks, the exact propagation is intractable - in our experiments we reached the limit of calculating exact lower and upper boundaries in a network with only 10 nodes and 16 edges - and other approximations are either computationally expensive, limited to specific network structures or both. LBBN provides a viable solution for a large-scale network that we would like to emphasize in any large-scale network."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers of the article for their very constructive suggestions, which helped us to improve the quality of this article and are also pleased about the comments of Sebastian Riedel."}, {"heading": "A Appendix", "text": "We will show that inequality (1) depends on it.
