Introduction", "text": "As a necessary complement to some existing mathematical tools for dealing with uncertainty, Molodtsov [17] has introduced the concept of soft sets via set value mapping. A distinguishing feature of soft sets, which differs from the theory of probability, is that a precise quantity such as probability and degree of membership is not essential; this feature facilitates some applications because the underlying probabilities and membership levels are not known with sufficient precision to justify the use of numerical valuations.Since its introduction, the concept of soft sets has received considerable attention (see, for example, 4, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20, 25)."}, {"heading": "2. Soft sets", "text": "For a detailed introduction to soft set theory, the reader can refer to [14, 17]. We begin with some notations. In classical set theory, the symbols \u2205, Ac, A, B, A, B, B, etc. clearly mean the empty set, the addition of A in relation to any universal set U, the union of sets A and B, and the difference of sets A and B, whose elements belong to A but not to B. In what follows, we write P (U) in relation to a universal set U and denounce P (U) in relation to soft sets F, etc. In this paper, U is a universal set and E is the set of all possible parameters taking into account U. Usually, parameters are attributes, properties or properties of objects in U. We remember the notion of soft sets based on Molodsov."}, {"heading": "3. Operations on soft sets", "text": "In this section, we generalize the basic operations to soft sets 3.3. Examination of further properties of these operations is postponed to the next section. (Let's start with the notions of empty and universal soft sets. (Let's start with the notions of soft sets, which are called soft sets in [14] of a soft set (F, A) when F (e) is called soft sets, when F (e) is called soft sets, when F (e) is written as soft sets, when F (F, A) is written as soft sets, when F (e) is written as empty sets, when F (e) is written as empty sets, when A (e) is written as soft sets, when A (e) is written as soft sets, symbolically we write (U, E) for the empty soft sets over U.Definition 3.2. A soft sets over U is called universal soft sets, when A (e) is written as soft sets, and when A = all sets, and F (E) are for the empty soft sets."}, {"heading": "4. Algebraic properties of soft set operations", "text": "This section is dedicated to some algebraic properties of soft-set operations, defined in the last section. Let's start with some properties that involve intersections and unions; the first four laws are obvious; we waive their proofs here, since the proofs come directly from the definitions of intersection and union of soft-sets.Proposition 4.1 (identity laws) e (F, A) about U, we have these (1) (F, A) = (F, A).Proposition 4.1 (identity laws) = (F, A).Proposition 4.1 (identity laws) e (F, A) about U, we have these (F, A) about U, we have these (F) (F, A) = (F).Proposition 4.2 (F) about the laws (F, E).Proposition 4.2 (Proposition 4.2).Proposition 4.3 (ideal laws).We have these (F) about U, we have these (F) about G, we have these (F)."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this essay, we have redefined the intersection, complement and difference of soft sets. These operations, together with an existing trade union operation, form the basic operations for constructing new soft sets from given soft sets. By examining the algebraic properties of these operations, we find that all the basic properties of operations on classic sets such as identity laws, laws of domination, distribution laws and De Morgan's laws apply to the newly defined operations on soft sets. From this point of view, the new operations on soft sets are reasonable. Motivated by the idea of not setting a parameter set in [14], we will examine the operations on soft sets by introducing more conjunctions including AND and OR into a parameter set. Furthermore, it is interesting to extend the terms intersection, complement, difference of soft sets developed here to other soft structures such as unsharp sets [22-19] and [24]."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under the funding programmes 61070251, 61170270 and 61121061 and the Basic Research Funds for Central Universities under the funding programme 2012RC0710."}], "references": [{"title": "Soft sets and soft groups", "author": ["H.
