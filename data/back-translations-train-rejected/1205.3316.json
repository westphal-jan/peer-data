Introduction", "text": "Computer-aided learning has benefited from the information technology revolution triggered by the advent of multimedia computers. There are thousands of CD-ROM learning materials on the market. The topics covered are huge: art, language learning, science, encyclopaedias, etc. Today, computer education is in extremely favorable terrain [24]. This article tries to show what is being done and what can be done to integrate these automatic language processing tools into computer-based software language learning. We use the technique of forced adaptation to see the degree of agreement between the model proposed by the teacher and the learner."}, {"heading": "2. Work Context", "text": "This work takes place in the Research Laboratory for Information and Communication Technology and Electrical Engineering (LATICE, Monastir unit). This article is part of CALL, it is part of the work of computer-aided learning of Arabic language by means of automatic Arabic language processing. In this work, we first present the basics of our speech recognition system. Next, we present our CALL system in these parts of the design, test and discuss the results."}, {"heading": "3. Arabic Language", "text": "Arabic is the language originally spoken by Arabs. It is a Semitic language (such as Akkadian and Hebrew) and belongs within this group to the South Semitic subgroup. Due to the territorial expansion in the Middle Ages and the spread of the Koran, this language has spread throughout North Africa and Asia Minor. Arabic has 445 million speakers, which ranks fourth in the number of speakers, eighth in the number of pages circulating on the Internet [4, 3]. Due to its morphological and syntactic characteristics, the Arabic language is considered difficult to control in the field of automatic language processing [5,6]. This difficulty requires new methods that facilitate the learning of Arabic, which is a RUF."}, {"heading": "4. Existing Systems", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they do not want."}, {"heading": "5. Automatic Speech Recognition", "text": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a computer technology that allows a machine to extract the verbal message contained in a speech signal. It uses computing methods in the fields of signal processing and artificial intelligence. Applications are varied: helping people with disabilities to control tuning machines, booking flights, learning other languages, data entry, etc. Most applications in RAP use technologies based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which are capable of simultaneously modelling the time and frequency characteristics of the voice signal. This technology provides powerful algorithms for learning and recognition, with HMM having proven to be best adapted to the problems of speech recognition. However, they have limitations and difficulties, mainly in choosing a good initial model for learning and modelling the phoneme duration [12,13]."}, {"heading": "5.1. State of the art", "text": "Automatic speech processing opens up new perspectives in view of the considerable difference between manual and classical command and voice. By using natural speech in human-machine interaction, the technology is within reach for all and extends it, thereby reducing restrictions on the use of keyboards, mice and command codes. Therefore, by simplifying the human-computer dialogue protocol, automated speech handling is also an increase in productivity, as it is the machine that adapts to humans in order to communicate, not vice versa. Furthermore, it enables the use of simultaneous eyes or hands for other tasks. It enables the humanization of information management computer systems and focuses its design on the user. Basically, the speech recognition software, which is primarily used for typing mass of text while delivering keyboard output (offering a rate of 50 words per minute, as opposed to more than 150 per minute for speech), remains the keyboard as necessary corrections for text and computer usage."}, {"heading": "5.2. Stages of recognition", "text": "The following diagrams (Fig.1), present the process chain of automatic speech recognition. From a speech signal, the first treatment to extract the parameters properties after pretreatment is to be used on a short-term basis (5 to 30 ms) to improve the input signal, to reduce noise and eliminate the signal \"do not speak\" (silence, music, etc.). Then, to extract a feature vector (acoustic vector) for classification. The characteristic parameters are set in the input of a module acoustic or an acoustic phonetic decoding. The latter, in turn, can generate one or more phonetic hypotheses, which are generally associated with a probability for each segment of the speech signal. This hypothesis generator will often be modeled by local statistical models of the elementary units of speech, for example a phoneme."}, {"heading": "5.3. Corpus", "text": "In order to implement our system of automatic Arabic speech recognition, a corpus of voices from several dialects is realized. This voice database consists of mono-loudspeakers with a sampling frequency of 16 khz, as shown in the following table (Table 1). The task of creating a corpus requires a great deal of attention in selecting the words that are most representative of all areas, and stores them in the highest possible quality, which allows a higher recognition rate. Most of the words used in the exchange of speeches are practically the same as those used for newspaper articles. Following this approach, we consulted the newspapers published in Arabic to select the words more employees every day. We arrived at a clarification of about 3500 words, most of which occur in Arabic in various areas of daily life: politics, sport, economy, economy, etc. Recording these words with three speakers, downloading the AASR corpus [14] and the gain of the corpus, which allows us to retrieve something in the following table of our work, by retrieving it in the following detail [6]."}, {"heading": "5.4. List of Arabic Phonemes", "text": "The phoneme is the unit that the decoder will recognize. We noted in Table 4 lists of the 44 phonemes used in our work. \u2022 At the end of this list we added the standard phoneme / SIL / ([14], [21], [22]), the phoneme \u2022 phonemes with spaces between the word units \u2022 \u2022 short vowels / AE /, / IH / and / UH / correspond to diacritical characters in Arabic Fatha, Dhamma, Kasra. \u2022 long vowels are / AE: /, / IY / and / UW /. \u2022 The short vowel / AH / is the diacritical character of Arabic Fatha, which is long / AH: /. \u2022 The short vowel / IX / corresponds to the diacritical character of Arabic Kasra and / Tafkhim, which is long / IX: / IX. \u2022 The short vowel / AA / IX corresponds to English."}, {"heading": "5.5. Pronunciation Dictionary", "text": "The quality of an automatic speech recognition system depends to a large extent on the accuracy of the pronunciation dictionary. The pronunciation dictionary must contain all the words in the corpus to ensure an important recognition rate, for which we spent a significant part of our work building the dictionary. Finally, we resulted in 25,841 words that are sufficiently large to contain all the words in the corpus and ensure a significant recognition rate. Creating a dictionary of pronunciations is necessarily based on the list of Arabic phonemes noted in the previous session. The following figure (fig. 2) shows an excerpt from the dictionary used in our work."}, {"heading": "5.6. Acoustic-Phonetic Decoding", "text": "This sequence of phonemes is based on parameter vectors extracted from the speech signal and the assumptions of the acoustic model and the speech model.The module consists of two sub-models: the first is to generate the representative parameters of the signal (Fig. 3), since the decoder cannot process signals in wave format and therefore must first extract the MFCC parameters.The second is the decoding itself. Thus, the necessary elements for acoustic-phonetic decoding are: \u2212 The MFCC parameters \u2212 The Acoustic Model \u2212 The language modelThis is an illustration that best summarizes the phenomenon of acoustic-phonetic decoding in the following figure (Fig. 4)."}, {"heading": "5.7. Principle of Forced Alignment", "text": "In this treatment, speech signals are aligned with corresponding transcriptions, the phonetic description of the speech signal is localized in the phonetic dictionary, the phonetic boundaries are determined in the registry, and each phoneme is assigned a score according to the distance from the norm that represents the acoustic model. We performed the alignment using the Sphinx Align tool (in the Sphinx3 field), which is able to align the speech signal with the transcription. To do this, we simply specify the paths to the data signals required in the MFCC format, the transcriptions, the phonetic dictionary, and the acoustic model.After the forced alignment is completed, we obtain a segmented corpus in phonemes with result files containing the start time and end time for each number of images affected and the score, and at the end of the file we find the sum of all the scores for each signal."}, {"heading": "5.8. Tests and Results", "text": "The purpose of the evaluation of our recognition system is that we have previously noted the training and tests for speech corpus, the latter characterized by several phrases: 5 male speakers and 4 female speakers. The results obtained are very satisfactory, in fact we have achieved an important recognition rate. The results obtained can be summarized as follows: Correct = 88.3% WHO = 11.7% With: Correct is the recognition rate, WHO is the error rate (Word Error Rate). Taking into account the following formulas: Percent Correct = (N-D-S) / N (2) Percentage WHO = 100-Percent Correct (3) With: N the number of labels in the file transcription, D the number of deletions, S the number of substitutions. The results obtained are very satisfactory given the size of our training corpus is relatively small with a reduced number of speakers. It is recommended that we have already used 100%, with different voices, to reach almost 16% for a large corpus."}, {"heading": "5.9. Comparing and Discussing", "text": "In order to test the effectiveness of our ASR system, we chose two additional speech recognition systems for isolated words [17,18] and made comparisons such as the following table (Table 4).The scene is full of research on speech recognition, then our choice is justified by the type of recognition (recognition of isolated words for the Arabic language).Thus, to ensure a logical comparison, both systems are chosen for isolated words."}, {"heading": "5.10. Conclusion", "text": "When we see the recognition rate, which corresponds to each size of the corpus, although we notice that it is not the primary factor affecting the results of a speech recognition system, we need to ensure some harmony between several factors: size of the corpus, size of the pronunciation dictionary, recording quality (the lowest possible noise), accuracy of the transcripts, good and correct pronunciation, correct procedure, etc."}, {"heading": "6. CALL Applications", "text": "Computer assisted learning has attracted a lot of attention in recent years [23]. Much research has been done to improve these systems, especially in the field of foreign language teaching. In this section, we describe our system and the learning outcomes of the computer assisted Arabic spoken language. This work is designed to teach people (French) Arabic as a foreign language, the correct pronunciation of phonemes. This application uses our automatic speech recognition system to detect errors in the learner's pronunciation."}, {"heading": "6.1. Design of our System", "text": "This system consists of a mosaic of subroutines managed by a main program that allows the user to interact first with the teacher during the design phase of the programmed instructions and then with the student himself during the lesson. Dialogue between operator and machine (teacher or student) is usually provided via a keyboard, screen and microphone."}, {"heading": "6.1.1. The role of the teacher:", "text": "The teacher should go to the lesson and then: \u2212 Choose the words according to the pronunciation problems that are adapted to the grade level: Level 1 (A1), Level 2 (A2) or Level 3 (B1). \u2212 The teacher monitors the system and decides whether to make the words he chooses available to the learners."}, {"heading": "6.1.2. The role of the learner:", "text": "The student \"works\" as follows: \u2212 The student pronounces the words chosen by the teacher."}, {"heading": "6.1.3. The role of the system:", "text": "The system can produce results according to the student's pronunciation: - If the pronunciation was wrong, the system returns the word after stressing the pronunciation instead of the incorrect pronunciation. - If the ground is too far away from the model proposed by the teacher, especially if it is not provided that the error is that there is only the error message. - In the latter case, one can ask: \u2022 Go directly to hear the next word and continue working. \u2022 Either repeat the word as many times as the teacher wants. All these rules are designed to make our system a very simple application that provides a real dialogue with the student, even in the absence of the teacher."}, {"heading": "6.2. Grouping of Phonemes", "text": "Phonemes present different challenges for each class, for the learners. Therefore, we find it best to group them into classes, as in Table 5.We explain here the abbreviation used in this table (Table 5) LSVG: long or short vowel germination WUS: words with unusual sounds SEOL: sounds that exist in other languages MFH: middle and end word \"hamza\" EL: Emphatic letters US: unproblematic sounds"}, {"heading": "6.2. The process of CALL: Tests and Results", "text": "This paragraph deals with the test procedure of our system. This application was tested by a linguist for solid information regarding its ability to provide statistics on a student and a level. Systematic tests on a large Arabic corpus (in the order of 562 words), selected by a linguist and categorized according to the grouping in Table 5. The words are likely to be commonly used in daily life, and they went as follows: \u2212 They do not pose any problems: 62 words. \u2212 Letters emphatically: 100 words. \u2212 Hamza in the middle and at the end: 100 words. \u2212 Sounds existing in other languages: 100 points. \u2212 Words with unusual sounds: 100 words. \u2212 Long vowel or short vowel and connotation: 100 words. This system was tested by 13 French students from the Bourguiba Institute of Modern Languages, Tunisia, after learning foreign languages, in our case Arabic. The following figures show the level statistics of each student for each class of Arabic phonemes."}, {"heading": "6.3. Discuss", "text": "Note that the phonemes that exist in other languages do not cause problems for learners at different levels, against the unknown phonemes pronunciation causes problems for most learners. Results for the emphatic letters (Figure 8) do not exceed the rate of 50% for at least 80% of learners, so the teacher has to work more on this page. Another problem with pronunciation of language vowels and mitigation is when looking at the results in Figure 6. In general, the results and statistics of our system: spoken language acquisition: case of Arabic language, are very satisfactory. Previous statistics show the level of each student's pronunciation difficulties in each class of phonemes. These statistics are very useful for the teacher to automatically detect errors in the pronunciation of each learner."}, {"heading": "6.4. Conclusion", "text": "Analysis of the results of forced orientations gave us an idea of phonemes that cause problems for learners and of phonemes that are easier to master. We found that the sounds with characteristics similar to those of the learners \"mother tongue are more difficult to master in our case (mother tongue: French, foreign language: Arabic). Emphatic phonemes are the most difficult to master. One of the difficult characteristics for learners to control is the duration of phonemes. We noticed this problem in analyses of the short vowels and long vowels of Arabic and the generic."}, {"heading": "7. Future Works", "text": "During this work, we did not take into account the level of each individual student, which raises the focus on possible improvement based on the characteristics of each level (A1, A2, B1) and the problems faced by the learners to another level. We find it interesting to carry out tests of all sounds of Arabic dialects [25], which are more targeted at all levels, even those considered advanced, and to try to include more nationalities for the learners, which is more than interesting in order to improve the tone references and verify proofreading messages."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusion", "text": "The results are satisfactory. In the second part, we presented our system of computer-aided foreign language education, which delivers results in the form of phonetic structures against other works that already label the input signal phonetically (as the case of El-Kasasy.) Help and correction messages also show a great advantage for our system. References [1]. http: / / cmusphinx.sourceforge.net. [2] J-P.HATON, C.
