Challenges in recognizing handwritten signs lie entirely in the variation and distortion of handwritten signs, as different people can use different spellings and directions to draw the same shape of the characters in their familiar font. This essay demonstrates the nature of handwritten signs, the conversion of handwritten data into electronic data, and the approach of neural networks to enable machines to recognize handwritten signs. Keywords: machine recognition, handwriting recognition, neural networks."}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Handwritten characters are vague in nature, as there may not always be sharp, perfectly straight lines, and curves do not necessarily have to be smooth, making the printed characters unlikely. In addition, characters of different sizes and orientations can be drawn, which are often written on a baseline in an upright or vertical position. Therefore, a robust handwritten recognition system can be designed by taking these limitations into account. However, it is sometimes quite tedious to recognize handwritten signs, as one can see that most people cannot even read their own written notes. Therefore, there is an obligation for a writer to write clearly. But even in the 21st century, handwritten communication has its own status and most of the time in daily life it is used worldwide as a means of communication and the information is shared as with others. Researchers have already paid a lot of effort to design handwritten character recognition systems, most of them referred to as [1-5], due to their important application such as bank checking, reading zip codes and reading various forms [6]."}, {"heading": "2. PROPOSED HANDWRITTEN CHARACTER RECOGNITION SYSTEM", "text": "The structure of the handwritten character recognition system consists of several phases. The first phase consists in the pre-processing of the string; the second phase consists in the extraction of the characteristics from the string. This is a very important phase. This method of character extraction must be very effective and efficient, since the extracted characteristics become the basis of the recognition. Thus, the feature extraction takes place at the unit level, i.e. for individual character boxes in the string, and finally the user can provide the sum of the characteristics for the string. These extracted characteristics are then provided as input patterns for neural networks. Once the neural network system has been trained for these input patterns, it will be able to classify them."}, {"heading": "2.1 Preprocessing phase", "text": "At this stage, each character is pre-processed in a string. It deals with the technique of contrast enhancement, noise removal and the isolation of regions whose texture indicates a probability of character information. In the pre-processing phase, it is normalized and all redundancy errors are removed from the drawing image and transferred to the next stage of the extraction of characteristics. The following pre-processing steps are followed to make the individual characters smooth and clear. i) First, the characters are truncated, i.e. additional pixels are removed from the drawing picture. ii) Then the image of the RGB characters is transformed into an image of grayscales iii) edges are found from the individual letters. iv) Additional holes fill up from the strings. v) Bounding Boxes consist of all the individual characters in the string of handwritten characters. These boxes represent the area of the individual character. We have tested our character strings on their hand-written character strings."}, {"heading": "2.2 Feature Extraction Phase", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules that they have adopted in recent years."}, {"heading": "2.3 Back propagation based Neural network recognition system", "text": "The back propagation algorithm is a method for reducing the mean square error between the actual and the target output of a multi-layer perceptron.

Update equations are derived from the chain derivation rule applied to the LMS training function. Convergence can be faster if an impulse date is added and weight changes by jij [) (1) (\u2212) (+ (1)"}, {"heading": "V. Repeat by Going to Step 2", "text": "The program based on the back-propagation algorithm described above trains the network to recognize the handwritten characters. This network takes input-output vector pairs during the training. The network trains its weight array to minimize the selected measure of performance, i.e., errors using the back-propagation algorithm. Our designed neural network system takes the following data as inputs from the user: a) The input pattern file b) number of neurons in each hidden layer c) value of the learning rate d) value of the impulse constant e) error value for convergence The output of the training program is a file containing modified weights of different connections of the network. This file serves as input to the test program. This file also contains the values of the neurons in the input layer, hidden layers, output layer, value of the learning rate and impulse factor so that the user does not need to re-enter these values during testing."}, {"heading": "3. RESULTS & DISCUSSION", "text": "The first part is for training the system and the second part is for testing purposes. Characteristics have been calculated and stored for each character to train the network. The following parameters are used for training our neural network: Number of neurons in the input layer: 6 Number of neurons in the hidden layer: 8 Transfer function used for layer 1: \"Logical\" Transfer function used for layer 2: \"Tansig\" Adaptation learning function: \"Learngdm\" Performance function: \"MSE\" The table below shows the results from the experiment. As we can see from the table, if we increase the number of units in the hidden layer, the network converges with greater accuracy, and this can be seen for the entire pattern. The detection accuracy is very high and corresponds to our predictions. The experiment in which the string can be detected with significant accuracy, shows that a string is written."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSION", "text": "We have proposed and developed a system for recognizing handwritten characters. We have tested our experiment on handwritten Hindi characters and the strings of those handwritten characters. Experimental results have shown that the machine has successfully recognized the string with an average accuracy of 93.5%, which is significant and may be acceptable in some applications. The experiment shows that as we have increased the number of hidden units in hidden layers, the network converges with greater accuracy. In the future, the similar experiment can be tested using some other characters and with some more or new parameters to improve the accuracy of the machine."}, {"heading": "5.
