INTRODUCTION", "text": "Optical character recognition is a thing of the past, as Gustav Tauschek received a patent on OCR in Germany in 1929, followed by Handel, who received a U.S. patent on OCR in the U.S. in 1933. Since then, number of character recognition systems have been developed and are also used for commercial purposes. However, there is still hope to build some smarter handwritten character recognition systems, as handwriting differs from one person to another. Its writing style, the shape of the alphabets and their size make the difference and the complexity of recognizing the letters. Researchers have already made many efforts in designing the handwritten character recognition system, which most of them are referred to as [1-5], because of its important application such as the bank verification process, reading zip codes and reading various forms [6]. Handwritten character recognition is still a problem for many languages such as Arabic, Farsi, Chinese, English, English, etc. A machine can perform tasks that require more time than a human being able to perform and save the same amount of time."}, {"heading": "2. HAND WRITTEN ENGLISH ALPHABET RECOGNITION SYSTEM", "text": "Two phase processes are involved in the overall processing of our proposed scheme: pre-processing and neural networks based on recognition tasks. The pre-processing steps deal with the manipulations required to prepare the characters for input into the neural network system. First, the required character or part of the characters must be extracted from the image representation. Dividing the alphabets into 25 segment grids, scaling the segments to a standard size and thinning the resulting character segments to obtain skeletal patterns may also be necessary to enable the recognition process: I. The alphabets can be thinned and their skeletons can be obtained using known image processing techniques before their binary forms are extracted.II. The scanned documents may be \"cleaned\" and \"smoothed\" using image processing techniques that enable better performance of the segment.Because this step involves the digitization of the networks."}, {"heading": "3. RESULTS & DISCUSSIONS", "text": "Since the alphabets are divided into 25 segments, the architecture of the neural network is designed specifically for processing 25 input bits. Network parameters used for the training are: Learning Rate Coefficient = 0.05 No. of Units in the Input Layer = 25No. of Hidden Layers = 2No. of Units in the Hidden Layer = 25Initial Weights = Random [0.1] Transfer Function, the Hidden Layer 1 = \"Logsig\" Transfer Function used for Hidden Layer 2 = \"Tansig\" contains the binary codes of Alphabets = 25Initial Weights = Random [0.1] Transfer Function, the Hidden Layer 1 = \"Logsig\" Transfer Function used for Hidden Layer 2 = \"Tansig.\" The training set includes the binary codes of Alphabets. It was not practical to enter these forms individually when creating the training set, as the actual form of a particular character depends on the nature of the alphabet."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSION", "text": "We tested our experiment across all English alphabets with multiple writing styles. Experimental results showed that the machine successfully detected the alphabets with an average accuracy of 82.5%, which can be significant and acceptable in some applications. The machine found that it is less accurate at classifying similar alphabets, and in the future this misclassification of similar patterns could be improved, and a similar experiment can be tested over larger datasets and with some other optimized network parameters to improve the accuracy of the machine."}, {"heading": "5.
