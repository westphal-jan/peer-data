Although no efficient algorithm can solve all of its instances, this approach is often overly pessimistic in practice, and a more realistic (but blurred) criterion would be to say that a problem is feasible if there is an efficient algorithm that correctly solves all of its practically interesting instances. The difference can be very significant, as the vast majority of instances are completely irrelevant for practical purposes. An important case is where clusters occur where one seeks a meaningful partition of a given dataset. Almost every formal manifestation of the clustering problem is NP-Hard, but a clustering instance is of practical interest if the data can actually be partitioned in a meaningful way."}, {"heading": "1.1 Stable instances", "text": "Definition 1.4 Let w: V \u00b7 V \u2192 [0, \u221e) be an instance of MAXCUT and leave \u03b3 \u2265 1.
