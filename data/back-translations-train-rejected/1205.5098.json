INTRODUCTIONMulti-Criteria Group Decision Problems frequently occur in practice. There are several methods that can be used to solve such problems. An example of an MCGDM problem is that a group of two people (A and B) intends to determine which laptop to buy based on certain criteria. Let us assume that they have evaluation criteria, such as: price, screen size, memory and battery life. Each decision maker may have different meanings for different criteria. For example, the relative importance of criteria for A can be: price > battery life > memory size > screen size. Here > means more than. For B, it may be a different order of criteria.

The definitions of fuzzy concepts relevant for the understanding of TOPSIS have been adapted from these sources. \u2212 Definition 1: A fuzzy concept defines a value in a universe of Discourse X. \u2212 Definition 1: The functional value is referred to as the degree of membership of x in a universe. \u2212 Definition 2: A triangular fuzzy number is referred to as the degree of membership of x in a universe. The closer the value of \u00b5a (x) to the unit, the higher the degree of membership of x in a universe. \u2212 Definition 2: A triangular fuzzy number is presented as a = (a1, a2, a3).

Linguistic variables", "text": "In fuzzy set theory, conversion scales are used to convert the linguistic terms into fuzzy numbers. In this thesis, we will use a scale from 1 to 9 to evaluate the criteria and alternatives. Below, the linguistic variables and fuzzy evaluations for the alternatives and the criteria: The values for the triangular fuzzy numbers that we have selected for the linguistic variables take into account the blur and distance between the variables (see Equations 1 and 2); the intervals are chosen to produce a uniform representation of 1 to 9 for the fuzzy triangular numbers used for the five linguistic evaluations; for example, one can also choose (4,5,6) instead of (1,1,3) to represent Very Low if one wishes, but in this case the \"1 to 9\" evaluations of 4 instead of 1 would be the normalization step."}, {"heading": "III. FUZZY TOPSIS", "text": "The technique called fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Situation) can be used to evaluate several alternatives against the selected criteria.

(1) The FNIS approach consists of the worst performance values.
