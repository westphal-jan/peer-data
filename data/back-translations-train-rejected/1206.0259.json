It is not really clear which of these two theses David intends. I will try to concretize both theses without getting caught up in technical details that are interesting but do not affect this fundamental distinction. Calculation is a manipulation of symbols: symbols are of an arbitrary form and they are manipulated on the basis of rules (\"algorithms\") that act on the forms of symbols, not on their meanings. In other words, calculation is not semantic, not semantic."}, {"heading": null, "text": "It would not be the causal structure of the planets that move: it would be the causal structure of the computer hardware that executes a certain algorithm, formally reflecting the causal structure of the planetary motion. So, in whatever sense, is the causal structure of the computer system, with other dynamic properties: the hardware that implements the algorithm, and those of the planets that orbit it. So, in whatever sense, is the causal structure of the computer model \"mirror\" the causal structure that models it? The answer is that it is formally seen, and that means that the symbols and symbol manipulations in the model can be systematically interpreted."}, {"heading": null, "text": "And we speculate about what brain activity (or synthetic apparatus activity, if cognition is possible in synthetic devices) produces this invisible cognition. Let us compare the case of the brain and its invisible cognition with the case of planetary motion, as well as with the case of another body organ other than the brain, one for which the problem of invisibility does not arise: the heart. The reason why we would never dream of saying that planetary motion was only computational, or to say that planets are actually in motion in a computational model, because the model reflects their \"causal structure,\" is simply that planetary motion is visible (or can be observed through instruments), and it is simply obvious that the computational model, even if it divides the formal invariants of planetary motion, does not move."}, {"heading": null, "text": "This means that people are able to understand themselves and understand what they are doing. (...) It is important to understand that my criticism of the theory of cognition is not based on the assumption that neuralism is true. (...) We will discuss the problem of implementation. (...) The independence of computation in a moment, but I do not want generative cognition to depend on a requirement of neuroscience. (...) It is necessary to preserve the dynamic properties of the brain. (...) It is necessary for the brain to function, but not necessarily for generative cognition to depend on the requirement of neuroscience. (...) It is necessary for the brain to function in the way it functions. (...)"}, {"heading": null, "text": "This is the point at which we remember that we have omitted the third burden of cognitive theory, in addition to behavioral abilities (1) (and brain function (2), which we have ignored): even if we define cognition for what it is, it cannot be perceived by anyone but the cognitionist himself.
