Introduction", "text": "Partially observable Markov decision-making processes (POMDPs) have been widely used to provide models for real-world decision-making problems, providing a mathematical framework for modelling the interaction between the agent and its environment. One of the most notable features of POMDPs is their ability to plan in dynamic environments and under uncertainty (Ong et al., 2010). To our knowledge, few authors have mentioned MDPs and POMDPs in the field of computer music to date, among them we could mention (Martin et al., 2010), who demonstrated the use of POMDPs to control music behavior under different conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel model for agents \"interaction with the music pitch environment, based on a variant of POMDPs referred to as mixed observation capabilities (Ong et al., 2010). In the 5th International Workshop on Machine Learning and Music, Edinburgh, UK, 2012, we propose some theoretical copyright scenarios (first mentioned by the author) in the 2012 / 3 scenario."}, {"heading": "2. The Basic Idea of MOMDP", "text": "In addition to the standard models of POMDP, the fully observable state components are presented as a single state, while the individual components are variable. The latter is essentially a factorized POMDP system that benefits from the factorization of its states. In a MOMDP model, a state s is factorized into two different variables. Thus, we would have a mixed system space DP = X \u00b7 Y in which X is the state of all values for x and either Y for y.Fig.1 The standard POMDP model (left) and the MOMDP model (right) are factorized, we would have a mixed system space DP = X \u00b7 Y in which X is the state of all values for x and either Y for y.Fig.2 The standard model POMDP model is a model (left) and the MOMDP model is factorized into two variables: s = (x, y), where x is fully observable and MOMDP partially observable."}, {"heading": "B. Modeling Robotic Tasks with MOMDPs", "text": "When the state of a robot consists of several components, some are fully observable, possibly due to accurate scanning, but others are not. This is a natural case for modeling with MOMDPs. All fully observable components are summarized and modeled by variable x. The other components are modeled by variable y. \u00b2 Due to space constraints, the evidence of all theorems is provided in the full version of the paper that will be available online at http: / / motion.comp.nus.edu.sg / papers / rss09.pdfar Xiv: 120 6.08 55v1 [cs.AI] 5J un2 01."}, {"heading": "3. The Proposed Model", "text": "From music theory we know that each composite interval can be broken down into a few octaves and a simple interval, which can also transfer this idea to other simple intervals. In our MOMDP-based model, the agent makes his decisions according to the states he receives from the environment, which is the musical pitch space here. A MOMDP is defined by the tuple (X, Y, A, O, Tx, Ty, Z, R, \u03b3). The relationship between these quantities and the musical concepts of our model is explained in detail below. At each time step, the environment is in a state where s = (x, y) and x x x x x x x x is a fully observable state, while y-Y is a partially observable state."}, {"heading": "4. Experiment: Reinforcing patterns", "text": "To test our model, we developed a Q-learning algorithm (Watkins, 1989) to perform a similar task to that performed in (Cont, 2008). We interacted with the system by inserting a relative pitch pattern shown in Figure 2 into the system. For this learning experiment, we set the learning parameters \u03b1 = 0.4, \u03b3 = 0.5, and N = 20 as the number of interactions. In order to better demonstrate musical learning, the results are presented in intervals and notes. Thus, the y axis of Figure 3 shows the intervals and x axis for the notes and for each pair of intervals. The grayscale values show the Q value learned and the intensity of these values shows the guidelines learned by the agent. Also, the values indicated with red rectangles are the values originally fed into the system via the pitch contour."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "The results of our experiments indicate that our agent has learned behavioural policy efficiently. Furthermore, we can see from Figure 3 that not only did our agent learn the given pitch contour (represented by red rectangles), but also some other pairs of states. This was mainly because our method benefits from factoring each state into a few fully observable and partially observable states. Therefore, this approach will obviously help to achieve a faster convergence of the agent that interacts with the musical pitch environment."}], "references": [{"title": "Planning under Uncertainty for Robotic Tasks with Mixed Observability", "author": ["S.C.W.
