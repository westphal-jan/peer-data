Introduction", "text": "The effectiveness of a KES is therefore crucial to the system's ability to deal with the vagueness and uncertainty of the extraction process. Commercially available KES ignore these aspects; they simplify both the presentation of the content of a KES and the interaction between users. The goal of a KES is to extract knowledge relevant to a user's request, expressed in natural language. Pertinence of the feedback of a KES is measured by parameters that reflect the system's ability to achieve such a goal. The essence of the goal is not deterministic, since uncertainty and ambiguity exist in the various parts of the extraction process. The expression of knowledge in a request is uncertain and often vague, the representation of an object in an object."}, {"heading": "2. Fuzzy Goals and Fuzzy Objects", "text": "Much research has been done in the theory of possibility on the term \"knowledge extraction.\" To expand the definition of knowledge (goal) extraction from fuzzy sets to fuzzy goals, we must first analyze how to describe fuzzy objects and goals in terms of fuzzy sets [3, 4]. How does a user formulate his or her goals? How do we describe a goal, for example, when looking for a house? A natural goal is to have a car that is not too old, not too expensive, a red color, etc., to describe a goal in general: \u2022 we list attributes (in the example above, age, cost, and color), and \u2022 we list the desired (fuzzy) value A1,..., One of these attributes (in the example above, these attributes are correspondingly \"too fuzzy, object not too expensive, and color), and \u2022 we list the desired (fuzzy) value A1,..."}, {"heading": "3. Knowledge Extraction System", "text": "In this paper we will apply to KE three theories that have been used in artificial intelligence for quite some time: possibility, probability and SN theories. The use of these techniques in KE was recently used as knowledge extraction in analogy to the fields of computing and information retrieval [5, 6]. Fuzzy set theory [7] is a formal framework well suited to improve model vagance: in information retrieval it has been successfully employed on several levels [8, 9], in particular for the definition of a superstructure of the Boolean model [10], with the attractive consequence that Boolean KESs can be improved without completely redesigning them."}, {"heading": "4. Probabilistic Relevance Feedback", "text": "Probabilistic Relevance Feedback (PRF) is a technique that involves adding new targets to the original query, selecting the added targets by adding the first m of targets to a list in which all targets present in relevant objects are evaluated according to the following weighting function [17]: () () () iiii iii i i i rnrR rRnNrw \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 =. log (1) where: N is the number of objects in the collection, ni is the number of objects with an occurrence of target i, R is the number of relevant objects displayed by the user, and ri is the number of relevant objects displayed by the user with an occurrence of target i. In essence, the PRF compares the frequency of occurrence of a target in the objects marked as relevant with its occurrence frequency in the entire object collection, with the frequency of experiments displayed in the entire object list with an occurrence of target query having a greater weight than the result of [this]."}, {"heading": "5.

Experimental Analysis", "text": "We decided to compare the two techniques (PPF and PRF) to see if one was better from an experimental point of view than the other, motivated by the results of an earlier study comparing the results of the two previously described techniques [3]. In this study, we discovered that PPF was performed as well as PRF, taking into account the best possible parameter settings, but different sets of objects were extracted. The experiments described in this paper are more precise, use larger data sets, and aim to test the possibility of combining the two techniques. We decided to perform our analysis according to the classic experimental methodology of KE, using KE effectiveness measurements and KE test collections. The most important measures used in KE are persistent extraction and precision. Object-persient extraction (Op) is the subset of all objects in the collections that are relevant to a query and are actually extracted."}, {"heading": "6.1 Experimental and Evaluation Settings", "text": "The object collections selected for investigation are the word processor program and the application test collections of the phone. The main features of these two test collections are summarized in Table 1. These are classic KE test collections used by our researchers on site and described in [3, 4]. At the current stage of our research it was not about efficiency issues, and we decided that size was not that important. There are still many open questions in applying SN to KE, and the problem of scaling the results is one of the most important. We are aware of the fact that the collections used in our experiments can be considered small from the point of view of KE."}, {"heading": "6.2 Comparing Probabilistic Relevance and Possibilistic Pertinence Feedback", "text": "Since our first comparative look at PRF and PRF, we noticed that the set of targets added to the original query was very different. In other words, by taking the same initial query and returning the same objects to the PPF and PRF, we obtained different objectives (and different weights for the same targets) added to the query. In a test of 25 queries randomly selected from the series of queries from our word processor, we found that the difference between the two groups of m (m = 10) targets to be added to the query was an average of 28%, i.e., at least 3 targets that were different. The difference in weights between the same targets present in both groups was an average of 87%. Analogous differences were found from the other test collections. We compared the performance of PRF and PPF with the training groups of different sizes. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate how the performance of PF and PRF are similar to the number of relevant objects obtained when the PRF is applicable to the number of PRF."}, {"heading": "7. Limitations", "text": "In this paper, we present a study on the effectiveness of possible and likely relevant feedback on the processing of queries by beginners. We have reported in the previous sections on some of the results of an analysis of the impact of the use of possibility and probability theories in user queries on the effectiveness of a KE system. We believe that the work presented here is complete because it uses a larger number of query sets, a larger collection of objects, and a more classical KE system that was not matched to the test collection used. Nevertheless, there are at least two important limitations of this study: 1. The collection of queries used in the experiment was not really representative of typical queries by beginners. However, it has long been known that queries by beginners mainly depend on the application domain and the KE environment."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions and futur works", "text": "In this paper, the summarized results of this study show that a PPF-based persistence feedback device is more effective than PRF at a low level of training. A low level of training (i.e. a small number of objects indicated by the user as relevant) is typical of real-world KE applications. However, since PPF and PRF identify different targets at each level of training that need to be added to those included in the original query, a combination of PPF and PRF may prove effective. Results in this direction appear to indicate that the combination is indeed effective. However, further testing with larger collections of objects and with different algorithms for PPF and PRF is needed to confirm these results and fully exploit their usefulness."}], "references": [{"title": "Progress in the application of Natural Language Processing to Information Retrieval tasks", "author": ["A.F.
