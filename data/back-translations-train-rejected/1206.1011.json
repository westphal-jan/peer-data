TASK DESCRIPTION AND RELATED WORK", "text": "There are three ways in which private states are expressed in language: speech events that express private states, and direct mentions of private states, and expressive subjective elements (Banfield, 1982). In this work, we distinguish between three types of opinion leaders that correspond to the above three types of subjective statements: the first is referred to as a direct speech event, while the second is presented as an indirect speech event."}, {"heading": "3. THE PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "In this section we first describe the necessary pre-processing phase of the Arabic text (paragraph 3.1) and then give a brief overview of the approaches examined (paragraph 3.2).

The tagged corpus is freely distributed by Arabic language courses by following the data resources on their website. (http: / / altec-center.org /) We used the Research and Development International (RDI) (http: / / www.rdi-eg.com /) toolkit to perform the orthographic part of the analysis."}, {"heading": "3.2 The Investigated Approaches", "text": "To identify sources of opinion, we have explored three different approaches: 1. identification of sources of opinion using traditional pattern comparisons.2. identification of sources of opinion using sequential marking CRF classification. 3. identification of sources of opinion using sequential marking CRF classifier with the use of patterns as a trait. The first approach investigated used handmade holder patterns. Such patterns are defined in terms of words, entities and POS tags.The pattern matching approach is detailed in Section 4.The second approach examined is monitored by statistical machine learning. We used conditional random field classifiers to train our model using our feature set. The CRF features are described in detail in Section 5, The third approach is also based on CRF. The only difference between the second and third approach is that the corresponding pattern feature is disabled in the second approach and activated in the third approach."}, {"heading": "4. OPINION HOLDER EXTRACTION USING PATTERN MATCHING", "text": "The patterns are defined using key phrases and POS tags (Figure 2).In order to test the validity of the manually extracted patterns, two tests are performed: the first test is the frequency test, in which the pattern is maintained if its frequency in a corpus of 150 MB of text exceeds a threshold value (the value 5 is selected by trial and error).The second test is the precision of the pattern in extracting the opinion-holders from a corpus of size 1 MB. All patterns of precision lower than a selected threshold have been removed. The selection of the threshold is subject to a compromise between memory and precision. The larger the value of the threshold, the less patterns we extract, and therefore the less memory we receive, while the smaller value of the threshold, the less precision of the ficher we receive. Experimentally, 0.8 was selected as the threshold value.The previous process resulted in a total of 43 neglect patterns that we extract, and therefore the value we receive, the value that we receive, while the threshold is lower."}, {"heading": "5.

The Semantic Field (SF) Feature (w):", "text": "The occurrence of some keywords may be sufficient for the human being to recognize, for example, a source of opinion, the keyword \"clarified\" is an obvious indication of the existence of the opinion-holder, if the statement is marked as a subjective statement. But what if the training sentence contains a low or no frequency of this keyword? We can compensate for this by grouping the semantically related keywords such as (illustrated, shown, clarified... etc.) (, (...) so that the missing keyword (\"clarified\" in our example) has the same conditional probability p (OH | SF) of its synonyms. This characteristic was determined with the help of the semantic lexicon of RDI [41], the input into the lexicon is the word in its phrase and the output is the semantic field of that word. If the word does not exist in the lexicon, it is given a zero value for that characteristic. Prepositions also have no setic fields and therefore no value."}, {"heading": "3. Part Of Speech Tag (POST) Feature (w):", "text": "A simple reason applies to general text analysis, not just opinion-forming: the marking of a part of a speech can be considered a rough form of word meaning [46]. The word POST feature is extracted using the morphological RDI analyzer [40]. The actual POST tag from the RDI was not used because it is so large that the same tag cannot occur frequently, Figure 3 shows an example of the actual RDI tagging result: hence we have reduced this tag to a smaller set of keywords {noun, definite, verb, translit, number, symbol and NA}. All non-Arabic words (Latin letters, special characters... etc.) are tagged as symbols. Definite class is any noun with a defined article prefix (verb, translit, number, symbol and NA)."}, {"heading": "4.

The Named Entity Features (w):", "text": "Each NE class has a corresponding Boolean characteristic column. These characteristics were calculated using the bootstrapping technique described by S. Abdel Rahman et al. [37] on our corpus to recognize NE characteristics of 10 different classes: person, location, organization, job, device, car, cell phone, currency, date and time. Of these 10 mentioned classes, persons and job-NE characteristics are the most effective NE characteristics in recognizing opinion holders, as the vast majority are either persons or workplaces. Another advantage of using this feature is that the boundaries of opinion holders are correctly recognized after recognizing appropriate NE boundaries."}, {"heading": "6.

In all subsequent statements, we will highlight all the NPs marked as sources of opinion by the classifiers, while the undetected sources will remain only bold without underlining. It is worth noting that, as shown in the examples, we will include titles, surnames, nationalities and job titles in the tagged sources of opinion, both for training and for auditing companies. This is useful because some of the sources of opinion are mentioned by job title instead of person name. For example: \"The Algerian President believes that the names, nationalities and job titles can be mentioned in the texts without using his name."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "This paper presents a leading research paper in the field of Arabic opinion makers. Identification of opinion sources in Arabic is examined using two approaches, we conclude that the sequential marking of ML classifiers exceeds patterns in terms of memory and precision. Furthermore, patterns do not significantly contribute to the results after they are encoded as CRF characteristics. Non-ferrous characteristics and semantic field characteristics are critical for the detection of opinion sources and partially compensate for the lack of parser characteristics. We will explore the possibility of improving the performance of the Arabic Opinion Holder Extraction task while using robust Arabic lexical or dependency sparing components."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "All authors thank the engineers Amr Magdy and Marwa Magdy, NLP researchers, for their support in coding and translating this work."}], "references": [{"title": "A Compact Arabic Lexical Semantics Language Resource Based on the Theory of Semantic Fields", "author": ["M.Attia", "M.Rashwan", "A.Ragheb", "M.A.Al-Basoumy", "S.Abdou"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Advances in Natural Language Processing.
