This Semantic Networks is used to describe the knowledge of an \"ideal\" expert while fuzzy sets are used both to describe the approximate and uncertain knowledge of novice users who intervene to match fuzzy labels of a query with categories from an \"ideal\" expert. The technical system we consider is a word processor software, with Objects such as \"Word\" and Goals such as \"Cut\" or \"Copy\". We suggest to consider the set of the system's Goals as a set of linguistic variables to which corresponds a set of possible linguistic values based on the fuzzy set. We consider, therefore, a set of interpretation's levels for these possible values to which corresponds a set of membership functions. We also propose a method to measure the similarity degree between different fuzzy linguistic variables for the partition of the semantic network in class of similar objects to make easy the diagnosis of the user's fuzzy queries.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Jun 2012 20:05:48 GMT  (102kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1061v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mohamed nazih omri", "mohamed ali mahjoub"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.1061"}, "pdf": {"name": "1206.1061.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Use of Fuzzy Sets in Semantic Nets for Providing On-Line Assistance to User of Technological Systems", "authors": [], "emails": ["*Nazih.Omri@ipeim.rnu.tn", "**MedAli.Mahjoub@ipeim.rnu.tn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: fuzzy set; linguistic variable; membership function; similarity; fuzzy semantic network"}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "Learning how to use a new technological system is mainly an explorative activity [2]. Research into learning has shown that it improves the skills that lead to successful error handling and discovery, and ultimately the construction of correct knowledge. However, the explorative activity often leads to experiences of uninterested states that do not achieve the interested state goal. [14] Users need help not only to avoid errors, but also to understand how the system interprets their commands [8, 9, 12]. In order to respond to a query, a leadership assistant could know very precisely what the user's goal is [14], what an object means in a particular state (the properties of the object being transformed). Furthermore, even with relatively well-defined goals, it is often necessary to think about higher-level objectives. The blurred set method was used to develop the \"online instructions\" of an intelligent assistance system. [3] You can be considered a supervisor for the execution of tasks that \"i\" and \"i\" (3) of the system are idealistic."}, {"heading": "2. Expert Semantic Net", "text": "The example of the technical system we are looking at here is the word processing software (Figure 1) with objects such as \"string\" and procedures such as \"cut\" or \"copy.\" For a beginner of the software, the list of standard names is not obvious, and he often wants to ask a knowledgeable operator how to perform an action, like \"rubbing letters.\" [4] The underlying psychological hypothesis is that targets are object properties and generators of object categories. Goals and procedures define the function of objects and the way they are used. As functional properties of objects, they enter into the construction of semantic networks as well as structural properties. We define a procedure as a sequence of operations whose execution serves to achieve a goal, and where the elements of the sequence are either primitive actions or sub-goals that require related procedures themselves."}, {"heading": "3. Linguistic variables and membership function", "text": "In the mathematical treatment of the linguistic variables, which aims to process some blurred conclusions by computer, a definition of the linguistic variables is necessary. In this context, we assign a function \u03bc to each value of the linguistic variables, the value varies between 0 and 1. While we hold the value of the classification in a certain number of blurred sentences, this represents the blurring process. In order to represent the different concepts of our system, we propose to consider the objectives (or objects) of the system as a set of linguistic variables."}, {"heading": "3.1. The levels of interpretation and its membership functions", "text": "So far, we have introduced a fine subdivision in which four or five values for the linguistic variable we manipulate form as many blurred sets as in Fig. 1. We have also defined five levels of interpretation, because it actually looks as if we have a problem with the natural distinction between the different levels at more than five levels, and less than five are not enough to have a good distinction. Our goal is to have a clearer idea of how a user's goal is interpreted in terms of the blurred knowledge bases. We can therefore distinguish five possible values for a given linguistic variable and therefore five member functions that correspond to the sets of values in Table 1. These values are determined by the expert and gradually adjusted by the system when a user's request is successfully identified."}, {"heading": "3.2. Definition of the fuzzy linguistic variables", "text": "We can distinguish five values: \"not _ true,\" \"little _ true,\" \"half _ true,\" \"rather _ true\" and \"quite _ true,\" which correspond to five fuzzy sets (fig. 1). Thus, CutWithKey of 0.25 belongs with a member factor \u03bc = 0.7 to the \"half _ true\" sentence and with \u03bc = 0.3 to the \"quite _ true\" sentence. We can explicitly write \u03bchalf _ true (CutWithKey = 0.25) = 0.7 and \u03bcquite _ true (CutWithKey = 0.25) = 0.3. We consider the member function of the verb to gum with regard to the expert Goal CutWithKey. Figs. 1 and 2 represent the result of the adaptation process. Thus, CutWithKey belongs to a member factor \u03bc = 0.7 to the \"half _ true\" and 0.4 (rubber."}, {"heading": "3.3.

This Semantic Networks is used to describe the knowledge of an \"ideal\" expert while fuzzy sets are used both to describe the approximate and uncertain knowledge of novice users who intervene to match fuzzy labels of a query with categories from an \"ideal\" expert. The technical system we consider is a word processor software, with Objects such as \u201cWord\u201d and Goals such as \u201cCut\u201d or \u201cCopy\u201d. We suggest to consider the set of the system's Goals as a set of linguistic variables to which corresponds a set of possible linguistic values based on the fuzzy set. We consider, therefore, a set of interpretation\u2019s levels for these possible values to which corresponds a set of membership functions. We also propose a method to measure the similarity degree between different fuzzy linguistic variables for the partition of the semantic network in class of similar objects to make easy the diagnosis of the user\u2019s fuzzy queries.", "creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word"}}}
