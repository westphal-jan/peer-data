In their Annual Review of Political Science study (2007), Chong and Druckman describe framing effects as such \"when (often small) changes in the presentation of a topic or event induce (sometimes large) changes in opinion\" (p. 104); as an example, they cite a study in which respondents respond differently when asked whether a hate group should be allowed to hold a rally, depending on whether the question was formulated as \"free expression\" or \"risk of violence.\" The origin of our work lies in a framing question motivated by a relatively topical political issue. In media coverage of transgenic plants and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food, GMO articles differ not only in terms of word choice, but in the assumption of a more \"scientific\" discourse, \"which means the inclusion of this potentially unsafe question and the question of adhesive?"}, {"heading": "1.2 Hedging as a sign of scientific discourse", "text": "In order to obtain a mathematically straightforward characterization of the \"scientific discourse,\" we probably turned to studies on the culture and language of science, a work that ranges from sociology to applied linguistics (Gilbert and Mulkay, 1984; Latour and Woolgar, 1979; Halliday and Martin, 1993; Bazerman, 1988; Fahnestock, 2004; Gross, 1990). One feature that has attracted quite a lot of attention in such studies is hedging (Myers, 1989; Lewin, 1998; Salager-Meyer, 2011; Hyland, pg. 1) defines hesitation as the expression of \"hesitation and possibility\" in communication, or, to put it another way, language that is \"fully committed to statements.\""}, {"heading": "1.3 Contributions", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want to do, and they are able to determine for themselves what they want to do."}, {"heading": "3 Data", "text": "To achieve the first step of our method outlined above, we first constructed a corpus of professors / pop scientists by extracting texts from the Web of Science for examples from the Prof sciences and LexisNexis for examples from the pop sciences, as described in Section 3.1. Our corpus is published online at https: / / confluence.cornell.edu / display / llresearch / HedgingFramingGMOs.As mentioned above, calculating the degree of hedging in the aforementioned corpus requires access to a hedge detection algorithm. We have taken a monitored approach, taking advantage of the availability of the CoNLL 2010 hedge detection training and assessment corpus described in Section 3.2."}, {"heading": "3.1 Prof-science/pop-science data: LEXIS and WOS", "text": "As already mentioned, a corpus of scientific and popular science papers is needed to determine whether hedges are more common in one or the other of these two writing styles. As our ultimate goal is to look at a discourse related to GMOs, we limit our attention to documents on the subject. Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WOS), a database of scientific journal and conference articles, was used as the source of professional scientific samples. We opted for abstracts rather than full scientific articles, because intuition suggests that the language in abstracts is higher level than in the papers and therefore more similar to the language one would see in a public debate on GMOs. To select thematic abstracts, we used the term \"transgenic food\" as a search term and discarded results containing any of a hand-picked list of non-thematic terms (e.g. \"mice\" or \"rats\")."}, {"heading": "3.2 CoNLL hedge-detection training data 8", "text": "As described in Farkas et al. (2010), the motivation behind the joint task of CoNLL 2010 is that \"the distinction between factual and uncertain information in texts is crucial for information extraction.\" Since \"detection of uncertainties is extremely important for the extraction of biomedical information,\" part of the data set consists of biological abstracts and complete articles from the BioScope corpus (bio). Meanwhile, Wikipedia editors have drawn the public's attention to specific markers of uncertainty known as weasel words.9: These are words or phrases \"intended to give the impression that something specific and significant has been said\" when in fact \"only a vague or ambiguous assertion or even a refutation has been transmitted.\" One example is \"It has been claimed that...\": the applicant has not been identified, so the source of the claim cannot be verified."}, {"heading": "3.3 Comparison", "text": "Although WOS and LEXIS differ in8http: / / www.inf.u-szeged.hu / rgai / conll2010st / 9http: / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Weasel, the average sentence length is similar, the average sentence length in bio is longer than in wiki. Articles in WOS are much more difficult to read than those in LEXIS by Flesch readability (Kincaid et al., 1975)."}, {"heading": "4 Hedging to distinguish scientific text: Initial annotation", "text": "As mentioned in Section 1, it is not clear from the outset whether hedging distinguishes between scientific texts or whether more hedges correspond to a \"scientific\" discourse. To get an initial sense of how common hedges are in WOS and LEXIS, we will comment on a sample of sentences from each in Section 4.1. In Section 4.1, we will explain the annotation policy of the CoNLL 2010 Shared Task and our own annotation method for WOS and LEXIS. Then, we will move on to Section 4.2 to compare the percentage of uncertain sentences in professional and pop science texts on this small hand-labeled sample and gain some evidence that there is indeed a difference in hedge occurrence rates, although surprisingly there seem to be more hedges in pop science texts. As a side benefit, we will then use the hand-labeled sample that we produce to examine the accuracy of an automatic hedge detector in the WOS + LEXIS domain; more on this in Section 5."}, {"heading": "4.1 Uncertainty annotation", "text": "CoNLL 2010 Shared Task Annotation Policy As described in Farkas et al. (2010, p. 4), the data annotation policies for the CoNLL 2010 Shared Task were as follows: \"Sentences containing at least one keyword were considered insecure, while sentences without a keyword were considered factual,\" with one keyword being a linguistic marker indicating uncertainty in the context. A simple example of a sentence that is \"insecure\" in the Shared Task raises the question of cystitis. \"The commented keywords are not necessarily general, especially in Wiki, where some of the tagged keywords are as specific as\" Schumann's best choral writing, \"\" people of Jewish tradition \"or\" certain leisure or cultural activities. \"It is noted that the\" uncertainty \"in the Shared Task Definition contains two formulations that lead to an animation that has said something important but what is really communicated is insecure.\""}, {"heading": "4.2 Percentages of uncertain sentences", "text": "As shown in Table 2, we observed a trend that contradicted previous studies. Uncertain sentences were more common in LEXIS than in WOS, although the difference between them was 10. We took steps to hide any explicit references to the source of individual sentences from commentators: the subset of authors who composed the comments were not the ones who collected the data, and the commentators were presented in random order.11 The last label was added due to some errors in scanning the data.Not statistically significant 12 (which is perhaps not surprising given the small sample size).The same trend was evident in the CoNLL dataset: Again, the percentage of uncertain sentences in bio (prof-science) articles was significantly lower than in wiki. However, to make a stronger argument about pro-science versus pop science, more comment is needed on the WOS and WLEXIS datasets."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "As outlined in Section 1, our proposal requires the development of an effective hedge detection algorithm. Our approach to the preparatory work described in this paper is to re-implement the Georgescul (2010) algorithm; the experimental results on the Bio + Wiki domain set out in Section 5.1 are encouraging; then we use this method to try to validate (on a larger scale than in our pilot manual comment) whether hedges can be used to distinguish between science and the popular scientific discourse on GMOs. Unfortunately, our results in Section 5.2 are inconclusive as our trained model has not been able to achieve satisfactory automatic detection accuracy of hedges on the WOS + LEXIS domain."}, {"heading": "5.1 Method", "text": "We adopted Georgescul's method (2010): Support Vector Machine Classification based on a Gaussian Radial Basis Kernel function (Vapnik, 1998; Fan et al., 2005), use of n-grams from annotated keywords as characteristics as described below. This method reached peak performance in the CoNLL 2010 Wikipedia recognition task (Farkas et al., 2010), and SVMs have proven effective for many different applications. We used the LIBSVM toolkit in our experiments 13.12 Continuous, \"statistical signature\" refers to the student t-tests with p < May 13http: / www.csie.edu.tw / cjlin / libsvm / As described in Section 3.2, there are two separate datasets in the CoNLL dataset. We experimented on it separately (Bio, Wiki)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Results on WOS+LEXIS", "text": "Next, we evaluated whether our best classifier could be generalized on the CoNLL dataset, in particular the WOS and the LEXIS corpus. Performance was measured on the 153 pages where our annotations were made, a dataset introduced in Section 4.1. Table 5 shows how the best models on Bio, Wiki and Bio + Wiki were each applied to the 153 labeled records. First, we can see that performance has deteriorated significantly compared to in-domain validation. Second, of the three different models, Bio showed the best performance, Bio + Wiki had the worst performance, and the combination of two datasets and keywords is a promising strategy."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and future work", "text": "In this position paper, we advocated that researchers apply the recognition of hedge funds not only to the classical motivation of problems in obtaining information, but also to questions of public opinion. Inspired by 16 average lengths of truly positive sentences: 28.6, false positive sentences 35.09, false negative sentences: 22.0. Previous studies in the social sciences, which refer to texts aimed at professional scientists, we proposed to address the issue with automatic detection of hedge funds as a first step. To develop a hedge fund, we used the CoNLL data set and a small annotated WOS and LEXIS data set. Our preliminary results show that there is a gap indicating that hedge funds do indeed distinguish between professional science and pop science documents."}, {"heading": "7 Appendix: pro- vs. anti-GMO dataset", "text": "Here we describe the pro-GMO data set that we collected in the hope that this data set could prove helpful for future research into the GMO debates, even though we did not use the corpus in the project described in this paper. The second step of our general approach outlined in the introduction is to examine whether the use of hedging in pro-GMO articles is consistent with our inferred \"scientific\" pattern of occurrence, more so than that in anti-GMO articles - requires a collection of opinion articles on GMOs. Our first attempt to use news articles (LEXIS) was unsatisfactory as we tried to maintain a neutral position in many articles, which led us to collect documents from more self-contained organisational portals such as Greenpeace (anti-GMO), Non-GMO Project (anti-GMO) or Why Biotechnology (pro-GMO)."}], "references": [{"title": "Shaping Written Knowledge: The Genre and Activity of the Experimental Article in Science", "author": ["Charles Bazerman"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Bazerman.,? \\Q1988\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bazerman.", "year": 1988}, {"title": "Vocabulary choice as an indicator of perspective", "author": ["Beata Beigman Klebanov", "Eyal Beigman", "Daniel Diermeier"], "venue": "In ACL Short Papers,", "citeRegEx": "Klebanov et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Klebanov et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Framing processes and social movements: An overview and assessment", "author": ["Robert D.

Prior work on the rhetoric and sociology of science suggests that hedging may distinguish popular-science text from text written by professional scientists for their colleagues. We propose a detailed approach to studying whether hedge detection can be used to understanding scientific framing in the GMO debates, and provide corpora to facilitate this study. Some of our preliminary analyses suggest that hedges occur less frequently in scientific discourse than in popular text, a finding that contradicts prior assertions in the literature. We hope that our initial work and data will encourage others to pursue this promising line of inquiry.
