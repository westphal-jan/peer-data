Introduction", "text": "Document Image Retrieval System (DIRS) based on keyword spotting performs the matching directly in the image data, bypassing OCR and using word images as a query. In DIRS [1], no weights are assigned to the extracted features and the weights for all features are one, although some features have a greater effect on the query. Feature weighting is a feature weighting algorithm that determines weights, not just rankings [14]. Frequently used feature weighting methods only take into account the distribution of a feature in the documents and do not take into account class information for the weights of the features. Several methods have been reported for feature weighting based on term frequency (TF) [16], reverse document frequency (IDF) [17]. In [15], a framework for integrating multiple, heterogeneous feature spaces into the kmeans clustering algorithm describes a method of weighting in this document."}, {"heading": "2. Related Works", "text": "In recent years, researchers have made a number of attempts to retrieve document images using word image. A detailed overview of the retrieval of document images up to 1997 can be found in Doermann [7]. An overview of the retrieval system of document images is presented in [10]. Attempts were made to perform word-level image comparisons and queries for printed documents [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13]. Leydier et al [8] used DIP techniques to create a sample dictionary for each document and then perform word comparisons by selecting the gradient angle feature and an appropriate algorithm. In previous work on Word Shape Coding, Li [5] used an alternative technique and a combination of feature descriptors for keyword weathering without the use of OCR. In [4] a novel, differential word image algorithm is designed for the use of word variants for word morphological descriptions in a language."}, {"heading": "3.

Overview of Feature Weighting For", "text": "The overall structure of the proposed system is shown in Figure 5 = q.The proposed system is designed to perform weighting characteristics based on the coefficient of multiple correlations. In fact, the main difference between this system and DIRS is the feature weighting and similarity measurement stage. In the feature evaluation stage, characteristics in the database are weighted according to their importance. In DIRS, no weights are assigned to the extracted characteristics and weights for all characteristics equally, although some characteristics have more effect on recovery. This method weighs each characteristic according to the different role of the characteristics during the indexing process. The next section describes this method in detail. 4.1 Feature weighting of the characteristics \u2212 kThe basic idea of feature weighting is inspired by the coefficient of multiple correlations. [2] Coefficient of multiple correlations can be used to describe the synthesized effects and correlations of each characteristic (s)."}, {"heading": "5.

Accuracy and retrieval values obtained are increased in Figure 5.As shown in Figure 6, by using coefficients of multiple correlations for weighting characteristics, the performance of DIRS in terms of average precision is increased and the notion of average retrieval is fixed.

Conclusions", "text": "In this paper we present the method of feature weighting in the document retrieval system. The proposed method uses the coefficient of several correlations for the weighting of each attribute. The purpose of this method is to increase the performance of the DIRS.
