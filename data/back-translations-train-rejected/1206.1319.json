Representing uncertain and imprecise information", "text": "Blur and randomness are two different components of blur. While blurred sentences are a rigorous blurring of random sentences, many operations defined in blurred logic lack a complete formalism and are not strongly supported by experimental evidence. On the other hand, blurred possibilist networks (CPN) or possibilist Bayesian networks associate an ultimately flexible inference mechanism based on principles of certainty or possibility distribution. [CPNs], however, suffer from the overwhelmingly large conditional possibility tables with discrete variables, namely Bayesian networks. [Fusion of continuous or crisp variables reduces the size of conditional security tables (in the case of certain networks in the witch, we use degrees of safety instead of possibility or probability) to practically acceptable levels, and these tables exhaustively encompass all intuitive and blurred rules of interference problems."}, {"heading": "3. Preliminary concepts", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. Fuzzy logic", "text": "Fuzzy set theory was first introduced by Zadeh [5]. In this theory, uncertainty has more to do with vague definitions of criteria than with randomness. Fuzzy set theory is based on a membership function \u00b5 (x), which describes the degree to which a certain statement is true [6]. For example, the statement \"Jhon is big\" can be more or less true. If we had a precise definition like \"Jhon is big if it is at least 1.75 in size,\" the membership function would only have values of 0 and 1, and fuzzy sets would not be required. Otherwise, the membership function could be for a fuzzy set: \u00b5\u00c2: X \u2192 [0, 1] And \u00b5\u00c2 (x) is interpreted as the degree of membership of element x in fuzzy sets for each x-X set."}, {"heading": "3.2. Possibilistic logic", "text": "Possibilistic logic [4] is a logic of uncertainty to argue with classical propositions among incomplete information and partially contradictory knowledge. Formulas of the necessarily estimated fragment of possible logic are derived from the form (\u0442, \u03b1) in which \u0439 is a classical formula (propositional formula or formula of first order) and \u03b1 [0,1] is understood as a lower limit to the degree of necessity. Let L be a finite propositional language. p; q; r;... denote propositional formulas. and vice versa they denote tautologies and contradictions."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Fuzzy Possibility and fuzzy Certainty distributions", "text": "The basic element of the possibility theory is the possibility distribution, which is an illustration of Q = Q = Q = Q = Q = Q (0.1) security. Formally, a possibility distribution is defined as: N = 0 means that the interpretation of p is impossible, and p = 1 means that nothing prevents the formula p from being the real world. [7] In the face of a possibility distribution, two different types of the order of precedence formulas of language are defined from this possibility distribution: p = 0 means that the interpretation of p is impossible, and p = 1 means that nothing prevents the formula p: \u2022 The possibility (or consistency) degree: p = max (number) of precedence formulas of language from being defined."}, {"heading": "4. Certain Knowledge bases: definitions and concepts", "text": "A certain formula (i.e. a possible formula) is a pair which is a classical closed formula of the first order and which is a positive number \u03b1 [0,1]. The correct part of a certain formula, i.e. the weight of the formula, is safe, i.e. to the extent that N is a necessary measure which models our possibly incomplete state of knowledge. Therefore, a certain knowledge base is defined as a set of weighted formulas. Formally, it is thus: (\u03b9, \u03b1i), i = 1.... m}, where \u03b9 is a meaningful formula and \u03b1i is the lower limit of necessity assigned to this formula (degree of safety)."}, {"heading": "4.1. Certain Bayesian networks (CBN)", "text": "A standard Bayesian network is a decomposition of a multivariate needs distribution by: N (A1,....., An) = mini = 1.. n (Ai | Parents (Ai)) (11), where Parents (Ai) is the group of parents of the variable Ai that is as small as safe by exploiting conditional dependencies of the type (9) and [10] above. Such a network is usually presented as a directed graph in which there is an edge from each of the parents to the conditional variable (Fig. 2). In our thesis, a particular Bayesian network is considered a graphical representation of uncertain information, providing an alternative to a probable causal network when numerical data is not available.Leave V = {A1, A2,..

CBN based on fuzzy necessity distribution", "text": "The logical formulas with a weight strictly greater than a certain level (lower limits of necessity degree of belonging) are immune to inconsistency and can certainly be used in deductive reasoning [11]. However, in order to conduct reasoning for both inaccurate and uncertain information, two important issues should be addressed. First, any improvement of the ability level for a piece of information can only be achieved at the expense of the specificity of the information; second, the recognized levels of causality explained in rules (case of fuzzy logic) and conditional dependencies (case of Bayesian networks) can be somewhat expensive due to the fact that this level of trust is somewhat critical. We propose to combine these three approaches (Bayesian networks, security distribution and fuzzy logic) to develop a method for uncertain and inaccurate knowledge representation that can improve decision systems. Our unclear beliefs are to measure a certain Bayesian necessity. For the simplicity, each has two conditions:"}, {"heading": "6. Transformation between FBN and FNB", "text": "Similarly, if the degree of the given necessities are blurred numbers as described in Section 5, the necessity distribution N (X) associated with a node X is considered as a blurred distribution defined by a membership function: [\u03b21, \u03b22] [0 1] [0 1] (18). Example: Consider the graph of Figure 3. () Each variable has two states here: the presence or absence of a unit, and we will define the same membership function as \u20ac. Let the different membership be as follows: \u00b5i () = ki1 x (\u03b2ij1) - ki2 x (- \u03b2ij2 | \u03b2ij2] Where: - \u00b5i () is the membership associated with the blurred variable that should be considered triangular. - ki1 and ki2 are the constant used in each membership function that should be considered triangular."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion and discussion", "text": "The present paper purported to be an attempt to partially demonstrate and understand the complexity of the world, which is increasingly observed, and was an attempt to contribute to its order and organization; the sophisticated approach combined the blurred logic and possible logic within a framework of causal networks, making it an efficient tool to model knowledge taking into account the expert's subjectivity, vagueness, and inaccuracy. Certain Bayesian networks with a blurred knowledge data approach naturally give us the substance of the evidence for each logical formula; although the methodology proposed in this paper aims and illustrates some typical examples, the techniques developed require experimental results; a future work is to expand this representation by defining efficient algorithms for local conclusions."}, {"heading": "8.
