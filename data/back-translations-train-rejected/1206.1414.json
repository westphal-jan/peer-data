Therefore, the application of intelligent systems can play an effective role in increasing the speed and improved quality of selection. In this paper, a system is introduced that attempts to trade with multi-agent systems and conduct negotiations between all agents. In this system, an intelligent agent is considered for each segment of the chain in which it is attempted to send orders and receive the response in the presence of the negotiation medium and communication with other agents. In this paper, it is explained how between agents, characteristics of multi-agents and standard registration medium of each agent in the environment is communicated.JADE (Java Application Development Environment) was used for the implementation and simulation of multi-agent cooperations.Keyword: Business-Commerce, Supply-Agents, SCADM,"}, {"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive on their own are not able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we tried to investigate and introduce their problems and shortcomings by examining the current methods of designing the supply chain and introducing a new model for chain-to-chain communication in supply chain management systems. In this model, which intelligent agents use for negotiation and decision-making in each chain, each actor can access the intended information within the chain and receive new information and insert information into other chains with movement between chains. Furthermore, this method avoids intensive management and, as required at different stages of the production routine, each actor can take responsibility for chain management and this management is continuously moved throughout the chain. Therefore, we find that the use of smart agents in the supply chain management system is more efficient than conventional supply chain management systems. The authors plan to continue their research on IASCCollaborationMobilityIntelligence Expert systems by using data mining methods in smart agents to improve decision-making."}], "references": [{"title": "Supply Chain Management \u2013 Strategy, Planning, and Operation, Upper Saddle River", "author": ["S.
