INTRODUCTION", "text": "With the development of computer systems and wireless communication, knowledge about the movement of mobile phones has come to the forefront. Although different mobile phones have differences in their movement behaviour and composition, predicting the next mobile phone is only possible on the basis of their own movement history. However, the imperfection of the movement sequences causes the movement sequences of mobile phones to change."}, {"heading": "2.

Similarity Measures for Euclidean Space", "text": "Measurements of similarity between Euclidean trajectory data and the referenced position of coordinates have been widely considered in various fields of research. Lin et al. [4] proposed a search method for similar trajectories by focusing on spatial shapes and comparing spatial shapes of moving object trajectories. Search algorithms based on the evaluation of OWD (disposable distance) in continuous and discrete cases of trajectories were developed. However, their search scheme OWD is time independent and based on Euclidean distance. Therefore, it is not appropriate to compare two trajectories in the cell space of wireless networks. Another method for measuring similarity between trajectories based on spatio-temporal representation was used by Zeinalipour-Yazti et al. [5] They proposed a distributed spatio-temporal similarity using the LCSS (longest subsequence)."}, {"heading": "2.2. Similarity Measures without Temporal Aspect", "text": "However, Jia-Ching Ying et. al. [9] proposed a new approach to measuring the semantic similarity between trajectories, namely the semantic trajectory pattern similarity (MSTP similarity). After transforming the geographical orbit set to the semantic trajectory data set, they used the sequential pattern mining algorithm Prefix-Span to break down the common semantic trajectory patterns known as semantic trajector patterns, and then used the longest common sequence (LCS) of two patterns to represent their longest common temporal unit and defined temporal coincidence."}, {"heading": "2.3.

A NEW SIMILARITY MEASURE FOR MOBILITY PATTERNS", "text": "Our new similarity re is a pair of patterns under the following conditions: (i) reflectivity: for all types of P (P = 0) we are simultaneously a reflection of Si ce and time. Intuitively, two mobility patterns are considered more similar in space if they share more common cells; patterns passing through the same cells at the same time must be considered more similar in time than the case in which they remained at different times. Consequently, the similarity between two mobility patterns based on two factors is taken into account: \u2022 The number of common cells in the two patterns is measured using the timestamps of the common cells. The former allows us to measure the spatial similarity. This sectoral takes into account the temporal similarity of two mobility patterns in time and space and then allows the use of weighted composition techniques for combining two such patterns.
