There are static systems that are characterised by the lack of auto-correction and the absence of changes in the exercises in the same learning unit. To present a course that meets the needs of teachers, correct text selection is required, which seems difficult due to the lack of tools that allow access to the texts according to desired criteria. \"Although text search appears to be a recurring task in language teaching, few tools seem to have been developed to allow teachers to access texts based on their problems\" (Loiseau et al., 2008) 1. Existing search mechanisms are based on a traditional search for keywords and this mechanism seems inefficient, requiring the indexing of an educational text to facilitate their search."}, {"heading": "2 State of the Art", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 History of ALAO", "text": "ALAO (Learning of Language Assisted by Computer) is an area of research and development that interests several disciplines in the field of cognitive science: linguistics (in the broadest sense including theoretical linguistics America, AppliedLanguage Teaching), computer linguistics informatique technology (especially artificial intelligence (AI)), psycholinguistics. 2What is often considered the first teaching machine is that developed by Sidney Pressey in the 1920s. It is merely an automated machine for correcting several decisions with four buttons (one per answer). When the student presses the right button, he switches to the next question. 3But the starting point of the EIAH (Environments for Human Learning) is programmed learning.

Unique is that it allows to consider the linguistic form not as a sequence of signs without interpretation, but as an element of a system with two levels (form and meaning).

This is the prism that creates the educational added value. For example, we look at the prism associated with the property \"text length,\" which we call plong. Text length can influence a teacher's decision to use it or not. According to our survey, most teachers, or rather the entirety, want an effective text, but with minimal length, so plong is a prism that makes it possible to know how many lines a text contains. To design a prism, we should define: the facet: it determines the value of the prism. The text: an input file from which we extract the information necessary to calculate the facet. CP: It is also necessary to calculate the facet. The output: it characterizes the value of the facet of the text from which the processing data must be given to a student."}, {"heading": "5.2 .2 Facet", "text": "The facet is the central unit: it represents the concepts on which the teachers \"reasoning is based. Therefore, there is an essential recursive relationship between prism and facet: a prism without facets is considered a mechanism, but not a prism. Facets exist only through the prism: without a mechanism to calculate them, it can be a property, but not a facet.
