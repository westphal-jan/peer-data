A temporal expression [7], also known as a timeframe, refers to any natural expression that characterizes a temporal entity, such as an interval or a period of time. Indeed, a phrase such as \"The Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti is very successful\" is a temporal expression. Timescales elude a link between the natural linguistic domain and the timeframe."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "The idea of annotating temporal expressions automatically from texts first appeared in 1998 [3]. This topic aroused increasing interest with the suggestion of an appropriate annotation scheme [12]. The original goal was to simplify the annotation phase in relation to the previous scheme in order to collect annotated data and use the temporal information to improve the performance of systems for answering questions [12]. All newer systems [19, 20] proposed for temporal expression tasks go through two different steps: identification and normalization. This dichotomy has been generally accepted by the research community because it makes the extraction phase easier in time [1]. In the identification phase, the effort focuses on how to properly recognize the sub-expressions, which are real temporal expressions in texts of natural language. This step is usually done using machine learning techniques. Ahn et al."}, {"heading": "3 Method", "text": "The contribution of my short taster project is twofold: First, I will illustrate a temporal body of expression explicitly designed for the normalization phase, and second, I will describe the software architecture of a new normalizer based on an existing one."}, {"heading": "3.1 Temporal expressions corpus", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to save themselves. < < < / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /"}, {"heading": "3.2 Temporal expressions normaliser", "text": "It is a rules-based normalizer that has been proven to provide the second-best performance in TempEval-2 Shared Task [17]. All rules are in the form of regular expressions in a switch architecture: Activating one of them precludes activating all others. I have introduced a top-level set of three new rules: extension, manipulation and post-manipulation rules http. Extension rules are just new rules that cover unexpected cases and are verified immediately before the pre-existing rules. If a temporal expression does not activate any of the expansion rules, it enters TRIOS. Some of these rules are used, for example, to normalize expressions of festivities, such as \"Thanksgiving Day\" or \"Saint Patrick's Day.\" The manipulation rules were introduced to turn certain known expressions into a simpler form before TRIOS processes them."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": "I evaluated the normalization system using the new corpus that was previously described as a training set, and then I measured the performance in relation to the TempEval-2 Shared Task Test Set. This gave me the opportunity to compare my normalizer with all the other people evaluated in this challenge. Therefore, a comparison between these systems is legitimate. In both cases, the evaluation process is based on counting. Since the normalization task aims to provide the right type attribute and the right value attribute, the evaluation is performed by counting how often the system delivers the same value in relation to human. It is important to stress that any value provided by the system that is different from human, annotation Dotation Dotation - Dotation is a human value."}, {"heading": "4.1 Results", "text": "The normalization results for the TempEval-2 Shared Task are shown in Table 3. The new TRIOS extension outperforms any system in normalizing value attributes and performs competitively in normalizing type attributes. The table already shows that normalizing value attributes is somewhat more difficult than normalizing type attributes. The extension of TRIOS outperformed the original system of 2.81% for type attributes and 9.13% for value attributes. I examined the original corpus ten times in a random sample (400 time expressions) and measured the performance with TRIOS and my extension. I performed a statistical analysis of the results and I demonstrated that the difference is statistically significant (Willcoxon test), respectively 0, 0586 and 0, 001621. The normalization results for the new corpus are shown in Table 4."}, {"heading": "4.2 Error analysis", "text": "The original TRIOS normalizer made 1023 value errors and 402 typos, while its extension made 779 and 323, respectively. By carefully analyzing the errors, I found many human annotations that at first glance seemed wrong. After analyzing the same annotations taking into account the entire sentence from which each expression was extracted, I found that the human annotations were indeed correct. Some examples are in Table 5. This leads to the conclusion that further improvements are only possible if I also take into account the resolution of anaphorical expressions. To achieve this, a larger window must be considered for each temporal expression, which at least takes into account the representation in which each temporal expression is located."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "I introduced a new rules-based normalizer of temporal expressions and showed that it performed better in terms of TempEval-2 shared task than the current state-of-the-art system. I also illustrated the corpus of temporal expressions for normalization and its purpose. I made both the normalizer and the corpus freely available online (GNU license)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Future work", "text": "The work presented in this report is the result of a preliminary study in the field of information extraction. The results presented in this report clearly demonstrate the need to deal with anaphorical temporal expressions in order to significantly improve the performance of the normalization phase. Currently, the normalization task only takes into account temporal expressions without considering a larger window, such as the whole sentence or a predefined number of words after and before the expression. This is necessary to cope with anaphorical expressions. My long-term goal is to develop novel techniques for extracting temporal expressions and use them in clinical settings.Due to the lack of occurring clinical data, I will investigate the use of semi-supervised machine learning approaches for the identification phase."}, {"heading": "5.2 Acknowledgements", "text": "I would like to thank Naushad UzZaman of the University of Rochester for sharing his normaliser with the scientific community, and I would also like to acknowledge the support of the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council in the form of a PhD scholarship."}], "references": [{"title": "Towards task-based temporal extraction and recognition", "author": ["D.
