This representation has a great practical interest due to the possibility to realize reasoning on classification with a fuzzy semantic network based system. For instance, the distinction between necessary, possible and user classes allows to take into account exceptions that may appear on fuzzy knowledge-base and facilitates integration of user's Objects in the base. This approach describes the theoretical aspects of the architecture of the whole experimental A.I. system we built in order to provide effective on-line assistance to users of new technological systems: the understanding of \"how it works\" and \"how to complete tasks\" from queries in quite natural languages. In our model, procedural semantic networks are used to describe the knowledge of an \"ideal\" expert while fuzzy sets are used both to describe the approximative and uncertain knowledge of novice users in fuzzy semantic networks which intervene to match fuzzy labels of a query with categories from our \"ideal\" expert.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Jun 2012 20:51:51 GMT  (78kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2347v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1206.1794"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1206.1794", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mohamed nazih omri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.2347"}, "pdf": {"name": "1206.2347.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Uncertain and Approximative Knowledge Representation to Reasoning on Classification with a Fuzzy Networks Based System", "authors": ["MOHAMED NAZIH Omri"], "emails": ["Nazih.Omri@ipeim.rnu.tn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Diagnosis of the wizard: \"Since you are using a text editor, you can only search for text files.

The example of the technical system we are looking at here is a word processing software with objects such as \"string\" and procedures such as \"cut\" or \"copy.\" For a beginner of the software, the list of default designations is not obvious, and he often wants to ask a knowledgeable operator how to perform an action, such as \"how to drive letters.\" In order to describe the knowledge of common sense, different types of relationships must be used.

Given a set of objects and a set of properties, we can built the binary relation composed by the set of all couples object-property for which the object holds the property. Such a binary relation may be presented a in two way table with objects in lines and properties in columns, checking cells structural properties of geometrical shapes are organised, we obtain the binary relation shown by the (figure 2), called the Hass diagram of the lattice. Several algorithms have been proposed to built the Galois lattice of a binary relation (Norris, 1978; Ganter, 1984; Bordat, 1986). This kind of lattices, and the Hasse diagram which is used to draw them, have severed to investigate categorization problems (Gu\u00e9noche & Van Mechelen, 1993; Storms, Van Mechelen & De Bocck, 1994). Figure (2) shows how the Galois lattice is used to formalize the class inclusion relation underlying data in table 1 by the mean of the double partial orders over: i - the set of objects, ii - the set of properties. The resulting structure is a two way lattices in which, when a set of objects A includes a set of objects B, the set of properties of the objects in A are included into the set of properties of the objects in B, and vice versa.

This representation has a great practical interest due to the possibility to realize reasoning on classification with a fuzzy semantic network based system. For instance, the distinction between necessary, possible and user classes allows to take into account exceptions that may appear on fuzzy knowledge-base and facilitates integration of user's Objects in the base. This approach describes the theoretical aspects of the architecture of the whole experimental A.I. system we built in order to provide effective on-line assistance to users of new technological systems: the understanding of \"how it works\" and \"how to complete tasks\" from queries in quite natural languages. In our model, procedural semantic networks are used to describe the knowledge of an \"ideal\" expert while fuzzy sets are used both to describe the approximative and uncertain knowledge of novice users in fuzzy semantic networks which intervene to match fuzzy labels of a query with categories from our \"ideal\" expert.", "creator": "PDFCreator Version 1.0.2"}}}
