It works by iteratively passing through two phases: the first (lines 6-17) is a rationalization phase in which for each decision the algorithm tries to determine that it is motivated, i.e., at least one rationing pattern holds for it. Unmotivated decision nodes are those in which every action taken has no effect on decision-making, and these decisions are removed by random nodes with uniform conditional probability distributions and any edges that come to them. The second phase (lines 18-20) is a marginal phase in which no impact on the decision of the decision-maker."}, {"heading": "3.1 Proof of correctness", "text": "/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /"}, {"heading": "3.2 Algorithm Complexity", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to be able to be able to be able to be, and that they will be able to be able to be able to be able to move."}, {"heading": "4 AN EXAMPLE", "text": "Consider the game A, which can be either high (H), medium (M) or low (L.

("}, {"heading": "6 DISCUSSION", "text": "The algorithm presented in this paper uses the adoption of well-differentiated (WD) strategies to simplify a game in order to calculate a Nash balance. Although this is a reasonable assumption for computer agents, it is not clear whether humans generally condition their actions only on the basis of observations that have an impact on their usefulness, or if they otherwise take irrelevant signals to heart. We plan to investigate these experimentally. Another limitation of our algorithm is that it uses strictly graphical properties to detect and remove unmotivated nodes. Although this greatly simplifies the process and keeps it computationally efficient, a more rigorous examination of the parameters within random and utility nodes could lead to further simplifications. For example, it could be the case that a signal-logical thought pattern keeps graphical, but the parameters of the MAID are such that the first agent (Alice) always optimally decides on a particular action for all possible values as a response."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK", "text": "We have presented an algorithm for identifying reasoning patterns in games. It can be used in two ways: first, it can identify unmotivated decisions in a MAID diagram; these can be effectively ignored to calculate a Nash balance that can sometimes lead to significant computational savings; second, it can detect non-obvious patterns of thought agents that could be used in decision-making; these patterns can be presented to a human decision maker to help him or her make good decisions; and it can be used as input for other algorithms to dissect, analyze, explain, or even predict agents or human behavior. We believe that in complex systems, especially those where human and computer agents interact strongly, it is important for successful agents to model the \"context\" of their interaction. Certain features of games are likely to provoke different motivations in human behavior, such as reciprocity or cooperation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The research reported in this paper was partially supported by AFOSR-MURI grant FA9550-05-1-0321."}], "references": [{"title": "25", "author": ["Ben Blum", "Christian R.
