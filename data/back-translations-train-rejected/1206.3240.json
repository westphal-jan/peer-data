A graphical model (Lauritzen, 1996) is a collection of random variables indexed by the vertices of a graph; each vertex v \u00b2 V corresponds to a random variable xv, and where for each A \u00b2 V, xA = {xv \u00b2 A}. We assume that each of the variables xv is discretely evaluated with the cardinality q. Of interest in this paper are distributions that according to a graph G = (V, E) are considered as follows: p (xV) = 1Z (D)."}, {"heading": "2.2 UNIFORM VS. NON-UNIFORM ALGORITHMS", "text": "The classical conception of algorithms refers to \"uniform algorithms,\" in which one has a single algorithm that works for all input lengths. An \"unequal algorithm,\" on the other hand, refers to a family of algorithms, one for each input length. A different way of thinking about such unequal algorithms is that the algorithm is allowed to receive any oracle advice that only depends on the input length (but not on the actual input length). In the theory of calculation literature, such \"unequal algorithms\" are usually referred to as \"fixed-input circuits,\" in which a different circuit is used for each input length. Class P is the class of problems with polynomial simultaneous algorithms, while P / Poly is their unequal counterpart, i.e. the class of problems that have polynomically identical algorithms (circuits)."}, {"heading": "2.3 GRAPH TREEWIDTH", "text": "A graph is called triangulated if each cycle of more than three lengths contains an edge between two non-adjacent vertices. The tree width of a general graph is defined tw (G) = min H G, H triangulates tw (H).Here, H G shows that H is a supergraph of G. In words, the tree width of a graph G is the minimum over the tree width of all triangulated supergraphs of G. Figure 1 shows an example of a non-triangulated graph G showing a 4 cycle without an edge connection between non-adjacent vertices. Graph H is a triangulated supergraph of G and has a tree width of 3, since the largest clique is {2, 5, 6, 8}."}, {"heading": "2.4 GRAPH MINORS", "text": "The Minor graph theory plays a key role in our analysis. Specifically, in Section 2.4.1, we show that the complexity of the conclusion in a minor of G in 1994 is limited by the complexity of the conclusion in G. A minor of a graph is achieved by each sequence of the following operations: \u2022 Vertex Deletion: Faced with a graph (V, E), a vertex v, an edge E is deleted, like all edges Ev = {E} incident to v to get the graph (V\\ V, E\\ Ev). \u2022 Edge Deletion: Faced with a graph (V, E), an edge E is deleted to get the graph (V, E\\ E)."}, {"heading": "2.4.1 Inference and graph minors", "text": "Let M (G, q) point to the set of all possible options for potential functions at the vertices and edges of G (V, E), with the variables having maximum cardinality q. That is, any set of possible options for potential functions at the vertices and edges of G (V, E), with the variables having maximum cardinality q. Let H be specified as minor of a graph G on inference in G.Lemma 2.3. Let H be minor of G, and let them be minor of G (H, q). There is a group of G (G, q), so that Z (H) can be calculated as minor of a graph G on inference in G.Lemma 2.3. Let H be minor of G and the sequence of minor operations that G has in H.Proof. All we need to show that a graph = (H, delegated) becomes EG, EG, EG, EG."}, {"heading": "3 PROBLEM STATEMENT", "text": "Let Tf (I) calculate the runtime of an algorithm f to Input I. We consider conclusions that are input a graph G = (V, E) and an element of M (G, q) (i.e., potentials defined in relation to the indentations and edges of G), and calculate the partition function Z (n). We would like to examine the effects of the treewidth tw (G) of the diagram G on the required runtime of all inference algorithms to examine the worst case or the maximum runtime of an algorithm across all inputs. Since Inference in a graphical model is NP-hard and assumes that NP 6 = P, we know that the worst runtime of any inference algorithm must be scaled with the size of the graph. This is the maximum runtime across all graphs."}, {"heading": "4 CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION", "text": "The problem is to identify a configuration of variables that satisfy all constraints (i.e., find a satisfactory mapping).We will consider CSP as a decision problem - the problem of deciding whether such a satisfactory mapping exists. We will mostly deal with 2-CSPs where each constraint contains only two variables.You can associate a chart with an instance of 2-CSP that represents the variables and edges that exist only between these linkages.A related problem is the MAX CSP, in which you are interested in the configurations of variables that represent the number of satisfied problems."}, {"heading": "5 MAIN RESULTS", "text": "In this section we present our most important results for graphical models with binary weighted variables."}, {"heading": "5.1 EXACT INFERENCE", "text": "So it is not that there is the worst runtime from f to Gk (i.e, T (k) = max.M (Gk) Tfk (Gk) Tfk (Gk))) with binary variables. (a) The assumption that NP 6 (P / poly) and that the gridminor hypothesis holds, T (k) is super polynomial. Hence, \u03b2f (k) as defined in (3) is super-polynomial with reference to k. (b) The assumption that GM (g) = O (g r) in the gridminor hypothesis."}, {"heading": "5.2 APPROXIMATE INFERENCE", "text": "The above results show that an exact inference is insoluble in any class of graphs with unlimited tree width. At this point, we prove that even achieving an approximation within an additive constant to the partition function is insoluble. Our result uses Lemma 4.4 together with the fact that the planar # 2-SAT # P is complete (Vadhan, 2001).Theorem 5.3. Suppose that the Grid-Minor hypothesis is correct. Suppose f is an arbitrary (randomized) approximate inference algorithm working on graphical models with binary variables."}, {"heading": "Z\u0302 such that", "text": "If \u03b2\u03b5f (k) is a polynomial in k, 1 \u03b5 and log (1\u03b4), as defined in (4), then NP P / poly.Proof. Unless NP P / poly is not random, there is no non-uniform method that can approximate the solution of a # P-complete problem to a constant c with a probability greater than 1 \u2212 \u03b4, which is polynomial in the size of the problem, c, and log (1\u03b4) polynomial (Vazirani, 2004). Based on Lemma 4.4, we have found that instances of planar # 2-SAT can be reduced to performing an inference in a model defined on a planar diagram so that the number of solutions bz (N) c is equal. Using the fact that planar # 2-SAT # P is complete, this result can be proved by following the same line of analysis adopted in the proof of Theem 5.1."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "With increasing interest in understanding different inference methods and providing conditions under which they are correct and comprehensible, it is important to understand whether there could actually be a structural property that can guarantee a comprehensible conclusion in addition to tree width. In this paper, we have examined, presented and discussed the relevant literature from the CSP community, as well as relevant concepts of graph theory, and can conclude that such an alternative property is not likely - finding a property that ensures the traceability of the conclusion without limiting tree width would mean providing a counter-example to Robertson's and Seymour Grid-Minor hypothesis. Nevertheless, it would be of great interest to prove the results in this paper without resorting to the Grid-Minor hypothesis. It would also be useful to obtain hardness results that apply to even the \"simplest\" high-tree width graph structures. Nevertheless, it would be of great interest to prove the results in this hypothesis without resorting to the Minor."}, {"heading": "Chertkov, M., & Chernyak, V. Y. (2006).
