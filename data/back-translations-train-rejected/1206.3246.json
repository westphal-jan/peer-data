Explicitly, links to a random node indicate the likely dependence of the node on its parents; links to a decision node indicate what information is available to make such a decision, and links to usage nodes represent that a benefit to these parents cannot be considered (utility nodes may not have children). Associated to each node, there are some parameters: A random node has a related categorical variable utility C with limited usage."}, {"heading": "3 CREDAL NETWORKS", "text": "We need some concepts of denominational networks before we present the reformulation to solve the strategy selection. A convexic series of denominational distributions is called denominational quantity [4]. A denominational quantity for X is called K (X); we assume that each denominational variable is categorical and that each denominational quantity has a finite number of deepenings (A). A denominational quantity K (X) and an event A, the upper and lower probability of A are each maxp (X) p (A) and minp (X). A denominational denominational quantity is a series of denominational distributions achieved by applying the Bayes rule to each denominational distribution in a denominational quantity of common distributions. A (separately specified) denominational networks are a set of denominational distributions achieved by applying the Bayes rule to each denominational distribution in a denominational quantity of common distributions."}, {"heading": "3.1 INFERENCE", "text": "A marginal conclusion in a credal network is the calculation of the upper (or lower) probabilities in an extension of the network. If Xq is a query variable, then a marginal conclusion is the calculation of narrow limits1 We note that other concepts of independence can be found in the literature [3, 10].for p (xq) for one or more categories xq of Xq. For conclusions in strong extensions, it is known that distributions that maximize p (xq) belong to the vertices of the extension [12]. Therefore, a conclusion can be generated by combinatorial optimization, since we need to find a vertex for each local credale set K (Xi | \u03c0 (Xi) so that the expression (2) results in a maximum p (xq). In general, inference presents enormous computational challenges, and exact inference algorithms that exhibit serious difficulties on the degeneration of all potential vertices."}, {"heading": "4 STRATEGY SELECTION AS A CREDAL NET INFERENCE", "text": "Let's assume this transformation resembles the proposal of Cooper [2].

First, we use randomly generated influence diagrams to compare the solutions of our method (which we call CR for credal reformulation) against the Single Policy Updating (SPU) of Lauritzen and Nilsson [15]. Later, we work with a practical EBO military planning problem and compare the method against the factorization of Zhang and Ji [22].4With regard to random influence diagrams, we have generated a data set based on the total number of nodes and the number of decision nodes. The selected configurations are presented in the first two columns of Table 1. We have from 10 to 120 nodes where 3 to 35 decision nodes are. The number of supply nodes is chosen equal to the number of decision nodes. Each row in Table 1 contains the average result for 30 randomly generated diagrams within this configuration."}, {"heading": "5.1 EBO MILITARY PLANNING", "text": "In this section we describe the performance of our method in a hypothetical effects-based operations planning problem [11]. An influence diagram similar to the model described by Zhang and Ji [22] is used. Its graphics are shown in Figure 2. The goal is to win a war, which is represented by the hypothesis Node (at the top of Figure 2). Only below there are the subgoals Air superiority, Territorial Occupation and Commander surrender, which are directly related to the main objective. There are eleven decisions (represented by rectangles): destroy C2 stands for command and control), destroy radars, destroy communications, destroy storage destroy destroy assembly, destroy assemble destroy, capture board, use special forces."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we discuss a new idea for strategy selection in the influence diagrams. We work with the Limited Memory Influence Diagram as it generalizes many of the suggestions for influence diagrams. The main contribution is the reformulation of the problem as a creative network inference that enables us to find the global maximum strategy for small and medium influence diagrams. Experiments suggest that many cases can be dealt with accurately. As far as we know, no in-depth investigation of exact procedures has been conducted for this class of diagrams. Due to the characteristics of our method, a solution is available at all times with a maximum guaranteed error during calculations. It is clear that large diagrams need to be dealt with roughly. Nevertheless, our method has yielded results in the experiments carried out that exceed existing algorithms. Although more time is spent, many situations require a solution to be as good as possible while time is a secondary issue. The ability of our approach to set an upper limit for the problem is likewise not more valuable to the result with the U."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The work described in this paper is partially supported by the US Army Research Office Scholarship W911NF0610331."}], "references": [{"title": "Decision-theoretic specification of credal networks: A unified language for uncertain modeling with sets of Bayesian networks", "author": ["A.
