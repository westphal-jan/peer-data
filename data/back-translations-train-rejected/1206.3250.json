(...) The main problems for scientists are that they use the tools of investigation that distinguish them. (...) Even in the fields of research in which they are researching this problem, the different model structures are appropriate. (...) The main problem for scientists is that they justify and justify these assumptions. \"(...)"}, {"heading": "1.1 BACKGROUND", "text": "Traditionally, causal discovery algorithms have been divided into two categories: Constraint based and Score based algorithms. Score based algorithms, such as the GESalgorithm (Chickering 2002), calculate a score for each model taking into account the measured data. The model with the highest score is then considered the most likely or plausible model taking into account the data. In contrast, constraint based algorithms (e.g. the PC algorithm (Spirtes et al. 2000) are tested for certain constraints in the measured data and models that correspond to the detected constraints are selected. Independence constraints are most often used, but many other constraints can also be factored.Without further assumptions (such as time order, non-Gaussian errors, etc.), both types of search algorithms are asymptotically limited to the discovery of OMEs or MMEs of causal structures."}, {"heading": "1.2 CLASSES OF HYPOTHESES", "text": "A knowledge graph is a mixed graph over a set of vertices V, so that two vertices are connected by exactly one of the following vertices: direct cause: A directed edge represents the knowledge that an undirected edge, the beginning, is a direct cause of the other, the end (relative to V): X Y / / non-adjacence: The absence of an edge represents the knowledge that neither a vertice nor a vertice is a direct cause of the other: X Yadjacency: An undirected edge represents the knowledge that there is a direct causal link between the two vertices, but a difference between the two vertices going in one direction: X Ysemi-directed edge from a vertice to a vertice."}, {"heading": "1.3 EXAMPLE", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules that they play by the rules, and they will be able to play by the rules that they play by the rules."}, {"heading": "2 THEORY", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of them are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves, and that they are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

Since the space of DAGs is very exponential, we are dealing with a number of variables for which there is no obvious clue as to how to generate a reasonable graph that is very similar (and indeed quite small). Also, if we just randomly select from the space of all possible variables, we get a sample of graphs that are very similar."}, {"heading": "5 DISCUSSION", "text": "The difficulty in specifying a certain number of experiments given to an OME when only individual (or very few) interventions are allowed per experiment is due to the interdependence of two adjacent edges. For example, if we know from passive observation that the OME is a chain of undirected edges, we know that this chain cannot contain vstructures, since it could contain a common cause in any vertex (except the ends)."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "We have provided an algorithm for calculating intervention sets based on the qualitative structural limitations of hypotheses spaces, which can be represented by knowledge diagrams. Knowledge diagrams provide a concise representation of hypotheses that characterize the underdetermination of causal structures from passive observation data (observing Markov equivalence classes) and subdeterminations based on experiment sequences. We suspect that the number of experiments that are sufficient and, at worst, necessary to discover the true causal structure in an OME is a function of the largest undirected clique in the OME, and we have shown why this assumption cannot be generalized to all knowledge diagrams. In simulations, we have shown that our OPTINTER algorithm determines intervention sets that generate experiment sequences that satisfy the assumption. As a result, we have a search method that is adaptive and therefore much more efficient than the number of experiments that are actually (the) the worst in the case."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "I am very grateful to Oleg Pikhurko for bringing Folkman's theorem to my attention, which was funded by a scholarship from the James S.
