[21] For example, adaptive interfaces are crucial because different users require different functionalities of multi-purpose software to identify and master different software functions [16]. In the latter case, however, a system should ideally adjust the way it interacts and the decision to interact with a user [15] to take specific user preferences into account. In this paper, we focus on interface customizations where the attributes of interface widgets (e.g. location, transparency and functionality) are automatically tailored to the needs of specific users. In particular, we are interested in intelligent systems that learn to predict user goals over time and suggest ways (e.g. by customizing the user interface)."}, {"heading": "2 The Customization Domain", "text": "We are interested in developing intelligent systems that perform customization of online user interfaces based on user preferences and needs. We are focusing on a concrete form of customization as an example to illustrate our approach, but note that the general principles are broader. We are using this area and this application to motivate the need for customization of user interfaces and to highlight the difficulties with standard survey methods. Our main contributions will be discussed in sections 4 and 5, but they will be more comprehensive than the task under consideration here."}, {"heading": "2.1 The Highlighting Task", "text": "Consider a user who writes slides in PowerPoint who wants to highlight important phrases and new terminology by stylizing a particular font. For aesthetic reasons, the user tends to choose from only a few highlighting styles that are consistent throughout a presentation and possibly across multiple presentations. This consistency provides an intelligent system with the ability to observe and learn custom patterns so that it can make useful suggestions in the future. Figure 1 shows an example toolbar of 10 symbols, each of which suggests a specific set of font characteristics that can be applied to \"patiently\" highlight the selected phrase. Many repetitive tasks in PowerPoint and other programs can benefit from automated suggestions designed to minimize user effort. We assume that the user has a specific style in mind when performing a highlighting task, where some font characteristics need to be changed to set them apart from the rest of the text."}, {"heading": "2.2 Predictive Model & Assistance Decisions", "text": "Intuitively, the value of highlighting suggestions depends on the amount of savings it offers compared to completing tasks manually. There are also costs associated with suggestions: interruption, processing costs, mode switching, etc. We will discuss the relative value and cost of a number of suggestions in the toolbar below. Note, however, that the value of a suggestion cannot be known with certainty: the system can only make a stochastic prediction of the actual intended goal of the user. These predictions must be weighed (or not) against the total cost and benefits of a suggestion. While our goal is not to discuss predictive models, we will provide a sketch of our system model to place our survey results in the appropriate context. We will specifically focus on highlighting goals in which the user wishes to anticipate a particular style (combination of font attributes). The system will take into account past user events and learn user-specific PODP timing (Decision Points) that can be generated in a target library."}, {"heading": "2.3 The Value and Costs of Suggestions", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "3 Preference Elicitation", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "4 Experiential Elicitation", "text": "To facilitate the interpretation of bound queries, we are developing an experimental version of bound queries that allows the user to \"experience\" both query options (including stochastic ones) before specifying a preference, asking the user to perform k simple tasks with the system in two ways: The SG (p) option shows o 'in fractions of p of k tasks and o' in the remaining tasks (in random order), thus \"experiencing\" a stochastic mix of interfaces. The deterministic option also requires k tasks to be completed, but all using the same interface oi. After each option, the user is asked to think about what he liked about the experience and what he didn't like - which is a function of the effort required for the tasks, the cost of \"processing\" the toolbar, the satisfaction that help is available in the toolbar, or the simplicity of the interaction - and to indicate his preference."}, {"heading": "4.1 Experiential Elicitation for Interfaces", "text": "To reduce cognitive stress and experiment time, we only elicit U (N, L, Q) for the values Q, 0, 2, 4, L, 1, 5, 10 and N, 1, 1. This discretization results in a range of 18 results. Similarly, we discredit perverse probabilities: [0, 0.1, 0.2,..., 1.0]. We define o = n0, l1, q4 because the user is at a low level of need and receives the best possible help, ando = n1, l10, q0 because the user is at a high level of need and receives the worst help. If the system proposes a toolbar, the user can select or ignore an icon if the task shown in Figure 1 is completely ignored and the additional font does not need to be executed."}, {"heading": "4.2 Conceptual vs. Experiential Elicitation", "text": "We compared experimental and conceptual queries experimentally to examine their impact on the meaningfulness of the queries according to several criteria: the efficiency (duration) of the procedure; the cognitive demand imposed on users; the interpretation or comprehensibility of the queries by the user; and the quality of the triggered responses. In particular, we compare the triggered utilities quantitatively under these two conditions and test whether users perceive these simple utilities under conceptual expressions as well as those under experimental expressions (our zero hypothesis, H0), we also look at the general structure of U (N, L, Q) to see whether users perceive a value in such simple help and whether trends exist in the entire user population. In addition to verbal descriptions, we used screenshots to represent each result in the conceptual condition. Thirteen people participated in the conceptual condition and eight people in the experiential group we define to define the target group to control the condition we define."}, {"heading": "5 Ways to Improve the Experiential Elicitation Procedure", "text": "Although experience enables users to formulate more realistic preferences, the process is time-consuming (even with simple terms of use over 18 out-4The T 2 distribution is a multivariate analogy to the Student T distribution).We have used the pseudo-inverse in the calculation of T 2.5A scores to determine how far apart the two keywords are. We are developing two more efficient selection procedures based on the results of Section 4.2. We present two procedures that we have primitized and primitized to highlight the benefits of online customizing - even for offline development of models that are too demanding."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "Traditional approaches to benefit evaluation do not seem to be effective in assessing user preferences for user interface customization and adaptive help design, largely due to the lack of experience evaluation. We have proposed a new, experiential solution method that is well suited to these and related tasks. Our results show that experiential solutions have several advantages, including: simplicity of management from the researcher's perspective; understanding the results from the user's perspective; and helping users appreciate the sequential nature of interaction, which is often overlooked in traditional \"conceptual\" solutions. We have also developed the primed + process to accelerate experiential solutions while retaining most of their benefits. In this paper, we focus on discovering a benefit function with three attributes of savings and processing costs in the context of user interface customization. Generally, the benefit function of a user may include different customization actions depending on the attributes."}], "references": [{"title": "Bayesian models for keyhole plan recognition in an adventure game", "author": ["D.
