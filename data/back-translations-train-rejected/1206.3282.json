With the probability q, a random mass atom of this clause is selected and its state reversed. With the probability 1 \u2212 q, the mass atom that causes the greatest increase in the total weight s (y, x) when turning over is selected to flip.

However, in this step the paradigm of Statistical Relational Learning comes into play. In a (meaningful) Markov network we do not have descriptions of higher order of its characteristics. To perform separations then means to evaluate all characteristics of the network. However, in the Markov logic we can do it better. There are two cases to consider: If we have to find assignments c with f\u03c6c (y, x) = 0, i.e. foundations for which y, x? [v / c] is wrong. Accordingly, we have to find w < 0 c for which y, x? [v / c] is true."}, {"heading": "4.3 RELATED WORK", "text": "We can either use it to address ILP problems by solving their LP relaxation and, if the solution is fractional, create additional constraints. Alternatively, we could formulate this problem as an instance of theory testing, but all axioms are grounded atoms and we are looking for all the fundamentals the formula applies to - database technology is optimized for this setting. The holistic solution is known to meet. Or we can use it to solve problems with a large number of constraints, such as ILP formulations of the Travelling Salesman Problem [Dantzig et al., 1954], without including them all. Our work follows previous research in the MAP Inference [Riedel and Clarke, 2006, Anguelov et al., 2004, Tromble and Eisner, 2006, Sontag and Jaakkola, 2007], where cutting plans are used to avoid all constraints in advance."}, {"heading": "5 EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In both cases, we want to investigate how CPI affects the runtime and accuracy of two base solvers: MWS and ILP.

While Cutting Planes have already been used for specific MAP inference problems, this work shows how they can be generalized and integrated into a framework for statistical relative learning in which they are automatically available for a wide range of tasks. Essentially, our method serves as a meta algorithm that switches between first-order deterministic query processing on the one hand and numerical optimization of sub-problems on the other. We evaluated the proposed algorithm using two real tasks for which we have shown MWS to work poorly: Joint Entity Resolution and Semantic Role Labeling. In both cases, CPI makes an exact method (P) more efficient, while remaining both faster and more accurate than a pre-sewing method."}], "references": [{"title": "The correlated correspondence algorithm for unsupervised registration of nonrigid surfaces", "author": ["D.
