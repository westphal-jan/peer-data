Although, xn} is defined as follows: There is a graph G = (V, E) with n branches and potentials for all edges ij \u00b2 E, we define the functionality f (x; \u03b8) = [E]. The MAP problem can be formulated as a linear program as follows: There is a vector of marginal probabilities comprising {\u00b5ij), ij \u00b2 E via variables corresponding to the edges and {\u00b5i). The MAP problem can be formulated as a linear program as follows."}, {"heading": "2.1 Choosing Clusters in the LP Relaxation", "text": "The choice of clusters should therefore be guided both by how much we are able to limit the marginal polytopic and by the computational costs of dealing with larger clusters. We will ideally not use a specific scenario in which the clusters are selected from a predefined set of possible clusters. In other words, we do not want to use the subset of clusters that will give us the best possible approach to a particular MAP problem, but rather add them gradually on the basis of some ranking criteria. In other words, we want to choose the subset of clusters that will give us the best possible approach to a particular MAP problem. We try to iteratively improve the approximation by using our current beliefs to guide the clusters. The advantage of iterative cluster selection is that we only add them up to the point where the relaxed LP has a holistic problem."}, {"heading": "3 Dual LP Relaxation", "text": "Different formulations of the original LP have led to different dual LPs, each of which has efficient message-passing algorithms to solve them [3, 6, 13, 15]. In this article, we focus on a specific dual formulation by Globerson and Jaakkola [3], which has the advantage that the message-passing algorithm corresponds to the coordinate parentage in the dual LP. Our dual algorithm will address many of the problems inherent in the original approaches, offering us: 1. Monoton decreasing upper limits on MAP.2. Selection of clusters that guarantee limited improvements.3. Simple \"warm start\" for tighter relaxation. 4. An efficient algorithm that scales to very big problems."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Generalized MPLP Algorithm", "text": "The generalized Max Product LP (MPLP) message passing algorithm introduced in [3] reduces the dual objective of cluster-based LP relaxation in each iteration. Rather, this monotonous property makes it ideal for adding clusters, since we can initialize the new messages in such a way that the dual value is monotonously lowered.Another key advantage of working in the dual LP is that the dual target gives us a certificate of optimality. Namely, if we find an association x that f (x; \u03b8) is equal to the dual target, it is guaranteed that x is the MAP assignment (since the dual objective cap limits the MAP value).In fact, with this property, we show in our experiments that MAP assignments can be found for almost all the problems we are looking at. Next, we describe the generalized MPLP algorithm for the specific case of clusters consisting of three nodes."}, {"heading": "3.2 Choosing Clusters in the Dual LP Relaxation", "text": "In this section, we provide a very simple procedure that allows you to add clusters to MPLP while simultaneously initializing all messages to zero in our experiments. Algorithmic properties at the beginning of Section 3.Suppose we have a set of triplet clusters C and now want to add a new triplet group. Let's label the messages before we add the new triplet group to zero. Of course, there are two questions. The first is: Suppose we decide to add a given triplet group, how do we set this triplet group so that the dual target maintains its previous value; the second question is how to choose the new triplet group to add; the initialization problem is straightforward; simply set a triplet group + 1 to equal."}, {"heading": "3.3 The Dual Algorithm", "text": "This year, we will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put ourselves in a position, to put ourselves in a position, to put ourselves in a position, to put ourselves in a position, to put ourselves in a position, to put ourselves in a position, to put ourselves in a position, to put ourselves in a position, to put ourselves in the position we are in."}, {"heading": "4 Related Work", "text": "Since MPLP is closely related to the Max-product generalized amount propagation (GBP) algorithm, our work can be considered a Max-pursuit method for GBP. This is closely related to the work of Welling [16], who proposed a Region-pursuit method for GBP. Similar to our work, he proposed greedily adding potential clusters from a candidate set. At each iteration, the cluster leading to the greatest change in GBP-free energy was added. He showed excellent results for 2D grids, but with fully connected diagrams, performance actually began to deteriorate with additional clusters. In [17], a heuristic relationship to maximum normality [19] was used as a stop criterion for region tracking to avoid this behavior. In contrast, since we work with the dual function of the LP, we can guarantee monotonal improvements throughout the course of the algorithm."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "Due to the scalability of our message-passing algorithm, we can apply it to cases where standard LP solvers cannot be applied to the original LP (see also [18]). At this point, we report on applications for problems of computer biology and machine vision.4We use the algorithm from Section 3.3 for all our experiments. We first run MPLP with edge clusters up to convergence or for a maximum of 1000 iterations, whichever comes first. All of our experiments, with the exception of those intended to show the difference between schedules, use N = 20 for the number of MPLP iterations executed after adding a cluster. As we run MPLP, we use the messages to decipher a holistic solution, and compare 4Graphical models for these in [18].the dual goal to the value of the holistic solution. If these are the same, we have found the MAP solution."}, {"heading": "5.1 Side-Chain Prediction", "text": "The problem of lateral prediction is to find the three-dimensional configuration of rotamers that have the backbone structure of a protein [18]. This problem can be considered as the search for the MAP configuration of a paired model, and in [18] the TRBP algorithm [13] was used to find the MAP solution for most of the models studied. However, TRBP could not find the MAP solution for 30 of the models. In previous work [12] we used a cutting-plane algorithm to solve these lateral problems and found the MAP solution for all of them. This required the addition of between 1 and 27 triplets per model. Running time was between 1 minute and 1 hour to solve each problem, with more than half of the LP to be solved."}, {"heading": "5.2 Protein Design", "text": "The problem is that this is a problem that needs to be solved first and foremost in the way it has occurred in the past."}, {"heading": "5.3 Stereo Vision", "text": "Given a stereo pair of images, the stereo problem is to find the disparity of each pixel in a reference image, and this disparity can easily be translated into depth by the camera. The best algorithms currently known for the stereo problem are those that minimize a global energy function [10], which is equivalent to searching for a MAP configuration in a paired model. In our experiments, we use the paired model described in [18] and apply our method to the \"tsukuba\" sequence, which is reduced in size to contain 116x154 pixels. As there are no connected triplexes in the grid system, we use our method of square clusters."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "To apply LP loosening to real-world problems, one needs to find an efficient way to add clusters to the basic relaxation so that the problem remains comprehensible, but allows a better approximation to the MAP value. In this paper, we presented a greedy limit minimization algorithm on the dual LP to solve this problem, and showed that it has all the necessary ingredients: an efficient algorithm for message delivery, a \"warm-start\" of the next iteration using current beliefs, and a monotonously decreasing constraint on the MAP. We showed that the algorithm works well in practice, finding the MAP configurations for many real-world problems that we previously thought were too difficult to solve for known methods. While in this paper we focused primarily on adding triplet clusters, our approach is general and can also be used to add larger clusters as long as the messages can be calculated efficiently in the algorithm algorithm."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was partially supported by the DARPA Transfer Learning Program and the Israeli Science Foundation.
