Causal assumptions are presented in the form of an acyclic causal diagram [Spirtes et al., 1993, Heckerman and Shachter, 1995, Lauritzen, 2000, Pearl, 2000] in which arrows represent the potential existence of direct causal relationships between the corresponding variables. Causal diagrams can contain uncontrolled variables, and our task is to determine whether we can estimate the effects of a sequence of actions from the observed data. We motivate the study by considering a medical treatment problem discussed in [Pearl and Robins, 1995, Dawid and Didelez, 2005]. There is a sequence of medical treatments (X1, Xk) that are applied to a patient over time."}, {"heading": "2 Previous Work and Notation", "text": "Dawid and Didelez (2005) formulated the problem of identifying dynamic sequence plans in the context of regime indicators and influence diagrams. (An influence diagram (ID) is a DAG over a series of V = V1,.., Vn} of variables, which also include regime indicators as special nodes of their own, so-called decision nodes (Dawid, 2002). We assume that all variables are discrete. DAG assumes that each variable is independent of all their non-descendant parents in the graph. (1) These assertions imply that the common probability function P (v) = P (v1,., vn) factored according to the product [Pearl, 1988] P (v) = iP (vi) (vi) (vi), where Pai (parental values are more variable Vi in the graph. 2The issue of causal inference is considered a problem of inference over different regimes that we can present grob."}, {"heading": "3 Problem Formulation", "text": "In this paper, we will formulate the sequential planning problem in the context of Bayesian causal networks (previously chosen for this system). A Bayesian causal network (CBN) consists of a DAG G over a set of V = {V1,.., Vn} of variables called a causal diagram. Interpretation of such a diagram has two components, probable and causal. Causal interpretation regards the directed edges in G as causal influences between the corresponding variables. In this interpretation, the factoring of (1) still continues, but the factors are assumed to represent autonomous data generation processes, i.e., each conditional probability P (vi | pai) represents a causal influence between the corresponding variables."}, {"heading": "4 Identification of Sequential Plans", "text": "First, we assume that the type of intervention we make is specifically sufficient to meet a simple condition.Assuming 1 P (xi) is not dependent on the unobserved variable, that is, for conditional intervention we can use (g (c)) or random intervention \u03c3Xi (y) = random intervention (c) = random intervention we need (c) X (c).This assumption corresponds to condition 6.6 or 7.2 in [Dawid and Didelez, 2005].Assuming 1 P (u), Xi (u) can becomesP (y) = random x (z) iP (xi)."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Unconditional plans are easier", "text": "In general, the identification of dynamic plans is more difficult than the identification of absolute plans that include only atomic interventions. Let an intervention strategy \u03c3 \u2032 X consist of all atomic interventions. Then, the manipulated graph G\u03c3 \u2032 X is a subgraph of G\u03c3X = empty. Let Z \u2032 D be the set of variables in Z (which are ancestors of Y in G\u03c3 \u2032 X. (25) Therefore, the identification of Px (y) is the identification of Q [Y} {} {{{} D} a subset of ZD. We have the identification of P (y; \u03c3P) X-Z) the identification of Q [Y-Z-DQ]. (25) The identification of Px (y) therefore requires the identification of Q [Y-Z-Z], while P (y-Z-Z) requires the identification of Q [Y-Z]."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We present a method for identifying dynamic sequential plans.
