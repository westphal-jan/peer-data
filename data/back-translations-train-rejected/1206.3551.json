Decision circuits are an up-to-date graphical representation introduced for the efficient evaluation of influence diagrams [Bhattacharjya and Shachter, 2007]. In this paper, we show that they are also useful for efficient sensitivity analysis in influence diagrams. Generally, the phrase sensitivity analysis refers to understanding how the output for a system varies as a result of changes in the input (s). For influence diagrams, one can think about how the optimal solution and the certain equivalent (CE) will change in terms of changing parameters, i.e. the probabilities and usefulness, or changing the informative assumptions of the problem that we observe are many questions that we can use."}, {"heading": "2 PRELIMINARIES", "text": "We assume that the reader is familiar with graphical models such as Bayesian Utility Networks and Influence Diagrams (see Shachter (2007) for an overview). Consider the two examples shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a represents a belief network with two nodes, labeled W (weather) and B (bring umbrella). We are interested in knowing if a friend brings an umbrella, and we believe it is easier to model this when we have a state in the weather. Figure 1b shows the influence diagram for a decision problem in which our friend decides whether to bring an umbrella based on their belief in the weather and their preferences, represented by the U node (Utility). She will observe a weather report (R) before making her decision. We use these examples to demonstrate the concepts in later sections that we make a distinction between extensive and normal influence diagrams."}, {"heading": "3 ARITHMETIC AND DECISION CIRCUITS", "text": "In this section we will discuss basic concepts relating to arithmetic and decision circuits. During this work, variables are marked with uppercase letters (X) and their values with lowercase letters (x). A bold letter indicates a series of variables.

Figure 3 represents a decision circuit corresponding to the influence diagram shown in Figure 1b. Decision circuits for influence diagrams can only be constructed in the order of variable elimination [Bhattacharjya and Shachter, 2007], similar to a design technique for arithmetic circuits [Darwiche, 2000]. The evidence indicator for decision D is set to 0 only when the alternative d is no longer available to the decision maker. The network parameter \u0445d | pa (D) for a decision D is set to 1 if the alternative is conditionally available under scenario pa (D), and 0 otherwise. Once the decision circuit is assembled, the decision circuit can be evaluated in an upward motion, analogous to the evaluation of the arithmetic circuit."}, {"heading": "4 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS", "text": "The conditional probabilities in an influence chart can be difficult to assess due to the lack of data, expert judgments on key uncertainties, the inaccuracy of the decision maker in terms of preferences and several other practical reasons. As a result, it is often beneficial to verify the change in the results of the decision model based on variations in the inputs of the model. Such questions fall under the umbrella of sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is an essential aspect of decision analysis during the development of the field. Sensitivity analysis helps in identifying the critical elements of the model, forms the basis for iterative refinement of the model, and can also be used after analysis to defend a particular strategy to the decision maker. [Howard, 1983] Sensitivity plots the representation of certain equivalents of different strategies can help us to identify the important variables. Sensitivity analysis for decision problems can be kept constant in terms of decision problems, when one parameter is widely classified, or another is simultaneously classified."}, {"heading": "5 ANALYZING NORMAL FORM INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS", "text": "If there is only one decision node in an influence diagram and there is no parent, the diagram is displayed in normal form. We expand this definition to allow the observation that E = e. We discuss sensitivity analyses for influence diagrams in normal form in this analysis."}, {"heading": "5.1 Partial derivatives", "text": "Consider an influence diagram with a single decision node D that has no parents. Let X be any uncertain variable, with the parents Pa (note that D can be a parent of X). Therefore, the dynamic programming function corresponding to this normal form influence diagram is changed from g = maxd * z x, pa (X) x x x x, where d is an alternative to the decision node D. In normal form, each alternative represents a strategy. Let EUd represent the expected benefit for strategy d. Then MEU = maxdEUd, optimal strategy d = argmaxdEUd and CE = u \u2212 1 (MEU). We will discuss many of the normal form sensitivity results using the following theorems, which outline the meaning of the derivatives of g (e) and g (e) NS (e). These are the basic values of the decision circuit that is evaluated by the proofs e."}, {"heading": "5.2 One-way sensitivity analysis plots", "text": "In this subsection, we will show how to create a diagram of the specific equivalent for the decision problem as a function of a particular meta-parameter when all others are held to their reference values. The expected tool for a particular strategy is a multilinear function of all meta-parameters. Therefore, the expected benefit for a particular strategy d is a linear function of a particular meta-parameter \u03c4k, with all other meta-parameters held to their reference values. We call this linear function EUd = \u03b1d (\u03c4k). We already have a point on this line from the initial sweep to evaluate the circuit, which we call (\u03c40k, \u03b1 0 d). We also have the slope of this line as it corresponds to the partial derivative from part (i) of theorem 1, where v = \u041ak is chosen. We refer to the slope as \u03b1 \u2032 d, k. The drawing of the decision problem CE in relation to metametrics shows the maximum u-resolution (if all is required for the NS-resolution) function."}, {"heading": "5.3 Admissible intervals", "text": "Another sensitivity question in the sense of a one-way sensitivity analysis is the following: Suppose a certain meta-parameter can vary, while all other meta-parameters remain constant at their reference values. What is the range of this meta-parameter over which the current optimal strategy remains optimal? We call this range the allowable interval for a meta-parameter. In other words, we are investigating how robust the optimal strategy is with regard to all meta-parameters. The allowable intervals are easily obtained for normal shape control diagrams, based on the ideas from the previous subsection. Since we have the lines for the expected usefulness of all strategies with regard to all meta-parameters, we can obtain the allowable intervals meta-parameter Ik for all meta-parameters at the same time."}, {"heading": "5.4 Value of information", "text": "The value of the information for a particular uncertainty is a useful sensitivity analysis for sequential decision problems, which indicates the maximum that the decision maker should be willing to pay to observe the uncertainty before making the first decision [Howard, 1966; Raiffa, 1968]. The double derivatives from part (i) of theorem 1 can also calculate the value of the information for all uncertainties not affected by the decision, using the part (ii) of theorem 1 (select v = \u03bbx). Here, MEUPI is the maximum expected benefit with perfect information about uncertain variable X. If the benefit function of the decision maker is linear or exponential, then the value of the information from uncertain variable X is the increase in the certain equivalent u \u2212 1 (MEUPI) \u2212 1 (MEU). Generally, this is a good approximation of the value of the information, even if the benefit function of the overall decision maker has a different form for the outcome (if we have a variable for the 1968)."}, {"heading": "6 ANALYZING EXTENSIVE FORM INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS", "text": "Sensitivity Analysis in Normal Form Influence Diagrams is relatively easy to describe as we explicitly present all strategies. Here, we discuss techniques for analyzing extensive form influence diagrams, all of which can also be applied to Normal Form Diagrams. We start from the standard conditions in the literature for influence diagrams such as \"no forgetting\" [Howard and Matheson, 1984; Shachter, 1986]."}, {"heading": "6.1 One-way sensitivity analysis plots", "text": "The sampling point method from the previous section also refers to extensive shape influence diagrams. It is also possible to set the CE for a given strategy s using decision circuits against \u03c4k. Therefore, the network parameters for decisions \u03b8d | pa (D) must be set accordingly. Note that these are preset according to the current optimal strategy s * after the initial upswing to evaluate the optimal strategy, so they must be reset if s 6 = s *. Once the network parameters for decisions are selected accordingly, we can oscillate the decision circuit up and down and treat the maximization nodes on both swings as sum nodes. Figure 4 is a one-sided sensitivity analysis diagram for the influence diagram shown in Figure 2 with respect to the meta parameter \u04451, the probability that the weather is sunny. The diagram shows the deviation in the CE of the decision problem as well as the CE of the current optimal strategy with respect to the changes in the problem is insufficient for most of us to observe that 1."}, {"heading": "6.2 Admissible intervals", "text": "In this section, an inactive node does not affect the expected usability, because it is an insufficient needs analysis."}, {"heading": "6.3 Value of information", "text": "The challenge in conducting information analyses for extensive shape control diagrams is that it is difficult to keep track of all derivatives for all strategies. We propose a simple method to find the value of information for variables that are not influenced by any decision when observed before the first decision. The goal is to reuse the decision circuit formulated in the offline phase. Assuming that the decision circuit has been evaluated and therefore the probability of proof P (e) has already been calculated, we can find the value of the information for each variable X with the help of some upward swings. If we pass the proof e, U = 1, x in an upward swing, we get once for every possible value of x EUPI (the maximum expected benefit with perfect information about uncertain variable X), as shown in the following theorem."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "Decision circuits are a graphical representation for efficient analysis of influence diagrams, with the potential to exploit both the conditional independence in the diagram and the local structure of asymmetries of real decision problems. Newer methods have been developed to create compact circuits using the separability of value function and operations such as circumcision and coalescence [Bhattacharjya and Shachter, 2008]. If the analyst can assemble an efficient decision circuit for an influence diagram, she can then use the compiled circuit to evaluate the optimal strategy and CE before performing sensitivity analyses of the kind depicted in this paper. We examined several one-way sensitivity analyses and demonstrated techniques to answer them using decision circuits. We discussed sensitivity analyses for both normal forms and extensive form influence diagrams. Sensitivity analyses are an essential tool to support critical modelling and assessment of influence diagrams."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank John Weyant for his support, Mark Chavira for providing helpful answers to our questions, Adnan Darwiche for providing relevant references and the anonymous reviewer for their feedback."}], "references": [{"title": "Evaluating influence diagrams with decision circuits", "author": ["D.
