Introduction", "text": "Intelligent Information Retrieval (IR) [8] was defined by different people in different manners, but the consistent theme was one of the machines (or programs) that do something for the user, or the machine (or program) that performs some functions that previously had to be performed by humans (either users or intermediaries). Information Retrieval Tool [1] is an important method for people to obtain knowledge and information. However, the technique of traditional information gathering has been criticized as deeply flawed; the main reason for this is that the search technique is mainly based on the keyword match. In other words, users enter the input in the form of keywords they want to search, and then recall the system, like search engines, the matching users the matching documents. Due to polysemy and synonyms, it is very difficult to understand the exact requirements of the user based on keywords. Frequently, the keywords entered will not get the desired results, the somewhat relevant or relevant users will ask for a better document today, too."}, {"heading": "Limitations in the past system", "text": "1. It is difficult to understand the needs of the user in order to search for the specified keyword sets. 2. Traditional websites or machines are not capable of learning and are not able to adopt the search criteria, and therefore have not been able to find the results based on user input in the past."}, {"heading": "Advantage in the current system", "text": "The machine should be able to group the similar things and present the information in the form of graphs. The tool we will use can visualize the information of high-dimensional data by reducing its dimensions.One advantage [9] of using SOM over other cluster algorithms is the spatial organization of the characteristic map that is achieved after the learning process.Basically, more similar clusters are closer than different.2 Basic elements of intelligent applications [2] 2.1 Aggregated content - Large collection of data that is similar or dependent on the application.The content that is aggregated is dynamic and not static, and its origins and storage locations could be geographically dispersed.Each individual piece of information is associated with or associated with many other different pieces of information. 2.2 Reference structures: These are the structures that provide one or more structural and setic interpretations of the content.For example, each individual piece of information is associated with the above-mentioned elements or many different pieces of information."}, {"heading": "How can I build intelligence in my own application? [2]", "text": "- Review your functionality and your data use cases should be identified to capture the behavior of the smart application at the beginning of the process. These cases can be identified by asking a number of questions, some of which could be: 1. Does our application have the good content collected from different sources? 2. Is our application a web application or a machine-dependent application? 3. Does the application work with free text? 4. Does the application have wizard-based workflows? 5. Does our application offer search capabilities? 6. Does the application require any kind of reporting? 7. Is our application able to make automated decisions based on defined rules? 8. Is identity verification important for our application? 9. Is our application capable of recommending the search results? The above list is just a set of sample questions that can be identified in use cases, as these questions help us provide pointers on the possibilities."}, {"heading": "3. Some Techniques for retrieving intelligent information:", "text": "3.1 SWOOGLE [10]: An engine for semantic webSwoogle [15], the semantic web search engine, is a research project conducted by the ebiquity research group in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Maryland. It is an engine that aims to find documents on the semantic web. Swoogle [3] is a crawler-based indexing and retrieval system for the semantic web. It extracts metadata for each document discovered and calculates relationships between documents. 3.2 ClusteringThe term clustering [2] means that the process of grouping similar things together. Clustering [12] is suitable in many situations where grouping for similar objects or things is required, but it is not always possible to achieve a desired goal simply by issuing SQL queries. In many cases, the search elements we need to use to locate the desired results are not exposed to the techniques."}, {"heading": "Self-Organizing Map", "text": "It is a data visualization technology that is used to reduce the dimensions of the data by using self-organizing neural networks. SOMs are used to perform two tasks, they reduce the high dimensions of the data and show the grouping of all available similarities between these data by creating a map of most dimensions 1 or 2. The illustration above gives an idea of a two-dimensional image that can be created using any of the available SOM tools. The illustration shows the grouping of colors like all greens in the upper left corner and in the same way as the blue ones in the other side of the image.Components [6] \u2022 Sample DataSample data is the first part of a SOM."}, {"heading": "SOM Algorithm:", "text": "Due to the nature of the self-organizing maps, the way they organize themselves is through the competition for the representation of the samples. Neurons are also allowed to change through learning, so morelike samples hoping to win the next contest. It is this learning and selection process that turns the weights into a map of similarities. SOM algorithm [7] is used with the use of two components (the sample and the weight vectors), which will represent the similarities of the sample vectors. The algorithm begins with the initialization of the weight vectors. Afterwards, the sample vectors are randomly selected from the available weight vectors and the weight vectors are searched in the map to find out which is the best match with the sample vectors. The next step is to find the neighbors of the selected weight vectors that are nearby."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusion & Future work", "text": "We discussed the techniques of intelligent information gathering and machine learning based on clusters and self-organizing maps. In the future, we can implement this ability of machine learning with an algorithm that introduces the crucial concepts of distance and similarity."}, {"heading": "5. References", "text": "1.
