Thus, for example, if we refer to the scene category \"Coast,\" the images of rocky coasts, sunsets, cloudy beaches or calm waters could be included. Analyzing visual subcategories in terms of object description could also help simplify the learning task for scene classification. We use the Scene Understanding (SUN) database for our scene classification experiments. The SUN database is a collection of approximately 100,000 images, which are grouped into an exhaustive set of 899 scene categories. For our experiments, we use the subcategories of 397 well-sorted categories."}, {"heading": "5.1 Visual subcategories are semantically interpretable", "text": "Our visual sub-category approach achieves a score of 27.1%, which confidently exceeds the linear SVM 16.9% (see table in Results per Category Supplement Material).The benefits of our approach become clearer when we take a closer look at the classification results of the discovered sub-categories (see Figure 7).Many of the discovered sub-categories correspond to the semantic sub-categories. Thus, the base category \"vehicleInterior\" contains clusters for \"Cockpit,\" \"Bus Interior,\" \"Car Front Seat\" and \"Rear Bench,\" all of which correspond to the fine-grained categories that form this basic category, allowing a deeper look at the image instead of simply assigning the category label. For example, instead of simply classifying an image as \"Vehicle Interior,\" we could now say that it is a \"Cockpit\" image."}, {"heading": "5.2 Visual subcategories alleviate the need for human supervision", "text": "To this end, we conducted an experiment in which the sub-categories in our framework were initialized based on the human annotation sub-categories on the unattended visual sub-categories, and the result achieved by this initialization (average 27.2%) is similar to the result achieved by our unattended sub-categories at 27.1% (see table in the supplement material for results per category), which is interesting because it suggests that human oversight of the creation of the fine-grained sub-categories to form a basic category classification may not be of much use compared to the unattended visual sub-categories. Our observations here are also supported by recent results in [8], where semantic similarity was correlated to visual similarity at the lower end of the ImageNet hierarchy, i.e. when the basic category is divided into extremely small sub-categories."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "Contrary to the prevailing belief that deformable parts are the key to the success of the model detector for deformable parts, we have found that the use of sub-categories can potentially reduce their need. Visual sub-categories not only serve to learn and perform models, but also lead to simpler and more interpretable models. In addition to object recognition, their use can also benefit the task of scene classification, as it can reduce the need for human oversight in designing the space of fine-grained sub-categories."}], "references": [{"title": "Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection", "author": ["N.
