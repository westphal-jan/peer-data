A homomorphism from A to B is a figure h: such a symbol R denotes the nature of the structure R.A as similar if they share the same signature. Let A, B be similar structures on the signature.

We say that a representation r is usable if the following two conditions are met. - There is a calculable problem of the figure t: \u00b7 Structures where for each string x a structure A is represented in the explicit representation, the string t (x) represents A under r, that is, r (x) = A. - There is a figure p: There is a figure p: Structures representing FPT in relation to the structure x-p."}, {"heading": "4 Compilability", "text": "We saw this, in the setting of the limited kind, in the equivalence of a proposition set on a limited variable fragment of the existential positive logic.

If there are k [1] -hard propositions that each proposition B is logically equivalent to a proposition in FOk, then the problem is FO-MC (F) in nuFPT. Proof. For each proposition B, let us name a logically equivalent proposition in FOk.
