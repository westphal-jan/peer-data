Different species have different leaf vein patterns. It is seen that leaf vein segmentation will help in maintaining a record of all the leaves according to their specific pattern of veins thus provide an effective way to retrieve and store information regarding various plant species in database as well as provide an effective means to characterize plants on the basis of leaf vein structure which is unique for every species. The algorithm proposes a new way of segmentation of leaf veins with the use of Odd Gabor filters and the use of morphological operations for producing a better output. The Odd Gabor filter gives an efficient output and is robust and scalable as compared with the existing techniques as it detects the fine fiber like veins present in leaves much more efficiently.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 Jun 2012 14:22:16 GMT  (598kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5157v1", "International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science Volume 3, No. 3, May-June 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science Volume 3, No. 3, May-June 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["vini katyal", "aviral"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.5157"}, "pdf": {"name": "1206.5157.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Leaf vein segmentation using Odd Gabor filters and morphological operations", "authors": ["Vini Katyal", "Yun Feng Li", "Qing Sheng Zhu Yu", "Kun Cao Cheng"], "emails": ["vini_katyal@yahoo.co.in", "Kaviral12@yahoo.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It can be seen that leaf vein segmentation will help maintain a dataset of all leaves according to their specific pattern of veins. [The algorithms offer a new way of segmenting the leaf veins using dd-gabor filters and using morphological operations to produce better output. The dd-gabor filter provides an efficient output and is robust and scalable compared to existing techniques, as it detects the fine fibers like veins in leaves.

CONCLUSION", "text": "The leaf vein is important for the identification of plants. These structures are always species-specific and consistently grow into a genetically determined pattern and shape. Botanists and foresters have developed terms for these patterns and shapes that help in the identification of trees. Therefore, identification and segmentation is of the utmost importance, which is presented by the approach in the algorithm. This method is flexible compared to other approaches proposed so far."}, {"heading": "6.
