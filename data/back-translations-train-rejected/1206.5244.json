Despite the complexity of the problem of quantitative variability at worst, the experiments show that the two heuristic search algorithms presented in the paper are very efficient on average. In the future, it may be interesting to investigate the use of the choquet integral in dynamic decision-making problems, e.g. in decision trees or Markov decision processes. The main problem there is the existence of dynamic inconsistencies induced by the choquet integral in sequential decision-making. Another direction could be to shape the potential of the choquet integral in multi-objective planning problems. As Grabisch (1996) has shown, the descriptive potential of the choquet integral offers interesting possibilities in the field of multi-criterion analysis. We could use the choquet integral to characterize a compromise-state diagram."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Jean-Yves Jaffray and Judy Goldsmith for the fruitful discussions on this work and anonymous reviewers for their useful comments.

We first recall the main features of the CEU model and introduce some examples showing its descriptive potential. Then we focus on the search for Choquet-optimal paths in multivalued implicit graphs where costs depend on different scenarios. After discussing complexity issues, we propose two different heuristic search algorithms to solve the problem. Finally, numerical experiments are reported, showing the practical efficiency of the proposed algorithms.", "creator": "Adobe InDesign CS2 (4.0.4)"}}}
