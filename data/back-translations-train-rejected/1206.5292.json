Attempts to achieve this have a long history and have gained steam in recent years. Within AI, Nilsson (1986) is an early example. Bacchus (1990), Halpern (1990) and collaborators (e.g. Bacchus et al. (1996) have produced a considerable corpus of relevant theoretical work. At around the same time, several authors began using logic programs to specify complex Bayesian work compactly, an approach known as knowledge-based model construction (Wellman et al, 1992). More recently, many combinations of (subsets of) first-order logic and probability have been proposed in the burgeoning field of statistical relational learning (Getoor & Taskar, 2007), including probabilistic programs (Friedman, 1999)."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 First-Order Logic", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the persons mentioned in this context are persons who are not in a position to abide by the rules, who are in a position to abide by the rules."}, {"heading": "2.2 Gibbs Measures", "text": "In this paper we will deal exclusively with Boolean states and functions (i.e., states are binary vectors, corresponding to possible worlds, and functions are logical formulas).Markov logic can be regarded as the use of first-order logic to describe the families of these functions (Richardson & Domingos, 2006)."}, {"heading": "3 Infinite MLNs", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Definition", "text": "As we have seen in the previous section, these can be converted into equivalent formulas in prenex CNF. We assume that all existentially quantified variables have finite domains, unless otherwise specified. By distributing conjunctions over conjunctions, each prenex CNF can now essentially be converted into quantifiable-free CNF, with all variables implicitly being universally quantified. The Herbrand universe U (L) of an MLN L is the set of all basic concepts that can be constructed from the constants and function symbols in the MLN.

The corresponding gibbous specification is denoted by \u03b3L.3, so that an MLN is local finite, it is sufficient for it to be defined. Definition 5.

Consider an MLN that states that each person is loved by exactly one person: x y loves (y, x).

The first equality holds because the speculation is a disjunction, and the second because every speculation has a zero probability of occurrence. There is a contradiction, and there is no measure consistent with the MLN. 4 The reason why the MLN is a falsehood, and the second because every speculation has a zero probability of occurrence."}, {"heading": "3.3 Uniqueness", "text": "This section deals with the question of the conditions under which an MLN allows a unique measurement variable. First, let's get some clues as to why an MLN might allow more than one measurement variable; the only condition that an MLN L places on a measurement variable is that it should be consistent with the local conditional distributions, but since these distributions are local, they do not determine the behavior of the measurement variable in infinity. For example, consider a semi-infinite two-dimensional measurement bar where neighboring locations are more likely to have the same truth value than not. This can be represented by formulas x, y, y, Q (x), y (x), y, y, y, y, Q (s), with a single constant 0 to define the origin (0), and with s () as a successor function."}, {"heading": "3.4 Non-unique MLNs", "text": "At first glance, it might seem that ambiguity is an undesirable property, and ambiguous MLNs are not an interesting study object. However, the ambiguous case is actually very important, because many phenomena of interest are represented by MLNs with ambiguous metrics (for example, very large social networks with strong word-of-mouth effects), and the question of what these metrics represent and how they relate to each other then becomes important. This is the subject of this section. The first observation is that the set of all Gibbs metrics G (\u03b3L) is convex, which is when \u00b5 \"the magnetic metrics G (\u03b3L) then implies the quantified metrics G (\u03b3L), where sp = s\u00b5 + (1 \u2212 s) of the tail metrics G (0, 1).

We have also described the structure of the set of consistent metrics when not a singleton, and demonstrated how to formulate the problem of satisfaction in relation to MLN metrics. Guidelines for the future include the development of advanced inference and learning algorithms for infinite MLNs, the derivation of alternative conditions for existence and uniqueness, the more detailed analysis of the structure of consistent metrics, the extension of the theory to non-herbrand interpretations and recursive random fields (Lowd & Domingos, 2007), and the study of interesting special cases of infinite MLNs."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We are grateful to Michael Jordan for helpful discussions.
