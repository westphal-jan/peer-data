This framework is based on a recursive definition that covers the case of multiple embedded time elastic dimensions. We prove that such inner products exist in our general framework and show how a simple instance of this inner product class operates on some prospective applications, while generalizing the Euclidean inner product. Classification experimentations on time series and symbolic sequences datasets demonstrate the benefits that we can expect by embedding time series or sequences into elastic inner spaces rather than into classical Euclidean spaces. These experiments show good accuracy when compared to the euclidean distance or even dynamic programming algorithms while maintaining a linear algorithmic complexity at exploitation stage, although a quadratic indexing phase beforehand is required.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 07:44:15 GMT  (423kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6196v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1101.4318"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1101.4318", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DB", "authors": ["pierre-fran\\c{c}ois marteau", "nicolas bonnel", "gilbas m\\'enier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6196"}, "pdf": {"name": "1206.6196.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Discrete Elastic Inner Vector Spaces with Application to Time Series and Sequence Mining", "authors": ["Pierre-Francois Marteau", "Gildas M\u00e9nier"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 120 6.61 96v1 [cs.LG] 2 7Ju n20 12Index Terms - Vector space, discrete time series, Sequence Mining, Inuniform sampling, Elastic inner product, Time verping."}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "T IME series analysis in metric spaces has attracted much attention over numerous decades and in various fields such as biology, statistics, sociology, networking, signal processing, etc., essentially due to the ubiquitous nature of time series, whether they are symbolic or numerical. Among other characterization tools, time delay distances (see [20], [13], and more recently [7], [9] among other references) have shown some interesting robustness compared to the Euclidean metric, especially when similarity search in time series databases is a problem. Unfortunately, this type of elastic distance does not allow the direct construction of certain cores that are useful when it comes to regression, classification or clustering of time series. A fortiori, they do not make it possible to directly construct inner products that include some time elasticity, which are essentially able to cope with some strains or a compression along specific dimensions."}, {"heading": "2 ELASTIC INNER PRODUCT VECTOR SPACES", "text": "Based on the recursive structure of the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) equation, in which the non-linear max operator is replaced by a sum operator, we propose a fairly general and parameterized recursive equation, which we call an elastic product.

Additionally, we evaluate the calculation costs of the indexed version of \u03b4eip, which we call \u03b4i \u2212 eip.

Figure 7 indicates the elapsed time in seconds, according to a logarithmic scale, for the four distances as a function of the length of the time series. Compared to \u03b4eip, \u03b4eip is very efficiently evaluated on the basis of the matrix calculation given in the equation, although without any offline indexing of the time series, \u03b4eip does not compete with the length of the line, which is clearly compared to the one that is compared to the ilined line in a curve."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSION", "text": "This work has made it possible to embed such time series in a single inner space, for example in the area of numerical or symbolic sequences."}], "references": [{"title": "Basic local alignment search tool", "author": ["S.F.

We prove that such inner products exist in our general framework and show how a simple instance of this inner product class operates on some prospective applications, while generalizing the Euclidean inner product. Classification experimentations on time series and symbolic sequences datasets demonstrate the benefits that we can expect by embedding time series or sequences into elastic inner spaces rather than into classical Euclidean spaces. These experiments show good accuracy when compared to the euclidean distance or even dynamic programming algorithms while maintaining a linear algorithmic complexity at exploitation stage, although a quadratic indexing phase beforehand is required.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
