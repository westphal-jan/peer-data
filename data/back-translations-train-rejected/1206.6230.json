This paper presents a decentralized data fusion and active sensing (D2FAS) algorithm for mobile sensors to actively explore the road network to gather and assimilate the most informative data for predicting the traffic phenomenon. We analyze the time and communication complexity of D2FAS and demonstrate that it can scale well with a large number of observations and sensors. We provide a theoretical guarantee on its predictive performance to be equivalent to that of a sophisticated centralized sparse approximation for the Gaussian process (GP) model: The computation of such a sparse approximate GP model can thus be parallelized and distributed among the mobile sensors (in a Google-like MapReduce paradigm), thereby achieving efficient and scalable prediction. We also theoretically guarantee its active sensing performance that improves under various practical environmental conditions. Empirical evaluation on real-world urban road network data shows that our D2FAS algorithm is significantly more time-efficient and scalable than state-of-the-art centralized algorithms while achieving comparable predictive performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 11:11:55 GMT  (184kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6230v1", "28th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2012), Extended version with proofs, 13 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 28 Jun 2012 04:21:18 GMT  (184kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6230v2", "28th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2012), Extended version with proofs, 13 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "28th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2012), Extended version with proofs, 13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC cs.MA cs.RO", "authors": ["jie chen", "kian hsiang low", "colin keng-yan tan", "ali oran", "patrick jaillet", "john m dolan", "gaurav s sukhatme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6230"}, "pdf": {"name": "1206.6230.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Decentralized Data Fusion and Active Sensing with Mobile Sensors for Modeling and Predicting Spatiotemporal Traffic Phenomena", "authors": ["Jie Chen", "Kian Hsiang Low", "Colin Keng-Yan Tan", "Ali Oran", "Patrick Jaillet", "John Dolan", "Gaurav Sukhatme"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it will happen, until it does."}, {"heading": "2 Relational Gaussian Process Regression", "text": "The Gaussian method (GP) can be used to model a spatially driven traffic phenomenon over a road network as follows: The traffic phenomenon is defined as the realization of a GP.

If the GP prediction is expected to be large, it cannot be performed in real time. For practical application, we need to resort to a mathematically cheaper approximate GP prediction. a simple method of approximation is to select only a subset U of the total set of observed street segments (i.e., the U-D) to calculate the subsequent distribution of measurements to any set of Y V\\ D unobserved street segments. Such a subset of data (SoD) is an approximation method that produces the following predictive UU distribution method closely reminiscent of the GP prediction."}, {"heading": "3 Decentralized Data Fusion", "text": "In this section, we will discuss the decentralized data fusion algorithms of our D2FAS algorithms, which distribute the computational load between the mobile sensors to achieve an efficient and scalable approximate GP prediction. Intuition of our decentralized data fusion algorithms is as follows: Each of the mobile sensors constructs a local summary of the observations made along its own path in the road network and communicates its local summary to each other sensor. Then, it assimilates the local summaries of the other sensors into a globally unified summary, which is used for predicting the traffic phenomenon as well as for active sensitization."}, {"heading": "4 Decentralized Active Sensing", "text": "The problem of active sensing with mobile sensors is formulated as follows: \"It is a problem that we can only solve if we choose the most informative routes in the region.\" (\"It is a problem that we do not know.\") \"It is a problem.\" (\"It is a problem that we cannot solve.\") \"It is a problem that we do not want to solve.\" (\"It is a problem that we do not want to solve.\") \"It is a problem that we do not want to solve.\" (\"It is a problem that we do not want to solve.\") \"It is a problem that we do not want to solve.\" It is a problem that we do not want to perceive. \"It is a problem that we do not want to perceive.\" (It is). \"We do not want to perceive.\" (It is). \"It is a problem that we do not want to perceive.\" (It is)."}, {"heading": "5 Time and Communication Overheads", "text": "This section analyzes the time and communication effort of our D2FAS algorithm and compares it with centralized active sampling (17) in combination with data fusion methods: Full GP (FGP) and SoD (Section 2)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Time Complexity", "text": "The data fusion component of D2FAS includes the calculation of local and global summaries and Gaussian predictive distribution. To generate the local summary using (6) and (7), each sensor must evaluate the local summary in O (U | 3 + | U | (D | / K) 2) time and invert it in O (U | 2K) 3) time, whereupon the local summary is evaluated in O (U | 2 | U | U | (D | / K) 2) time.

In contrast, FGP and SoD require each sensor in each iteration to send a message of size O (| D | / K) that includes exactly its local observations to handle communication failures. If the number of local observations is greater than a local summary of the predefined size, then the data fusion component of D2FAS is more scalable in terms of communication effort than FGP and SoD. For the partially decentralized active sensor component of D2FAS, each sensor component is greater than a local summary of predefined size, then the data fusion component of D2FAS is higher than the speed specified by D2FAS."}, {"heading": "6.1 Performance Metrics", "text": "The first measure evaluates the predictability of a tested algorithm: it measures the mean of the quadratic error (RMSE) caused by the predictive mean of the tested algorithm, in particular using (1) FGP, (4) SoD or (10) D2FAS.

Therefore, D2FAS is handy for deployment in a large mobile sensor network to achieve durable and accurate traffic modelling and forecasting. In our future work, we assume that each sensor can only communicate locally with its neighbors (rather than assuming full communication) and can develop a distributed data fusion approach for efficient and scalable safe GP predictions based on D2FAS and consensus filters (Olfati-Saber, 2005).
