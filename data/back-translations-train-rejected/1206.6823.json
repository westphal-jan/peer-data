The evidential functions are defined on sets and their enumeration. Broadly speaking, the time complexity of computing evidential functions is exponential. Essentially, it is not feasible to translate the evidence theory into an efficient direct implementation (Barnett 1981). Therefore the applications of the DempsterShafer theory of evidence to real-world problems have been until recently limited (Denoeux 2000), in particular, to text categorization. Considerable efforts have been devoted to developing efficient algorithms for computing evidential functions (Barnett 1981; Shafer, et al. 1987; Kennes, et al. 1990; Moral, et al. 1994; Guan, et al. 1995; Shafer, et al. 2002).
