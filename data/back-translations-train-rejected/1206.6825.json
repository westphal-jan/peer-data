We demonstrate that many of these large-clique triangulations are non-minimal and are thus unattainable via the variable elimination algorithm. We introduce ancestral pairs as the basis for novel triangulation heuristics and prove that no more than the addition of edges between ancestral pairs need be considered when searching for state space optimal triangulations in such graphs. Empirical results on random and real world graphs show that the resulting triangulations that yield significant speedups are almost always non-minimal. We also give an algorithm and correctness proof for determining if a triangulation can be obtained via elimination, and we show that the decision problem associated with finding optimal state space triangulations in this mixed stochastic/deterministic setting is NP-complete.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 15:41:21 GMT  (199kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6825v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["chris bartels", "jeff a bilmes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6825"}, "pdf": {"name": "1206.6825.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Non-Minimal Triangulations for Mixed Stochastic/Deterministic Graphical Models", "authors": ["Chris D.

A chord is an edge that connects two non-consecutive vertices in a cycle. A graph is triangulated if it does not contain chordless length cycles greater than three. A triangulation of a graph G = (V, E) is a (possibly empty) set of edges F so that a graph G (G) = (V, E, F) is triangulated. The edges of a graph G = (V, E) are minimal. The term triangulation is also used to mean the graph T (G). In the face of a graph G = (V, E), the neighbors of v, V) are defined as NEG."}, {"heading": "3 MINIMAL VERSUS NON-MINIMAL", "text": "With a sense of the usefulness of deterministic variables and the background of triangulation and elimination, we go further by discussing when and why one would like to go beyond traditional triangulation techniques. It is a common belief that triangulations that minimize clique size may be desirable for use in the calculation of queries on a graphical model, because it can be shown that many of the measurements of performance in an exponential function on w, the inherent treewidth of the graph [7, 13] may not necessarily be optimal. An example of this is when it may be more desirable to bundle many small cardinality variables together in a clique to avoid increasing the size of cliques that contain large cardinality variables. Furthermore, some queries on node trees can be performed without actually storing clique potentials in memory; instead, only the separation variables are stored."}, {"heading": "4 ELIMINATION GRAPH DETECTION AND COMPLEXITY", "text": "It has been shown that elimination is not able to generate certain (potentially useful) triangulations, but given a triangulation = > NP | How can you tell if an elimination order could have generated it?

It takes a graph, G, and a triangulation, T (G), as input, and returns true if T (G) can be achieved by an elimination order, which is essential to our results, where we show that most of the desirable triangulations in our test set could not be generated by elimination."}, {"heading": "5 ELIMINATION WITH EXTRA FILL-IN", "text": "It is a question of the extent to which people are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

An example was given where optimal triangulation has a state space that is arbitrarily smaller than all elimination-based triangulations. An algorithm was presented to determine whether triangulation could have been produced by elimination, and it was shown that the generalized triangulation problem NP is complete. Extraelimination was introduced as a framework for producing any triangulation, and additional edges in state space optimization could be limited to the ancestral edges. Novel heuristics based on ancestral edges were presented, and the results were given on randomly generated and real graphs."}, {"heading": "A APPENDIX", "text": "Lemma 11 (G), G (G), S (G), G (G), G (G), G (G), V (V), V (V), V (V), V (V), V (V), V (V), V (V), V (G), V (G), V (G), V (G), V (G), V (G), V (G), V (G), V (G), V (G), and all v), C are stochastical.

large-clique graph triangulations can be useful for reducing computational requirements when making queries on mixed stochastic/deterministic graphical models. We demonstrate that many of these largeclique triangulations are non-minimal and are thus unattainable via the elimination algorithm. We introduce ancestral pairs as the basis for novel triangulation heuristics and prove that no more than the addition of edges between ancestral pairs need be considered when searching for state space optimal triangulations in such graphs. Empirical results on random and real world graphs are given. We also present an algorithm and correctness proof for determining if a triangulation can be obtained via elimination, and we show that the decision problem associated with finding optimal state space triangulations in this mixed setting is NP-complete.", "creator": null}}}
