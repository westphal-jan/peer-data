In fact, the constructive evidence in the fifth section not only shows us that these rules are complete, but also provides formal recursive algorithms to perform calculations with rules 2 and 3 when we need problem 1 or 2. Together with the algorithm we have outlined in section four, we get a formal procedure to solve the identification problem and calculate causal effects using the graphical rules 2 and 3."}], "references": [{"title": "Testing identifiability of causal effects", "author": ["Galles", "Pearl", "D. 1995] Galles", "J.
