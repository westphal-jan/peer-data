Knight [11] is often ascribed the distinction between risk and uncertainty, the former corresponding to situations in which a unique probability function is known on relevant event space, while the latter, Knightian uncertainty, corresponds to situations in which there is more than one plausible probability function. Ellsberg [4], who introduces the term ambiguity, has shown that certain patterns of rational behavior are not compatible with Savage's axioms, which are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a unique subjective probability function. Schmeidler [12] describes a decision model of ambiguity. He introduces Choquet's expected benefit model, in which actions are evaluated by Choquet that measure non-additive uncertainty. Gilboa and Schmeidler [7] suggest that a decision maker can maintain a number of (additive) probability functions."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion and further work", "text": "This paper describes a new approach to decision-making under ambiguity. We offer a new and more general axiomatization of preference over probability games. We argue that probability games adequately describe measures available to decision-makers in situations where they know experimental data and the set of plausible models, but not the previous probability on models. The axioms used for probability games have the same logic and intuition as Jensen's axioms for probability games. We show that the preference relationship to probability games is represented by a benefit function mapping of games of chance into two-dimensional vectors. We define the concept of ambiguity aversion to describe the taste of decision-makers. Under constant ambiguity aversion, we derive price formulas for probability games. This formula has a form of a familiar logistical function. Our approach offers a new perspective on the role of data in decision-making under ambiguity. Since subjective probability may not be considered useful to these prior models, and may not be useful to finding common solutions."}], "references": [{"title": "The Likelihood Principle, 2 ed", "author": ["J.O.

Likelihood gambles describe actions in a situation where a decision maker knows multiple probabilistic models and a random sample generated from one of those models but does not know prior probability of models. This new axiom system is inspired by Jensen\u2019s axiomatization of probabilistic gambles. Our approach provides a new perspective to the role of data in decision making under ambiguity. 1 Likelihood gambles Likelihood gambles introduced in [5, 6] describe actions in situation of model ambiguity characterized by (1) there are multiple probabilistic models; (2) there is data providing likelihoods for the models and (3) there is no prior probability about the models. Formally, we consider a general problem described by a tuple (X,Y,\u0398,A,x). X,Y are variables describing a phenomenon of interest. X is experiment variable whose values can be observed through experiments or data gathering (e.g. lab test results, clinical observations). Y is utility variable whose values determine the utility of actions (e.g. stages of disease, relative size of the tumor). \u0398 is the set of models that encode the knowledge about the phenomenon. To be precise, \u0398 is a set of indices and knowledge is encoded in probability functions Pr\u03b8(X,Y ) for \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398. A is the set of alternative actions (e.g. surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy) that are functions from utility variable Y to the unit interval [0, 1] representing utility. Fi\u2217I thank Bharat Rao for encouragement and support and UAI-2006 referees for their constructive comments. One should note that the use of utility rather than nally, evidence/data/observation gathered on experiment variable is X = x. A fundamental question to be answered is which among the alternative actions is the best choice given the information. We introduce the concept of likelihood gambles and derive a pricing formula that will allow their comparison. Note that given a model \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398 and observation x, distribution on utility variable Y is Pr\u03b8(y|x). According to the classical Bayesian decision theory actions a \u2208 A are values by their expected utility", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.94b Copyright 2004 Radical Eye Software"}}}
