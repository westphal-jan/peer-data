As the number of possible ways to map a series of observations on underlying objects is enormous, these problems are extremely challenging for standard sampling. Specialized algorithms have been developed in the areas of recording connection [Fellegi and Sunter, 1969] and data association [Bar-Shalom and Fortmann, 1988], which provide approximate solutions for certain classes of models. Recently, Pasula et al. [2003] and Oh et al. [2004] have obtained state-of-the-art results on these problems using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

A typed language of the first order comprises a series of types, such as String, NaturalNum, Citation, and Publication, and a series of function symbols1, such as Name, Title, and PubCited. A model structure specifies a series of objects for each type, and for each function symbol specifies an assignment of argumentation stages to values. A BLOG model specifies a generative process for constructing such possible worlds. Fig. 1 shows a simplified version of the BLOG model that we use for quoting symbols. The model begins by explaining object types (line 1) and introducing some guaranteed objects that exist in all possible worlds. The rest of the model consists of two types of statements.

Proposal distributions are written as Java classes that implement an interface called Proposer. Specifically, a class that implements the Proposer interface defines a family of offer distributions: An object of this class defines a specific distribution q (s) | sn once it has been initialized with a specific BLOG model, observed evidence, and a list of queries. Useful Proposer classes can be specialized in a specific model and type of query: for example, an applicant for citation comparison could only support BLOG models that are identical to the one in Figure 1 (with the exception of variations in the number of citations); evidence that consists of observed text for each citation, the same quotation, and the MC query, whether the method is consistent with the MC (after that)."}, {"heading": "4 MCMC STATES", "text": "The obvious method of applying MCMC to a BLOG model is to let the MCMC states be possible worlds. However, the supply distribution of [Pasula et al., 2003] does not propose complete possible worlds. A complete possible world typically contains many publications that are not quoted, i.e., does not propose the value of PubCited (c) for any quote c. The world must state the values of the title and the NthAuthor for all existing publications. However, the supply distribution discussed in paragraph 2.1 never suggests titles or authors for unquoted publications. The conditional BN for the quotation comparison model makes it clear that attributes of unquoted publications are irrelevant: In a world where a publication p is not quoted, the titles and NthAuthor variables defined on p do not require active ancestors of queries or evidence variables."}, {"heading": "4.1 EVENTS AS MCMC STATES", "text": "Our generic MCMC architecture circumvents these difficulties by allowing the proposed distributions to use partial descriptions of the possible worlds Q = Q (Q = Q = Q). For example, the applicant (Q = Q = Q = Q) can be considered an event: a series of complete possible worlds that meet the specification. Thus, our system maintains a Markov chain over a series of events that are subsets of the result space. The following theorem specifies conditions under which a Markov chain over E correctly answers queries.Theorem p is a probability distribution over a series of events, E and Q is a group of subsets of the result space.

In worlds where there are 10 releases, for example, the release objects are uniformly selected from these release objects (Pub, 1),... (Pub, 10). The BLOG model in Fig. 1 specifies that the value of each PubCited variable is uniformly selected from these release objects. 3 For example, consider an MCMC state in which # Pub = 1000, but only 200 different release objects currently serve as values for PubCited variables. When the applicant performs a splitting operation - taking, say, (Pub, 7), publication marks and splitting some of his citations to join a new release - which of the 800 previously uncited releases is used as value for those releases."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Abstract partial instantiations", "text": "Our general MCMC system includes an additional layer of abstraction that makes it easier to write application distributions with interchangeable objects. Idea is to set MCMC states using abstract partial instances where unnumbered object identifiers can be used both as arguments and as values for basic random variables.

Lemma 3. Let's actually be an abstract partial instance for a BLOG model. Then, all concrete versions of \u03c3 have the same probability that we will call PC. If such mixing were allowed, then they are all. The proof for this Lemma is based on the stipulation in Def. 2 that an abstract instance cannot use both concrete objects and object part identifiers for the same type. If such mixing were allowed, then some concrete versions of \u03c3 have4In models in which objects can be abstracted other variables than others, depending on whether certain object part identifiers were used elsewhere in the instance."}, {"heading": "4.3.4 A useful special case", "text": "The abstract partial instances we use for quoting only make assertions about cited publications.

The state object passed to proposeNextState is actually a difference structure, or \"patch,\" based on the current state sn. This difference structure contains a hash table that maps modified or newly instantiated basic variables to their new values, as well as a list of newly instantiated variables. In fact, the applicant only changes this patch; the underlying copy of sn remains unchanged. However, the difference structure supports all the same access methods as an ordinary MCMCState data structure: when a client asks for the value of a variable that has not been modified, the request of sn is simply passed on to the original state by the proposal of the initial state 1."}, {"heading": "5.2 COMPUTING THE ACCEPTANCE PROBABILITY", "text": "In addition to maintaining the MCMC state, the main task for our general purpose code is to calculate the probability of acceptance."}, {"heading": "6 EXPERIMENTS", "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have developed a general meridian system, which only has the possibility of finding a solution that is capable of finding a solution."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by DARPA IPTO in the framework of the CALO project (03-000219) and the Effective Bayesian Transfer Learning project (FA8750-05-2-0249).

Recent work has achieved efficient and accurate inference on such problems using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques with customized proposal distributions. Currently, implementing such a system requires coding MCMC state representations and acceptance probability calculations that are specific to a particular application. An alternative approach, which we pursue in this paper, is to use a general-purpose probabilistic modeling language (such as BLOG) and a generic Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm that supports user-supplied proposal distributions. Our algorithm gains flexibility by using MCMC states that are only partial descriptions of possible worlds; we provide conditions under which MCMC over partial worlds yields correct answers to queries. We also show how to use a context-specific Bayes net to identify the factors in the acceptance probability that need to be computed for a given proposed move. Experimental results on a citation matching task show that our general-purpose MCMC engine compares favorably with an application-specific system.", "creator": null}}}
