We showed that probability logic and the logic of expected distance are no more meaningful than each other (Lee 2006). In addition, advanced languages, including some of these symbols, are strictly more meaningful than LEDs. It is an interesting question whether there are sets of complete axioms for these extended systems. Arguing with the expected distance has many potential applications. An interesting application is an argumentation system for second-order uncertainties (Gaifman 1986). Since degrees of uncertainty are usually represented in metric spaces, we can assume expected distance functions to represent second-order uncertainties."}], "references": [{"title": "Toward a geometry of common sense: A semantics and a complete axiomatization of mereotopology", "author": ["N.

There also exists a wide variety of formal systems on spatial reasoning (eg. see Gabelaia et al. 2005, Asher & Vieu 1995, Lemon & Pratt 1998) and especially on reasoning about metric spaces (eg. see Kutz et al. 2003, Wolter & Zakharyaschev 2005). But it is hard to find a formal system when probabilistic uncertainty is present on metric spaces. In probabilistic or statistical analysis, it is usually assumed that values of random variables are real numbers. Since most of statistical inference is related to reasoning about expectation and variance, restricting the range of random variables to the spaces where those values are well defined is considered as an acceptable sacrifice. A formal reasoning system on expectations with respect to probability measures and other belief theoretic measures can be found in (Halpern & Pucella 2002). Even though expectations of an event cannot be defined on arbitrary metric spaces, the expectation of distances with respect to a fixed set is well defined in any metric space. For example, an expectation of a random location on a sphere cannot be defined, but an expected distance of a random location from the south hemisphere is a well defined notion. The expected distance is often interpreted as a loss function in statistical decision theory (Berger 1985). Loss(a) = EP (d(X, a)). In this case, the distance function d(x, a) with respected to a fixed point a is used to calculate the cost for predicting x when a is a true state. A complimentary concept of a cost function in decision theory is a utility function. The expected utility function has been an important topic in economics for a long time (Von Neumann & Morgenstern 1944; Savage 1954; Schmeidler 1989). We can also find more generalized expected utility functions defined for plausibility measures and generalized utility functions. (Chu & Halpern 2003; 2004). The objective of a decision problem is to find an action that minimizes a loss function. For example, if we have a uniform prior probability distribution on [0, 1] where d(x, y) = |x\u2212 y|, the loss minimizing prediction would be X = 0.5. But in inference problems, the objective is to derive more information from given information. As an example, for the previous distance function, if we know that EP (d(X, 0)) = 1, then we can deduce that EP (d(X, 1)) = 0. For inference problems, a viewpoint from fuzzy logic is also meaningful. Let\u2019s assume that a fuzzy set Da represents a fuzzy concept \u201cdissimilar from a\u201d for a point a in a 1-bounded metric space \u03a9. A natural candidate for a membership function of Da would be d(x, a).
