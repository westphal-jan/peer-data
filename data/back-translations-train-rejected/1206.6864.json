Consider the classical example of a recommendation system where the rating of an item by a user should symmetrically be dependent on the attributes of both the user and the item. The attributes of the (known) relationships are also relevant for predicting attributes of entities and for predicting attributes of new relations. In recommendation systems, the exploitation of relational attributes is often referred to as collaborative filtering. Again, in many applications one might prefer to model the collaborative effect in a symmetrical way. In this paper we present a relational model, which is completely symmetrical. The key innovation is that we introduce for each entity (or object) an infinite-dimensional latent variable as part of a Dirichlet process (DP) model. We discuss inference in the model, which is based on a DP Gibbs sampler, i.e., the Chinese restaurant process. We extend the Chinese restaurant process to be applicable to relational modeling. Our approach is evaluated in three applications. One is a recommendation system based on the MovieLens data set. The second application concerns the prediction of the function of yeast genes/proteins on the data set of KDD Cup 2001 using a multi-relational model. The third application involves a relational medical domain. The experimental results show that our model gives significantly improved estimates of attributes describing relationships or entities in complex relational models.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 16:28:29 GMT  (280kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6864v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB cs.LG", "authors": ["zhao xu", "volker tresp", "kai yu", "hans-peter kriegel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6864"}, "pdf": {"name": "1206.6864.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Infinite Hidden Relational Models", "authors": ["Zhao Xu", "Volker Tresp", "Kai Yu"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Relational Learning analyzes the likely limitations between entity attributes and relationships.

(Getoor et al., 2000) refined probabilistic relationship models with class hierarchies specializing in different probabilistic dependencies for each subclass. (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004) introduced an author-theme model for documents, which implicitly examined the two relationships between documents and authors, as well as document and words. (Kemp et al., 2004) showed a relational model with latent classes. (Carbonetto et al., 2005) introduced the non-parametric BLOG model, which specifies non-parametric probability distributions over possible worlds defined by first-order logic. These models performed well in certain applications. However, most of them are limited to areas with simple relationships. The proposed model goes beyond that by taking into account several related entities. Furthermore, the non-parametric nature allows the complexity of the model to be tuned based on the available data set."}, {"heading": "3 The DAPER Model", "text": "The DAPER model (Heckerman et al., 2004) formulates a probabilistic framework for a database model of entity relations. The DAPER model consists of entity classes, relationship classes, attribute classes, and arc classes, as well as local distribution classes and constraint classes. Figure 1 shows an example of a DAPER model for a universe of students, courses, and notes. The entity classes specify classes of objects in the real world, such as Student and Course, which are represented as rectangles in Figure 1. The relationship class corresponds to the interaction between entity classes. It is represented as a diamond-shaped node with dashed lines associated with related entity classes. The relationship, Take (s, c) indicates that a student is taking a class c. Attribute classes describe properties of entities or relationships. Attribute classes describe properties of entities or relationships. Attribute classes are associated with the corresponding relationship class - a knotted line."}, {"heading": "4 Infinite Hidden Relational Models", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Hidden Relational Models", "text": "An example of a hidden relationship model is shownin Figure 2. The example shows a movie recommendation system with entity classes User and Movie and Relationship Class Like. In addition, there are the attributes UserAttributes, MovieAttributes and R (Rating) and various parameters and hyperparameters. The first innovation in our approach is to introduce a latent variable for each entity, referred to in the example as To and Zm. They can be regarded as unknown attributes of entities and are the parents of both entity attributes and relationship attributes. The underlying assumption is that if the latent variable was known, both entity attributes and relationship attributes can be well predicted. The most important result from the introduction of the latent variables is that information can now be propagated through the base network of interconnected latent variables. Consider the prediction of the ratio as an attribute R. If both the associated user and the movie have strong attributes known for the system, these attributes will determine the state of the system."}, {"heading": "4.2 Infinite Hidden Relational Models", "text": "The latent variables play a key role in our model, and in many applications we would expect the model to require a large number of states for the latent variables. Let's look again at the movie referral system. With little information about past ratings, all users could look the same (movies are liked or disapproved worldwide), with more information available, certain clusters could be discovered among users (action movie lovers, comedy lovers,...), but with an increasing number of past ratings, the clusters could have increasingly detailed structures that ultimately indicate that each person is an individual. Therefore, it makes sense to allow any number of latent states by using a Dirichlet procedural mixing model, which allows the model to decide itself on the optimal number of states for the latent variables. Moreover, the infinite hidden relative model can now also be seen as a direct generalization of a non-parametric hierarchical hierarchical approach."}, {"heading": "5 Sampling in the Infinite Hidden Relational Model", "text": "Although a dirichlet process model contains an infinite number of parameters and states, the sampling process assumes only a growing but limited representation. This sampling process is based on the Chinese restaurant process (CRP), where a state of a latent variable is identified as a cluster, i.e., a table in a restaurant. We will now describe how the CRP is applied to the infinite hidden relationship model. \u2022 The procedure differs from the standard model in that it samples the relational attribute in which two CRP processes are coupled. We will leave out the description of the sampling attributes applied to simple, given parameter samples. \u2022 The first user is assigned to the user cluster 1, Zu1 = 1; an associated parameter is generated, 1 Gu0. Similarly, the first movie is assigned to the movie cluster 1, Zm1 = 1; an associated parameter the first movie is generated and the second parameter is generated."}, {"heading": "6 Experiment on MovieLens", "text": "First, we evaluate our model based on MovieLens data, which includes movie ratings from a large number of users (Sarwar et al. 2000). The task is to predict whether a user likes a movie. There are two entity classes (User and Movie) and a relationship class (Like: User like movies). The user class has several attribute classes such as age, gender, profession. The movie class has attribute classes such as Published-year, genres, etc. The relationship has an additional attribute R with two states: R = 1 indicates that the user likes the movie and R = 0 indicates something else. The model is presented as Figure 2. In the data set, there are a total of 943 users and 1680 movies. In addition, user ratings of movies are originally recorded on a five-point scale ranging from 1 to 5. We transfer the ratings as binary, yes, if a rating is higher than the average user rating, and vice versa."}, {"heading": "7 Experiment on Medical Data", "text": "The second experiment concerns a medical domain. The proposed model is shown in Figure 3 (a). The domain comprises three entity classes (patient, diagnosis and procedure) and two relationship classes (Make: doctor makes a diagnosis and Take: patient takes a procedure). A patient typically has several attributes, including age, gender, PrimaryComplaint. To reduce the complexity of Figure 3 (a), patient characteristics are summarized as patient attributes (these attributes are not aggregated in learning processes and inferences). Diagnostic attributes contain the class of diagnosis specified in Figure 9 and the procedure attributes specified in CPT4."}, {"heading": "8 Experiment on Gene Data", "text": "In fact, we are in a position to go in search of a solution that is capable of resolving the problems that we have got to grips with."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions and Extensions", "text": "We hope that an infinite hidden relational model will be a useful complement to relational modeling by allowing flexible conclusions in a relational network that reduce the need for a comprehensive structural model search. We have implicitly adopted a particular sampling scheme, namely that entities are scanned independently from unspecified populations. In this context, our model allows generalization, but it may fail if this assumption is not reasonable or if the sampling method in the test set changes. We have focused on explicit modeling of the relationship between entity pairs, but our model can be easily generalized if more than two entities are involved in a relationship. In our future work, we will explore and compare various approximate inference algorithms."}], "references": [{"title": "Nonparametric bayesian logic", "author": ["P. Carbonetto", "J.
