In the case of two sequences, this property states that for two elements we have \u03bb, \u00b5 VP and each x, x, x, x, x) AEU ([\u03bb / x, \u00b5 / x \"] = \u03bb AEU (x) and each x, x\" AEU (x \"). This formula can, of course, be extended to any finite number of sequences. It is noteworthy that this is due to the axis of independence. In compound lotteries with two results, it means that for each < \u03bb, \u00b5 > in P2 and for any lottery \u03c0, \u03c0.\" This property implies that the AEU fulfils the dynamic consistency. Dynamic consistency is a very good property if it provides a nice decision-maker in any further step of decision-making (in the EU)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Autoduality of the Uncertainty Representation", "text": "The dual of prearrangement% S over events F is the relation% S T defined by \u0430 A > > F, A% S TB if and only if B% SA, where A and B denote the supplements of A and B. Of course, the dual of the dual of a prearrangement is the prearrangement itself. Dual% S is denoted as autodual if and only if for two events A and B, A% SB \u21d4 B% SA. For such autodual prearrangement, this means that A is more plausible than B if and only if the supplement of B is more plausible than that of A. Duality and autoduality can of course be extended to plausibility measurements. One plausibility measurement is the dual of another if their induced predictions about events are plausible to each other. As examples, the duals of necessity measurements (Dubois and Prade (1980)) and of faith and plausibility functions (Shafer 1976) are the other duals respectively."}, {"heading": "4.3 Autoduality of the Decision Criterion", "text": "The properties of duality and autoduality can also be specified on the basis of the preference relationship to actions. As the preference to the consequences is not assumed to be complete, broadening the definitions is somewhat difficult. We must assume that preferences to actions result from preferences to the consequences. For each preference% to actions A and each preference% X to consequences X, let% (% X) denote the preference to actions if the consequences are viewed in reverse order, i.e. bad results should be more attractive than good ones.

If the benefit allocation is concave, the decision-maker is risk-averse. He / she would prefer safe consequences to risky consequences. On the contrary, if the benefit allocation is convex, the decision-maker is risk-averse. Modeling basic benefit allocation versus risk depends on how the benefit allocation is subjected to the consequences. By designing basic benefit allocation, one can integrate the decision-maker's attitude into the decision-making model. Of course, this idea can be transferred to the AEU. Choosing basic benefit allocation allows the decision-maker to take into account the decision-maker's attitude. We illustrate this characteristic with a simple example. Let y1, y2, y3 have three consequences so that y1, Xy2, Xy3. Let \u03c0 = [bilix / y1, \u00b5 / y.3] Let yu = a basic benefit allocation."}, {"heading": "5 RELATED WORKS", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are able to integrate themselves, in which they are able to live, in which they are able to live, in which they live, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they"}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "We have provided two axiomatic justifications for a class of general expected usefulness, which we called algebraic expected usefulness. Our second axiomatization is of particular interest. Although it requires two solubility conditions, it is based on simple and natural axioms (prearrangement, non-triviality, weak independence and continuity), similar to those in Machina (1988) for the EU. Our general algebraic approach has enabled the unification of all predicted usefulness in an equal formalization. An algebraic expected usefulness can be constructed from any uncertain representation that meets our conditions, which is of particular interest to uncertainty representation, for which decision models have not yet been proposed. We have shown that the standard expected usefulness as a special case enjoys the EU."}], "references": [{"title": "A definition of subjective probability", "author": ["F. Anscombe", "R.
