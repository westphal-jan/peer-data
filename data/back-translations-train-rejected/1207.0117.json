In this paper we present a rules-based expert system used in the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. The expert system accepts input from the user and, depending on the patient's symptoms, diagnoses when the patient suffers from cerebral palsy."}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION1", "text": "With the advent of the latest technologies in computer and information technology, the relationship between humans and computers has reached a new level. Computer science is not limited to core areas such as networks [7], network security [1, 4, 6], databases [2], but is also used in many interdisciplinary areas such as biology [12], chemistry [3], medical diagnostics [11], etc. In this paper, we present a rules-based expert system for diagnosing cerebral palsy and classify it as mild, severe or moderate according to the symptoms presented by users. Expert system is the ability to replicate people's thinking and reasoning based on some facts and rules. Expert systems have a place in various sectors such as drug diagnosis, decision support systems, education and tutoring systems used in medical diagnostics."}, {"heading": "2. CEREBRAL PALSY OVERVIEW", "text": "Cerebral palsy is a non-progressive disease resulting from injuries in the foetal stage or in early childhood that results in postural, movement, gait and tonus deficits. Cerebral palsy restricts the patient's ability to perform full motor functions and restricts the patient's activities [15]. Statistics show that the number of children suffering from cerebral palsy varies between 1.5 and 4 per 1000 births. Cerebral palsy affects not only the state of health, but also economic conditions, since the medical costs for children with cerebral palsy are 10 times higher than for children without cerebral palsy or with other mental disabilities [5]. Depending on the symptoms of cerebral palsy, it can be classified as mild, moderate or severe. The primary symptoms of cerebral palsy are: 1 disease is not progressive. 2 Spasticity in patients without cerebral palsy or with other cognitive impairments of gait may be classified as mild, moderate or severe."}, {"heading": "3.

METHODOLOGY FOR DIAGNOSIS", "text": "Cerebral palsy is diagnosed on the basis of users \"answers to questionnaires. In order to assess the disease, each symptom is assigned a specific weight [17] and on the basis of this weight, a definitive cumulative weight value is calculated on the basis of which the disease is diagnosed."}, {"heading": "4.1 ALGO RITHM FO R CUMULATIVE WEIGHTAGE SCORE", "text": "The algorithm for calculating the weight value is: 1. The user of the system receives a questionnaire containing questions about the symptoms of the patient. The questions are asked in simple English without medical terminology for the convenience of the patient. The user of the system answers the questions with yes or no. A list of symptoms with the corresponding weight value is presented in Table 1. According to the user's input, each symptom is assigned the corresponding weight. For an affirmative answer, the weight is assigned as indicated in the table, while for a negative answer the weight value is assigned zero. 3. Assess the cumulative value of the patient's condition from the patient's reaction and normalize the value so that we get a percentage value according to the formula according to which Wi = weighting of symptoms with weight loss is between 66% and 16% (cerebral palsy) between 38% and 16% (cerebral palsy)."}, {"heading": "5. EVALUATION OF THE SYS TEM", "text": "The system showed accurate results when the specific symptoms of the test cases were given as user input. In addition, a number of parents who had already been diagnosed with cerebral palsy were asked for their input, and the system showed accurate results and diagnosed patients as having cerebral palsy and classified their illnesses accordingly."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this article, we discussed the design and implementation of a rules-based expert system for cerebral palsy diagnosis, which helps to diagnose cerebral palsy and classify it as mild, moderate or severe. In implementing this system, we took into account the most classic symptoms of cerebral palsy and weighted each symptom according to user feedback. The expert system can do much to support the decision-making process of health professionals and also help parents who have children with cerebral palsy to assess their children and take appropriate measures to manage the disease."}], "references": [{"title": "A Distributed Security Scheme for Ad Hoc Networks\", ACM Crossroads", "author": ["Dhaval Gada", "Rajat Gogri", "Punit Rathod", "Zalak Dedhia", "Nirali Mody", "Sugata Sanyal", "Ajith Abraham"], "venue": "Special Issue on Computer Security.
