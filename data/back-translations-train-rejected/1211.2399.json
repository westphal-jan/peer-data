This work inspired research in artificial intelligence [20], which led to the creation of a symbolic network of influence diagrams (NID) as representational formalism. NID is a formalism similar to the possible semantics of the Kripke models [21] and is a super-series of Bayesian games. The basic idea of NID is the modeling of human thought patterns in different SIs. Each node of an NID is a multi-agent influence diagram (MAID), which is a model of an agent's SI. MAID is an influence diagram (ID) in which each decision node is associated with an agent. ID is a Bayesian network (BN) in which one has common nodes, decision nodes, and use nodes. In summary, this approach assumes that human decision-making is possible in general games."}, {"heading": "3 Used Datasets", "text": "The first set of data selected for our data mining approach was already mentioned in our previous paper [19]. It is the game RPS played over a computer network; this game is easy to explain and most people do not train to play it at expert level; it is symmetrical, zero-sum game and two players. The study was conducted on threads of 30 one-shot games. A player had a delay of 6 seconds for viewing each shot. If he did not respond, the last or default gesture was chosen. One thread lasted an average of 22.7 years and 7 of them were male. They had to play the thread twice against another tester, which represents an equal probability distribution between the three gestures. At least you can see these MSE.Ten computer science students were recruited. They were on average 22.7 years old and 7 of them were male. They had to play the thread twice against another tester.

Therefore, each tupel has the length of 3 + 3 + 1 = 7. The simplification function is a window over three final rounds. There are 2187 possible tuples for RPS. Decisions made in the first three rounds of the game are not taken into account. Therefore, the size of the set is 540 tuples. The second set of data is also converted into a set of 371 tuples, in which each tupel includes the claimant's payout update, and the claimants Boolean repeat data. The implementations of classifiers provided by WEKA are used for cross-validating the two sets of tuples. For the first set, there are 45 classifiers available in the WEKA library that can handle multi-value nominal classes."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "Strategic behavior consists of observable actions, the origins of which are attempted to be understood as generally as possible. In summary, the SMO can find the most general deterministic hypothesis on regularities of human behavior in the scenarios studied. The correctness of such a hypothesis exceeds the figures reported in related work. SMO's hypothesis space is a complex function and can be used to formalize a formalism for describing game behavior."}], "references": [{"title": "Strategische Interaktion realer Agenten: Ganzheitliche Konzeptualisierung und Softwarekomponenten einer interdisziplinren Forschungsinfrastruktur", "author": ["R.
