In RoboCup there are several different types of leagues. Currently, in the case of RoboCup 2D Soccer Simulation League (2D RCSS), all aspects of the game of the best teams in the world are fairly real when compared with games between different humanoid teams, while the same does not apply to the case of the other leagues of RoboCup. In 2D football simulations, the rcssserver [19] establishes the reality of the simulated football world. Through UDP / IP, client agents have connected with this simulated reality."}, {"heading": "2 The Quantum Consciousness Soccer Simulator", "text": "The new concept of football introduced in this section is based entirely on assumptions and not on any direct observations and experiences. In general, six types of roles are distinguished in the simulation environment: players, referees, coaches, managers, supporters and supporters. In fact, in this paper, we focus only on two types of roles: players and supporters. The members of all roles are autonomous software agents, for example, in the sense of the paper. [6] In the following, we will use the terminology \"autonomous football agent.\" Each autonomous football agent is characterized by a function that acts as a power of will. For example, p, rplayer, w, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, p, etc."}, {"heading": "3 The First Reference Implementations", "text": "In the case of RoboCup, there are only players and coaches. In contrast, football fans also need to be treated in the newly introduced simulation environment. There is the main difficulty of implementation, as the number of followers can exceed 80,000. This is only partially a technical problem, as it also raises questions of principle regarding the heterogeneous composition of the followers. In terms of the technical problem, it may be a possibility to use CUDA [16] GPU, where device threads would correspond to the followers. To deal with heterogeneity, we can create different archetypes such as attackers, midfielders and defenders among the players. It should be noted that similar difficulties will arise in dealing with couch potato fans, as their number may reach hundreds of thousands. In this case, a Java-EE-based [13] solution could be explored.In this chapter, we will focus only on such an implementation, which will examine the development of the basics of the football game."}, {"heading": "3.1 An Experimental Implementation of the New Concept of Soccer", "text": "The clients are defined in the class QCSSAgent. The state vectors are abstracted from the class StateVector. This implementation can be found at SourceForge, at the address https: / / sourceforge.net / projects / qcss / [4], using the following modified definition of the selection procedure in the method void QCSSStadium:: select reality (void).Definition 7 (a modified selection procedure of the QCSS writer).Let rl-R be an autonomous football agent in the role of player or supporter (l = 1,..., n).Leave these {rj1 t \u2192,.., rjm t \u2192 rjz \u2212 rjz before the time t + j. At the time + we will not (1) the probability (1), the 1 (1) not (1)."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Further Work", "text": "During implementation, there may be the introduction of new roles such as ball or pitch, where the members of these new roles might know, for example, the motion equations of the Newton. However, it would be a mistake because, for example, the laws of motion would arise by themselves. At this moment, the agents included in the experimental implementation cannot play football. This implementation may only be used to test the performance and timing of the architecture. The next step is to program player and fan agents to play football. For example, the simplified algorithms of the FerSML platform can be used for the (subjective) implementation of the movement of players and their passports. With minimal customization, the FerSML platform can also be used to visualize the stream of the selected state vectors as a football game."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "It is undeniable that this essay has focused directly on football, but in fact it suggests much more than just football. This is an initiative to create a community of programmers who want to help develop successful QCSS-based football teams and QCSS-based football fan groups. We hope and believe that our new simulation concept can provide an exciting framework for studying concrete models for establishing reality and that it could become a standard cognitive problem, as RoboCup has become in the field of AI over the last 15 years. However, in order to return to football, the objective role of fans in the proposed new simulation model becomes apparent, and this objective role could explain the home advantage, because in the case of a home game it means that many home fans can watch the game in the home team stadium. Thus, the direct reason for the home advantage is simply the impact of the objective role of home fans."}, {"heading": "5 Acknowledgements", "text": "The author thanks Ja'nos Komzsik, Pe'ter Jeszenszky and Andra's Mamenya \"k for reading the manuscript and for correcting grammatical and spelling errors."}], "references": [{"title": "Footballer and football simulation markup language and related simulation software development", "author": ["N.
