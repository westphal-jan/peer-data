INTRODUCTIONAn expert system (knowledge-based) system is a problem-solving and decision-making system based on the knowledge of its task and logical rules or method of using knowledge."}, {"heading": "A. Knowledge Engineering", "text": "As described in [1], KR is the process of developing an expert system. It consists of three phases: Acquisition of knowledge: The process of obtaining knowledge from experts (by questioning and / or observing human experts, reading certain books, etc.).Knowledge representation: Selection of the most appropriate structures to represent knowledge (lists, sets, scripts, decision trees, object-attribute-value triplets, etc.).Knowledge validation: Verification that knowledge of IT is correct and complete."}, {"heading": "B. Types of Knowledge", "text": "Procedure: Describes how a problem is solved. It contains rules, strategies, agendas and procedures. Heuristic: It describes a rule of thumb that helps guide the thought process. Meta-knowledge: Describes knowledge of the efficiency of problem solving. Structural knowledge: It describes knowledge structures. It contains rule sets, concept relationships and concepts of object relationships. [2] Fact knowledge: It is verifiable by experiments and formal methods, tacit knowledge: It is implicit, unconscious knowledge that is difficult to express in words or other representations. Priority / Prior knowledge: It is independent of experience or empirical evidence, e.g. \"anyone born before 1990 is older than 15 years\" Posteriori / Posterior knowledge: dependent on experience or empirical evidence, since \"X was born in 1990.\""}, {"heading": "C. The Knowledge Representation", "text": "It is an area of AI research that aims to translate knowledge into symbols to facilitate inferences from these elements of knowledge and create new elements of knowledge, while knowledge (is an advance from data to information, from information to knowledge and knowledge to wisdom) and representation (is a combination of syntax, semantics and reasoning) [3]. There are two basic components of KR, namely thinking and inferring. Cognitive science is about how humans store and process information, and in AI the goal is to store knowledge in a way that programs can process it. [4]"}, {"heading": "D. Knowledge Representation Issues", "text": "In the following, the questions related to the representation of knowledge grain size - resolution Detail Scope Modularity Understandability Explicit Vs. Implicit Knowledge Procedural Vs. Declarative Knowledge.32 | P a g ewww.ijarai.thesai.org. KNTATION TECHNIQUESMany of the problems in AI require comprehensive knowledge of the world. Objects, properties, categories and relationships between objects, situations, events, states and time, causes and effects are the things that the AI must represent. KR provides the ability to represent all the things defined above [5]. KR techniques are divided into two main categories, which are declarative representation and processual representation. The declarative representation techniques are used to represent objects, facts, relationships. While procedural representation is used to represent the action of the objects, KR techniques are the declarative representation and representation."}, {"heading": "A. KRYPTON", "text": "The system consists of two modules: the Terminology Box and the Assertional Box. The Terminology Box or the Module is based on the language KL-ONE - a representation system based on semantic networks and frames [7]. The KRYPTON-like language was developed mainly from the work of KLONE. Difficulties in presenting assertive knowledge via KL-ONE convey the idea of integrating a theory prover and a KL-ONE-like language into a hybrid system. It is essentially like a \"tell-ask\" module. All interactions between a user and a KRYPTON knowledge base are mediated by TELL and ASK operations, the feature introduced in Figure 2.The most important feature introduced by KRYPTON is the idea of a functional approach to knowledge representation [8]: KRYPTON is equipped with a clear, implementation-independent description of the services provided to the user."}, {"heading": "B. KANDOR", "text": "The basic units of KANDOR are individuals and frames. The Knowledge Model for KANDOR is given in Fig. 3. Individuals are assigned to objects in the real world, and frames are assigned to groups of those individuals. These units are manipulated by the standard representational structures of frames, slits, constraints, and slit fillers that are common to most frame-based systems. Each slot maps individuals into values that are called slit fillers. There are two types of frames: primitive and defined. To be an instance of a primitive frame, an individual must be explicitly defined as an instance of the frame in KANDOR; they simply look like descriptions of some individuals. There are two types of frames: primitive and defined. To be an instance of a primitive frame, an instance of a primitive frame must be explicitly specified whether a frame is defined as an instance of the frame when it is created."}, {"heading": "C. BACK", "text": "A key aspect of BACK implementation is the balance of the formalities involved. Although the reasoning in hybrid systems is often incomplete (due to efficiency requirements), it sometimes leads to situations where a formalism allows to express something that should obviously have an impact on another formalism according to the semantics of the system, the incompleteness of the reasoning must be countered by these effects that can be realized by the system. (ii) The formalisms of this type of system are referred to as \"unbalanced.\" The main criteria to be taken into account in the development of the BACK system [16] are the following: (i) the sub-formalisms of the system should be balanced, (ii) theformalism should allow feasible consequence algorithms that cover almost all possible conclusions, (iii) the enforcement box formalism should represent incomplete knowledge in a limited way, (iv) the system should be considered incremental (inconsistent)."}, {"heading": "D. KL-TWO", "text": "The KL-TWO system consists of two subformalisms: PENNI, a modified version of the RUP system (Reasoning Utility Package), and NIKL (New implementation of KLONE), a terminological argumentation approach in the tradition of KL-ONE [7]. These two formalisms complement each other: PENNI is able to present propositional assertions without quantification, and NIKL allows the representation of a simple class of universally quantified sentences. These sentences can be applied 34 | P a g ewww.ijarai.thesai.org in PENNI in order to expand its propositional language with a limited form of quantification. Fig. 4 shows the architecture of KL-TWO [12]. PENNI formalism consists of a database of propositional assertions referring to the structure of KL."}, {"heading": "E. CAKE", "text": "The CAKE system was developed as a knowledge representation and argumentation tool for the programmer's apprenticeship project [13], which differs from the hybrid systems previously presented. CAKE does not present complementary representation formalisms, in which different types of knowledge are represented, but it uses its two formalisms to represent the same knowledge.The two formalisms present in CAKE are: a predicate accounting package based on the RUP (Reasoning Utility Package) system, and a specialized semantic network like the formalism used to represent the structure of programs.This last formalism, called plan diagrams, or simply plans, was developed with no particular concern for formal semantics, but was designed only to meet the requirements of the program representation problem.The current architecture of CAKE consists of shaft layers: the bottom five layers that constitute the precalculation layer (or the three)."}, {"heading": "F. MANTRA [14]", "text": "Developed by J. Calmet, I. A. Tyandra and G. Bittencourt in 1991, it is a combination of four different knowledge presentation techniques: first-order logic, terminological language, semantic networks and production systems. All algorithms used for inferences are decidable, because this representation uses the four-value logic. Mantra is a three-layered architectural model. It consists of the epistemological level, the logical level, the heuristic level.

FRORL", "text": "The acronym for FRORL is Frame-and-Rule Oriented Requirement Language [14], developed in 1992 by Jeffrey J. P. Tsai, Thomas Weigert, and HungChin Jang, and this FRORL is based on the concepts of frames and production rules that were designed primarily for software requirements and specification analysis. Six main steps for processing are as follows: 1) Identifying subjects and theme2) Defining object frames. 3) Defining object frames that are not limited to physical units. 5) Defining object properties. 6) Defining actions and communicationThere are two types of frames, i.e. object frames and activity frames. Object frames are used to represent the unit of the real world that is not limited to physical units. These frames act as a data structure. Every activity in FRORL is represented by activity frames that are a prerequisite for changing the world."}, {"heading": "H. Other Hybrid Systems", "text": "The other hybrid systems are a very ambitious project developed at USC (California, USA). It includes a terrain classifier, an instance mediator, a rules-based system.
