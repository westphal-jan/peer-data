Introduction", "text": "Different approaches exist for the task of deriving the temporal evolution of multiple sources based on common observations (Mahler, 2007; Van Gael et al., 2008), which are generally based on a model in which sources are continuously observable, in the sense that they are expected to emit / return observations at each step in time (although there may be evidence), but there are different types of sources for which observations are inherently intermittent, and for which this intermittent has temporal structure that can be characterized as a point process. Examples include acoustic event sequences such as birdsong or footsteps (Wang and Brown, 2006), Internet access protocols (Arlitt and Williamson, 1997), pulsars in astronomy (Keane et al., 2010), and neural firing patterns (Bobrowski et al al al al al., 2009). Intermittent observations are often not distributed with the sparse imaging techniques that are only a representation of time."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "To our knowledge, this particular problem has not been addressed directly in the literature, but temporal data is most often treated with a model of sources that continuously or synchronously update to an underlying temporal sampling rate. Relevant formulations for our purposes include the infinite factorial hidden Markov model (infinite FHMM) by Van Gael et al. (2008) or the probability hypothesis density filters (PHD filters) (Mahler, 2007), both of which describe an unknown number of independent Markov sources. FHMMs assume that the underlying sources are non-intermittent throughout their lives, and that they persist throughout the observation period. Pragmatically, intermittent emissions can be handled by including standstill states, although the duration of such states cannot assume arbitrary distribution."}, {"heading": "2.

However, the noise cluster differs qualitatively from the MRP clusters, and the transitions within the MRP sequences are the latent features of primary interest, so we focus our weighting yardsticks on signal / noise separation and transitions. Below, our statistics are based on the standard F measurement (Witten and Frank, 2005, Chapter 5), which summarizes precision and retrieves it as follows: F = 2 \u00b7 Precision + Recall Precision (6) = 2t + (2t + f \u2212 f + f + f +)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Synthetic Experiment", "text": "In fact, most people are able to recognize themselves and understand how they have behaved."}, {"heading": "4.3 Birdsong Audio Experiment", "text": "Many natural sound sources generate signals with structured patterns of emissions and silence, such as birdsong or footsteps. If emissions can be modelled as MRP from such a source, then our follow-up method should be able to separate several simultaneous \"streams\" of emissions. In the following experiment, we investigated the ability of our conclusion to perform this separation in data derived from audio signals containing several cases of a common bird species in many European countries, the Common Chiffchaffinch (Salomon and Hemim, 1992). Chiffchaffinch song consists of sequences of typical length of 8-20 \"syllables.\" Each syllable is a pitch that consists of a chirping downwards to a short tone in the range of 5-8 kHz. Syllables are separated by about 0.2-0.3 seconds. To our knowledge, the exact tone sequence has not been studied in detail; it appears to be a short-term dependence and therefore to be analysed in the margins."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 Data Preparation", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to play by the rules we have set ourselves in order to fulfil them."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Inference from Audio Mixtures", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced a specific cluster problem, namely the separation of time-stamped data derived from multi-point processes and confusing noise. We have developed an approach to derive structure from data generated by a mixture of an unknown number of similar Markov renewal processes (MRPs) and independent noise. In a synthetic experiment, we have shown that inference can work very well even under high noise conditions (up to \u2212 24 dB SNR). In an experiment with birdsong audio data, we have also shown strong performance, although dependent on the quality of the underlying representation, to restore events from audio data. Our method is general and has very few free parameters. The conclusion in the present work is limited to models without a hidden state and with only uniform Markov dependence. These limitations result from the comparative models, which are in contrast to the previous models in the MMRP class."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "(Acknowledgements will be added in the final version)"}], "references": [{"title": "Internet web servers: Workload characterization and performance implications", "author": ["M.F.
