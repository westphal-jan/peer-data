In the classification and cluster analysis of textual data, the vector model of text documents is widely used, where these documents are represented as vectors in a phase space [Pantel and Turney, 2010]. The text frequency of words forms the basis of this space. An important task is to find the optimal vector subspaces of documents for the classification and cluster analysis of text documents [Sebastiani, 2002; Forman, 2003]. The problem lies in particular in the selection of keywords whose text frequency can be used as input parameters for text classifiers with satisfactory precision. Solving this problem optimizes the required number of calculations and the precision of a classifier in data mining. Various parameters are used in the classification analysis to determine the classification potential of each word."}, {"heading": "Genetic Optimization of the Basis of Documents Vector Space.", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to set out in search of a new home."}, {"heading": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "The paper describes the genetic optimization of keywords whose frequency is the component of document vectors that function as attributes in text classification analysis.The genetic optimization was performed on the basis of the volume of words that represents the fraction of the frequency dictionary with predefined frequency boundaries.The frequency dictionary was formed on the basis of analyzed text arrangements of English fiction.
