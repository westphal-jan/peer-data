INTRODUCTION", "text": "It is one of the most important areas of research in computer vision. Human tracking in monitoring applications and aircraft tracking in military applications are known to be important areas of multi-target tracking. Multi-target tracking comprises two main stages: 1) Poseestimation and 2) data association. Kalman filtering and net-based methods are the most important methods for estimating poses used in linear systems with Gaussian noise. For linear-Gaussian systems, Kalman filtering is an analytical and optimal method used for pose estimation. Unlike Kalman filtering, the particle filtering method can be used in non-Gaussian systems with non-Gaussian noise. This is the most important advantage of particle filtering over other methods. Estimulation of manoeuvring target targets is one of the most important problems in pose estimation."}, {"heading": "2. PARTICLE F ILTER", "text": "If the system is linear and the system noise is not Gaussian, an approximation method should be used. Here, one of the most common numerical and approximation methods for estimation is sequential Monte Carlo [9]. This technique is known as Particle Filter [10] or Monte Carlo [11]. Suppose Xt denotes the state of the target at the time t, and Ztdenk denotes the set of all measurements at the time. The main idea in particle filtering is the representation of the probability distribution function (pdf) by a series of weighted samples. Suppose that () {} (), | 1,..., n nS s, n, N \u2212 aserized values at the time. The main idea in particle filtering is the representation of the probability distribution function (pdf) by a series of weighted samples."}, {"heading": "3. SIR PARTICLE FILTER", "text": "One of the major challenges in implementing the SIS particle filtering algorithm is the appropriate choice of the weight density function ().q. This function is used in the scanning step. Pose accuracy is increased by increasing the similarity between the weight density function and the post-density function. Another problem in implementing the particle filter is the degeneration problem. After repeated iteration of the particle filter algorithm, some of the particles have a very low weight, which means that some of the particles have no influence on the calculation of the post-density function. This is a disadvantageous event. There are two solutions to overcome the degeneration problem: 1) Appropriate choice of the weight density function 2) keying. Both of these solutions are used in the SIR approach. State transition function is considered as an importance density function. () () () 1) 1 | 1, then an optimum (ampliz = 6) function."}, {"heading": "4. TARGET REPRESENTATION MODEL", "text": "In this thesis, the state of each target is represented by a rectangle. The center of the rectangle denotes the current state of the target, and the dimensions of the rectangle are adjusted by the size of the target. Fig.1 shows the representation model of the targets. In this figure, xH and yH are dimensions of the surrounding rectangle of the target object, and (), x y denotes the current state of each target. The model of each target consists of the state of the target and the dimensions of the surrounding rectangle. If changes in the model exceed the specified threshold, the target model is updated. If the target model is updated, both the target state and the dimensions of the corresponding rectangle are updated."}, {"heading": "5. SYSTEM DYNAMIC EQUATION", "text": "In this essay, we used videos from the real world. These videos were extracted from real airshow videos taken from the Internet. In these videos, the camera is movable. A sudden movement of the camera causes unwanted movements in the trajectories of targets. Therefore, a discrete random process is considered as a state transition equation for each target. In the state model, the state transition equation is defined as the following. () () 1 |, tt t tX X - = + (9), where () 0, t pB noise is a two-dimensional Gaussian noise."}, {"heading": "6. LIKELIHOOD FUNCTION", "text": "In this study, we used the combination of two functions to define the Likelihood function: The first function calculates the probability according to the difference between the corresponding pixel ray scale mode [1 6]; the second function calculates the probability of corresponding regions using a color histogram in RGB mode [1 3]; the Likelihood function is defined as follows: () () 2int | it t ensity colorp z X p = + (11) In Section 6.1, the grayscale module is explained briefly and an equation for calculating the color scale is defined; in Section 6.2, the RGB module is introduced and an equation for calculating the color scale is defined."}, {"heading": "6.1. Grayscale Module", "text": "The difference in the intensity of the corresponding pixels is used to calculate the similarity between the sregion of the target and the region of each particle. If S is the number of pixels within the region of the target and j C is the number of pixels within the region of the j-th particle, then we calculate the similarity of these regions using the following equation [18]: () 1intI i ijix yT CH Hensity p e = \u2212 \u2212 \u00b7 \u2211 = (12) where xH and yH are the dimensions of the rectangular region of the target, and I the number of pixels within that region."}, {"heading": "6.1. RGB Module", "text": "In some studies, a color distribution model is used as a measurement model [14]. This model is anq = 8 \u00d7 8 histogram in the RGB color space. This histogram is calculated for the rectangular region of the target. The distance of each pixel from the center of the region affects the values of the histogram. In [14], the interval (0.255) is divided into 8 equal parts, and an 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 histogram is used. To reduce computational complexity, we use a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 histogram. In this color distribution model, the effectiveness of each pixel decreases to values of the histogram as it is placed far from the center of the region. \u2212 Epanechnikov core function is used to specify this property in the histogram, which is defined as follows: () 21 10r k k k rotherwise \u2212 < = (13) where r is the distance of each pixel from the center of the region."}, {"heading": "7. DATA ASSOCIATION", "text": "The data association algorithm associates the available measurements with the objectives captured. In cluttered environments, some of the obtained measurements can arise from clutter. A data association algorithm must recognize the measurements that arise from clutter. Some of the important data association algorithms are Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN), Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) and Multi Hypothesis Tracking (MHT). GNN is a more efficient algorithm for opaque environments. Our selected videos in this study had a static background and our tracking environment was opaque. We used GNN as a data association algorithm. Each measurement is assigned to the next track in the GNN algorithm. Optimal association minimizes the sum of distances between each measurement and its counterpart. The optimal association can be achieved by means of a cost matrix and an optimization algorithm."}, {"heading": "8. DEFORMATION DETECTION", "text": "In such a case, the old target weight allocation model is not efficient, and using a static target tracking model does not produce good results. MM is a commonly used approach to solving this problem. In this paper, a dynamic model is used to improve the results of the SIR algorithm in multiple maneuvers. If changes in the target model exceed the specified threshold, the model should be updated, and the old target model is replaced by a new one. Deformation detection is done using a color histogram described in Section 6.2. After several frames, the targets under consideration are detected again using a background subtraction algorithm, and the color histogram is replaced by a new one for the region of each detected target."}, {"heading": "9. CONDITIONS OF EXPERIMENTS", "text": "Our proposed DDPF algorithm and the basic SIR algorithm are implemented by MATLAB 2011 (b). These algorithms are tested on a system with configuration: CORE i7 CPU, 4GB RAM and 1GB Geforce VGA. The videos from the real world are selected to test our proposed algorithm. These videos are extracted from parts of real airshow videos. The format of these videos is \"mp4,\" and their dimensions are 240 x 320. It is assumed that the number of targets in these videos is constant and predetermined. To detect the targets, a subtraction algorithm is used in the background, as the selected videos have a partially static background. Background of selected videos should be reclusion. Our proposed DDPF method is suitable for tracking in a confusing environment."}, {"heading": "10. COMPARISON", "text": "In this section, we compare the results of our proposed DDPF algorithm with the basic SIR particle filtering algorithm when maneuvering targets multiple times. Fig.2 shows that the basic SIR-PF algorithm is unable to track the maneuvering of targets without using a dynamic model for targets. Fig.3 shows that the DDPF algorithm efficiently tracks the maneuvering targets. Comparison results show that the basic SIR-PF algorithm misses targets when rotation or scaling occurs in the target model, while the proposed DDPF method solves this problem by updating the model when rotation or scaling occurs."}, {"heading": "11. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION", "text": "In this paper, we propose the DDPF method by applying a dynamic target model in the SIR-based particle filtering algorithm to track multiple manoeuvre targets. Results show that the basic SIR-PF algorithm is unable to efficiently track the various manoeuvre targets when rotating or scaling in the target model, while the DDPF method will be able to track multiple manoeuvre targets more robustly. Our studies showed that the results are very sensitive to parameter settings, and extending this approach to include adaptive parameters is being considered as our future work. One of the problems in tracking multiple manoeuvre targets is the occlusion problem. Solving the occlusion problem to improve the results of the proposed approach is our other future work."}], "references": [{"title": "N", "author": ["A. Doucet"], "venue": "J. Gordon and V.
