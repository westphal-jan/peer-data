In fact, content still consists exclusively of pages linked by links whose non-trivial words are indexed together with metadata from search engines that allow correspondence between them and those inserted by the user to be found. Thus, despite the high efficiency and precision of the algorithms involved, such machines represent a \"dumb\" example of information retrieval, where the consistency between terms, even when they are advanced, outweighs their significance.

The basic idea is that each resource (concept, class, property, object, value, etc.) can be uniquely described by simple properties or by value properties identified. All of this allows to schematize an RDF model using an oriented graph whose nodes represent primitive objects and whose edges identify properties. RDF's limited vocabulary is extended by RDFS (RDF schema), which makes it possible to define classes and properties in a more powerful way. For example, it is possible to define a property as a relationship by specifying its domain and / or range, or to say which class is a subclass of another. From a data-structural point of view, an RDF graph can be viewed as a group of triples of type (subject-predicate object)."}, {"heading": "1.5 Ontologies", "text": "OWLontologies further expand the vocabulary of RDFS. 8 If RDFS guarantees universality and precision in the construction of knowledge representation, with OWLwe we we achieve such expressivity that we can \"argue\" about described information and \"extract\" more, through reasoning. It provides powerful tools to define classes (which represent concepts), properties (relationships between classes) and individuals (their instances), and gives the chance to combine them into logical constraints by means of which necessity and / or sufficiency can be expressed. OWL is composed of three sublanguages with increasing expressivity: OWL Lite, OWL DL and OWL Voll. The first two have an almost complete correspondence between two peculiar DLs (resp. SHIF) and SHOIN (D)."}, {"heading": "1 THEORETICAL FUNDAMENTALS 6", "text": "Metamodeling, along with some new constructs that increase their expressiveness, and extends support to data types. As for sublanguages, we can deal with Full and OWL 2 DL in OWL 2. As already mentioned, the latter corresponds to the sROIQ (D) logic. Although the former can be considered syntactically as a union of the latter with OWL 2 DL, it is semantically compatible with OWL 2 DL (insofar as its semantics allow to draw all conclusions that can be drawn by using the semantics of OWL 2 DL). Similar to the analog sublanguage OWL 1 Full, OWL 2 is applied in modeling concepts where no argumentation is required. A new feature of OWL 2 is the use of profiles (i.e. fragments of language) OWL 2 EL, OWL 2 QL and OWL 2 RL: 11 is the first useful for applications that contain large quantities of QL, or are not structurally oriented to such applications."}, {"heading": "1.6 Syntactical correspondence of OWL(2) with DLs", "text": "In terms of its practical representation, an ontology is an RDF / XML-structured text file, but for our purposes it is more useful to look at it in the form of an RDF diagram and hence of triples. Table 1.3 describes the correspondence between the most common constructs of DLs and those triples (or, if necessary, a single resource) that use the RDF (S) syntax along with that of OWL (2). It also contains the names given by OWL to the basic concepts and roles of DLs. It is interesting to note how a DL construct often coincides with many triples, which sometimes makes the interpretation quite difficult. _: x and _ list symbols in Table 1.3 each point to an empty node and a list (a structure that we will not deal with), while the prefixes before the elements of triples represent standard W3C namespaces that serve as abbreviations for the URIs they refer to."}, {"heading": "1.7 SPARQL", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have had in the past, and they will be able to play by the rules they have had in the past."}, {"heading": "1 THEORETICAL FUNDAMENTALS 7", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2 ANALYSIS AND RESULTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 The family DL<\u2200\u03c00>", "text": "Description logic derived from decideable fragments of set theory, generally referred to by the notation DL < LANGUAGE _ NAME >, is of considerable importance. The logic family underlying this class of ontologies, the subject of research on which this project is based, focuses on the fragment that has good significance in application in the real world, and the interest it arouses relates to the completeness of its decision-making process in some cases of practical relevance.

To do this, it is necessary to query as many publicly available ontologies as possible quickly and efficiently. SPARQL queries are conveniently used for this purpose. Management is provided by dOWLphin, a Java library specifically designed to easily load the ontologies and prepare the queries. The underlying library is Jena, one of the most common API collections for the Semantic Web, which is very handy because it can handle triples directly. As a front-end GUI, the QuAny program, also created within the experiment, was used to query against local and remote ontologies and store the corresponding results on the hard disk for future verification."}, {"heading": "2.3 Results and future objectives", "text": "The query was used to test a significant number of ontologies of the BioPortal, the web portal of the National Center for Biomedical Ontology. This choice was not random, but was motivated mainly by two reasons: the first concerns the large number of ontologies present on the portal and coming from sources of biomedical resources around the world; the second refers to the connection that these ontologies have with the real world in general and with human life and medicine in particular, which are areas that offer several suggestions for reflection on the extent to which knowledge of such important topics can be schematized and presented, and, above all, the role that reasoning could have in the automatic conclusion of new information. Approximately 30% of the ontologies resulted from members of the DL < 0 > language, which raises good hopes for an argument for them, since \u2212 remember \u2212 w.r.t. shows computational complexity in the NP application area."}, {"heading": "A ANALYSIS OF THE SPARQL QUERY", "text": "As we see in the implementation, writing what an algorithm could do through a list of well constructed statements is not an immediate operation; the final query is the result of various logical lines of reasoning regarding the conversion of DL < 0 > constructs into those of RDF (S) / OWL (2) that are appropriately applied to some testosterone."}, {"heading": "A ANALYSIS OF THE SPARQL QUERY 11", "text": "In fact, it is not that it is a purely economic matter, but rather that it is a purely economic matter, in which it is a purely economic matter.
