The 7 inputs represent the different structural features calculated from each image. Each of the 49 training sessions forms a fuzzy inference system with 16 fuzzy rules. Each input received two general bell curve membership functions and the output was represented by two linear membership functions. The outputs of the 49 training sessions are condensed into a single output representing the system output for this input picture.The data set is divided into two categories: training data and test data. The training data set consists of images of all four types of tumour. These training samples are grouped into four different regions, namely white matter, grey matter, cerebrospinal fluid and the abnormal tumour region using the Fuzzy C Average (FCM) algorithm. The cluster centre of the tumour region for all four classes is monitored and stored."}, {"heading": "2.5 Training Algorithm", "text": "There are several training algorithms for feed-forward networks. Gradient is determined by a technique called back propagation, in which the computing power is executed backwards through the network. The simplest implementation of back propagation learning adjusts the network weights in the direction in which the performance function decreases faster. An algorithm used in this work is extracted from [25]."}, {"heading": "2.6 Performance measures", "text": "All classification results could have an error rate and occasionally either detect no anomaly or identify an anomaly that does not exist. It is customary to describe this error rate using the terms true and false positive and true and false negative as follows: [8] True Positives (TP): the classification result is positive in the presence of the clinical anomaly. True Negatives (TN): the classification result is negative in the presence of the clinical anomaly. False Positive (FP): the classification result is positive in the presence of the clinical anomaly. False Negative (FN): the classification result is negative in the presence of the clinical anomaly. Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) * 100% specificity = TN / (TN + FP) * 100% accuracy = (TP + TN + TN) / (TP + TN + FN) * 100% accuracy"}, {"heading": "3. RESULTS", "text": "4. Conclusion: This paper examines the application of ANFIS for the classification of brain tumors in MRI. Experimental results provide promising results for ANFIS as an image classifier. The classification accuracy of ANFIS as shown in Fig. The future scope of this work is to improve the ANFIS architecture in order to achieve a high classification accuracy and to measure the thickness and volume of the tumor."}, {"heading": "5.
