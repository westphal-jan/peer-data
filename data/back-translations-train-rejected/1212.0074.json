Its nearest, better known relative is Persian. Kurdish is spoken in Kurdistan, a large geographical area spanning the intersection of Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria. It is one of the two official languages in Iraq and has a regional status in Iran. Although there are 20 to 30 million speakers, Kurdish is one of the less well-equipped languages, and very few tailor-made tools for editing texts in this language are available. Similarly, it has not received much attention from the IR and NLP research communities, and the available literature can be summarized as a few attempts at creating a corpus and lexicon for Kurdish [2,8]. In order to provide the basic tools and techniques for processing Kurdish, we have recently launched a project at the University of Kurdistan (UoK 2). This paper gives an overview of the main challenges we need to address in this project."}, {"heading": "2 Challenges", "text": "We have divided the most important challenges into five groups: While the first two groups deal with the diversity aspect of the Kurdish language, the third and fourth focus on processing difficulties and the last examines the depth of Kurdish's scarcity of resources."}, {"heading": "2.1 Dialect Diversity", "text": "The first and most important challenge in the processing of Kurdish texts is their dialect diversity. In this paper, we focus on Kurmanji and Sorani, who are the two most important Kurdish dialects in terms of number of speakers and degree of standardization. [3] Together, they account for more than 75% of Kurdish native speakers. [8] The characteristics that distinguish these two dialects are mainly morphological in nature (the phonological differences are explained in the next section); the important morphological differences are [5,3]: - Kurmanji is more conservative in maintaining both gender (female: male) and case position (absolute: oblique) in nouns and pronouns. Sorani has largely abandoned this system and uses pronominal suffixes to take over the functions of the cases."}, {"heading": "2.2 Script Diversity", "text": "For geopolitical reasons, each of the two dialects mentioned uses its own writing system. In fact, Kurdish is considered a two-standard language [2], with Kurmanji written in Latin letters and Sorani in Arabic letters. Both systems are almost entirely phonetic [2]. As already mentioned, Sorani and Kurmanji are not morphologically identical, and since these systems reflect the phonology of their corresponding dialects, there is no bijective correlation between them. In Figure 1, we have included three tables to demonstrate the non-trivial correlations between these two writing systems. It should be noted that the table in c) contains approximate equivalences, which correspond to the list proposed in [4]."}, {"heading": "2.3 Normalization", "text": "The unicode mapping of the Arabic-based Kurdish alphabet has two potential sources of ambiguity that should be handled carefully: 3 Although there are signs of a weakening of gender differences in some variants of the Kurmanji [3]. - For some letters such as ye and ka, there is more than one Unicode [7]. During the normalization phase, the occurrences of these multi-code letters should be unified. - As in Urdu, the isolated and definitive forms of the Arabic letter ha consist of one letter (pronounced e), while the initial and middle forms of the same Arabic letter represent another letter (pronounced h) for which a different Unicode encoding is available [8,2]. In many electronic texts, these letters are written only with the ha, distinguished by the use of the zero-width non-carpenter, which prevents a character from being associated with its successor. This distinction must be taken into account in the normalization phase."}, {"heading": "2.4 Segmentation and Tokenization", "text": "Segmentation refers to the process of recognizing the boundaries of text components, including sentences, phrases, and words. Compared to Persian and Arabic, this process is relatively simple in Kurdish, mainly because short vowels are explicitly represented in Kurdish writing systems.In fact, as discussed in [1], the lack of short vowels contributes most significantly to the ambiguity in the Arabic language, causing difficulties in homographic resolution, word deciphering, and recognizing parts of the language.In Persian, its negative consequence is more visible in recognizing Izafe constructs [7].Despite the inclusion of short vowels, the Arabic-based Kurdish alphabet still suffers from two problems inherited from the Arabic writing system: - the Arabic alphabet has no capital letters, making it more difficult to recognize sentence boundaries and designated entities. - Space is not a deterrent boundary and entity."}, {"heading": "2.5 Lack of Language Resources", "text": "Kurdish is a resource-poor language for which the only linguistic resource available on the web is raw text [8]. Specifically, Kurdish still does not have a comprehensive and reliable generic / domain-specific corpus, despite the few attempts to build a corpus [2] and lexicon [8]. Moreover, a test collection - indispensable for evaluating information retrieval systems - or a containment algorithm for Kurdish is still lacking. Finally, Kurdish, although well served by dictionaries [3], still lacks a WordNet-like semantic lexicon."}, {"heading": "3 Conclusions", "text": "As the examples in [2] show, when going from Kurmanji to Sorani, the \"same\" word can go through several levels of change at the same time: writing systems, phonology, morphology, and sometimes semantics. This clearly shows that the mapping between these two dialects is more than translation, though less complicated than translation. Any word processing system designed for the Kurdish language should develop and exploit an mapping between these two norms. On the technical side, providing the necessary processing techniques - by using existing techniques or, if necessary, developing new techniques - offers many opportunities for future work. However, a core set of language resources must first be available as a crucial prerequisite for most of these tasks. At UoK, we have taken the first step and are currently building a large standard test collection for Kurdish language."}], "references": [{"title": "Arabic Natural Language Processing: Challenges and Solutions", "author": ["A.
