In particular, we discuss different types of explicit permissive norms that work as exceptions to opposite obligations. Moreover, we show how strong permissions can be represented both with, and without introducing a new consequence relation for inferring conclusions from explicit permissive norms. Finally, we illustrate how a preference operator applicable to contrary-to-duty obligations can be combined with a new operator representing ordered sequences of strong permissions which derogate from prohibitions. The logical system is studied from a computational standpoint and is shown to have liner computational complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Dec 2012 07:36:46 GMT  (61kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0079v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["guido governatori", "francesco olivieri", "antonino rotolo", "simone scannapieco"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.0079"}, "pdf": {"name": "1212.0079.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 121 2.00 79v1 [cs.L"}, {"heading": "1.

All the discussion about the calculation bases of permission in definaprapracticable rules is represented by the definition of rules, whose conclusions are usually followed when defeated by evidence to the contrary.

Finally, we illustrate how a preference operator applicable to contrary-to-duty obligations can be combined with a new operator representing ordered sequences of strong permissions which derogate from prohibitions.
