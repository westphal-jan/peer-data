Also, changing the \"discrete time range\" of that description, allowing a continuous time that is more natural for most scientific applications, leads us to a class of computer model languages rather than programming languages: Compositional stochastic modeling (CSM) languages. Such languages have many attractive properties for modeling processes in the real world: a close correlation between computer and physical semantics, a systematic method to derive algorithms for sampling, inference, and model reduction, and relevance for new perspectives in biocomputing and abstract mathematics, among others.Unfortunately, the leap between continuous and discrete time seems like a big one - all the more so when a continuous space is allowed for modeling purposes."}, {"heading": "2 Operator algebra approach to CSM", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only be a matter of time before it is so far, until it is so far, until it is so far."}, {"heading": "2 Relat ionship to probabil ist ic programming", "text": "A discrete time semantics has been defined in [1], which essentially discards the real weighted event times in a DG without differential equations (a stochastic parametrized grammar or SPG).With this semantics, SPGs actually comprise an expressive probabilistic programming language. If another PP language can be reduced to SPGs, it can be transferred (efficiently) to DGs by restoring the missing event times using calls to an Erlang distribution with parameters that must be calculated anyway for the discrete time SPG semantics. In the opposite direction, DGs can be reduced to Turing machines that include plential number generators, since simulation engines for DGs exist."}, {"heading": "3 Relevant applicat ion domains", "text": "The type of compositional stochastic modeling language discussed here has potentially broad applicability due to the additive compositivity of its semantics (parallel processes have added time-evolutionary operators), which, along with its continuous time model, ensures close convergence of computer-aided semantics and dynamics in scientific domains (physical, electronic, biological, social, etc.). Algorithms for simulation, inference, and model reduction follow. Biological applications have been demonstrated with models of gene regulation, molecular complexes in synapses, and tissues that include plant and animal stem cell niches with cell division and diffuse growth factors. A schematic example of such stem cell application is the dynamic grammar of Figure 1, which is explained more fully in [6]. Other SPG-like \"rule-based\" biochemical modeling languages have been applied to a variety of biological modeling problems."}, {"heading": "4 Further Discussion", "text": "One criterion for meaningful universality in a formal modeling language is that language should be inferred under \"expected\" modes of model reduction. Model reductions in physics often switch from deterministic to stochastic dynamics or back, from discrete to continuous variables, or vice versa - so we have proposed a framework that encompasses all of these variations, including hybrids. Strangely, model reductions often assume infinite boundaries; the approximation of integral molecular numbers through continuously evaluated concentrations is one example; another is the spatial continuity of PDE models, which actually consist of discrete atoms and molecules."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "[1] Mamiolsness E. and Yosiphon E. and Yosiphon G (2006): \"Stochastic Process Semantics for Dynamical Gramsci.\" [2] Yosiphon, G.
