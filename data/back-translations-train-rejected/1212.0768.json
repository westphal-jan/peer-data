Introduction", "text": "Imagine that you are driving your car and that a truck is in front of you on the road, the engine is stopped, the rear door is safely opened and the furniture for a nearby apartment is unloaded. As the lane of your car is delimited by a continuous line and a sidewalk, you must not overtake according to traffic regulations. You are then doomed to wait until the truck has finished its unloading, a process that might consider you to be an unsafe, probably long, time limit. To take a second example, imagine that you are about to reach a roundabout, but that the car in front of you has stopped in the lane, probably with an engine problem, such as a power failure that has led you out of an unsafe, probably long, time limit by a continuous line and a sidewalk, imagine that you are waiting behind the broken car until that car can be moved again, probably with an engine problem, such as a power failure."}, {"heading": "2. Model", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Context", "text": "Among the possible approaches to modeling traffic situations, there are more and more symbolic approaches that use ontologies [3] [12] [18]. The basic idea is that a high level, symbolic representation (knowledge) is useful to think about traffic situations associated with perception, path planning and kinematic control - see [1] about cooperating vehicles that integrate these two approaches. More generally, ontologies are introduced into mobile erobotic systems (e.g. OROCOS [16]). Other approaches use vehicle-based ad hoc networks (VANETs) to model sensors and actuation in each vehicle and the communication between them (V2V) or with the infrastructure (V2I) [14] [15]. In our approach, we also use vehicles that are equipped with sensors and actuators and that can communicate with others and the infrastructure."}, {"heading": "2.2 Ontologies", "text": "In computer science (as opposed to philosophy, where the term \"ontology\" has a different definition), anontology can be defined as the specification of the conceptualization of a domain of knowledge. [10] For example, the diagnosis of infectious diseases is a domain of medical knowledge; the associated concepts form the conceptualization; the description of these concepts by Anda in a formal language represents its specification. An important characteristic of an ontology is its completeness: an ontology should cover the entire domain of knowledge, i.e. not leave concepts behind. Anontology can also be defined as a complete semantics network, emphasizing that it consists of a hierarchy of concepts. In practice, an ontology is expressed as classes, attributes and individuals. Tools are available to graphically create / edit an ontology (e.g. PROT\u00c9G\u00c9 [17], SWOOP [20] and Ontology (WL)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Proposed model", "text": "The proposed ontology represents the vehicle (intelligent vehicle and other vehicles), the infrastructure and traffic regulation (see Fig. 1). Based on the modelling of all the concepts associated with traffic regulation, we have not found any ontology dedicated to it (e.g. A3MEfocuses only on the movement of the vehicle [3]). Only newspaper articles report accidents in the case of traffic regulation. Therefore, we have our own, not based on a body of text, but on the experience of the driver (member of the laboratory with his driver's license) and their own reactions to traffic regulation. More precisely, a vehicle is symbolically represented by the name (\"car\" class), an internal class (\"DriverEmotion\") and its possible characteristics (\"motion\" class, with subclasses \"CurrentMotion\" and \"NextMotion\")."}, {"heading": "3. Results", "text": "The approach in Section II is implemented with the theontology editor PROT\u00c9G\u00c9 version 4 [17], using the easoner PELLET version 2.2.0. Follow-up rules are expressed in SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) [11]. We present first the associated static knowledge (i.e. classes, properties and individuals), then edynamic knowledge (i.e. follow-up rules) and finally examples."}, {"heading": "3.1 Classes, properties and individuals", "text": "The environment of the CyberCar is represented by the class \"Infrastructure\" (see Fig. 2). The main element is the class \"RoadNetwork,\" which represents roads / roads and intersections as graphs, the former being corners and the latter edges (borrowed from [18]). For example, two nodes (i.e. \"RoadNode\" individuals) can be connected to another intersection by a road (i.e. a \"RoadConnection\" individuals), or even by two lanes (i.e. two \"RoadConnection\" individuals), the lane up and down - a two-lane connection connects the two nodes. The immediate dividing lines of each \"RoadConnection\" individuals are represented by the class \"ZoneOnTheSide,\" i.e. sidewalks, zebras, continuous lines and line lines. The first two are subclass of the \"DrivableZone,\" i.e. at the level of the subclass of vehicles they are not physically considered a subclass."}, {"heading": "3.2 Inference rules", "text": "The development of a symbolic situation should only be described in terms that are sometimes true and sometimes false, depending on the time they are in. (An example of how such a situation can occur.) But, although the \"imperfect\" driver exhibits a certain behavior, in a sense he cannot see himself able to represent the formal foundations of ontologies, ismonotonous and others that represent the current value of a term, the truth of what is going on in it. Typically, SWRL [11] cannot represent a rule: IF and C THEN not (D). That is, in DL, things can only be incorporated into the current ontology, and never withdrawn from it.Facing this limitation, we have chosen to discredit time, i.e.reason on time steps and represent the reasoning of an intelligent vehicle in two consecutive steps:"}, {"heading": "3.3 Examples", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where there is only one person who is able to take care of another person who is able to take care of another person."}, {"heading": "4. Discussion", "text": "The definition of a topological world model in order to derive the next movement of an intelligent vehicle from it, in order to assist drivers in terms of traffic regulation, raises a multitude of questions: 1. How long does it take a driver to cope with the situations described in Section I to decide to cross a continuous line? On the one hand, it is prohibited to cross this line by traffic regulation (the aim is to respect traffic regulation), but on the other hand, he remains trapped for too long in his lane behind an unloading truck / broken vehicle, which is either inappropriate (the aim of maintaining traffic, e.g. reaching point A.) The time it takes to overtake a discharge of the truck / broken vehicle is related to the way in which a driver finds an acceptable trade with this conflict - this could be coded as a driver dependent threshold on the elapsed time, in terms of the \"hasEum\" property section 3.2, for example, the psychology section 3.2."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "This model consists of an ontology that represents vehicles, infrastructure, and traffic regulation (implemented in OWL with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [17]), and follow-up rules (implemented in SWFD [11]) that calculate the next movement of an intelligent vehicle in discredited time. Cases have been presented for relaxing traffic regulation that demonstrate a realistic behavior of the intelligent vehicle. Future work will include (1) the representation of traffic regulation as rules that infer the legality / illegality of the potential movement of an intelligent vehicle; (2) the integration of ontology, an argumentation paradigm about safety, as a context definition of perception / control through uncertainty; and (3) the porting of ontology to CyCab platforms. The authors thank our colleagues from the IMARA team for numerous fruitful discussions. We thank Timothy Redmond (Stanford) for help with prot\u00e9g\u00e9, helpful, and anonymous comments."}], "references": [{"title": "A Scheme for Coordinating Multi-Robot Planning Activity and Plans Execution", "author": ["R.
