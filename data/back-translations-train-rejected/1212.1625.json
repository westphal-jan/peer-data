Originally geospatial in nature, AgreementMaker has since been extended to include many types of matching algorithms, enabling it to handle a wide range of applications. In addition to its use in practical applications, the AgreementMaker system has been tested in the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) competition. AgreementMaker's development focused in particular on the anatomy task, which consists of matching between the Adult Mouse Anatomy and the NCI Thesaurus, which describes human anatomy. In this task, AgreementMaker was the most powerful system, both in OAEI 2010 and OAEI 2011. While the AgreementMaker system did not compete in the OAEI 2012, a BERUEON-ON comparison was used based on the configurations used for OAEI 2011 and OAEI 2011."}, {"heading": "2 Methods", "text": "The AgreementMaker system was configured as submitted to the OAEI in 2011 [2]. In addition to testing the AgreementMaker with the version UBERON used in the OAEI in 2011 (release 2011-08-31), we also tested a newer version of UBERON (release 2012-08-14) [3]. We tested the AgreementMaker system on the anatomy task of OAEI 2012, using the reference orientation of the competition to evaluate its performance."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "The results of the AgreementMaker system in the anatomical task of OAEI 2012 are presented in Table 1. As expected, the results obtained with the configurations submitted to the OAEI 2011 are consistent with the results of this competition, as no changes have been made to the ontologies or the reference orientation for the task. Results obtained with the updated ontology of UBERON showed a slightly lower precision, but a 0.9% higher recall and thus a higher F measurement. Compared to the systems participating in OAEI 2012 (Table 2), recall and F measurement of AgreementMaker are only second behind those of the GOMMA-bk Matcher [4]. Furthermore, the AgreementMaker is only 0.1% F measurement under GOMMA-bk when using the newer version of UBERON, and although its recall 3.5% is lower, its precision is 3.5% higher."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions", "text": "The results that AgreementMaker has produced in the anatomy task indicate that if it had competed at the OAEI 2012 with exactly the same system that was submitted the previous year, it would still have taken second place in this task (F-scale). Furthermore, the performance of AgreementMaker, although the development of AgreementMaker last year did not focus on the anatomy task, would still be one of the best in this task. Future development of the AgreementMaker system should focus in particular on improving memory, as it was significantly below GOMMA-bk in this regard. Strategies for this could include the use of additional meditologies or other external data sources such as Wikipedia, whereby the development of AgreementMaker should also focus on efficiency, as several systems have completed the anatomy task within a minute."}, {"heading": "5 Acknowledgments", "text": "DF, CP, ES and FMC were financed by the Portuguese FCT through the SOMER project (PTDC / EIA-EIA / 119119 / 2010) and the multiannual funding programme for LASIGE.
