In this case, no limits or specific limitations were applied to the joint angle, the system was left free to find a solution, and fitness is simply the minimum distance between the end segment and the target point.

The joints are actuated by a servomotor, which includes its control with a built-in PID controller. Walking is achieved by generating a swivel motion of leg 1, while leg 2 is used to support the robot, and a swivel motion of leg 2, when leg 1 is the support. In our case, the following steps were performed during robot prototyping: First, we build a simple two-legged robot with only three degrees of freedom on each leg. Subsequently, the robot parameters, including segment size, servo masses were measured. Real robot movements were reported to the IK-PSO algorithm."}, {"heading": "5. DISCUSSION AND FURTHER WORKS", "text": "The IK-PSO algorithm, Inverse Kinematics PSO, is based on a forward kinematic model, a specific formulation of the PSO, and a fitness function to provide the inverse kinematics solution of a robotic system. IK-PSO generates a series of solutions, each in a particle, then calculates the forward equivalent target position of a particular point, the COM for a walk, and returns the best one. The algorithm could solve any inverse kinematics problem while applying it here to the flywheel leg of a two-legged robot, before extending it to the global walkway, where a simplified inverse pendulum model is used to estimate the COM position. This position was then given to the IKSO to generate the required motion joints to create the required motion joints."}, {"heading": "6.
