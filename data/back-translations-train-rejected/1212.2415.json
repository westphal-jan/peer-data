As we see in the table, the detection performance does not increase if the number of characteristic points is greater than 50.Table 2 shows the result of the comparison between the paper method and EGBM in the case that the number of characteristic points is fixed, if the detection performance is caused by the ability to remove it from the table \u2212 as is possible by the weakening of the table."}], "references": [{"title": "Face Recognition in Subspace", "author": ["G.
