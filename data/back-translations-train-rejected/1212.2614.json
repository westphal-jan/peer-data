(On the contrary, man-made systems are associated with goals achieved through the provision of services.) The most important parts of a man-made system are probably the assessments that represent the effectiveness of a system whose effectiveness is linked to the general fuzzy model developed above. The advantages and disadvantages of these measures are also discussed and an application to the problem-solving process is presented in order to increase its effectiveness. The amount of information achieved through an action can be measured by reducing the uncertainty resulting from this action."}, {"heading": "4. Modelling the Process of Mathematical Modelling", "text": "In previous work, we have developed models similar to the above general model for a more effective description of multiple situations with fuzziness and / or uncertainty in the fields of education (for the processes of learning and problem solving), artificial intelligence (for case-based and analogical reasoning) and management (for the evaluation of fuzzy data obtained through research and decision-making). See, for example, [15] and their references. Notice also that Subbotin et al., based on our fuzzy model for the process of learning [12], applies the \"centric\" method for comparing the mathematical learning abilities of students and the measurement of scaffolding skills (support) effectiveness provided by teachers, while Perdikaris (3], uses the total uncertainty of uncertainty and Shannon entropy for the measurement of geometric skills."}, {"heading": "5. Applications of the Model for MM", "text": "The following two experiments took place recently at the Technological Education Institute (T.E. I.) in Greece. = Results for membership in the MM group: 1 = 6 = 6 = 6. In the first of them were 35 students from the School of Technological Applications, i.e. future engineers, and our basic tool was a list of 10 problems (see appendix) given to them for solving (time allowed 3 hours). Before starting the experiment, we gave the students the correct instructions, which among others emphasize that we are interested in all their efforts (successful or not) during the MM process, and therefore they must keep records for all of them, at all stages of the MM process. This manipulation enabled the students to obtain realistic data from our experiment for each stage of the MM process and not only those based on the final results of the students, which could normally be achieved by completing their examinations. Our characteristics of the students in each stage of the M process were less successful than if they achieved M-positive results:"}], "references": [{"title": "Fuzzy Sets, Uncertainty and Information", "author": ["G.J.
