To capture non-Poissonian features, in order to fix the inevitable inherent irregularity, researchers rescale the time axis with tedious computational overhead instead of searching for another distribution. Spikes or action potentials are precisely-timed changes in the ionic transport through synapses adjusting the synaptic weight, successfully modeled and developed as a memristor. Memristance value is multiples of initial resistance. This reminds us with the foundations of quantum mechanics. We try to quantize potential and resistance, as done with energy. After reviewing Planck curve for blackbody radiation, we propose the quantization equations. We introduce and prove a theorem that quantizes the resistance. Then we define the tyke showing its basic characteristics. Finally we give the basic transformations to model spiking and link an energy quantum to a tyke.

That's about 300 points. We use a simple performance measure to count the points that match. On average, we have 280 points that match. This corresponds to over 97% of the curve points, as shown in Figure 4. Future work has many dimensions. One possible direction is to answer the question: What is the relationship between the problem class that is solved by the current model and the class of problems solved by chaotic stochastic models? If the two classes are equivalent or there is an association between them, there is no need to hybridize neural networks with blurred sets, coarse sets or chaos. Another future direction of work is to study how to exploit other quantum physical equations, such as Vienna suggested quantum networks for the spectrum that was correct, or the range of chaos."}], "references": [{"title": "Synaptic modification of correlated activity: Hebb\u2019s postulate revisited", "author": ["G.
