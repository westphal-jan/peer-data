An example from India", "text": "It is very common in India to mix languages in social media posts, such as this example from Twitter, which uses a mixture of Hindi and English: # saale government ki # maakiaankh # kutteke bacche social networking sites bandh karega ek # madharchod ka # gaand maro # bhenchodThis translates as: # bad-boy government's # eye-of-mother # son-ofdogs want social networking sites closed each and every # motherfucker's # ass be raped # sisterfuckerA recent analysis of social media, which aims at an emotional analysis, would deal with the topic of the post aimed at the mood. In this case, it is an alleged government proposal to close down social media sites. In this post, \"government\" and \"social media sites\" are in English, but the words expressing the desire to ban these sites, and the author's attitude to do so, are based on Hindi social media analysis, including many regional languages that each of these sites would have to contribute significantly."}, {"heading": "C.

Existing natural language processing techniques are either based on words as units or use units such as grams only for basic classification tasks. How close can a machine come to reasoning about the meanings of words and phrases in a corpus without using any lexicon, based only on grams? Our own motivation for posing this question is based on our efforts to find popular trends in words and phrases from online Chinese social media. This form of written Chinese uses so many neologisms, creative character placements, and combinations of writing systems that it has been dubbed the \u201cMartian Language.\u201d Readers must often use visual queues, audible queues from reading out loud, and their knowledge and understanding of current events to understand a post. For analysis of popular trends, the specific problem is that it is difficult to build a lexicon when the invention of new ways to refer to a word or concept is easy and common. For natural language processing in general, we argue in this paper that new uses of language in social media will challenge machines\u2019 abilities to operate with words as the basic unit of understanding, not only in Chinese but potentially in other languages.", "creator": "cairo 1.10.2 (http://cairographics.org)"}}}
