It allows one to gather proof statistics related to shapes of goals, sequences of applied tactics, and proof tree structures from the libraries of interactive higher-order proofs written in Coq and SSReflect. The gathered data is clustered using the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms available in Matlab and Weka. ML4PG provides automated interfacing between Proof General and Matlab/Weka. The results of clustering are used by ML4PG to provide proof hints in the process of interactive proof development.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Dec 2012 21:06:34 GMT  (1381kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3618v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 8 Jul 2013 05:19:38 GMT  (504kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3618v2", "In Proceedings UITP 2012,arXiv:1307.1528"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO", "authors": ["ekaterina komendantskaya", "j\\'onathan heras", "gudmund grov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.3618"}, "pdf": {"name": "1212.3618.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Machine Learning in Proof General: Interfacing Interfaces", "authors": ["Ekaterina Komendantskaya", "J\u00f3nathan Heras", "Gudmund Grov"], "emails": ["katya@computing.dundee.ac.uk", "jonathanheras@computing.dundee.ac.uk", "G.Grov@hw.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "C.
