RELATED WORK", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "III. FRAMEWORK DEFINITION", "text": "The framework used in this work differs from those in the literature; the time horizon considered is from the current time up to 2 hours, which is referred to the strategic phase in air traffic control; the idea behind the strategic phase is to bridge the gap between air traffic flow management (ATFM) and air traffic control (ATC) on the one hand, and the gap between the ground, approach and route phases on the other. It is referred to as the gate-to-gate solution; the ATFM is responsible for validating flight plans throughout the day, taking into account the capacity constraints of the sectors, while the ATC is responsible for ensuring the separation of aircraft and minimizing delays; the idea behind the strategic phase is to take into account the information from the ATC and accurately predict the future sector load; then regulations or clearances can be applied to incoming flights to respect sector capacity and reduce the complexity of the ATC-level, in other words to use the current information."}, {"heading": "IV. SYSTEM OVERVIEW", "text": "This section explains the reasons for the proposed way to manage uncertainty and to optimize the state of airspace on different time scales.The time range is from the current time up to 2 hours.The geographical scope is in the order of several centers in a congested area, e.g. European airspace. The system consists of three processes: modeling, monitoring and optimization. The modeling receives new flight plans and creates a Bayesian network for each flight plan once and for all (in particular, all possible alternative routes are known at the time of creation).The periodic monitoring adjusts the parameters of the model according to real-world observations. This process ensures that the model of the actual situation is consistent with reality, a critical problem for accurate prediction in the sample. The optimization process optimizes the current situation by proposing changes to the flight plans to achieve an optimal state."}, {"heading": "B. Trajectory Model", "text": "This is a natural choice, as it is a DAG consisting of random variables (RV) and their conditional dependencies. A node is equivalent to an RV and an edge between two nodes. Compared to other approaches from literature, BN is a framework that deals directly with uncertainty. Some continuous distributions can then be used to draw conclusions when new information arrives over time. For more information on BN, see [16]. Compared to other approaches from literature, BN is a framework that deals directly with uncertainty. Some continuous distributions can express a number of scenarios that potentially include an infinite number of parameters that are mainly used to close unobserved variables, and thus it is used to predict the arrival time at the following measurement points. Many algorithms exist to do the following. Learning is also an important topic in BNs."}, {"heading": "C. Monitoring", "text": "Finally, the monitoring process is responsible for maintaining a unified model of the actual situation of airspace. Information from radars, aircraft and weather centres can be taken into account to estimate the values of the distributions of the random variables of the BN. The task of this process is filtering, which estimates the current value of past observations. In practice, the monitoring changes the PDFs and integrates observations of the overflight time by creating conditional PDFs. For example, when a flight takes off, the exact departure time disappears in known and the 15 minutes of uncertainty. This must be taken into account in subsequent optimization phases."}, {"heading": "V. OPTIMIZATION", "text": "Now that we have an airspace model, we want to optimize overflight time to reduce the likelihood of congestion for each sector and minimize the delays resulting from the regulations, by defining an optimization problem that has an objective function of minimizing decision variables and constraints."}, {"heading": "A. Objective function", "text": "For the purposes of optimization, objective functions must be defined. Indeed, the interests of each of the airspace actors are often contradictory or poorly defined. A cost index quantifies the benefits of a trajectory for an airline. Normally, this cost index is not communicated explicitly to air traffic controllers, so integrating airline preferences into the model at this point can be difficult. Nevertheless, the original flight plan is intended to reflect the interests of the airlines and is actually validated by the CFMU. Let A be the vector of the arrival time for each flight that is normally specified by the airline. With our airspace model, we can obtain an estimate of this value with the expected arrival time: A-f = E (Tf, a) = E-tfTf, a (t) dtConsequently, the cost function will punish the delay of the arrival time."}, {"heading": "B. Decision Variables", "text": "The decision variables model two types of regulations. The first is the diversion rule, which changes the path of the original flight plan. In this case, we simply choose to maintain the original route or choose an alternative in the series of possible routes for a particular aircraft. Once an alternative is selected, the BN must be changed and the conclusion recalculated. This process has a calculation effort and an operational effort in terms of complexity. Therefore, the change of these decision variables is punished. Nevertheless, when we observe the change in the cost function with various alternatives, we can assess the robustness of the solution by diversion. Furthermore, it can be a means to evaluate whether a diversion strategy is suitable to reduce the cost function of a flight. Furthermore, it allows to model the uncertainty around a weather phenomenon that will require the diversion of a flight. Once the diversion decision variables are set, the arrival times at the measuring stations are affected."}, {"heading": "C. Sector Constraint", "text": "Sector constraint can be used as hard or soft constraint. In the first case, a workable solution must meet Pr (Ci, [t0, t1] > ci) \u2264, i.e. the probability that sector i is overloaded during the time interval [t0, t1] is below a threshold. In the second case, the soft constraint will be part of the objective function to minimize the probability that a sector is overloaded."}, {"heading": "VI. EXAMPLE", "text": "In this section we present a toy example of the use of airspace, because it is unknown whether the structure is then given. This will allow us to understand the limits of a theoretical approach with very simple PDFs and will be translated by using approach methods that are easier for computer-based simulations. So, let us imagine the case of two planes following the same flight plan. The sequence of waypoints is: 1-2-3-4. 2 is an arrival time for both flights is simultaneously 46-4. Also, let us choose a capacity of 1 aircraft for sector S1 and 3 is an outgoing waypoint of sector S1. Table 1 indicates the parameters of the uniform distribution of the entered PDFs. The expected arrival time for both flights is simultaneously 46-4. Also, let us choose a capacity of 1 aircraft for sector S1. Figure 1 shows the resulting BN, where the blue nodes of the trajectories and the large yellow nodes of the sector are."}, {"heading": "VII. MONTE-CARLO APPROACH", "text": "From this example, we can see that working with PDFs with a symbolic approach to calculation can quickly become cumbersome. Consequently, we will rely on Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the sector congestion PDFs. [17] We know that a Monte Carlo method applies the fact that: 1N \u2211 i = 1 f (x (i) a.s.N \u2192 \u221e \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2192 \u2022 X f (x) p (x) dxwhere x (i) is a sample from the PDF p (x), an unbiased estimator that will almost certainly approach the expected value according to the law of large numbers. In our case, scenarios with trajectory samples are created for statistical analysis of the expected arrival time and sector occupancy. The scenario is complete if it gathers one scanned trajectory per flight plan. This method gives as output a series of M scenarios D = profiles [1]."}, {"heading": "A. Stochastic Optimization Problem", "text": "The goal of modeling a stochastic optimization problem is to eliminate uncertainty about the results of a system by taking into account the most likely ones. In our system, this is done using the Monte Carlo simulation that generates scenario D. The optimization process includes a separate copy of the airspace model to evaluate the solutions without affecting the monitored airspace model. Subsequently, the optimization process starts from the actual situation as a standard solution and generates a new set of parameters for the model. One possible stop criterion for this iterative process is monitoring the value of the cost function and stopping whenever it remains stable for a predefined period of time. This stop criterion should work even if we do not have enough information about the landscape of the cost function."}, {"heading": "B. Sector Constraint Approximation", "text": "As already mentioned, an estimate of the congestion probability can be the ratio between the number of scenarios in which the sector is not overloaded and the total number of scenarios. This probability is calculated for each time window, thus creating a stochastic process. Thus, a finer discretization has a cost in the number of estimated random variables in this stochastic process. An efficient method of estimating this stochastic process is to determine the time intervals in which the flight is located in a sector. This is simply with the recorded times at the entry and exit points of the sector. Afterwards, we can count the number of intervals that overlap with the time period and compare it with the threshold."}, {"heading": "C. Objective Function Approximation", "text": "In the Monte Carlo approach, the objective function landscape is not directly explored, but approached through a large number of simulations. In this case, it is often more relevant to maintain a pool of good solutions, since one solution is better than another with a certain probability alone. Finally, regularization conditions in the objective function will probably be necessary to obtain realistic solutions; the diversion must be penalized because it adds a workload to the controller and the pilot; the mobile home resources should also be modified only slightly and consistently, due to their flexibility, to minimize the number of changes in flight behavior; and finally, the deviation should always reflect the uncertainty of the system and be integrated into the objective function. These considerations will be easier to take into account in the Monte Carlo approach due to its flexibility. More generally, it is very likely that several different objectives will have to be considered for realism; most likely, the optimization problem will become multi-objective - even if the final output of the optimization process is planned in the context of the optimization process."}, {"heading": "VIII. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES", "text": "A new system was presented to deal with the uncertainty, complexity and sub-optimality. The novelty of this system is to define the trajectories as stochastic objects, i.e. parts of a Bayesian network. Afterwards, these objects evolve with the real system and are updated through a monitoring process to obtain a consistent model of the actual situation. From this model, an optimization process determines the optimal configuration of the airspace towards which the system should move. The optimal airspace is communicated to the controllers in the form of targets on the trajectories. This model is compatible with the current air traffic control system and does not imply a complete reorganization of the control centers. This approach prepares future improvements based on the work in SESAR and NEXTGEN projects by facilitating 4D trajectory integration in order to minimize the uncertainties, thus increasing the system relevance."}, {"heading": "IX.
