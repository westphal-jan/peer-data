This model is then used within a trajectory prediction tool. Finally, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) optimization algorithm is used to tune five selected parameters, and thus improve the accuracy of the model. Incorporated within a trajectory prediction tool, this model can be used to derive the order of magnitude of the prediction error over time, and thus the domain of validity of the trajectory prediction. A first validation experiment of the proposed model is based on the errors along time for a one-time trajectory prediction at the take off of the flight with respect to the default values of the theoretical BADA model. This experiment, assuming complete information, also shows the limit of the model. A second experiment part presents an on-line trajectory prediction, in which the prediction is continuously updated based on the current aircraft position. This approach raises several issues, for which improvements of the basic model are proposed, and the resulting trajectory prediction tool shows statistically significantly more accurate results than those of the default model.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Dec 2012 14:17:16 GMT  (118kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3998v1", "SESAR 2nd Innovation Days (2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "SESAR 2nd Innovation Days (2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SY", "authors": ["areski hadjaz", "ga\\'etan marceau", "pierre sav\\'eant", "marc schoenauer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.3998"}, "pdf": {"name": "1212.3998.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Online Learning for Ground Trajectory Prediction", "authors": ["Areski Hadjaz", "Ga\u00e9tan Marceau", "Pierre Sav\u00e9ant", "Marc Schoenauer"], "emails": ["areski.hadjaz@thalesgroup.com", "gaetan.marceaucaron@thalesgroup.com", "pierre.saveant@thalesgroup.com", "marc.schoenauer@inria.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of the functionality of the Decision Support Tool relies directly on an accurate TP: controller posting, workload estimation, arrival sequences, loss of separation detection and conflict resolution, to name the most prominent.

MODEL", "text": "The system describes the transitions between the different modes depending on the states and the control laws. Following the mode, a given differential equation is integrated to obtain the trajectory. In this section, the assumptions are explained, the model is defined, and an integration scheme for generating the trajectories is given."}, {"heading": "A. Assumptions", "text": "Depending on the requirements of the simulation, it is possible to select different degrees of difficulty for the coordinate systems and the aircraft control system. Considering only the ascent phase, the system will develop in a short time in a limited geographical area. On the basis of these considerations, we assume that the model of the flat earth represents a reasonable approach (cf. [18]). This model assumes that the earth is flat and non-rotating and can be defined as an inertial frame of reference. In addition, the gravitational force is constant and perpendicular to the ground. The atmosphere rests relative to the earth and atmospheric properties depend solely on the altitude. With these assumptions, one can define the differential equations of kinematics and dynamics. In kinematics, the equations merely imply that the displacement is proportional to the speed projected on the vertical or horizontal plan. For the dynamics, we have to modulate the thrust, the resistance, the lift and the weight."}, {"heading": "B. Total-Energy Model", "text": "This section is based on the BADA 3.10 User's Manual [3]. BADA is based on the total energy model, in which the working speed corresponds to the rate of potential and kinetic energy. Here, the rate of ascent is determined by controlling the speed and throttling. From [3] p.14: eq.3,2-7 and by converting the quantities into functions of height h, velocity V and mode q, the rate of ascent is defined by: h (V, q) = T (h) \u2212 \u2206 TT (h) [(Thr (h) \u2212 D (V, h))) \u00b7 Vm \u00b7 g \u00b7 f (V, h, q) (1), in which the function T (h) in BADA 3.10 User's Handbook [3] p.10, Thr (h) at p.22, D (V, h) at the variation V (V, h, q) at p.15-16. As a first approximation, the mass, i.e. the phase, i.e. the acceleration V, is not the acceleration (i.e. the acceleration)."}, {"heading": "C. Mode Definition", "text": "In this section we define the modes and their transitions based on the BADA 3.10 User's Manual [3]. First, we leave Q = {CAS, MACH} \u00b7 {LOW, HIGH} \u00b7 {DEC, CST, ACC} the mode space. The first two modes, transition height and tropause, depend exclusively on the height: q1 (h) = {CAS, if h \u2264 Htrans MACH otherwiseq2 (h) = {LOW, if h \u2264 HIGH otherwiElsewhere Htrans is the transition height and Htrop is the troppause geopotential pressure height. Finally, the last feature q3 is the mode of acceleration. The simplest controller of this mode is: q3 (V, h) = ACC, if the transition height and Htrop is the troppause height and Htrop is the tropausal pressure height."}, {"heading": "D. Trajectory Generation", "text": "In order to simulate the system, one must specify eq.1 and eq.2 as functions of time = q = 1. With regard to BADA, let Thr (h (t), t) = Thr (h (t))), D (h), V (t), t (h), V (t) and T (h (t), t) = T (h (t))), i.e. the development of thrust, temperature and deceleration are time invariant. Furthermore, the aircraft dynamic functions must be specified in relation to the flight envelope curves (t). In this study, we choose a nominal thrust function. In eq.1, Thr is replaced by the maximum thrust force Thrmax and the whole equation is multiplied by a reduced lift coefficient Cred, which should give realistic profiles (cf. [3] p.24)."}, {"heading": "E. Parameter Tuning", "text": "Now that the trajectory generator is defined, we would like to adjust the model parameters according to the observations. First, there should be a trade-off between the number of parameters and the ability of the model to approximate real trajectories. Instead of using the standard thrust controller defined in [3], we tried to find the optimal acceleration controller for a given trajectory. However, the resulting controller was a bang-bang control function, in which we observed that the mode switches between acceleration and deceleration at each time step. This function can clearly approximate any real trajectory, but is not generalized from one trajectory to another and does not reflect the real behavior of the aircraft. Therefore, eq.1 and eq.2 and the velocity plan V \u0432 determine the parameters m, V1, V2, M and \u0445T to determine the trajectory optimization parameters, as they are discrete from a control law."}, {"heading": "F. Black-Box Optimization", "text": "As already mentioned, the parameter tuning refers to the non-convex black box optimization, and several methods could be used to address it. In addition, there is no information about the modality of the objective function with five parameters. In fact, it is unimodal if the mass parameters or the differential temperature are the only ones that need to be tuned. These have an effect on the entire track. But the speed parameters have local effects depending on the speed scheme. In addition, the differences between the speed parameters will induce acceleration phases that transform the track. Determining the best value for a speed parameter that fits locally into the track will create a local optimum that could be worse than finding the two speed parameters that avoid an acceleration phase that is not undertaken in reality. Even if we do not prove that the objective function is multimodal, we may think that it may be the general case (or at least the goal may not be)."}, {"heading": "IV. MODEL VALIDATION", "text": "This section covers both the empirical validation of the nominal model and the estimation algorithm used to adjust the parameters to the entire trajectory."}, {"heading": "A. Dataset", "text": "To validate our model, we use a dataset composed of 262 real trajectories of the A320. These trajectories were recorded by a radar system over a month. For a trajectory, there is a data vector every 5 seconds consisting of the aircraft position, climbing rate and actual flight speed. Afterwards, the top point of the ascent is calculated as the first highest point of the trajectory. In addition, for more than 30 seconds, these trajectories do not exhibit a zero climb rate, they must reach a travel level of at least 300 FL and their duration is at least 1100 seconds. These filter conditions allow trajectories to be maintained that are not affected by altitude clearance."}, {"heading": "B. Methodology", "text": "To evaluate the model, we evaluate the positioning error between the TP and the real trajectory. Let H (\u03b8; s0) be the order of the altitude differences caused by the simulation of the hybrid system with the parameters \u03b8 = [m \u2206 T V1 V2 VM] T and the initial condition vector s0 = [t0 q0 h0 V0] T. Then the measurement quantity is simply the sum of absolute errors. In the case of the parameter estimation, in the realisable space of the parameters we look for the point \u03b8 that minimizes this measurement quantity. Thus, we have the optimization problem: \u03b8 i, j = argmin \u0442 j \u2211 n = i | H (s0) n \u2212 Tn | (3), where H (\u03b8, s0) is the order of the ordered altitude differences achieved for given parameters, and the initial conditions s0 and T is the order of the observed altitude differences."}, {"heading": "C. Results", "text": "Table I shows the evolution of the mean errors and the standard deviation over time for both models: with nominal values and with concerted values. The first important evidence is the inaccuracy of the total energy model to model the positions at the beginning of the trajectory. In fact, the errors at the concerted values are not sufficient to capture this complexity. Furthermore, the optimization of the equation has a global scope and so the errors generated by local behaviors of the aircraft are quickly ignored at the beginning of the trajectory and the selected five parameters are not sufficient to capture this complexity. Furthermore, the optimization of the equation has a global scope and so the errors generated by local behaviors of the aircraft are ignored in favor of general behavior. This directly depends on the selected values values of i, j in the execution phase i, j, which in this case are i = 0 and j = ttoc, where tc is the time at the top of the ascent."}, {"heading": "V. ONLINE TRAJECTORY PREDICTOR", "text": "In this section, we present an online trajectory prediction using the observed positions of a current flight to simultaneously optimize the parameters of the model to predict the rest of the trajectory. Various types of algorithms can be used to perform this task. Traditionally, a probabilistic approach has been used in this online configuration, such as Kalman filters, where uncertainty is explicitly modeled. These algorithms work very well in short periods of time, but for longer periods such as this, the linearity of the model may be too limited and should be the subject of future experiments. In our approach, we use the BADA model in conjunction with the optimization algorithm CMA-ES to adjust the parameters of the model with an objective function that defines a distance between the observed positions and the modeled ones. As we will see, the problem of overhauling, which is investigated by statistics and machine learning, presents itself in our context."}, {"heading": "A. Design of Experiment", "text": "To verify that the idea of an online predictor is valid, as already mentioned, we need to perform an empirical evaluation of the chosen algorithm by replicating the same context. The main hypothesis is that we can determine from the observational set the values of parameters adapted to the current flight. Thus, the trajectory is divided into two subsets: the observed altitudes from beginning to present and the future altitudes from the present to the peak of ascent. As in section IV-C, we use measurement points to assess the quality of the prediction by calculating the errors between the predicted altitudes and the real ones. To distinguish whether one error group is statistically greater than the other, we use a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. The zero hypothesis of this test is that two contiguous paired samples come from the same distribution. In our case, this test is a relevant choice because two approaches are tested on the same tract set."}, {"heading": "B. Methodology", "text": "The most naive way to learn the parameters of the model from the observed altitudes is to directly apply Eq.3 from Section IV-B and apply them to generate the rest of the trajectory, so the standard model is always better than the one equipped with a significant p-value. The reason behind this result is simply that the adapted model does not generalize about all the behavior of the aircraft. In other words, it is only adapted to the behavior captured in the observations. This problem relates to the overpass in machine learning literature. To avoid this problem, we must consider the trajectory as a time series in which the observations arrive with a certain order, i.e. the time order in which we first always observe the initial ascent, in which we know from Table I that the inaccuracy of the model is the greatest. In addition, we are more interested in the parameter values that fit better than at the beginning of the trajectory."}, {"heading": "C. Results", "text": "The approach is validated on the same dataset as subsection IV-A. We select three different time periods to represent the online aspect of the method; the size of the validation set is set at 36 points or 180 seconds; this choice must address the trade-off between the validation purpose of avoiding overadjustments that could lead to a large validation set, and the learning purpose of determining the best parameter values that could lead to a large learning set, and therefore a small validation set. At the very least, the size of the validation set must be higher than the acceleration phase during which the local behavior differs most from the global one. In the learning target function (cf. Eq.4), we choose a linear weight function where i = es \u2212 1. The initial lambda value is arbitrarily set to 100 and doubled until the penalty is high enough so that the adjusted values correspond to the default values. Then, the parameter errors correspond with the lowest validation disions."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In summary, this article presents a flight model for the prediction phase defined as a hybrid system based on BADA. An integration scheme is defined to generate the trajectories from this system. Subsequently, the matching parameters are identified to be used in the online context. The method is validated by measuring the vertical errors between real and generated trajectories: for both standard and adapted parameter values. In the validation context, the adjustment is made to the entire trajectory, i.e. with total information. the measured errors are considered to be the accuracy limit of this five-parameter model. Subsequently, the model is applied in the online context that develops over time. Known altitudes are used to adjust the parameters, and then these are used to predict the remaining points. To avoid revision, the known points are divided into a learning set and a validation set. The validation group is used to adjust the preparameters to adjust the parameters."}, {"heading": "VII.

presents a model based on an hybrid system to numerically simulate the climbing phase of an aircraft. This model is then used within a trajectory prediction tool. Finally, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) optimization algorithm is used to tune five selected parameters, and thus improve the accuracy of the model. Incorporated within a trajectory prediction tool, this model can be used to derive the order of magnitude of the prediction error over time, and thus the domain of validity of the trajectory prediction. A first validation experiment of the proposed model is based on the errors along time for a one-time trajectory prediction at the take off of the flight with respect to the default values of the theoretical BADA model. This experiment, assuming complete information, also shows the limit of the model. A second experiment part presents an on-line trajectory prediction, in which the prediction is continuously updated based on the current aircraft position. This approach raises several issues, for which improvements of the basic model are proposed, and the resulting trajectory prediction tool shows statistically significantly more accurate results than those of the default model.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
