Conclusion", "text": "In this essay, we defined event expression through sentences in natural language and semantic relationships between events. We also defined event scheme, memory scheme and comprehensible sequence of events in memory. Based on this definition, we looked at text understanding process with communication diagram in memory. The script model in [1] assumes some kind of concrete scripts (for example, food script and dentist script), which consist of stories of a fixed and multi-storey structure. Besides, scripts assume rich and detailed content that will be difficult to implement. Memory scheme of this essay can easily be compared to [1]. We think it is possible to create memory scheme if we have a history of some series. Of course, memory scheme must be reasonable and as standard as possible."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2012, "abstractText": "In this paper, we define event expression over sentences of natural language and semantic relations between events.
