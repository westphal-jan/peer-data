Normally, each cell is divided in two - with control of the gene. From the two cells, healthy new cells take over and old ones die out. Thus, the expression of a gene provides a measure of the activity of a gene under certain biochemical conditions. It is known that certain diseases, such as cancer, are reflected in the change in the expression values of certain genes. In a cancer cell, mutations can \"turn on\" and \"turn off\" others in a cell. Gene expression represents the activation level of each gene within an organism at a certain time. The expression value provides the activity of a gene under certain biochemical conditions (including samples). Gene expression data from a microarray experiment can be represented by a real-value expression matrix M =, as shown in Figure 1, where the lines (G = expression patterns of genes that represent columns (S = expression patterns of genes representing period profiles of samples)."}, {"heading": "1.2 Fuzzy Soft Set Theory: A Review", "text": "Most of the definitions presented in this section can be found in [10] [13] [14].

Researchers have investigated the problem of similarity measurement between groups; the set may consist of blurred numbers and vague quantities [10]. P. Majumdar, S. K.

Let and are two families of blurred soft sets. Now the similarity between and is found and it is denoted by S (Here, the similarity technique based on the soft set is used to calculate the similarity of genes.

RESEARCH MOTIVATION", "text": "Soft set theory is a new mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainties that traditional mathematical tools cannot handle [2]. Previous cluster algorithms have not used soft set concepts and are only used to select characteristics and classify decision problems. In our proposed work, we applied the Fuzzy Soft set concept to the problem of gene clustering. The analytical goal is to find clusters of genes that are more similar to each other than observations in different clusters. This research area focuses on improving the performance of the approach to gene clustering. To analyze which cluster algorithm provides better results between different gene expression data sets, a comparative analysis is performed with the Kmeans and the Rough K-means algorithms."}, {"heading": "3. LITERATURE SURVEY", "text": "Different approaches to gene filtering and different types of gene cluster methods are discussed in [3]. Data cluster analysis has been extensively applied to extract information from gene expression profiles obtained with DNA microarrays [4]. Cluster analysis technology is used to identify genes that are coordinated regulated. Many cluster techniques have been applied to gene expression data. For example, Limin Fu and Enzo Medico have introduced a novel fuzzy cluster method for analyzing DNA microarray data [5]. Jie Zhang, et al., have identified a number of genes that represent potential biomarkers for breast cancer prediction that patients can categorize into two groups with different predictions [6]. Author Daxin Jiang Chun Tang Aidong Zhang, gives extensive surveys for cluster analysis for S. gene expression algorithm [3]."}, {"heading": "4. GENE SELECTION", "text": "One of the interesting characteristics of microarray experiments is that they group information on a large number of genes. These questions will affect biologists in many ways, and we face many problems while focusing on convergence, so we have to choose the dimensionality reduction of gene expression data. One of the characteristics of gene expression data is that it makes sense to reduce the dimension in both genes and samples, but in our dissertation we only do the gene-based clustering, so we choose the pre-processing of gene expression data. Gene selection is also an interesting area of research among gene expression data [3]. Gene selection has three different approaches, such as filtering approach, wrapper approach, and embedded approach."}, {"heading": "4.1 Entropy filtering", "text": "Entropy measures the uncertainty of a random variable. To measure the interdependence of two random genes X and Y, we used Shannon's information theory [15].H (X) = (1) H (X) is the entropy value of the individual gene X.

It is one of the most widely used clustering techniques. It is a heuristic method in which each cluster is represented by the center of the cluster (i.e. the centroids). The K-mean algorithm is very simple and can be easily implemented in solving many problems. The K-mean algorithm is the most well-known square error-based cluster algorithm [16]. The K-mean algorithm is one of the benchmark algo rituals in partitional clustering. The goal of the K-mean cluster algorithm is usually to create a group of clusters that divide the data into similar groups. Samples close to each other are assumed to be similar, and the goal of the partitional cluster algorithms is to group data that is close together."}, {"heading": "5.2 Rough K-Means Clustering", "text": "The Rough K-Means algorithm (Macqueen, 1967) belongs to the group of algorithms referred to as partitioning methods and which also have the most widely used cluster techniques.

CONCLUSION", "text": "A comparative analysis of the proposed work shows that the proposed cluster approach offers a higher battery race than the other two benchmark cluster algorithms. If the proposed cluster algorithm could integrate knowledge as partial as some cluster constraints in performing the cluster task, we can expect that the cluster results would be biologically more significant. One of the features of the gene expression data is that it makes sense to cluster both genes and samples, but in this work we have only performed the gene-based cluster approach.
