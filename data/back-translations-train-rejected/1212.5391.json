Recently, CT scanning has emerged as one of the key diagnostic tools, thanks to its pattern recognition, machine learning and image processing technology, and feature selection is an essential part of knowledge-gathering, and feature selection is used to improve classification accuracy and reduce the processing time of classification algorithms."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "Amer et al. [6] investigated computed tomography (CT) breast imaging and developed a computer-aided system for distinguishing different lung abnormalities. They investigated texture-based features, Fourier-based features and wave-based features. Aliferis et al. [7] investigates machine learning methods for the development of computer models. These computer models used gene expression data to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor, between metastatic and non-metastatic features, and between histological subtypes of lung cancer. A second goal is to identify small groups of gene predictors and investigate their properties in terms of stability, size and relationship to lung cancer. The idea of attribute reduction and decision-making by means of soft set theory was first used by Maji al.

Thus, the first step in pre-processing is image analysis. Therefore, the current step in this work consists in conducting a comparative examination of some image enhancement techniques, namely average filters, Gaussian filters, medium filters [15]. All the filter types mentioned are applied to the noise image. The SNR value is determined on the basis of equation (1) and the SNR values of each image resulting from each filter type are compared, we obtain the most suitable filter that could be applied to the raw CT images [6]. The original image and noise image are shown in Figure 2 and the resulting images from all types of the previous filters are shown in Figure 3.
