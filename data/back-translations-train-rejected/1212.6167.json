Credit requests, of new and existing customers, are often evaluated by classical discrimination rules based on customers information. However, these kinds of strategies have serious limits and don't take into account the characteristics difference between current customers and the future ones. The aim of this paper is to measure credit worthiness for non customers borrowers and to model potential risk given a heterogeneous population formed by borrowers customers of the bank and others who are not. We hold on previous works done in generalized gaussian discrimination and transpose them into the logistic model to bring out efficient discrimination rules for non customers' subpopulation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Dec 2012 12:03:26 GMT  (105kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6167v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["farid beninel", "waad bouaguel", "ghazi belmufti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.6167"}, "pdf": {"name": "1212.6167.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Transfer Learning Using Logistic Regression in Credit Scoring", "authors": ["Farid Beninel", "Waad Bouaguel", "Ghazi Belmufti"], "emails": ["farid.beninel@ensai.fr", "bouaguelwaad@mailpost.tn,", "belmufti@yahoo.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Credit risk is one of the main risks that a credit institution has to deal with. This risk arises when a borrower has to pay his debt in the fixed-rate bond. (This risk arises when a borrower pays his debt in the fixed-rate bond.) This risk occurs when a borrower pays his debt in the fixed-rate bond. In order to control this type of risk, bank managers need to look for efficient solutions to distinguish between good and bad risk claimants. (2002) and Saporta (2006) define credit scoring as the process of determining how likely a particular applicant is to be repaid. Credit scoring methods are used to classify potential creditors into two risk classes. (Giudici, 2003) These methods use explanation variables to estimate his intended credit repayment performance."}, {"heading": "2 Logistic Regression Model", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Classical Logistic Regression", "text": "Logistic regression is a variant of linear regression that is used when the dependent variable is a binary variable and the independent variables are continuous, categorical or both. Logistic regression provides a linear function of descriptors as a discriminatory tool, this technique is often used in credit scoring applications due to its simplicity and explanabilty. The model form is bylog (pi1 \u2212 pi) = \u03b20 + \u03b2Txi, (1) where - pi is the posteriori probability, defined as the probability that an individual has the 1 for certain values taken by descriptors (i.e. P (Yi = 1 | xi). - xi = (x1i, x 2 i,..., x d i) is the vector of the observed value assumption by description variables. - \u03b2T = (\u03b21, \u03b22,..) is the vector of the variable effects. - \u03b20 is the threshold.

The use of the data on the customer subpopulation aims to moderate the small size of the subpopulation of non-customers by assuming the existence of hidden connections between the distribution of variables over the respective case and the distribution over the respective case. It is known from Beninel and Biernacki (2007) and Bouveyron and Jacques (2009) that the existence of certain connections between the variable distributions leads to relationships between the parameters of their respective logistic regression models, so our task is to find these connections. In this context, a preliminary case study was successfully conducted in the multivariate cases of Beninel and Biernacki (2005).

A comparison of the performance of the seven models was performed and the models M3 and M4 were selected as the best classification model for the non-customer subpopulation; these two models suggest the performance of the traditional classification model M1. This research could have yielded more interesting results if we had been able to have a sample of a larger size. We envisage as a perspective the application of logistic regression using non-linear links between the two subpopulations. We can also apply a non-parametric approach that can appear efficient once the linear models find their limits."}], "references": [{"title": "Logistic discrimination", "author": ["J.

Beninel and Biernacki (2009) extended this approach to the multinomial logistic discrimination and proposed an additional links\u2019 model in the case where the two studied subpopulation are two Gaussian ones. The main idea of this previous works is that information related to one of the two subpopulations contains some information related to the other one. The earlier works, have been the exit of the main thoughts of this paper, given previous results in the case of Gaussian mixture model and the six presented models by Beninel and Biernacki (2009), our task is then, to go in deep in the previous results with more testes and simulations, and to add to the former links\u2019 models a seventh one.", "startOffset": 186, "endOffset": 780}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "According to Beninel and Biernacki (2009) links between subpopulations could exist and consequently, information on \u03a9 could provide some information on \u03a9\u2217.", "startOffset": 13, "endOffset": 42}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "It\u2019s known from Beninel and Biernacki (2007) as well as Bouveyron and Jacques (2009) that existence of particular connections between the variables distributions lead to relations between the parameters of their respective logistic regression models, consequently our task consists in finding these links.", "startOffset": 16, "endOffset": 45}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "It\u2019s known from Beninel and Biernacki (2007) as well as Bouveyron and Jacques (2009) that existence of particular connections between the variables distributions lead to relations between the parameters of their respective logistic regression models, consequently our task consists in finding these links.", "startOffset": 16, "endOffset": 85}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "It\u2019s known from Beninel and Biernacki (2007) as well as Bouveyron and Jacques (2009) that existence of particular connections between the variables distributions lead to relations between the parameters of their respective logistic regression models, consequently our task consists in finding these links.

The aim of this paper is to measure credit worthiness for non customers borrowers and to model potential risk given a heterogeneous population formed by borrowers customers of the bank and others who are not.
