PROBLEM DESCRIPTION", "text": "\"Action expresses priorities.\" Mahatma GhandiImagine that we are looking on the basis of computational processes. Then, we should see a starting point of a task and a processing unit (as in today's architecture of computations), which will cause something like a bottleneck (fig. 1) that allows the task or data to pass through according to the capacity of that unit. Otherwise, this unit will in some way limit the computational capabilities of the system and let the process flow serially: Something greater should be expressed by something more narrow. The same situation in different forms that we observe in nature, and to a large extent it determines the appearance of the real world and the entire possible existence that we can observe. Other determines reality. It is that when we talk about interactions in any space, we must look at simultaneous objects with defined shapes and boundaries in relation to the environment."}, {"heading": "III.

CONCLUSION", "text": "This work continues the research that has been done in [1], [4] - [6], and here we have taken a step forward in formalizing the independent properties of observable and conceivable spaces. This research can help us to understand more clearly what mind is, and we are no longer needed to address thinking only to the physical processes in certain tissues or organisms, or even to certain physical objects, and will be able to look beyond to the elementary properties of nature, which constitute the whole variety of other possible representations of reality and virtual spaces that may be both observable and existent or imaginable. In further research, we will continue to specify the spatial properties of reality and further formalize what we have found. The goal will be to connect what we already have, expand the basic concepts and concepts, cover the basic variant of a complete model, and achieve practical results in decision making, planning, analysis, automated design, effective reasoning, or optimization of the use of this theory or formation."}], "references": [{"title": "Levels of Ordering in Software Design and Thinking", "author": ["Kirill Sorudeykin"], "venue": "Proceedings of \u0406V-th all-Ukraining conference \u201cIntellectual Computer Systems And Networks\u201d, Krivoy Rog, Ukraine,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Sorudeykin \u201cA model of Spatial Thinking for Computational Intelligence\u201d, 9th IEEE East-West Design & Test Symposium, (EWDTS\u201911)", "author": ["A.
