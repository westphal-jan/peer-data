Actual information about these units and their semantics is discovered by Network Mining (NM) systems. [20] However, the raw data discovered is domain specific and must be translated into a domain-independent model for network inferencing, while the definition of a network model (NIM) forms the basis for the application of network inferences."}, {"heading": "3 Design Principles and Decisions", "text": "The most important design decisions that were made were to seek representation for an integration model and language to formulate conclusions. We had to take (1) an approach that does not require any system change when we change the inference programs or the integration model, (2) an easy-to-understand representation of information suitable for the inference approach, and (3) a sufficiently powerful inference technique that is simple enough to be used by our customers and partners to define their own inference programs. The need for (1) derives from the development of the inference programs in the early prototypes. The range of data and scope of conclusions evolved - and will continue to evolve - as more data sources are integrated and conclusions are refined. Therefore, the life cycle of the data model and inference programs must be decoupled from that of the system. Since system landscapes and business networks are very complex for large corporations, and many impletisation specifications are considered quantum specifications (2) or (3), of course, as most of the quantum courts require (3)."}, {"heading": "4 The Integration Network (Inference) Model", "text": "The model for presenting integration networks as virtual \"actual\" enterprise landscapes includes a representative interface of units from the middleware space of enterprise integration [15]. Although this domain has many aspects that are treated differently in different system implementations, we identified a common, central meta-model that we call Network Integration Model (NIM). The basic NIM units that are relevant to the conclusion are introduced subsequently, while further units are explained later where necessary. The basic requirement for defining an integration meta-model is to present the actual physical hosts in the enterprise landscape as first-class units and then find the interfaces they provide or call during message-based communication. Since most of the communications actually address logical units such as applications or tenants that run on the physical hosts, a system is considered to be a node of the network. That is, systems represent (business) application messages and are the interface logic of integration messages, and for example, for communication with other systems via the low."}, {"heading": "5 The Network Inference Approach", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "6 Results and Experiences", "text": "This year it will be so far that it will be able to use the mentionlcihsrteeSe rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc-the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the ru the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the rfu the"}, {"heading": "7 Related Work", "text": "Our approach to the representation and conclusion of integration networks is based on Datalog, a well-researched topic [12,25] that has recently been revived due to good parallelization capabilities, at the latest through the work of Hellerstein et al. [2,14]. Even in the field of business analysis, Datalog has recently been used, mainly through the work of [5,6,7]. However, these approaches do not address network-specific inference domains for which they define extensions. In terms of the metamodel for integration networks, [23] the closest known related work is that defines a path array used to traverse arbitrary graphs. Likewise, we define nodes and edges with incoming and outgoing connectors as different in terms of meaning and usage. For NM systems in general, related work is performed in the area of Process Mining (PM) initiated by [1], which is located between computational data mining and data intelligence."}, {"heading": "8 Discussion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we present a new domain for information discovery, machine learning, and network reconstruction, for which we have defined a modeling and inference approach to reconstructing integration networks from raw NM data using Datalog. Designed specifically for connectivity and integration domains, the network model includes an intersection of relevant entities created by analyzing multiple middleware systems on the market. We encoded the raw data discovered as database facts to create a domain-independent knowledge base and apply rule-based conclusions that represent a multi-level network inference approach. We validated our approach in a simulated integration network and reported on our experiments in applying our system to enterprise networks in the real world. The evaluation shows good results in terms of challenges such as equivalence class determination, flow and cross-middleware network reconstruction, as introduced in Section 2. Although the network structure should be very well reconstructed to add attributes to the detection area, more should be able."}], "references": [{"title": "Process Mining: Discovery", "author": ["W. van der Aalst"], "venue": "Conformance and Enhancement of Business Processes,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2011}, {"title": "BOOMAnalytics: Exploring Data-centric, Declarative Programming for the Cloud", "author": ["P.
