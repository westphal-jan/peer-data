To compare the performance of the DLV-based solver with CRModels2, we use the classic Space Shuttle reaction control system benchmark [3] and new benchmarks such as the representation and argumentation with intentions [5] and the shortest path problem. To measure the performance of the solvers, the time in seconds is used. As the time complexity of the translation is low, the recorded problem solving time does not include the translation time. In this experiment, we use the DLV build BEN / Dec 21 2011 and CRModels2 2.0.12 [14], the ASP solver Clasp 2.0.5 with Gringo 3.0.4 [15]. The experiments are performed on a computer with Intel Core Duo PRA1.00 and Windows PRAz 461.00 with the grounder Gringo 3.0.4 [15]."}, {"heading": "4.1 The First Benchmark: Programs for Representing and Reasoning with Intentions", "text": "We compare crTranslator with CRModels2 based on the following scenarios proposed in [5]: Consider a series of four rooms, r1, r2, r3, r4, which are connected by doors so that an agent can move along the line from one room to the next. We say that two people meet when they are in the same room. Suppose our agent Bob is first in r1 and intends to meet John, who, as Bob knows, is in r3. This type of intention is often referred to as the intention to achieve the goal. The first task is to design a simple plan for Bob to achieve this goal: from r1 to r2 and then to r3. Suppose Bob moves from r1 to r2, John moves from r3 to r2, the second task is to detect the unexpected achievement of his goal and not to move on to r3."}, {"heading": "4.2 The Second Benchmark: Reaction Control System of Space Shuttle", "text": "USA-Smart is a CR prologue program to find plans with improved quality for the operation of the reaction control system (RCS) of the space shuttle. Plans consist of a sequence of operations to open and close the valves that control the propellant flow from the tanks to the nozzles of the RCS. In our experiment, we used the USA-Smart program with four instances: fmc1 to fmc4 [16]. The SPARC variant of the USA-Smart program is written as close as possible to USA-smart. The results of the performance of crTranslator and CRModels for these programs are shown in Figure 2. We note that these instances have small abductive supports (with a support size of less than 9) and a relatively large number of cr rules (with more than 1200)."}, {"heading": "4.3 The Third Benchmark: Shortest Path Problem", "text": "For a single-pointed graph and a pair of unique vertices of the graph, the shortest path problem is to find a shortest path between these two vertices. In a graph with n vertices and e edges, its density is defined as e / (n * (n * (n * 1). In our experiment, the problem cases are randomly generated based on the number of vertices and the density of the graph. The density of the graphs varies from 0.1 to 1, so that the shortest paths include abductive supports of different sizes. To create diagrams with a longer shortest path (which requires larger abductive supports), we zoom into the density between 0 and 0.1 with a step of 0.01. To shorten the time that solves the problem, we use a smaller number of supporting points. In a graph, we define the distance between a pair of abductive supports as the length of the shortest path between them. In a randomly generated graph, we select two vertices so that their distance between these two vertices is longest."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "This paper describes a sorted version of CR prologue called SPARC, presents a translation of the consistency that restores the rules of the language into weak constraints of the DLV, and examines the possibility of building efficient inference engines for SPARC on the basis of this translation. This is a preliminary report. There are a number of steps that should be taken to develop SPARC into a language of knowledge representation for teaching and application. In particular, we plan to: - Expand expand SPARC to include a number of useful language constructs that go beyond the original language of the ASP, such as aggregates and optimization constructs. In this extension, instead of focusing on a specific syntax, we plan to allow users to choose their preferred input language, such as that of DLV or LPARSE or GRINGO, and to provide the final system with support for the appropriate language, such as aggregates and optimization constructs."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The work of Gelfond and Zhang was partially supported by the NSF scholarship IIS-1018031."}, {"heading": "Appendix: CR-Prolog", "text": "The version discussed here is less generic than the standard version (in particular, it ignores the treatment of preferences that are sometimes referred to as indirect exceptions. Intuitively, these are rare exceptions that come into play only as a last resort to restore the consistency of the agent's worldview when all else fails. Representing indirect exceptions seems to be beyond the power of \"pure\" ASP [1] that prompted the introduction of cr rules. To illustrate the problem, consider the following example 3.
