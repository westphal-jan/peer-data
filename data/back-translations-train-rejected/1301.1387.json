This work continues our research on the introduction of non-herbrand functions into ASP. In logic programming, functions are typically interpreted beyond the Herbrand universe, with each functional term f (x) being associated with its own syntactical representation. That, in most logical programming languages, is the value of an expression f (x) itself and therefore, when equality is understood as identity, f (x) = 2 is wrong. This type of function and the efficient implementation of solutions is the subject of a substantial amount of research (we refer the reader to certain types of knowledge, but it is sometimes convenient to use functions with non-Herbrand domains)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we have defined the syntax and semantics of an ASP extension to include NonHerbrand functions with full-fledged arithmetic expressions and consistency-restoring rules. ASP {f, cr}, the resulting language, supports sub-functions, and we hope to have shown that it enables the encoding of fairly complex types of knowledge, including knowledge of total functions. Compared to similar languages, ASP {f, cr} achieves a remarkable balance between expressiveness and efficiency of calculation. In the previous section, the discussion about the efficiency of calculation was based solely on the size of the grounding of the corresponding codes, but in [1] experimental evidence of solving performance based on an ASP {f} solver prototype (available at http: / marcy.cjb.net / clingof) has been provided. We expect that a version of the solver including support for the extended language defined in this paper will soon be available. As soon as this previous discussion is available, we plan to concrete it from the http: / cycl.net section."}], "references": [{"title": "Answer Set Solving and Non-Herbrand Functions", "author": ["M.
