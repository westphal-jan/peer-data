These new definitions help us to understand the relationship between the semantics of the FLP and the semantics of the first-order stable model and their extensions. For the class of programs in which the two semantics coincide, the DLV-HEX system can be seen as an implementation of the stable model semantics of GQ formulas; a recent extension of the F2LP system [19] to include \"complex\" atoms as the front-end of DLVHEX to implement the generalized semantics of the FLP."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Vladimir Lifschitz for useful discussions related to this paper, and Joseph Babb and the anonymous speakers for their useful comments, which were partially supported by the National Science Foundation under grant IIS0916116 and the South Korean IT R & D program MKE / KIAT 2010-TD-300404-001."}], "references": [{"title": "Recursive aggregates in disjunctive logic programs: Semantics and complexity", "author": ["W.
