Classification is the process of predicting classes using some machine learning algorithms in a single experiment. Classification of different tumour types in gene expression data is of great importance for cancer diagnosis and drug discovery, but is more complex due to its enormous size. DNA micro-array technologies have made it possible to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes in a single experiment. Several techniques are available to analyze gene expression profiles. A common feature of these techniques is the selection of a gene group for the subfixing process."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "Soft set theory was initiated by Molodstov to solve some uncertainties among the data that are not solved by traditional mathematical tools. Maji et al. have further investigated the soft set theory and used this theory for some decision-making problems [3] [4]. They have also introduced the concept of soft set theory for decision-making problems. Aktas and Cagman have introduced the concept of soft groups [5]. P. Majumdar et al. [6] have introduced a general blurred soft set and they have studied the similarity of soft set for medical diagnosis to detect pneumonia in sufferers [6]. Recently, Milind M. Mushrif, et al. have introduced a new method for classifying natural textures using a blurred soft set classifier. Their new approach provides high accuracy in the classification of textures [7]."}, {"heading": "3 RESEARCH MOTIVATION", "text": "The biggest challenge in classifying gene expression data is its enormous size and inaccuracy. Many researchers try to achieve greater accuracy in gene classification by reducing or selecting the informative genes among thousands of genes. In cancer classification, researchers use some machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis, etc., Rough Set Theory and Fuzzy Logic are only used for gene selection. In this paper, we use soft-set-based classification methods for cancer classification. In this algorithm, genes are selected for dimensionality reduction through entropy filtering, and genes are used for cancer classification based on their expression level of blurred soft-set-based classification methods."}, {"heading": "4 METHODOLOGY", "text": "The methodology used in this paper is shown in Figure 1.

CONCLUSION", "text": "Classification is the most important technique in microarray technology, which is used to predict classes between genes or samples. Prediction plays an important role in the biomedical field for predicting disease stages and drug discovery. In this paper, the classification technique is used to predict cancers between genes in different cancer gene expression datasets, such as the gene expression dataset for leukemia cancer with two classes of tumor and non-tumor, the gene expression dataset for lung cancer with two classes of tumor and the gene expression dataset for normal and breast cancer with two classes of benign and malignant. In this paper, the fuzzy soft set gene classification is used to classify gene expression data. The classification accuracy of the proposed approach is compared with the KNN and fuzzy KNN algorithms. Experimental analysis demonstrates the efficacy of the future unsharp set of data sets compared to other approaches."}, {"heading": "11.
