We propose a real-time solution based on the idea of using some words or groups of words that indicate grammatical categories; and some specific endings of some sentences. Our idea is based on some features of the Romanian language, in which prepositions, adverbs or certain endings can provide a lot of information about the structure of a complex sentence. Such features can also be found in other languages, such as French.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "Before performing a semantic analysis of the natural language, we should define the lexicon and syntactic rules of a formal grammar that is useful in generating simple sentences in the respective language (e.g. English, French or Romanian). We will consider a simple grammar with some rules for the lexicon and some rules for the grammatical categories. The rules for the lexicon will be of type (1):"}, {"heading": "G \u2192 W (1)", "text": "where G is a grammatical category (or part of the language) and W is a word from a particular dictionary; the other syntactic rules are of type (2):"}, {"heading": "G1 \u2192 G2 G3 (2)", "text": "This means that the first grammatical category (G1) is formed from the concatenation of the other two (G2 and G3) \"intelligent\" sentences, from the right side of the arrow. Our simple grammar is represented in Figure 1. It contains only a few Romanian words and the syntax rules form a subset of the Romanian syntax rules: in Figure 1 we use these notations: S = sentence, NP = word sequence, VP = word sequence, N = noun, Det = determinator (article), AP = adjective phrase, A = adjective, C = conjunction, CA = group consisting of a conjunction and an adjective. This grammar generates correct sentences in English, such as: \u2022 Orice femeie iube\u015fte. (Every woman loves this sentence), C = conjunction, CA = group consisting of a conjunction and an adjectivity.This grammar generates correct sentences in English, such as \"Orice femu\u015fte.\""}, {"heading": "2. USING THE DEFINITE CLAUSE GRAMMARS", "text": "In order that our grammar does not generate false sentences in the nominative (subjective), we should use the terms of gender, number, case, etc., which indicate, for example, that \"femeie\" and \"frumoas\u0103\" have the female gender and singular number. \"El iube\u0219te ea\" is wrong because \"ea\" is in the nominative case, and we should use the \"pe\" preposition to get the battery case. The correct formulation is \"El iube\u0219te pe ea,\" or even \"El o iube\u0219te pe ea.\" (\"He loves it\"). If we take the case into account, the grammar is no longer independent of the context: it is not true that every NP is the same, regardless of the context. Nevertheless, if we want to work with a grammar that is independent of the context, we can split the category NP into two, NPN and NPA to divide verbal groups in the nominjective (subjective), or categories (the two), respectively."}, {"heading": "2. THE IDEA FOR SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE LANGUAGE", "text": "As we explain in the introduction, classical ideas of syntactic analysis are considered a problem that could come second. \"However, in the previous sections we point out the following: 1. Use of CFG grammar, syntactically correct sentences (in Romanian) are accepted, as well as wrong words. 2. The power of the analysis system (for example, a chart parser) based on the volume of vocabulary used depends on the volume of vocabulary used. 3. The power of a chart parser can be improved using DCG grammar, which implies that the set of syntactic rules, with a set of new rules, using special variables (such as gender, number, etc.) We assume that the first and last edition of the system is not necessary to analyze erroneous sentences, so we consider the grammatical problem that could be the second."}, {"heading": "3. CREATING AND CONSULTING A DATABASE", "text": "Of course, by introducing more such sentences (phrases), the user can create a table in a database with the structure of a sentence; therefore, each entry would contain the fields: subject, predicate, predictive noun, direct object, indirect object, place adverbial, etc. The detailed structure of the table is presented in Section 5 when we discuss the DIASEXP system developed by us. Consultation of such a database would be done by Romanian question phrases (phrases), for example: \u2022 Cine < predicate > < addition directly >? (\"Cine cite\u015fte cartea?\") (Who < predicate > < direct object >? (\"Who reads the book?\") to find out the < subject > by using a search engine based on pattern matching (matching pattern) in which search terms are reacted to the predicate > < direct object >? (\"Who reads the book?\"), in order to find out the < subject >, using a search engine based on pattern matching (matching pattern) in which search terms are reacted to the predicate > < direct object >? (\"Who reads the book?\" Who reads the book? \"), we can also relate to the vocabulary based on a (such a) system, and the result (although) may be (the\" direct object). \""}, {"heading": "4. A GENERATIVE GRAMMAR MODEL FOR SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS", "text": "Below (Figure 3) we present the grammar used by our system in syntactical analysis: 1.

DIASEXP", "text": "Using the grammar from the previous section, we developed the DIASEXP system. DIASEXP has a simple text interface in which the user can introduce various expressions that describe some knowledge of some real events. This collection of expressions is recorded as a \"story.\" However, each sentence of history is analyzed by the system, which automatically recognizes the parts of the sentence and inserts them into a table with the following fields: 1. Subject - this will represent the simple subject of the sentence (a noun or pronoun) (see rules 4 and 37 in Figure 3); 2. Attrib _ sub - this will be the attribute of the subject (it can be, for example, an adjective, see rules 9 and 12 in the same figure); 3. Predicate - the predicate of the sentence represents the main action of the self-conscious sentence; the predicate can be represented by a normal verb or the copulative verb \"a fi.\""}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "CFG and DCG are types of generative grammars used in the syntactical analysis of a phrase in natural language. Sometimes, long or complex phrases pose a problem for classical chart parsers. Characteristics of the Romanian language, which are related to the morphology of words or the way adverbs are formed, can be successfully used in syntactical analysis by using a system based on patterns. This system works in real time and does not record the entire dictionary of Romanian language. It will use a small dictionary of \"prefixes\" (prepositions, adverbs, etc.) as well as some endings and linkages."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "The authors thank Professors Dan Cristea, Grigor Moldovan and Ioan Andone for their advice and observations during the research activities."}], "references": [{"title": "Aspects of the Theory of Syntax", "author": ["N.
