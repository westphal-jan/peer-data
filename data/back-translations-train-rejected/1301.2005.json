To characterize infinite models in a finite expression, two important terms, namely type and feature, are defined by [16] and [15] respectively for TBoxes and general KBs in a manner that has a signature.

Compared to the inconsistency of the TBoxes, we are not able to overcome all these inconsistencies that occur in KBs, because there are two additional cases: the inconsistency of the ABoxes and the inconsistency between TBoxes and ABoxes. Specifically, these inconsistencies occur in the concepts, between the assertions and role assertions, between the assertions and inclusions, even between a single inclusion and a single assertion. Example 3 Let K = ({P \u2212)) will be a KB (see [15]) and the role assertions. He concludes that K is not consistent and therefore does not exhibit model characteristics i.e., ModF (K) =. In order to deal with these various inconsistencies in a uniform way, we adopt the technique of compressing minimal model types in order to construct them directly over the characteristics."}, {"heading": "4 Properties of Distance-based Semantics", "text": "In general, most existing semantic thought patterns are much weaker than the classical semantic perceptions that exist."}, {"heading": "5 Related Works", "text": "In this section, we compare our scenario with existing para-consistent approaches in DL-Lite or other DLs. Existing model-centric approaches to inconsistency handling are usually based on types of extended inconsistency of tolerable semantics, such as quadrivalent description logic of [18] and quasi-classical description logic of [12]. Compared to them, our distance-based semantics works on classical interpretations, but can still draw more meaningful and reasonable logical conclusions. For example, quadrivalent DL-Lite, modus ponens, modus tollens and disjunctive syllogism are no longer valid. Taking the Penguin KB for example, we cannot draw the intuitive conclusions that the swallowpig is a bird and can fly under quadrivalent semantics (with the material inclusion interpretation [18]). In contrast, quasic DLs can present basic argumentation rules, but they may be inconsistent if they are too much semantic."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have presented a model-based framework for dealing with inconsistencies in DL-Lite by introducing distances across types of characteristics for CBs. Within this framework, we define a kind of semantics (so-called distance-based semantics) that characterizes a kind of cautious dependency relationship that is paraconsistent, non-monotonous, and has the splitting property. A characteristic of distance-based engagement is that it largely maintains consistency. Furthermore, our model-based framework takes into account both minimal semantic changes and the rule of \"majority consideration\" in syntax. In this sense, our approach is a natural combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. As a result, our scenario is finer-grained compared to previous approaches to paraconsistent reasoning. Although distance-based semantics presented in this paper is based on classical semantics (general divalence-based semantics), we can build on a semantics based on a semantics based on two-value."}], "references": [{"title": "The dl-lite family and relations", "author": ["A.
