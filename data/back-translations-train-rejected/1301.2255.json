This leads to the existence of two kinds of possibilistic causal graphs where the conditioning is either based on the minimum, or the product operator. Benferhat et al. (1999) have investigated the connections between min-based graphs and possibilistic logic bases (made of classical formulas weighted in terms of certainty). This paper deals with a more difficult issue : the product-based graphical representations of possibilistic bases, which provides an easy structural reading of possibilistic bases. Moreover, this paper also provides another reading of possibilistic bases in terms of comparative preferences of the form \"in the context p, q is preferred to not q\". This enables us to explicit preferences underlying a set of goals with different levels of priority.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:22:32 GMT  (937kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2255v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["salem benferhat", "didier dubois", "souhila kaci", "henri prade"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2255"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2255.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Graphical readings of possibilistic logic bases", "authors": ["Salem Benferhat", "Didier Dubois", "Souhila Kaci", "Henri Prade"], "emails": ["}@irit.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have set themselves in order to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "It can be checked that the possibility distribution asso ciated with the constructed 11 G (using the chain rule)", "text": "This is the same as the one associated with the possible base in any case. Let's observe that we have chosen the arrangement of the vari ables arbitrarily in the example. Clearly, each arrangement suggests that arrangements that are the more natural, or that lead to a simple structure. Let's also note that the calculation of weights could also be carried out in the form of symbols. In the theory of possibility, desires or knowledge that can be expressed in different formats were shown. This paper has used two compact representations of the distribution of possibilities: a possible knowledge base and a possible graph. Each of these representations was shown in preventive papers. [3, 6] to be equivalent to a distribution of possibilities that has linked the possible worlds."}], "references": [{"title": "Independence in qual\u00ad itative uncertainty frameworks", "author": ["lJ N.
