Artifacts consist of data and lifecycles, accounting respectively for the relational structure of the artifacts' states and their possible evolutions over time. In this paper we put forward artifact-centric multi-agent systems, a novel formalisation of artifact systems in the context of multi-agent systems operating on them. Differently from the usual process-based models of services, the semantics we give explicitly accounts for the data structures on which artifact systems are defined. We study the model checking problem for artifact-centric multi-agent systems against specifications written in a quantified version of temporal-epistemic logic expressing the knowledge of the agents in the exchange. We begin by noting that the problem is undecidable in general. We then identify two noteworthy restrictions, one syntactical and one semantical, that enable us to find bisimilar finite abstractions and therefore reduce the model checking problem to the instance on finite models. Under these assumptions we show that the model checking problem for these systems is EXPSPACE-complete. We then introduce artifact-centric programs, compact and declarative representations of the programs governing both the artifact system and the agents. We show that, while these in principle generate infinite-state systems, under natural conditions their verification problem can be solved on finite abstractions that can be effectively computed from the programs. Finally we exemplify the theoretical results of the paper through a mainstream procurement scenario from the artifact systems literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Jan 2013 11:45:54 GMT  (94kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2678v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Jan 2013 09:22:30 GMT  (446kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2678v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["francesco belardinelli", "alessio lomuscio", "fabio patrizi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2678"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2678.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Verification of Agent-Based Artifact Systems", "authors": ["Francesco Belardinelli", "Fabio Patrizi"], "emails": ["BELARDINELLI@IBISC.FR", "A.LOMUSCIO@IMPERIAL.AC.UK", "FABIO.PATRIZI@DIS.UNIROMA1.IT"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 130 1.26 78v2 [cs.MA] 2 2Yes nWe examine the problem of model verification for artefact-centric multi-agent systems on the basis of specifications written in a quantified version of time-epistemic logic that expresses the knowledge of agents in exchange.

Introduction", "text": "Much of the work in the field of knowledge reasoning involves the development of formal techniques for the representation of epistemic properties of rational actors or agents in a multi-agent system (MAS) from 2008. Approaches based on modal logic are often based on interpreted systems (Parikh & Ramanujam, 1985), computer-based semantics (Wooldridge, 2000), which is used for the interpretation of multiple temporal-epistemic logic. This line of research was thoroughly researched in the 1990s, leading to a significant body of work (Fagin, Halpern, Moses, 1995), and other significant studies have been conducted since then; a current topic of interest has focused on the development of automatic techniques, including model verification (Clarke, Grumberg, & Peled, 1999), for the verification of temporal-epistemic systems."}, {"heading": "1.1 Artifact-Centric Systems", "text": "One point of differentiation from more traditional, distributed systems is the interoperability and networking of services and the shared format for both data and remote process calls. However, two technology-independent concepts permeate the service-oriented literature: orchestration and choreography (Alonso and choreography), which deal with the achievement of a certain general goal (Alonso and choreography concerns the distributed coordination of different actions through publicly observable events to achieve a certain goal. An MAS perspective (Wooldridge, 2001) is known to be particularly helpful in the service-oriented computing function, which allows us to assign states of information and common goals to the different services."}, {"heading": "1.2 Related Work", "text": "As stated above, virtually all current literature on artifact-centric systems focuses on the characteristics and implementations of the artifact system as such; little or no attention is paid to the actors on the system, whether they are human or artificial agents; however, some formal techniques have been presented to verify the core aspects of the system; below, we briefly compare them with the results of this verification; to our knowledge, the review of artificially-centred business processes is initially discussed in (Bhattacharya et al., 2007), where accessibility and stoppages are presented in the context of ofarfact-centric systems and the complexity of the results for the verification problem; and the current paper differs significantly from the language (Bhattacharya et al., 2007) in that we use a more expressive specification language, even when the agent-related aspects are not taken into account, and by using effective abstraction methods for verification (Gertacharya et al., 2007)."}, {"heading": "1.3 Scheme of the Paper", "text": "The rest of the work is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present Artefact-Centric Multiagent Systems (ACMAS), the semantics we use throughout the paper to describe agents operating on an artifact system. In the same section, we present FO-CTLK, a first-order logic with knowledge and time to reflect on the evolution of the knowledge of agents and the artifact system, which allows us to propose a satisfaction relationship based on the concept of limited quantification, and to highlight some characteristics of isomorphic states. An immediate result is the indecidability of the model verification problem for ACMAS in its general environment. Section 3 deals with syntactic constraints on FOCTLK that enable us to guarantee the existence of finite abstractions of infinite states."}, {"heading": "2. Artifact-Centric Multi-Agent Systems", "text": "Since data and databases are important components of artefact systems, we base our formalization of artefacts on them as concepts. However, as discussed in the previous section, we place emphasis on agent-based concepts here. As such, we define our systems as both the artifacts in the system and the agents that interact with the system. A standard paradigm for logical thinking about agent-based systems is interpreted systems (Parikh & Ramanujam, 1985; Fagin et al., 1995). In this context, agents are equipped with private local states and evolve through the execution of actions according to an individual protocol. Since data play a key role and enable us to specify characteristics of the artefact system, we define the local states of the agents as evolving database instances. We call this formalization artefact-centric multi-agent systems (ACMAS)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Databases and First-Order Logic", "text": "As discussed above, we use databases as the basic building blocks for defining the states of the agents and the artefact system.

We define an artefact-centric multi-agent system as a system that includes all the interacting artifacts in the system and a finite series of agents that interact with such an environment. As agents, we have views on the state of the artifact, i.e., projections of the status of certain artifacts, we assume that the building blocks of their private local states can also be modeled as database instances. Consistent with the semantics of the interpreted systems (Fagin et al., 1995), not everything needs to be present in the states of certain artifacts in the environment; a part of it can be completely private and not replicated in other states. So, we begin with the introduction of the term agent.Definition 2.6 (Agent) Given an interpretation domain U, an agent is a tuple A = < D, Act, Act, Pr > where the database is local schema."}, {"heading": "2.3 Model Checking", "text": "\"We define the problem of verification of an artificially-centered multi-agent system against a specification of interest.\" \"We follow the artificially-centered model.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"We.\" \"\" We. \"\" \"We.\" \"\" \"We.\" \"\" \"We.\" \"\" \"We.\" \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \"\" \"We.\" \".\" \".\" \"\" We. \"\". \"\" \"We.\" \".\" \"\" \"We.\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"We.\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" We. \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" We. \".\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\". \"\". \"\" \""}, {"heading": "2.4 Isomorphisms", "text": "We examine the concept of the Isomorphism an AC-MAS.

In what follows, we present two main results. < S > S > S identifies language limitations; the second case, presented in the next section, focuses on semantic constraints, which we call limited. While these cases are orthogonal to each other in a sense, we show that they both lead to decideable model verification problems. Both are also executed on a fairly natural subclass of AC-MAS, which we call limited. Our goal for the procedure is to identify limited abstractions of the infinite state of AC-MAS, so that the verification of programs that allow AC-MAS as models can be performed on them, rather than on infinite states of AC-MAS. We will see this in detail in the introduction of our objectives in the first section of Biology."}, {"heading": "P |= \u03d5 iff P \u2032 |= \u03d5", "text": "In summary, we have proven that bi-similar AC-MAS validate the same SA-FO-CTL formulas.

We are particularly interested in finite abstraction, so we operate on a special class of infinite models, which we call \"bounded.Definition.\" Definition 3.6 (Limited AC-MAS) An AC-MAS P is indeed limited, because a limited AC-MAS can be defined for all if a limited AC-MAS is defined for all. Furthermore, it should be noted that a limited AC-MAS can contain an infinite number of states, all of which are limited by b. Observe that bounded AC-MAS may be defined on infinite domains U, note that a bbounded AC-MAS may include infinitely many states, all bounded systems are infinite-state in general. Notice also the value b bounds only the number of distinct individuals in a state, not the size of the state itself, i.e."}, {"heading": "P |= \u03d5 iff P \u2032 |= \u03d5.", "text": "In view of the fact that the verification of a finite AC-MAS is decisive, this is a remarkable result. However, note that we do not have a constructive definition for the construction of an abstract AC-MAS P \u2032 from a concrete AC-MAS P. However, this does not matter, since in practice a concrete artifact system is defined by a program, e.g. in the GSM language, as discussed in the introduction. Rather, the ability to derive finite abstractions not only for arbitrary AC-MAS, but for those that are models of concrete programs is important. We will do this in Section 6, where we will use the result described above. Note that an abstract AC-MAS as in Definition 3.8 depends on the abstract agents defined in Definition 3.7."}, {"heading": "4. Abstractions for FO-CTLK", "text": "In the previous section, we have shown that syntactical limitations of the specification language lead to finite abstractions for limited AC-MAS. A natural question that arises is whether the limitation to finite atomic specifications can be lifted, which would allow us to check any agent-based FO-CTLK specification not for a finite AC-MAS, but for its finite abstraction.The key concept we identify in this section is uniformity. As we will see later, uniform AC-MAS systems where the behavior does not depend on the actual data available in the States. This means that the system contains all possible transitions that are enabled according to parametric rules of action, resulting in a rather \"complete\" transition relationship. This notion corresponds to that of generosity in databases (Abiteboul et al., 1995)."}, {"heading": "4.1 \u2295-Bisimulation", "text": "s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s\" s \"s"}, {"heading": "4.2 Finite Abstractions", "text": "We combine the notion of uniformity that has been examined so far in this section with the assumption about the limits made in Section 3.1.

Unlike Section 3.1, we are operating here on the basis of the complete FO-CTLK specification language. The main result here is given by Corollary 4.14, which guarantees that uniformity in the context of a limited AC-MAS is a sufficient condition for the satisfaction of the finite abstractions. Below, we assume that each AC-MAS P is such that adom (s0) C is not the case, so that all (infinitely many) elements are contained in Adom (s0).

As we have noted in the introduction, artefact-centric systems are typically implemented by declarative databases such as GSM (Hull et al., 2011). It is therefore of the utmost interest to investigate the verification problem, not only by means of criterion semantics such as AC-MAS, but by means of concrete programs. As discussed, GSM is an established declarative language for artefact-centric environments, alternative declarative approaches exist. For reasons of generality, we follow our discussion of a very broad class of declarative languages and define the concept of the artefact-centric program. Intuitively, an artefact-centric program (or AC program) is a declarative description of a whole system interacting with a series of multifactorial services."}, {"heading": "7.

The process begins when a customer prepares and submits a purchase order (PO), i.e. a list of products that the customer requires to the manufacturer. Upon receipt of a PO code, the manufacturer prepares a material order (MO), i.e. a list of components that are required to assemble and forward the requested products. Upon receiver classes, we can either accept or reject."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We have proposed AC-MAS, a novel semantics that incorporates first-order features that can be used to think about multi-agent systems in an artefact-centric environment. We have observed that the problem of model verification for these structures is indecidable against specifications given in a first-rate temporal-epistemic logic, and can be used to identify suitable fragments for decidability. We have identified two orthogonal solutions to this problem. In the former, we have limited ourselves to the language of specification and have shown that by limiting ourselves to statutory atomic temporal-epistemic specifications, we allow infinite states, limited states and finite abstractions. In the latter, we have maintained the complete first order temporal-epistemic systems, but identified the remarkable subset of unitary AC-MAS. In this environment, we have shown that unified MAS is."}], "references": [{"title": "Web Services - Concepts, Architectures and Applications. Data-Centric Systems and Applications", "author": ["G.

Artifacts consist of data and lifecycles, accounting respectively for the relational structure of the artifacts\u2019 states and their possible evolutions over time. In this paper we put forward artifact-centric multi-agent systems, a novel formalisation of artifact systems in the context of multi-agent systems operating on them. Differently from the usual process-based models of services, the semantics we give explicitly accounts for the data structures on which artifact systems are defined. We study the model checking problem for artifact-centric multi-agent systems against specifications written in a quantified version of temporal-epistemic logic expressing the knowledge of the agents in the exchange. We begin by noting that the problem is undecidable in general. We then identify two noteworthy restrictions, one syntactical and one semantical, that enable us to find bisimilar finite abstractions and therefore reduce the model checking problem to the instance on finite models. Under these assumptions we show that the model checking problem for these systems is EXPSPACE-complete. We then introduce artifact-centric programs, compact and declarative representations of the programs governing both the artifact system and the agents. We show that, while these in principle generate infinite-state systems, under natural conditions their verification problem can be solved on finite abstractions that can be effectively computed from the programs. Finally we exemplify the theoretical results of the paper through a mainstream procurement scenario from the artifact systems literature.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
