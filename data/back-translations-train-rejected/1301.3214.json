There are several significant difficulties with the above approach. Firstly, it is difficult to grasp a complex statistical relationship between a large number of binary variables (which represent emotions) and a high-dimensional vector (which represent the document). Furthermore, it is difficult to imagine a reliable process for compiling a finite list of all possible human emotions. Finally, it is not clear how documents that express a particular emotion should be used. The use of labeled documents only in suitable models that predict their labels, ignores the relationship between emotions and is problematic for emotions with only a few comments. We propose an alternative approach that models a stostic relationship between the document X, an emotion (the labeling of the labels that can be placed on the epileptic, the epileptic that lies directly with the labels that represent the epileptic, the epileptic that can be placed on the label)."}, {"heading": "2 The Statistical Model", "text": "We make the following four assumptions with respect to document X, the discrete emotion label Y (1, 2,., C), and the position on the continuous mood varied Z-Rl.1. We have the graphic structure: X \u2192 Z \u2192 Y, which implies that the emotion label Y (1,., C) is independent of the document X (typically in a bag of words or n-gram representation), the distribution of Z-dimension models is a specific emotion label Y = y), which means that the distribution of Z-dimension models (typically in a bag of words or n-gram representation) is a linear regression model: {Z | X = x}. The distances between the vectors in {E | Y = y models are sufficient."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "We have used these optional annotations in the form of emoticons, which can be selected from a predefined list of possible emotions, or from a novel emotion specified by the author. We have searched 15,910,060 doc-1http: / / www.livejournal.com and selected 1,346,937 documents that feature the most popular 32 emotion labels (in terms of the number of documents included in annotations). In Figure 1, we compare our model with Watson and Tellegen's well-known psychological model. We make the following observations: First, the horizontal axis expresses a mood of polarity-like emotion; the left part shows emotions as accomplished, happy and excited, while the right part shows emotions as sad and depressed. This is in line with Watson and Tellegen's observations. Second, the vertical predictive axis expresses the level of mental engagement or energy level."}, {"heading": "4 Summary", "text": "In this work, we introduced a continuous representation of human emotions Z and constructed a statistical model linking them to documents X and a discrete set of emotions Y. Our adapted model bears great similarities to models developed in the psychological literature based on human survey data. Recently, several attempts have been made to derive insights from social media or news data through mood predictions. It is likely that the current multivariate view of emotions will contribute to progress in these important and challenging tasks."}], "references": [{"title": "Experiments with mood classification in blog posts", "author": ["G.
