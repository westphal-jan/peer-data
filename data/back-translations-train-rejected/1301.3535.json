Thanks to a major US airline, this study is able to assign airport locks and analyze gate assignments with the actual number of transfer passengers at a major US hub airport. Flight schedules and transfer passenger data on May 1, 2011 at the hub airport are sourced from the airline, assuming that all flights are full of passengers. Passengers checking in at the airport (departure passengers) and whose final destination is the airport (destination passengers) move from the passenger terminal to a gate. Passengers who have connecting flights at the airport (transfer passengers) move from one gate to another. Since only data on the number of transfer passengers from a single airline is available, passengers other than transfer passengers are treated between the flights of the airline with departure and destination passengers (O & D)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Objective 1: Minimize Passenger Transit Time", "text": "The first goal is to minimize the transit time of passengers at an airport. Passengers at an airport are divided into three groups: Passengers begin their journey from the airport. Passengers at the airport switch from one flight to another at the airport. The transit time of passengers depends on the distance from a security checkpoint to a gate (ds). Passengers at the airport switch from one flight to another. Passengers at the airport can move faster by moving on the sidewalk, subway passengers move, etc. Assume that the flight is at gate j and the number of passengers on the flight i noi, then the total time of flight i is higher, where passengers on the way i / v m can move faster, subway passengers move etc. Assume that the flight i is at gate j and the number of passengers on the flight i is noi, then the total time of transit time of passengers i is noi / v m."}, {"heading": "2.3 Objective 2: Minimize Aircraft Taxi Time", "text": "The second objective is to minimize the unhindered taxi time and taxi delay. Unhindered taxi time for an arrival time is calculated by the taxi speed; the unhindered taxi time for a departure time from the moment an aircraft leaves the ramp area without a taxi delay. It includes the duration of the push back. A taxi delay occurs in one of the following cases. 1) A taxiway blocks the push-back route of another aircraft. 2) Two aircraft taxis in opposite directions in the same taxi lane. The first case is called push-back blocking and the push-back flight is delayed until the taxiway passes the taxiway. The second case is called taxi blocking and one of the aircraft has to shift its taxi lane to another taxi lane."}, {"heading": "2.4 Objective 3: Maximize the Robustness of Gate Assignments", "text": "The third goal is to maximize the robustness of gate assignments. Likewise, the goal is to minimize the duration of gate conflicts. If a gate is still occupied by an aircraft, if another aircraft requests the gate, it should wait until the assigned gate or another gate is available, which corresponds to a gate conflict. Figure 2 illustrates a gate conflict where acta (i) and actd (i) indicate the actual arrival and departure times of flight i, and gate separation is the time span between the scheduled departure time of flight i (touti) and the scheduled arrival time of flight k (tink). Figure 2 shows flight i is scheduled to leave the gate before arrival of flight k, but the departure time of flight i is delayed and flight k arrives earlier than planned. Thus, if flight k arrives, the gate is not released and flight k must wait for a gate."}, {"heading": "2.5 Trade-offs of Multiple Objectives", "text": "It is well known that there are trade-offs presented in this study [9, 13]. In order to analyze the trade-offs between three objectives, five scenarios are presented in Table 1. Scenario 1-3 optimizes each objective. Scenario 4 weighs equally on Objectives 1 and 2. Thus, it optimizes two objectives at the same time. Scenario 5 takes into account all objectives: 40% for the first and second objective and 20% for the third. These percentages are chosen arbitrarily: The ratio of three objectives depends only on the policy of airport managers and airlines. Table 1: Scenario 1: Scenario 1: Scenario 1: Scenario 2: Objective 1: Objective 1: Objective 1: Objective 1: Objective 1: Objective 2: Objective 2: Objective 2: Objective 2: Objective 2: Objective 3: Objective 3: Objective 3: Objective 4: Objective 2: Objective 2: Objective 2: 2: 2: 4: Objective 2: 4 + Objective 40.5: Objective 2: Objective 40.5."}, {"heading": "2.6 Optimization Method", "text": "Taboo Search (TS) is a meta-heuristic algorithm known to deal efficiently with combinatorial optimization problems such as the gate assignment problem [14, 15]. Because the gate assignment problem is complex, it is difficult to find the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. TS can outperform the Branch and Bound and Genetic Algorithm in terms of time and resolution accuracy for the gate assignment problem [9]. TS is a local search so that the algorithm can approach a local optimum that is not the global optimum. To help TS escape a local optimum, a taboo memory restricts TS from using recently used searches for certain iterations. However, if a limited search engine improves the objective value, the search engine can be used independently of the taboo memory known as an aspiration criterion."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "In Scenario 4 and 5, passengers run longer than in Scenario 1, but less than in the original (current) gate assignment and Scenario 2 and 3.Fig.7 shows the average taxi time of each passenger. Undoubtedly, Scenario 2 (Taxi 100%) produces the shortest taxi time without a taxi delay. Scenario 3 (Robust 100%), however, concludes that Scenario 4 and 5 balance well between two different destinations: minimizing the passenger journey time and minimizing the rolling time. Scenario 8 shows the average gate conflict time of each passenger. Scenario 3 (Robust 100%) induces the shortest duration of the gate conflict. Note that Scenario 5 (Pax 40%, Taxi 40%, Robust 20%) yields the second best result of gate assignment, while Scenario 4 (Pax 50%, Balance Objectives for Gate 3) yields better results for Gate 5."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "This study presented several simulations of gate allocation according to different objectives. These objectives are the minimization of the transit time of passengers in passenger terminals, the minimization of aircraft taxi time on ramps and the minimization of the duration of gate conflicts. It is known that there are trade-offs between these objectives, so an objective function has been proposed that balances three objectives at the same time. The objective compensation function fulfills all three objectives, while other objective functions fulfills only one or two objectives. Furthermore, the objective compensation function exceeds the current gate allocation in each destination. Therefore, the airport gate allocation has a potential to improve the efficiency of traffic flow in the passenger terminals and on the ramps, as well as the robustness of gate operations. Future work will take into account the gate holding strategies generated by the airport CDM. Although this study includes the robustness of gate allocation, the gate holding strategies will always be needed to help the passengers to address the comprehensive experience of the holding strategy, and to make the holding experience work better."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "This work was partially supported by the European Community Framework Programme 7 as part of the META CDM project.
