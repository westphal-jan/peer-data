However, these methods fail when real data is available with partially correlated views. Newer methods such as factorized orthogonal latent space [3] or multi-view harmonium (MVH) [4] assume that views are generated from two groups of hidden nodes: sight-specific hidden nodes and common nodes. However, these models are based on the predefined connection structure, and deciding on the number of hidden and sight-specific hidden nodes requires a lot of human effort. In this essay, we propose structure-adapting multi-view harmonium (SA-MVH), which avoids all of the problems mentioned above. Instead of explicitly viewing-specific and hidden nodes, we automatically redefining each of these nodes dependencies from the existence of a set by just choosing to hide them from the set and let us use them."}, {"heading": "2 The Proposed Model", "text": "The definition of SA-MVH begins by selecting the marginal distributions of the visible nodes and the hidden nodes v (k) and a series of hidden nodes h from exponential family distributions: p (v (k), p (hj), p (exp), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj), p (hj). Connections between visible nodes and hidden nodes of SA-MVH are defined by weight matrices {W (k) and switching parameters (skj)."}, {"heading": "3 Numerical Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Feature Extraction on Noisy Arabic-Roman Digit Dataset", "text": "To simulate the view-specific and common characteristics of multi-view data, we developed a synthetic dataset containing 11,800 pairs of Arabic numerals and the corresponding Roman numerals in different fonts. For each pair, we added random vertical line sounds to Arabic numerals and horizontal line sounds to Roman numerals (Figure 2- (a)). SA-MVH trained with 200 hidden nodes found 95 common features (linked to both views) and 47 view-specific features for Roman numerals and 32 for Arabic numerals. The remaining 26 were not connected to views and were ignored. Most common features were noise-free and coded parts of Roman and Arabic numerals (Figure 2- (b))."}, {"heading": "3.2 Image Classification on Caltech-256 Dataset", "text": "We extracted 512 dimensions of GIST features from the Caltech 256 dataset and 1,536 dimensions of gradient histograms (HoG) to simulate multiview settings. SA-MVH and other multiview feature extraction methods based on Harmonium - DWH and MVH were trained on the dataset for comparison. We also compared our method with Sparse Filtering [5], a non-harmonium-based method. We trained the feature extraction methods and tested the methods with k-next neighbor classifiers (Table 1). SA-MVH achieved better results in this experiment than other feature extraction models, regardless of the value of k for the closest neighbor classifier."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "The proposed method, SA-MVH, models multiview data distribution with less restrictive assumptions and also reduces the number of parameters that need to be adjusted by human hands. SA-MVH introduces switching parameters that control the connections between hidden nodes and input views and find the desired configuration during training. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach by comparing our model with existing models in experiments with synthetic data sets and image classification with simulated multi-view settings."}], "references": [{"title": "Canonical correlation analysis: An overview with applications to learning methods", "author": ["D.R.
