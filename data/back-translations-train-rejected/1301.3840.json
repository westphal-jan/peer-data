We argue that the a person's utility value for a given outcome can be treated as we treat other domain attributes: as a random variable with a density function over its possible values. We show that we can apply statistical density estimation techniques to learn such a density function from a database of partially elicited utility functions. In particular, we define a Bayesian learning framework for this problem, assuming the distribution over utilities is a mixture of Gaussians, where the mixture components represent statistically coherent subpopulations. We can also extend our techniques to the problem of discovering generalized additivity structure in the utility functions in the population. We define a Bayesian model selection criterion for utility function structure and a search procedure over structures. The factorization of the utilities in the learned model, and the generalization obtained from density estimation, allows us to provide robust estimates of utilities using a significantly smaller number of utility elicitation questions. We experiment with our technique on synthetic utility data and on a real database of utility functions in the domain of prenatal diagnosis.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:49:11 GMT  (381kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3840v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["urszula chajewska", "daphne koller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3840"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.3840.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Utilities as Random Variables: Density Estimation and Structure Discovery", "authors": ["Urszula Chajewska", "Daphne Koller"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it will be able to introduce the aforementioned cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated rf\u00fc ide cerebral geeaeenlcsrteeSrteeu."}, {"heading": "1 2 1 2 -2[[Arwr-u[[ + :ziiBrwr-Brllrll 2cr1", "text": "This year, more than ever before in the history of the city, where it has come to the point where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place."}], "references": [{"title": "Graphical models for preference and utility", "author": ["F.
