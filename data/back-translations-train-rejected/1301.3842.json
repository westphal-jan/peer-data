Because there is a cost associated with sending each offer, the optimal mailing strategy depends on both the benefit obtained from a purchase and how the offer affects the buying behavior of the customers. In this paper, we describe two methods for partitioning the potential customers into groups, and show how to perform a simple cost-benefit analysis to decide which, if any, of the groups should be targeted. In particular, we consider two decision-tree learning algorithms. The first is an \"off the shelf\" algorithm used to model the probability that groups of customers will buy the product. The second is a new algorithm that is similar to the first, except that for each group, it explicitly models the probability of purchase under the two mailing scenarios: (1) the mail is sent to members of that group and (2) the mail is not sent to members of that group. Using data from a real-world advertising experiment, we compare the algorithms to each other and to a naive mail-to-all strategy.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:49:19 GMT  (203kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3842v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david maxwell chickering", "david heckerman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3842"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.3842.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Decision T heoretic Approach to Targeted Advertising", "authors": ["David Maxwell", "David Heckerman"], "emails": ["dmax@microsoft.com", "heckerma@microsoft"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "A simple advertising strategy that can be used to increase the sales of a product is to send special offers by e-mail to selected customers.

To understand the problem with the obvious course of action, it is useful to consider how a person should respond to the advertisement, whether or not they receive the advertisement; the second person we refer to as such describes a person who receives the offer and does not receive the offer, regardless of whether or not he receives the advertisement; and the third person we refer to as transferable describes a person who subscribes to the offer and does not subscribe."}], "references": [{"title": "A Bayesian approach", "author": ["C.
