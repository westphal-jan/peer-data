The paper shows that epistemic independence and the standard Markov condition violate desirable separation properties. The adoption of a contraction condition leads to d-separation but still fails to guarantee a belief separation property. To overcome this unsatisfactory situation, a strong Markov condition is proposed, based on epistemic independence. The main result is that the strong Markov condition leads to strong independence and does enforce separation properties; this result implies that (1) separation properties of Bayesian networks do extend to epistemic independence and sets of probability measures, and (2) strong independence has a clear justification based on epistemic independence and the strong Markov condition.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:49:30 GMT  (224kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3845v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fabio gagliardi cozman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3845"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.3845.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Separation Properties of Sets of Probability Measures", "authors": ["Fabio G.
