We then show how SLPs can be used to represent prior distributions for machine learning, using (i) logic programs and (ii) Bayes net structures as examples. Drawing on existing work in statistics, we apply the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm to construct a Markov chain which samples from the posterior distribution. A Prolog implementation for this is described. We also discuss the possibility of constructing explicit representations of the posterior.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:49:34 GMT  (295kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3846v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["james cussens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3846"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.3846.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Stochastic Logic Programs: Sampling, Inference and Applications", "authors": ["James Cussens"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "Algorithms for exact and approximate inference in stochastic logic programs (SLPs) are pre\u00ad sented, based respectively, on variable elimina\u00ad tion and importance sampling.
