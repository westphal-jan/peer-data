Ticket j (for 1 \ufffd j \ufffd m) pays b units if the result j actually occurs; otherwise it pays nothing. All tickets cost 1 unit, so all results share the same odds. Agent has a certain capital K, which he wants to invest in lottery tickets. Suppose that Agent thinks the actual results are distributed depending on any distribution P *. Agent's gambling strategy can be described by a vector P = (1). P (m))), where P (m) is the share of capital K, the Agent invests in earnings j. That is, he buys P *.
