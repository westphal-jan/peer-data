The graph of a dependency network, unlike a Bayesian network, is potentially cyclic. The probability component of a dependency network, like a Bayesian network, is a set of conditional distributions, one for each node given its parents. We identify several basic properties of this representation and describe a computationally efficient procedure for learning the graph and probability components from data. We describe the application of this representation to probabilistic inference, collaborative filtering (the task of predicting preferences), and the visualization of acausal predictive relationships.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:50:38 GMT  (314kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3862v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["david heckerman", "david maxwell chickering", "christopher meek", "robert rounthwaite", "carl kadie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3862"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.3862.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Dependency Networks for Collaborative Filtering and Data Visualization", "authors": ["David Heckerman", "David Maxwell Chickering", "Christopher Meek", "Robert Rounthwaite", "Carl Kadie"], "emails": ["heckerma@microsoft.com", "dmax@microsoft.com", "meek@microsoft.com", "robertro@microsoft.com", "carlk@microsoft.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "We describe a graphical representation of probable relationships - an alternative to the Bayesian network, which is called the dependency network.
