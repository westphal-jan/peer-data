{"id": "1301.3868", "review": {"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Jan-2013", "title": "Making Sensitivity Analysis Computationally Efficient", "abstract": "To investigate the robustness of the output probabilities of a Bayesian network, a sensitivity analysis can be performed. A one-way sensitivity analysis establishes, for each of the probability parameters of a network, a function expressing a posterior marginal probability of interest in terms of the parameter. Current methods for computing the coefficients in such a function rely on a large number of network evaluations. In this paper, we present a method that requires just a single outward propagation in a junction tree for establishing the coefficients in the functions for all possible parameters; in addition, an inward propagation is required for processing evidence. Conversely, the method requires a single outward propagation for computing the coefficients in the functions expressing all possible posterior marginals in terms of a single parameter. We extend these results to an n-way sensitivity analysis in which sets of parameters are studied.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:51:02 GMT  (306kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3868v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["uffe kj{\\ae}rulff", "linda c van der gaag"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3868"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.3868.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Making Sensitivity Analysis Computationally Efficient", "authors": ["Uffe Kj::erulff", "Linda C. van der Gaag"], "emails": ["uk@cs.auc.dk", "linda@cs."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}], "references": [{"title": "Computer-Aided Electromyography and Ex\u00ad", "author": ["S.
