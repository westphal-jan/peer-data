Compared to other game-theoretic representations, such as strategic or extensive forms, G nets are more structured and more compact; more fundamentally, G nets constitute a computationally advantageous framework for strategic inference, as both probability and utility independencies are captured in the structure of the network and can be exploited in order to simplify the inference process. An important aspect of multi-agent reasoning is the identification of some or all of the strategic equilibria in a game; we present original convergence methods for strategic equilibrium which can take advantage of strategic separabilities in the G net structure in order to simplify the computations. Specifically, we describe a method which identifies a unique equilibrium as a function of the game payoffs, and one which identifies all equilibria.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:51:10 GMT  (307kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3870v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["pierfrancesco la mura"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3870"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.3870.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Game Networks", "authors": ["Pierfrancesco La Mura"], "emails": ["plamura@stanford.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it will happen, until it does."}], "references": [{"title": "Condi\u00ad tional, hierarchical, multi-agent preferences", "author": ["M L"], "venue": "In Proc. of Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge - VII,", "citeRegEx": "L,? \\Q1998\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "L", "year": 1998}, {"title": "Expected Utility Networks", "author": ["Y.
