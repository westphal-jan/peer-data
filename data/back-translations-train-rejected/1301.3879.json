We present a formal framework, termed asymmetric influence diagrams, that is based on the influence diagram and allows an efficient representation of asymmetric decision problems. As opposed to existing frameworks, the asymmetric influece diagram primarily encodes asymmetry at the qualitative level and it can therefore be read directly from the model. We give an algorithm for solving asymmetric influence diagrams. The algorithm initially decomposes the asymmetric decision problem into a structure of symmetric subproblems organized as a tree. A solution to the decision problem can then be found by propagating from the leaves toward the root using existing evaluation methods to solve the sub-problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:51:46 GMT  (353kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3879v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["thomas d nielsen", "finn verner jensen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3879"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.3879.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Representing and Solving Asymmetric Bayesian Decision Problems", "authors": ["Thomas D.

We present a formal framework called asymmetric influence diagrams, which are based on the influence diagram and allow an efficient representation of asymmetric decision problems. However, the asymmetric influence of people at the qualitative level is primarily unpronounced and can therefore be read directly from the model. We provide an algorithm for solving asymmetric influence diagrams. First, the algorithm breaks down the asymmetric decision problem into a structure of symmetric sub-problems, which are organized as a tree. A solution to the decision problem can then be found by using the existing assessment methods of existing evaluation methods to solve the asymmetric decision mechanisms."}], "references": [{"title": "A Comparison of Graphical Techniques for Asymmetric Decision Problems", "author": ["Bielza", "Shenoy", "C. 1999] Bielza", "P.P.
