Now, if we arrange the variables described in Theorem 2, we get a ROBDD where the nodes representing the cause variables are the nodes closest to the terminal node. This means that after propagation we can determine all the required values, i.e., the number of configurations given with ci = 1J and evidence e is given by: \"v (c) CardB (C = y, e) = L 2 # ie\" CtECtwhere Ci is the set of nodes Ci with an outgoing 1 arc and # li is the number of arcs on the path li from the Ci in question to the terminal node; the simple error assumption ensures that there is exactly one path from each Ci to the terminal node."}], "references": [{"title": "Decision-theoretic troubleshoot\u00ad ing: A framework for repair and experiment", "author": ["Breese", "Heckerman", "J.S. 1996] Breese", "D.
