Real-time query selectivity estimation (the problem of estimating the number of rows in the data satisfying a given predicate) is an important practical problem for such databases. We investigate the application of probabilis\u00ad tic models to this problem. In particular, we study a Markov random field (MRF) ap\u00ad proach based on frequent sets and maximum entropy, and compare it to the independence model and the Chow-Liu tree model. We find that the MRF model provides substantially more accurate probability estimates than the other methods but is more expensive from a computational and memory viewpoint. To alleviate the computational requirements we show how one can apply bucket elimination and clique tree approaches to take advantage of structure in the models and in the queries. We provide experimental results on two large real-world transaction datasets.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
