We introduce Probabilistic State-Dependent Grammars (PSDGs) to represent an agent's plan-generation process. The PSDG language model extends probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) by allowing production probabilities to depend on an explicit model of the planning agent's internal and external state. Given a PSDG description of the plan-generation process, we can then use inference algorithms that exploit the particular independence properties of the PSDG language to efficiently answer plan-recognition queries. The combination of the PSDG language model and inference algorithms extends the range of plan-recognition domains for which practical probabilistic inference is possible, as illustrated by applications in traffic monitoring and air combat.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:52:22 GMT  (294kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3888v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david v pynadath", "michael p wellman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3888"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.3888.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Probabilistic State-Dependent Grammars for Plan Recognition", "authors": ["David V.
