Due to their coarse level of representation detail, qualitative probabilistic networks do not provide for resolving trade-offs and typically yield ambiguous results upon inference. We present an algorithm for computing more insightful results for unresolved trade-offs. The algorithm builds upon the idea of using pivots to zoom in on the trade-offs and identifying the information that would serve to resolve them.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:52:25 GMT  (277kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3889v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["silja renooij", "linda c van der gaag", "simon parsons", "shaw green"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3889"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.3889.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Pivotal Pruning of Trade-offs in QPNs", "authors": ["Silja Renooij", "Linda C. van der Gaag", "Simon Parsons"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is more than ever in the history of the city, where it is so far that it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place."}, {"heading": "4 SPLITTING UP AND CONSTRUCTING SIGNS", "text": "This year it is as far as never before in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany."}], "references": [{"title": "Efficient reasoning in qualitative prob\u00ad abilistic networks", "author": ["Druzdzel", "Henrion", "1993a] M.J.
