This is done by alternating between the space of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and the space of skeletons. The found orientations of the edges are based on a scoring function rather than on induced conditional independences. This operator can be used as an extension to commonly employed search strategies. It is evaluated in experiments with artificial and real-world data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:52:45 GMT  (301kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3894v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["harald steck"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3894"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.3894.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the Use of Skeletons when Learning in Bayesian Networks", "authors": ["Harald Steck"], "emails": ["steck@in.tum.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}], "references": [{"title": "Discrete Multivariate Analysis", "author": ["Y.
