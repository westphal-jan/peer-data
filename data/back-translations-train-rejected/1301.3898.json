Using structural-semantical definitions of the probabilities of necessary or sufficient causation (or both), we show how to optimally bound these quantities from data obtained in experimental and observational studies, making minimal assumptions concerning the data-generating process. In particular, we strengthen the results of Pearl (1999) by weakening the data-generation assumptions and deriving theoretically sharp bounds on the probabilities of causation. These results delineate precisely how empirical data can be used both in settling questions of attribution and in solving attribution-related problems of decision making.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:53:00 GMT  (278kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3898v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jin tian", "judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3898"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.3898.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Probabilities of Causation: Bounds and Identification", "authors": ["Jin Tian"], "emails": ["@cs."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is at an all-time high in the history of the European Union."}, {"heading": "PN = P(Yx' =f alse I X= true, Y =true)", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}], "references": [{"title": "Reference guide on epidemiology", "author": ["L.A.
