In this work, these operators are used to compute topological relations between objects defined by the constraints of the nine Intersection Model (9-IM) from Egenhofer. With the help of these constraints, we define a procedure to compute the topological relations on CSG objects. These topological relations are Disjoint, Contains, Inside, Covers, CoveredBy, Equals and Overlaps, and are defined in a top-level ontology with a specific semantic definition on relation such as Transitive, Symmetric, Asymmetric, Functional, Reflexive, and Irreflexive. The results of topological relations computation are stored in the ontology allowing after what to infer on these topological relationships. In addition, logic rules based on the Semantic Web Language allows the definition of logic programs that define which topological relationships have to be computed on which kind of objects. For instance, a \"Building\" that overlaps a \"Railway\" is a \"RailStation\".", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Jan 2013 08:13:54 GMT  (203kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4780v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CG cs.AI", "authors": ["helmi ben hmida", "christophe cruz", "frank boochs", "christophe nicolle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.4780"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.4780.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "From Quantitative Spatial Operator to Qualitative Spatial Relation Using Constructive Solid Geometry, Logic Rules and Optimized 9-IM Model A Semantic Based Approach", "authors": ["Helmi Ben Hmida", "Frank Boochs"], "emails": ["boochs}@geoinform.fh-", "cnicolle}@u-bourgogne.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "A.

CSG-based implementation of 3D topological relations", "text": "Constructive Solid State Geometry is defined by Friedrich A. Lohm\u00fcller in [21]. It is a technique used in solid state modeling that enables the modeler to create a complex surface or object by using Boolean operators such as union, intersection or difference to combine objects. A CSG object can be represented by a tree, each leaf being a primitive operation and each node a Boolean operation. In fact, there are only five standard CSG operations that are materialized by union, intersection, difference, inverse and clipped _ by. These methods return the resulting solid from the operation and are limited to objects including closed space. In fact, lines and planes are both objects that do not contain any volume, which means that no possible CSG operations can be applied to them. As a conventional solution, a solid is created from a line and plane, adding a small noise rate to the aforementioned geometry, while always considering the fact that the number of space objects is smaller than the number of objects used."}, {"heading": "C. Ontology and rules", "text": "Ontology is a formal representation of knowledge through the hierarchy of concepts and the relationships between these concepts. In theory, ontology is a formal, explicit specification of common conceptualization [24]. In any case, ontology can be considered a formalization of knowledge representation and descriptive logic (DLs) and provides a logical formalization of ontologies [25]. Descriptive logic (DLs) [26] [27] are a family of knowledge representative languages that can be used to represent the knowledge of an application domain in a structured and formally well understood manner. The following example defines a mother as a woman who has at least one child type of person. By implication, it means that each individual type of woman represents languages that stand as at least one relationship to a person and the kind of relationship. \"This woman is of the kind of mother tongue.\""}, {"heading": "6.5) Tall(?x)", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "D. Enrichment of the ontology from Boolean operators using CSG model", "text": "Using the CSG model and its associated Boolean operator allows us to model the topological relationships. In order to combine SWRL rules with topological operators, built-in messages are used to calculate the operator. Consequently, the results of the operators can be used to define queries or to enrich ontology with new topological relationships between two objects. The following rule stipulates that a \"building\" defined in ontology and overlapping with a \"railway\" is also a \"station\" in ontology. Buildings (? b) ^ Railway (? r) ^ Topo: Intersections (? b,? r) Station (? b) To make it realistic, two problems appear and need to be solved. First, the semantic definition of relationships at the ontology level needs to be defined in terms of their own properties.
