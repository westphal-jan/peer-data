While there is a clear need for automated or even semi-automated methods to simplify scenario creation, research on the subject is still in the very early stages. This review shows that many of the existing methods for geometric modeling and object recognition can be important for process automation. Three main strategies are described in the literature, the first being based on human interaction with supplied software for point cloud classification and annotation, while the second strategy relies more on automated data processing without human interaction through the use of different segmentation techniques for feed extraction, new techniques represent an improvement over those cited by integrating semantic networks to guide the reconstruction process."}, {"heading": "2.1.1 Manual Supported strategy", "text": "In fact, 3D object reconstruction tools are still largely based on human interaction, where the user may be assisted in their design, but object interpretation, selection, and extraction of measurements must be done manually, making this the most time-consuming way to get from a dataset to an extracted object (Leica Cyclone: 3D Point Cloud Processing Software)."}, {"heading": "2.1.2 Semi-automatic and automatic strategy", "text": "These methods represent a surface quality based on the handling of objects that prove problematic in their entirety. In this context, it is also necessary to understand the way in which the objects in their entirety are viewed from the point of view of form.

In this case, it is the way in which they move, it is the way in which they are viewed in their entirety."}, {"heading": "2.2 Knowledge modelling", "text": "In recent years, formal ontology has been proposed as a solution to the problem of reconstructing 3D objects from 3D dot clouds (Cruz, Marzani, & Boochs, 2007).In this area, the ontology structure has been defined as a formal representation of knowledge through a series of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between these concepts. It is used to puzzle over the entities within that domain, and can be used to describe the domain. Conventionally, ontology presents a \"formal, explicit specification of a common conceptualization\" (Gruber, 2005).Ontology provides a common vocabulary that can be used to model a domain. Well-made ontology has a number of positive aspects, such as the ability to define a precise vocabulary of terms, the ability to inherit and expand relationships, the relationships between defined languages, and finally the ability to explain relationships between defined concepts."}, {"heading": "3 APPROACH OVERVIEW", "text": "In fact, it is so that the majority of them are able to survive themselves, without it coming to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, and in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, and in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, and in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, and in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, and in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, and in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, and in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process, in which it comes to a process"}, {"heading": "3.1 Ontology schema", "text": "This section discusses the various aspects related to the ontology structure behind the WiDOP prototype in order to respond to the various purposes cited. Ontology presents the core of the WiDOP project and provides a knowledge base for the application created. However, the global schema of the modeled ontology structure provides a suitable framework to characterize the various captured objects from the point of view of 3D processing. The generated ontology is mainly used for two purposes: conducting the processing algorithm sequence creation based on the target object. To facilitate the semantic annotation of the different captured objects within the target group, the ontology is divided into three main parts: the algorithm conceiving concepts and the geometry sequence creation based on the target object properties. However, they are linked to other captured objects within the target scene objects."}, {"heading": "4 DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE MODELLING", "text": "The resulting knowledge base around the Deutsche Bahn scene was inspired by our discussion with the domain expert and our study based on the official website of the Deutsche Bahn specification \"http: / / stellwerke.de.\" Once it is complete, new knowledge about the geometry and metrological relationships between the various elements will be synthesized. An overview of the elements targeted, the most useful and discriminatory features for their detection and interaction, is available. Basically, a railway signal is one of the most important elements within the Deutsche Bahn scene, where we find main signals and secondary signals. Main signals are divided into primary signals and long-distance signals. In fact, the primary signal is a railway signal. It indicates whether the subsequent track section may be traveled. Normally, a primary signal is announced by a long-distance signal, the latter indicating which image signal is to be expected to be linked to the main signal at a distance of 1 km. Large variety of secondary signals are presented from each other, as are the preceding electrical elements, each of the other, and each of the other."}, {"heading": "4.1 Geometric characteristics", "text": "Geometric characteristics can be a discriminatory feature that can improve the automatic annotation process. Therefore, we decide to examine the various geometric characteristics related to the cited elements and then use only the discriminatory characteristic as the basic feature for a particular object. In a first step, Bounding Boxes are used to focus on topological relationships. The following table groups the object characteristics in relation to the properties of a Bounding Box (Figure 5). This table is extended by algorithmic characteristics, but not presented here."}, {"heading": "4.2 Topologic characteristics", "text": "During the exploration of the railway area, many standard rules are imposed to help the driver and ensure the safety of the passengers. In our view, these are also helpful for checking and guiding the annotation process: for example, the distance between the long-distance signal and the main signal corresponds to the braking distance that the trains need. The braking distance is to be determined on a specific route and is often 1000 m in the main lines or 700 m in rare cases. In addition, three to five approach signal shafts are about 75 m away, while the last one is then 100 m away from the long-distance signal, Figure 6. The same applies to the mast elements, as they are usually 50 m apart from each other. In addition, an important additional information that can distinguish the masts from the signal is connected to the small power box, which is always connected to the signal bottom.In the next section, an overview of the procedure undertaken in the WiDOP project for recognizing and commenting the various objects of Deutsche Bahn is given."}, {"heading": "5 SEMANTIC ANNOTATION PROCESS", "text": "The process for the qualification of topological relations between geometries is based on SWFD rules."}, {"heading": "5.1 Point cloud to geometry", "text": "The first step is geometric element detection, which is why the detected elements are used to populate the ontology.The \"3Dswrlb: VerticalElementDetection\" block is aimed at detecting vertical elements. The prototype of the designed built-in is: 3D _ swrlb _ Processing: VerticalElementDetection (? Vert,? Dir), with the first parameter representing the target object class and the last the point cloud directory defined within the created scene. At the moment, the detection process leads to bouncing boxes representing a rough position and orientation of the detected object. Table 1 shows the mapping between the built-in 3D processing objects, which are computerized and translated for prediction, and the corresponding class."}, {"heading": "5.2 Geometries to topology", "text": "Once geometries are detected, the second step aims to verify certain topology properties between detected geometries. Therefore, 3D _ Topologic inserts have been added to extend the SWRL language. Topological rules are used to define constraints between different elements. After parsing the topological inserts and their execution, the result is used to enrich ontology with relationships between individuals verifying the rules. Similar to 3D inserts, our engine translates the rules with topological inserts into standard rules, Table 2."}, {"heading": "5.3 Geometry to semantic", "text": "3DProcessing _ swrlb: VerticalElementDetection (?

These rules control and manage the annotation process. The following example shows how a rule defines the class of a vertical element that is of type mast in relation to its height."}, {"heading": "5.4 Topology to semantic", "text": "The following example shows how semantic information about existing objects is used in conjunction with topological relations to define the class of another object.

This knowledge modelled under the ontology SWFL rules is used to comment on the execution of 3D processing, topological qualification and finally the detected elements to enrich ontology and advance the detection of new objects. Future work will include the integration of new knowledge that can intervene within the annotation process, such as the number of detected lines within each boundary field and the updating of the general platform architecture to ensure more communication between scene knowledge within 3D processing."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This paper presents work carried out within the framework of a research project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Education under the contract number 1758X09.
