These approaches all make use of type theory at least to compose the meanings. We present here with some details one of these approaches, ours, which makes use of sec- ond order lambda calculus as a type theory for meaning assembly and of multi sorted higher order predicate logic for semantic representation.The advantages of such an approach are illustrated both in formal semantics (determiners, quantifiers, plurals) and in lexical pragmatics (coercions, possible and impossible copredication over different senses, deverbal am- biguities, fictive motion,..). Thereafter we explain the similar approaches by pointing out the differences.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Jan 2013 17:42:19 GMT  (1368kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4938v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 1 Jan 2014 23:58:30 GMT  (1383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4938v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 3 Jan 2014 15:43:25 GMT  (1383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4938v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.CL", "authors": ["christian retor\\'e"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.4938"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.4938.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A TYPE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE SEMANTICS: THE MONTAGOVIAN GENERATIVE LEXICON", "authors": ["CHRISTIAN RETOR\u00c9"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The meaning of the word is represented by second-order lambda terms of the lambda calculation (Girard's System F) with basic types, including one type of propositions and many types for a variety of sorted logics. This framework is capable of integrating a correct treatment of lexical phenomena into Mongolian compositional semantics, including the limitation of selection imposed by the type of arguments of a predicate, and the possible adaptation of a word to specific contexts. Among these adaptations of the sense of the word to the context, ontological inclusions are dealt with by an extension of the system F with compulsive subtyping introduced in the present essay. The advantages of this framework for lexical pragmatics are illustrated by means of meaning transfers and constraints, possible and impossible co-authentication through various senses, deverbal ambiguities, and \"fictive motion.\" Next, we show the compositional framework by using the quantitators to open the compositional framework."}, {"heading": "1.

Compositional semantics issues: determiners, quantifiers, plurals", "text": "So far, we have focused on phenomena in lexical semantics, which are normally excluded from standard models, but are properly mastered by our model. But, we also need to take a look at compositional semantics, which is a logical structure of a set, to see if our model is still properly analyzing what compositional models do, and possibly provide better analysis. Hopefully, sentence structures will be analyzed so far correctly, but beyond that, our extended structure is quite attractive for some classic topics such as determinators and quantification, as we show in this section. Determinators and quantifiers. The examples presented so far only relate to correct names, because the determiners and quantifiers are a bit more complex than in the usual montagographic setting, let's see how they work. To integrate lexical questions into compositional semantics, which is closely linked to syntax, we should at least describe the behavior of determinators and quantifiers in our framework."}, {"heading": "5. Comparison with related work and conclusion", "text": "As discussed at the beginning of the second section, the basic type of the various types of terms can be discussed. We have suggested using classifiers as the basic types of a language with classifiers, because classifiers are linguistically and cognitively motivated classes of words and entities. However, it is quite possible that other types of basic types are more suitable especially for specific applications. [38] With regard to this problem, the inclusion between basic types that are morphisms in our model can be introduced with words or as general axioms. We prefer the first solution, which allows idiosyncratic behavior, depending on words as explained in paragraphs 2.4 with \"classise\" and \"promotion.\" Nevertheless, when it comes to ontological inclusions, or other very general constraints, we think that a subordinate approach is possible and reduces the size of the lexicon."}], "references": [{"title": "Quantification in ordinary language: from a critic of set-theoretic approaches to a proof-theoretic proposal", "author": ["Vito Michele Abrusci", "Christian Retor\u00e9"], "venue": "In Peter Schro\u0308der-Heister, editor, 14th Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Sciences,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Lexical Meaning in context \u2013 a web of words", "author": ["Nicholas Asher"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Formalization of coercions in lexical semantics", "author": ["Nicholas Asher", "Zhaohui Luo"], "venue": "Sinn und Bedeutung", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2012}, {"title": "A type driven theory of predication with complex types", "author": ["Nicolas Asher"], "venue": "Fundamenta Informaticae,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Towards a Type-Theoretical Account of Lexical Semantics", "author": ["Christian Bassac", "Bruno Mery", "Christian Retor\u00e9"], "venue": "Journal of Logic Language and Information,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Logical Aspects of Computational Linguistics - 7th International Conference, LACL", "author": ["Denis B\u00e9chet", "Alexander Ja.

This framework is able to integrate a proper treatment of lexical phenomena into a Montagovian compositional semantics, including the restriction of selection which imposes the nature of the arguments of a predicate, and the possible adaptation of a word meaning to some contexts. Among these adaptations of a word\u2019s sense to the context, ontological inclusions are handled by an extension of system F with coercive subtyping that is introduced in the present paper. The benefits of this framework for lexical pragmatics are illustrated on meaning transfers and coercions, on possible and impossible copredication over different senses, on deverbal ambiguities, and on \u201dfictive motion\u201d. Next we show that the compositional treatment of determiners, quantifiers, plurals,... are finer grained in our framework.
