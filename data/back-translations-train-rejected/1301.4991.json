Here, we share our experience regarding the creation of 3D semantic facility model out of unorganized 3D point clouds. Thus, a knowledge-based detection approach of objects using the OWL ontology language is presented. This knowledge is used to define SWRL detection rules. In addition, the combination of 3D processing built-ins and topological Built-Ins in SWRL rules allows a more flexible and intelligent detection, and the annotation of objects contained in 3D point clouds. The created WiDOP prototype takes a set of 3D point clouds as input, and produces as output a populated ontology corresponding to an indexed scene visualized within VRML language. The context of the study is the detection of railway objects materialized within the Deutsche Bahn scene such as signals, technical cupboards, electric poles, etc. Thus, the resulting enriched and populated ontology, that contains the annotations of objects in the point clouds, is used to feed a GIS system or an IFC file for architecture purposes.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Jan 2013 12:42:17 GMT  (1218kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4991v1", "ISSN: 1942-2679. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1301.4783"]], "COMMENTS": "ISSN: 1942-2679. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1301.4783", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["helmi ben hmida", "christophe cruz", "frank boochs", "christophe nicolle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.4991"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.4991.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Knowledge Base Approach for 3D Objects Detection in Point Clouds Using 3D Processing and Specialists Knowledge", "authors": ["Helmi Ben Hmida", "Frank Boochs", "Christophe Cruz", "Christophe Nicolle"], "emails": ["boochs}@geoinform.fh-", "cnicolle}@u-bourgogne.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive themselves are able to survive themselves, \"he told the German Press Agency in an interview with\" Welt am Sonntag \":\" I don't think we will be able to change the world. \""}, {"heading": "A. Manual survey model creation", "text": "In current practice, the creation of a plant model is largely a manual process carried out by service providers assigned to scan and model a plant. In reality, it can take several months to complete a project, depending on the complexity of the plant and the modeling requirements. Reverse engineering tools are characterized by the geometric modeling of surfaces, but with the lack of volumetric representation, while such design systems cannot cope with the massive data sets of laser scanners. As a result, modelers often oscillate back and forth between different software packages during the modeling process, leading to the possibility of information loss due to limitations of data exchange standards or errors in implementing standards within the software tools. [16] Previous knowledge of the determined geometry of components, such as the diameter of a column, can be used to limit the modeling process, or to preserve the characteristics of a component library."}, {"heading": "B. Semi-Automatic and Automatic methods", "text": "The manual process of constructing a survey model is time-consuming, labor-intensive, tedious, subjective, and requires skilled manpower. Although modelling individual geometric primitives can be quite fast, modeling a facility can require thousands of primitives. The above-mentioned observations and others illustrate the need for semi-automated and automated techniques for creating models. Ideally, a system could be developed that uses a point cloud of a facility as input and for producing a fully compliant model. The first step within the automated and automated system extends to creating models."}, {"heading": "C. Discussion", "text": "The methods presented for collecting modeling and object recognition are based on knowledge of the domain. Concepts such as \"signals are vertical\" and \"signals intersect with the ground\" are explicitly encoded by a set of rules. Such rule-based approaches tend to be fragile and collapse when tested in new and slightly different environments.In addition, people model the context by specifying the concepts and relationships of objects to describe the world.However, no one mentions the knowledge of 3D processing algorithms and the associated results such as geometry and topology.Based on these observations, flexible representations of objects of the plant and more complex guiding algorithms for object recognition by modeling algorithmic, geometric and topological knowledge within an ontology2012, \u00a9 Copyright by authors, Published in accordance with IARIA - www.iaria.orstructure the way of significantly improving."}, {"heading": "A.

The 3D processing algorithms", "text": "Numerical processing involves a series of algorithms or their combination to process the spatial data. Strategies include the recognition of geometric elements (straight line, plane, surface, etc.), projection-based, regional estimation, histogram matrices, etc. All of these strategies are either guided by knowledge or use existing knowledge to intelligently and optimally estimate the object. In addition to 3D point clouds, various types of input data sets can be used, such as images, domain images, point clouds with intensity or color values, point clouds with individual images oriented to them, or even stereo images without point clouds. All sources are used for the application of specific strategies. Knowledge not only describes the information of the objects, but also provides a framework for controlling the selected strategies. The success rate of recognition algorithms using RANSAC [24], Iterative Closest Point [25] and Least Squares Fitting [26] should significantly increase through the use of knowledge."}, {"heading": "C. The WiDOP processing", "text": "In order to manage the interaction between knowledge transfer and 3D editing, a new layer is needed called WiDOP editing within rules. This layer ensures the control and management of knowledge transfers and the decision made on the basis of SWRL languages. However, the semantic structure within the ontologies expressed by OWL can be used within ontology, and the knowledge bases themselves are used for inference purposes. However, to express the rules, the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) has emerged. The SWRL takes the form antecedent in the following way where both are antecedent and consistent."}, {"heading": "C. Guiding 3D processing algorithms", "text": "In fact, the knowledge base created aims to fulfil basic purposes, which are as follows: \u2022 Do we perform processing algorithm sequencing based on the characteristics of the target object? \u2022 Do we facilitate the semantic annotation of the various detected objects within the target scene? Remember that one of the main ideas behind this project is to guide, adapt and select the most appropriate algorithms based on the characteristics of the object. The role of knowledge is not only to provide the characteristics of the object (shape, size, color...), but also to detect the status of the object (visibility, correlation) to algorithmic objects in order to adjust its parameters to a current situation. Based on these observations, we give a link of algorithms to objects based on similar characteristics as Figure 11. In fact, knowledge controls one or more algorithms for detecting this object, we adapt this situation."}, {"heading": "VII. BENCHMARKS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Annotation process summerized", "text": "For the demonstration of our prototype, two different sections were extracted from the entire scanned point cloud associated with the Deutsche Bahn scene in Nuremberg. While the last one measures 87 km, we have just recorded two small scenes of 500 m each. Each of the scanned scenes contains a variety of targets. The entire scene was scanned with a terrestrial laser scanner fixed within a train, resulting in a large point cloud representing the surfaces of the scene objects. Within the created prototype, different SWRL rules are processed, e.g. Figure 15. Initially, geometric elements of interest are sought based on dynamic 3D processing algorithm sequence based on semantic object characteristics. In the second step, within our approach, existing topologies between the captured geometries are identified so that useful topologies for geometrical annotation can be tested. Topological built-ins such as Connected Touch, Decisive Perditional Objects can be found as a sufficient number of distinctive, Perpendicular from a number of geometric elements."}, {"heading": "B. System evaluation", "text": "Our testicles were made on two different databases with a length of 500 m, which were extracted from the entire scanned point cloud data. Where the first scene contains only 37 elements and the second 128 elements. As a first impression, it is perfectly reasonable that the number of elements varies from one scene to another, because we are near the station, the scene is richer and vice versa. It is also evident from the above tables how our knowledge base could detect which geometry represents a real element of those that are noise, Table 6. Similarly, our annotation process is in most cases able to influence the correct designation of the detected Bounding Box based on the knowledge of its component, its internal and external topology. In the first example, Table 7, among 13 elements is classified as masts, three as switchgear and 18 signals. While in the second scene, among 67 elements are classified as masts, 55 signals and finally 155 switchgear is published, Table 8.TABLE 6. ECTICTIVE STICKED 120M."}, {"heading": "VIII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "text": "Our solution aims to perform the detection of objects from a technical survey within the laser scanner technology by using existing knowledge of a specific domain (DB), which is modelled within an ontology structure. SWRL rules are used to comment on 3D processing, topological qualification and finally the detected elements in order to enrich ontology and advance the detection of new objects. The designed prototype takes 3D point clouds from a plant and produces fully commented scenes within a VRML model file. The proposed solution to this challenging problem has proven its efficiency through real-world testing within the Deutsche Bahn scene. The creation of processing and topological build-ins has presented a robust solution to solve our problems and prove the ability of the semantic web language to intervene in each domain and create the differences."}], "references": [{"title": "Investigating laser scanner accuracy", "author": ["W.

In addition, the combination of 3D processing built-ins and topological Built-Ins in SWRL rules allows a more flexible and intelligent detection, and the annotation of objects contained in 3D point clouds. The created WiDOP prototype takes a set of 3D point clouds as input, and produces as output a populated ontology corresponding to an indexed scene visualized within VRML language. The context of the study is the detection of railway objects materialized within the Deutsche Bahn scene such as signals, technical cupboards, electric poles, etc. Thus, the resulting enriched and populated ontology, that contains the annotations of objects in the point clouds, is used to feed a GIS system or an IFC file for architecture purposes.
