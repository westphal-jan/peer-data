INTRODUCTION", "text": "Nowadays, qualitative spatial relations are used in many areas of computer science, where thinking about such relationships is fundamental to inferring the graphical representation through logical mechanisms. Such relationships facilitate access to data through a query mechanism that relates to objects and their relationships. Methods for modeling spatial relations have been compiled in several surveys, such as in Galton, 2009, where current models fall into two main categories - connection based on model (Randell, et al., 1992), and intersection based on one (Egenhofer & Herring, 1990). From a logical point of view, qualitative models are defined to infer topological relationships without taking real geometries into account. The OpenGeospatial Consortium has a standard nomination for the basic topological relations to fundamental topological relationships (Consortium, 2012)."}, {"heading": "2. BACKGROUND", "text": "This section is divided into three sections; the next subsection focuses on the 9-IM models for the qualification of topological relations; the second subsection deals with a new data model called Selective NefComplexes, which enables the calculation of operators on Nef polyhedra, which are used to verify the topological relation constraints; and finally, the last section deals with the logical aspect and representation of quantitative topological relations."}, {"heading": "2.1 Topological relationships", "text": "The standard models consist of the following relationships: Equal, fragmented, overlapping, overlapping, covered by, inside, contains (Egenhofer, 2010); Binary topological relations between two objects, A and B. The 9 intersections between the six objects A and B are based on the intersection of A inside (A \u00b0), border (A) and outside (A-) with B inside (B \u00b0) and outside (B -); the 9 intersections between the six objects describe a topological relationship and can be represented by a 3x3 matrix inside."}, {"heading": "2.2 Selective Nef Complex", "text": "The selective Nef complex (SNC) is a model for defining a partition with the inscription of its cells. If the inscriptions are Boolean polyhedra to define the insertion and exhibition parts, the complex describes a set, a so-called Nef polyhedron (Nef, 1978). When implementing Nef polyhedrons in 3D (Granados, et al., 2003), they provide a B-Rep data structure that is closed under Boolean operations and with all their generality. Starting from half-spaces, it is possible to work with unification, intersection, difference, complement, interior, exterior, boundary, closure and regulation operators. The theory of Nef polyhedrons was developed for arbitrary dimensions. A Nef polyhedron in dimension d is a dot set P 'that provides the selective, the topical, the symmetric, and the intrinsic operations of a limited number of open half-spaces by set completion and intersection points."}, {"heading": "2.3 Ontology and rules", "text": "Ontology is a formal representation of knowledge through the hierarchy of web concepts and the relationships between these concepts. In theory, ontology is a formal, explicit specification of common conceptualization (Gruber, 1993). Description logic (DLs) (Calvanese, et al., 2001) is a family of knowledge representation languages that can be used to represent the knowledge of an application domain in a structured and formally well understood way. (1) The following example defines a mother as a woman who has at least one infant type of person. Inference means that every single type of woman who is considered to be at least one relationship with a person and the nature of the relationship is \"hasChild,\" then that woman is a kind of mother. (1) As semantic web technologies have matured, the need to incorporate the concepts behind the description logic within ontology languages should be realized."}, {"heading": "2.4 Enrichment of an ontology from Boolean operators", "text": "The use of the SNC model and the associated Boolean operator enables us to model the topological relationships. In order to combine SWRL rules with topological operators, news-ins are defined for the computation of the operator. Consequently, the results of the operators can be used to define queries or to enrich the ontology with new topological relationships between two objects. To make this possible, two problems appear and must be solved. Firstly, the semantic definition of the relationships with respect to their own properties in ontology must take place. Secondly, the computation of topological relationships by means of Boolean operators with regard to the limitations of the 9-IM model must be defined. The following rule stipulates that a \"building\" defined in ontology that overlaps with a \"railway\" is also a \"station\" in ontology."}, {"heading": "3. IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "This section is divided into three sections: the first describes how the Boolean operators are used to calculate the 9-IM matrix for topological relation validation; the second introduces top-level news relations to top-level ontology and their built-in counterparts; these news relations are specified with a semantic definition; and the last section deals with the translation engine, which allows the calculation of topological inserts to enrich ontology."}, {"heading": "3.1 Calculation of 9-IM using the SNC Boolean operators", "text": "Table 4 gives an overview of the available Boolean SNC operators. In relation to Table 1 of the 9 IM matrix, only the operators across intersections (), interior space (equivalent I (A)), boundary (equivalent to B (A)), and complement (equivalent to () (), which we will call E (A), are required. Consequently, the following 9 IM matrix is subtracted with SNC operators. If the results of the nine updated equations match the expected results, then the relationship between the two objects is wrong. Otherwise, the relationship is wrong. Table 5 is an example of the disjunctive relationship. If one of these equations is wrong, then the relationship between the two objects does not exist."}, {"heading": "3.2 Definition of topologic relationships in the ontology", "text": "In terms of our knowledge base, the top-level ontology is created to model the topological relationships, this ontology is used to enrich an existing knowledge base to allow the definition of topological relationships between objects. Next, the table summarizes for each topological relationship, its name in ontology using the prefix \"topo,\" its semantic properties and the newly built one to automate the calculation of relationships using SWRL rules. Furthermore, in top-level ontology, two inverse relationships are defined: the topo: inside relationship is the inverse relationship of topo: contains, and the relationship topo: covers is the inverse relationship of topo: coveredBy."}, {"heading": "3.3 Translation engine", "text": "The translation engine enables the calculation of spatial SWFL rules, which can also take the form of queries, and interprets the instructions to analyze the spatial components. Once the spatial components are analyzed, they are calculated by the translation engine through the operations provided at SNC level by relevant spatial functions and operations. Results are listed in the Knowledge Base, making it spatially rich. Subsequently, these instructions are translated for execution by their respective machines into standard formats. Finally, with the inference engine, the enrichment and population of ontology through the results of the inference process are stored in the Knowledge Base, Figure 2."}, {"heading": "4. SWRL RULES IMPACT ON SEMANTIC QUALIFICATION", "text": "In order to emphasize the usability of the presented approach, we decide to expand the research by taking a step forward from the qualification of the spatial relationship semantically to the expansion of the semantic rules and query language that creates a 3D semantic spatial qualification platform (3DSQ), such an improvement will support the inference to 3D spatial knowledge and finally enable the query of the spatial knowledge base. To do this, a Java prototype has been developed that demonstrates the applicability of the presented concept, ensuring interaction between users, the OWL ontology and the qualification engine from one side, and will allow an interactive visualization of the qualified spatial relation from another site.Add to its ability to process spatial data in our case, the 3DSQ platform guarantees a common understanding of the spatial domain between humans and machines by ensuring the semantic inference and queries of spatial knowledge."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The calculation of these rules is based on the definition of Nef polyhedra, which can be automatically generated from standard polyhedra. A prototype will be developed using the library CGAL (http: / / www.cgal.org). Some simplifications will be made regarding the calculation of the 9-IM of each topological relation to reduce the calculation volume. Future work on the qualification of topological relations will focus mainly on semantic qualifications and conclusions (Boley, et al., 2001) and will be presented in the next generation of the SWRL topology rule. This can also be done by a composition of relationships containing (? a,? b) ^ (? a,? c) disjoint (? a,? c) (4)."}], "references": [{"title": "Spatial data modelling for 3D GIS", "author": ["A.
