In this paper, we argue that to apply rationality result of belief dynamics theory to various practical problems, it should be generalized in two respects: first of all, it should allow a certain part of belief to be declared as immutable; and second, the belief state need not be deductively closed. Such a generalization of belief dynamics, referred to as base dynamics, is presented, along with the concept of a generalized revision algorithm for Horn knowledge bases. We show that Horn knowledge base dynamics has interesting connection with kernel change and abduction. Finally, we also show that both variants are rational in the sense that they satisfy certain rationality postulates stemming from philosophical works on belief dynamics.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Jan 2013 11:30:37 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.5154v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["radhakrishnan delhibabu", "gerhard lakemeyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.5154"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.5154.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Radhakrishnan Delhibabu", "Gerhard Lakemeyer"], "emails": ["delhibabur@ssn.edu.in", "gerhard@kbsg.rwth-aachen.de", "delhibabu@kbsg.rwth-aachen.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 130 1.51 54v1 [cs.LO] 2 2Keyword: AGM, Faith Update, Horn Knowledge Base Dynamics, Kernel Change, Kidnapping, View update."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In our case, it requires the development of knowledge bases for the purposes of carrying out symbolic considerations.

that Hansson uses [21] to bring about a change in the knowledge base. Similar to our approach, it focuses on formulas or sentences in the knowledge base to update them. Insertion and deletion of formulas are considered on the same level. Chandrabose has proposed various ways to change the knowledge base only by deleting databases, which is necessary and sufficient for such an update. Our knowledge base consists of two parts that are immutable and updating, but the focus is on minimal changes. There are more related works on the subject. Eiter [16], Langlois [28], and Delgrande [15] focus on horn revision with different perspectives such as logical closure and faith level."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion and remarks", "text": "We argued for the generalization of faith dynamics theory in two respects: We also investigated the relationship between knowledge base dynamics and abduction, which leads to a generalized algorithm for revision based on abductive procedures.

Finally, we provide a quick overview of the main operators for faith change, especially faith updates versus database updates.In bridging the gap between faith dynamics and view updates, we observed that a balance between compatible efficiency and rationality needs to be achieved."}, {"heading": "5.

In this paper, we argue that to apply rationality result of belief dynamics theory to various practical problems, it should be generalized in two respects: first of all, it should allow a certain part of belief to be declared as immutable; and second, the belief state need not be deductively closed. Such a generalization of belief dynamics, referred to as base dynamics, is presented, along with the concept of a generalized revision algorithm for Horn knowledge bases. We show that Horn knowledge base dynamics has interesting connection with kernel change and abduction. Finally, we also show that both variants are rational in the sense that they satisfy certain rationality postulates stemming from philosophical works on belief dynamics.
