Thus, a knowledge-based detection approach of objects using the OWL ontology language is presented. This knowledge is used to define SWRL detection rules. In addition, the combination of 3D processing built-ins and topological Built-Ins in SWRL rules aims at combining geometrical analysis of 3D point clouds and specialist's knowledge. This combination allows more flexible and intelligent detection and the annotation of objects contained in 3D point clouds. The created WiDOP prototype takes a set of 3D point clouds as input, and produces an indexed scene of colored objects visualized within VRML language as output. The context of the study is the detection of railway objects materialized within the Deutsche Bahn scene such as signals, technical cupboards, electric poles, etc. Therefore, the resulting enriched and populated domain ontology, that contains the annotations of objects in the point clouds, is used to feed a GIS system.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Jan 2013 08:17:15 GMT  (489kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.5349v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1301.4991,arXiv:1301.4783"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1301.4991,arXiv:1301.4783", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CG cs.AI", "authors": ["helmi ben hmida", "christophe cruz", "christophe nicolle", "frank boochs"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.5349"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.5349.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Toward the Automatic Generation of a Semantic VRML Model from Unorganized 3D Point Clouds", "authors": ["Helmi Ben Hmida", "Frank Boochs", "Christophe Cruz", "Christophe Nicolle"], "emails": ["boochs}@geoinform.fh-mainz.de", "cnicolle}@u-bourgogne.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to move to another world, in which they are able to move, and in which they are able to move."}, {"heading": "A. Manual survey model creation", "text": "In current practice, the creation of a plant model is largely a manual process carried out by service providers assigned to scan and model a plant. In reality, it can take several months to achieve a project, depending on the complexity of the plant and the modeling requirements. Reverse engineering tools are characterized by geometric modeling of surfaces, but with a lack of volumetric representation, while such design systems cannot handle the enormous data sets of laser scanners. As a result, modelers often oscillate back and forth between different software packages during the modeling process, resulting in information loss due to limitations on the data exchange standards or errors in implementing the standards within the software tools. [13] Previous knowledge of the geometry of components, such as the diameter of a column, can be used to restrict the modeling process, or to preserve the properties of known components in a library."}, {"heading": "B. Semi-Automatic and Automatic methods", "text": "The manual process of constructing a survey model is time-consuming, tedious, subjective, and requires skilled manpower. Although modelling individual geometric primitives can be quite fast, modeling a facility can require thousands of primitives. The above-mentioned observations and others illustrate the need for semi-automated and automated techniques for creating models. Ideally, a system could be developed that incorporates a point cloud of a facility as input and produces a fully completed model as a result."}, {"heading": "C. Discussion:", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "A. Ontology schema", "text": "In this section, the various aspects of Deutsche Bahn ontology are discussed behind the scenes. Ontology is the core of the WiDOP project and provides a knowledge base for the application generated. The global scheme of modelled ontology provides a suitable framework for the characterisation of the captured objects. The generated ontology is mainly used for two purposes: it performs processing algorithm creation based on the target objects. In order to enable the semantic arrangement of the captured objects within the target region, the knowledge generated must be placed in the position in which they are located."}, {"heading": "B. Enrichment of the ontology within processing and topologic operations", "text": "In order to support the defined use cases, two additional basic layers are added to the ontology to ensure the geometric recognition and annotation tasks. These operations are the qualification of the 3D processing or topological relations.1) 3D processing operations The 3D processing layer contains all relevant aspects related to the 3D processing algorithms. Their integration into the WiDOP semantic framework takes place through special built-ins.They manage the interaction between the above layers and the semantic layer. In addition, it contains the different algorithm definitions, properties and associated geometries to the respective defined algorithms. An important achievement is the recognition and identification of objects with specific properties such as a signal, indicator columns and the electric pole, etc., by using their geometric properties. As the information in point cloud data is sometimes unclear and insufficient, the topological relationship between one object and another can also be established by topological signal."}, {"heading": "C.
