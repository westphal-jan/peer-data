A central notion in this setting is that of an ontology-mediated query, which is a database query coupled with an ontology. In this paper, we study several classes of ontology-mediated queries, where the database queries are given as some form of conjunctive query and the ontologies are formulated in description logics or other relevant fragments of first-order logic, such as the guarded fragment and the unary-negation fragment. The contributions of the paper are three-fold. First, we characterize the expressive power of ontology-mediated queries in terms of fragments of disjunctive datalog. Second, we establish intimate connections between ontology-mediated queries and constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and their logical generalization, MMSNP formulas. Third, we exploit these connections to obtain new results regarding (i) first-order rewritability and datalog-rewritability of ontology-mediated queries, (ii) P/NP dichotomies for ontology-mediated queries, and (iii) the query containment problem for ontology-mediated queries.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Jan 2013 09:11:54 GMT  (113kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6479v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 6 Jun 2013 12:52:59 GMT  (117kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6479v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["meghyn bienvenu", "balder ten cate", "carsten lutz", "frank wolter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6479"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6479.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Ontology-based Data Access: A Study through Disjunctive Datalog, CSP, and MMSNP", "authors": ["Meghyn Bienvenu", "Balder ten Cate", "Carsten Lutz", "Frank Wolter"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "Categories and Subject Descriptors", "text": "H.2.3 [Database Management]: Languages - Query Languages; H.2.5 [Database Management]: Heterogeneous Databases"}, {"heading": "Keywords", "text": "Ontology-based data access; query answering; query rewriting"}, {"heading": "1.

We show that any finite relationship structure B over a scheme S leads to a satisfaction problem that has a limited relationship structure A over S, whether there is a homomorphism from A to B (written A \u2192 B).

It is easy to see that query containment in coCSP is characterized by homomorphisms between templates. Consequently, it is easy to show that query containment is NP-complete for a generalized coCSP with constant symbols. Theorem 12 yields the following NEXPTIME upper limit for query containment in OBDA languages. The corresponding lower limit is proven in the full version of this paper by a non-trivial reduction of a NEXPTIME-complete tiling problem. Theorem 14 query containment in (SHIU, AQ, BQ) is located in NEXPTIME. It is already NEXPTIME-hard for (ALC, AQ) and for (ALC, BAQ, this containment in (SHIU, AQ, BQ)."}, {"heading": "5.2 FO- and Datalog-Rewritability", "text": "A prominent approach to answering ontologically mediated questions is to use existing relational database systems that are not integrated into the database to eliminate ontology by rewriting ontology [18, 22, 20]. In particular, an ontologically mediated query (S, O, q) is writable if there is an FO query about S that corresponds to it and is datalog-recordable if there is an ontologically mediated program about S that defines it. We observe that any ontologically mediated query that is FO-recordable is also datalog-recordable."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "Another query language commonly used in OBDA with descriptive logic is conjunctural queries. Results in this paper suggest that there is a dichotomy between PTIME and CONP for (ALC, CQ) if and only if the Spring-Vardi hypothesis is true. We leave open whether there is a natural characterization of (ALC, CQ) with respect to disjunctive datalogies. We would particularly like to know whether theorems 8 and 10 extend to (GF, UCQ) and (GNFO, UCQ). Firstly, it would be interesting to understand the data complexity and query containment problem for (GF, UCQ) and (GNFO, UCQ). As explained in Section 4, solving this question for theorem 8 is equivalent to clarifying the compatible status of GMSNP and MSNP2.Another interesting topic for future work is the analysis of splitability (Spritability and Spritability)."}, {"heading": "7.
