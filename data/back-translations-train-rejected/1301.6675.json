Based on the fact that in many cases there are few state changes in the temporal range of interest, we propose a novel representation called Temporal Nodes Bayesian Networks (TNBN). In a TNBN each node represents an event or state change of a variable, and an arc corresponds to a causal-temporal relationship. The temporal intervals can differ in number and size for each temporal node, so this allows multiple granularity. Our approach is contrasted with a dynamic Bayesian network for a simple medical example. An empirical evaluation is presented for a more complex problem, a subsystem of a fossil power plant, in which this approach is used for fault diagnosis and prediction with good results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:56:38 GMT  (321kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6675v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gustavo arroyo-figueroa", "luis enrique sucar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6675"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6675.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Temporal Bayesian Network for Diagnosis and Prediction", "authors": ["Gustavo Arroyo-Figueroa", "Luis Enrique Sucar"], "emails": ["garroyo@iie.org.mx", "esucar@campus.mor.itesm.mx"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is as if most people are able to survive themselves by going in search of themselves.
