The former stratifies the pieces of knowledge (expressed by logical formulas) according to their level of certainty, while the latter exhibits relationships between variables. The two types of representations are semantically equivalent when they lead to the same possibility distribution (which rank-orders the possible interpretations). A possibility distribution can be decomposed using a chain rule which may be based on two different kinds of conditioning which exist in possibility theory (one based on product in a numerical setting, one based on minimum operation in a qualitative setting). These two types of conditioning induce two kinds of possibilistic graphs. In both cases, a translation of these graphs into possibilistic bases is provided. The converse translation from a possibilistic knowledge base into a min-based graph is also described.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:56:55 GMT  (429kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6679v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["salem benferhat", "didier dubois", "laurent garcia", "henri prade"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6679"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6679.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Possibilistic logic bases and possibilistic graphs", "authors": ["Salem BENFERHAT", "Didier DUBOIS", "Laurent GARCIA", "Henri PRADE", "Paul Sabatier"], "emails": ["@irit.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to set out in search of a new home in which to find a new home."}], "references": [{"title": "Possibility theory: qaulitative", "author": ["D.
