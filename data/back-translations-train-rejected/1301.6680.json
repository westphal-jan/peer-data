The first is energy saving in the building. The second is customer value---how the people in the building experience the effects of the actions of the agents. We give evidence for the truth of this hypothesis through experimental findings related to tools for artificial decision making. A number of assumptions related to agent control, through monitoring and delegation of tasks to other kinds of agents, of rooms at a test site are relaxed. Each assumption controls at least one uncertainty that complicates considerably the procedures for selecting actions part of each such agent. We show that in realistic decision situations, room-controlling agents can make bounded rational decisions even under dynamic real-time constraints. This result can be, and has been, generalized to other domains with even harsher time constraints.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:56:59 GMT  (222kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6680v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["magnus boman", "paul davidsson", "hakan l younes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6680"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6680.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Artificial Decision Making Under Uncertainty in Intelligent Buildings", "authors": ["Magnus Boman", "Paul Davidsson"], "emails": ["mab@dsv.su.se", "lorens@acm.org", "pdv@ide.hk-r.se"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before in the history of the city."}], "references": [{"title": "An evolutionary approach to norms", "author": ["R.
