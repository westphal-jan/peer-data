When agents value resources in combination rather than in isolation, they must often deliberate about appropriate bidding strategies for a sequence of auctions offering resources of interest. We briefly describe a discrete dynamic programming model for constructing appropriate bidding policies for resources exhibiting both complementarities and substitutability. We then introduce a continuous approximation of this model, assuming that money (or the numeraire good) is infinitely divisible. Though this has the potential to reduce the computational cost of computing policies, value functions in the transformed problem do not have a convenient closed form representation. We develop {em grid-based} approximation for such value functions, representing value functions using piecewise linear approximations. We show that these methods can offer significant computational savings with relatively small cost in solution quality.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:57:07 GMT  (541kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6682v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["craig boutilier", "moises goldszmidt", "bikash sabata"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6682"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6682.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Continuous Value Function Approximation for Sequential Bidding Policies", "authors": ["Craig Boutilier", "Bikash Sabata"], "emails": ["cebly@cs.ubc.ca", "}@erg.sri.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves how they want to behave and how they want to behave."}, {"heading": "The interpolation process is illustrated in Figure I for two", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it will be able to put itself at the top, \"he said in an interview with\" Welt am Sonntag. \""}], "references": [{"title": "Competitive equi\u00ad libria in and exchange economy with indivisibilities", "author": ["S.
