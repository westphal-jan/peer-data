Probabilities are defined directly on the proofs of atomic formulae, and by marginalisation on the atomic formulae themselves. We use Stochastic Logic Programs (SLPs) composed of labelled and unlabelled definite clauses to define the proof probabilities. We have a conservative extension of first-order reasoning, so that, for example, there is a one-one mapping between logical and random variables. We show how, in this framework, Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) can be used to induce the features of a loglinear model from data. We also compare the presented framework with other approaches to first-order probabilistic reasoning.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:57:26 GMT  (343kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6687v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["james cussens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6687"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6687.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Loglinear models for first-order probabilistic reasoning", "authors": ["James Cussens"], "emails": ["jc@cs."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, we are in a position to change the world, to change it and to change it."}], "references": [{"title": "Stochastic attribute-value grammars", "author": ["S.
