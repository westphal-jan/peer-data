Our first result is a performance guarantee establishing that the optimal branching (or Chow-Liu tree), which can be computed very easily, constitutes a good approximation to the best polytree. We then show that it is not possible to do very much better, since the learning problem is NP-hard even to approximately solve within some constant factor.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:57:30 GMT  (347kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6688v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["sanjoy dasgupta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6688"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6688.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Sanjoy Dasgupta"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, as never before, it will be able to retaliate, to retaliate."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "We consider the task of learning the maximum\u00ad likelihood polytree from data.
