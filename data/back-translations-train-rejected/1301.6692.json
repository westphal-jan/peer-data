Comparing belief function and possibility theories", "abstract": "The problem of assessing the value of a candidate is viewed here as a multiple combination problem. On the one hand a candidate can be evaluated according to different criteria, and on the other hand several experts are supposed to assess the value of candidates according to each criterion. Criteria are not equally important, experts are not equally competent or reliable. Moreover levels of satisfaction of criteria, or levels of confidence are only assumed to take their values in qualitative scales which are just linearly ordered. The problem is discussed within two frameworks, the transferable belief model and the qualitative possibility theory. They respectively offer a quantitative and a qualitative setting for handling the problem, providing thus a way to compare the nature of the underlying assumptions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:57:47 GMT  (274kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6692v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["didier dubois", "michel grabisch", "henri prade", "philippe smets"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6692"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6692.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Didier Dubois", "Paul Sabatier", "Michel Grabisch", "Henri Prade", "Philippe Smets"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}], "references": [{"title": "A possibilistic logic machinery for qualitative decision", "author": ["Dubois et al", "1997] Didier Dubois", "Henri Prade", "Regis Sabbadin"], "venue": "Proc. of the AAAI'97 Spring Symp.
