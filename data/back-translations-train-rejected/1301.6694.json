Until now, most representation theorems for preference over acts rely on a numerical representation of utility and uncertainty where utility and uncertainty are commensurate. Disrupting the tradition, we relax this assumption and introduce a purely ordinal axiom requiring that the Decision Maker (DM) preference between two acts only depends on the relative position of their consequences for each state. Within this qualitative framework, we determine the only possible form of the decision rule and investigate some instances compatible with the transitivity of the strict preference. Finally we propose a mild relaxation of our ordinality axiom, leaving room for a new family of qualitative decision rules compatible with transitivity.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:57:55 GMT  (380kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6694v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["helene fargier", "patrice perny"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6694"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6694.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Qualitative Models for Decision Under Uncertainty without the Commensurability Assumption", "authors": ["Helene Fargier", "Paul Sabatier", "Patrice Perny"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to put itself at the forefront in order to embark on the path to the future."}, {"heading": "3. 2 THE QUALITATIVE INDEPENDENCE", "text": "This is an axiom that can be seen as the counterpart to a condition of independence used in so-called decision theory (see Sen (1986)), which concludes with a condition of neutrality that makes preferences that are considered independent of the labels of actions.
