Introduction In this paper, we present a new theory of plan recognition. Our theory, which differs from abductive and probable theories, provides support for the use of plan recognition systems that intelligently build a system that supports the users of the application world. Introduction In this paper, we present a new theory of plan recognition. Our theory, which differs from abductive and probable theories, is different from previous theories in the treatment of plan execu as primary."}], "references": [{"title": "A Bayesian model of plan recognition", "author": ["E.
