In EUNs not only probabilities, but also utilities enjoy a modular representation. EUNs are undirected graphs with two types of arc, representing probability and utility dependencies respectively. The representation of utilities is based on a novel notion of conditional utility independence, which we introduce and discuss in the context of other existing proposals. Just as probabilistic inference involves the computation of conditional probabilities, strategic inference involves the computation of conditional expected utilities for alternative plans of action. We define a new notion of conditional expected utility (EU) independence, and show that in EUNs node separation with respect to the probability and utility subgraphs implies conditional EU independence.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:59:18 GMT  (330kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6714v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["pierfrancesco la mura", "yoav shoham"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6714"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6714.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Expected Utility Networks", "authors": ["Piero La Mura", "Yoav Shoham"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}], "references": [{"title": "Graphical models for preference and utility", "author": ["F.
