We proposed a new, richly structured modeling language, {em Object-oriented Bayesian Netorks}, that we argued would be able to deal with such domains. However, it turns out that OOBNs are not expressive enough to model many interesting aspects of complex domains: the existence of specific named objects, arbitrary relations between objects, and uncertainty over domain structure. These aspects are crucial in real-world domains such as battlefield awareness. In this paper, we present SPOOK, an implemented system that addresses these limitations. SPOOK implements a more expressive language that allows it to represent the battlespace domain naturally and compactly. We present a new inference algorithm that utilizes the model structure in a fundamental way, and show empirically that it achieves orders of magnitude speedup over existing approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:00:32 GMT  (332kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6733v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["avi pfeffer", "daphne koller", "brian milch", "ken t takusagawa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6733"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6733.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Daphne Koller", "Brian Milch", "Ken T.
