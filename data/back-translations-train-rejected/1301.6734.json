The aim of this paper is to propose BN as a suitable tool for dependability analysis, by challenging the formalism with basic issues arising in dependability tasks. We will discuss how both modeling and analysis issues can be naturally dealt with by BN. Moreover, we will show how some limitations intrinsic to combinatorial dependability methods such as Fault Trees can be overcome using BN.
