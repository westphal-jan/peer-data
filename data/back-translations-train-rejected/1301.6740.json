They are particularly useful for representing environments such as road networks and office buildings, which are typical for robot navigation and planning. The work presented here is concerned with acquiring such models. We demonstrate how domain-specific information and constraints can be incorporated into the statistical estimation process, greatly improving the learned models in terms of the model quality, the number of iterations required for convergence and robustness to reduction in the amount of available data. We present new initialization heuristics which can be used even when the data suffers from cumulative rotational error, new update rules for the model parameters, as an instance of generalized EM, and a strategy for enforcing complete geometrical consistency in the model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for both simulated and real robot data, in traditionally hard-to-learn environments.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:01:01 GMT  (596kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6740v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hagit shatkay"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6740"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6740.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning Hidden Markov Models with Geometrical Constraints", "authors": ["Hagit Shatkay"], "emails": ["shatkay@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is not a country, but in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a city and in which it is a country."}], "references": [{"title": "Map Building for a Mobile Robot from Sen\u00ad sory Data, Autonoi'IWUS", "author": ["M.
