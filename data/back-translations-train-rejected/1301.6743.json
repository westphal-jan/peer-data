A fur\u00ad ther increase may be expected now recently developed pre\u00ad scriptive deontic logics (Makinson, 1999; van der Torre and Tan, 1998a) have delivered some promising approaches for the following long-standing problems in normative reason\u00ad ing and their notorious deontic paradoxes. Yao-Hua Tan EURIDIS Erasmus University Rotterdam P.O. Box 1738 3000 DR Rotterdam The Netherlands ytan@fac.fbk.eur.nl Contrary-to-duty. The conceptual issue of the contrary\u00ad to-duty paradoxes is how to proceed once a norm has been violated. Clearly this issue is of great practical relevance, because in most applications norms are vi\u00ad olated frequently. In electronic contracting the con\u00ad tracting parties usually do not want to consider a vi\u00ad olation as a breach of contract, but simply as a dis\u00ad ruption in the execution of the contract that has to be repaired. Dilemma. The conceptual problem of the dilemma para\u00ad doxes is to determine the coherence conditions of a normative system. For example, when drafting regu\u00ad lations a coherence check indicates whether they have this desired property, or whether they should be fur\u00ad ther modified. In this paper we introduce a deontic update semantics for defeasible obligations and we show that the dynamic ap\u00ad proach not only gives a better analysis of the traditional deontic problems, but it also gives a better analysis of the problems discussed in defeasible deontic logic. An exam\u00ad ple of reasoning with defeasible obligations is that nor\u00ad mally you have an obligation not to have a fence around your cottage, but this obligation is defeated in the excep\u00ad tional circumstances when your cottage is next to a cliff (the examples in this paper are taken from the cottage hous\u00ad ing regulations discussed in (Prakken and Sergo!, 1996)). Defeasible obligations can be overridden or cancelled by other, stronger obligations. It has been argued that more specific defeasible obligations are stronger than more gen\u00ad eral defeasible obligations, and therefore override them in case of conflict (Horty, 1993; van der Torre, 1994; Asher and Bonevac, 1996; Morreau, 1996). Unfortunately, the analysis of the specificity principle in logics of defeasible reasoning does not apply to defeasible deontic logic, be\u00ad cause it may interfere with the violability of norms. In other words, the combination of reasoning about uncer\u00ad tainty and contrary-to-duty reasoning leads to new com\u00ad plications. This interference is illustrated by the following diagnostic problem. 632 van der Torre and Tan 1. There should not be a fence around the cottage. 2. If the cottage is next to a cliff, then there should be a white fence. 3. If there is a fence, tlien it should be white. 4. There is a white fence. Is the fact 'there is a white fence' a violation or an ex\u00ad ception? Obviously, this is a crucial question for legal knowledge-based systems. If the cottage is next to a cliff, then there should be a white fence according to the second line and the first obligation is cancelled. Moreover, if there is a fence, then there should be a white fence according to the third line, but the first obligation is not cancelled. In this paper we formalize the heuristic principle that a defeasible obligation 'normally a ought to be (done)' to\u00ad gether with the fact '\u2022a is (done)' is a violation, unless there is a more specific overriding obligation. The underly\u00ad ing motivation from legal reasoning is that criminals should have as little opportunities as possible to excuse themselves by claiming that their behavior was exceptional rather than criminal. In absence of a cliff you have to pay a penalty for having a fence, because in that case the first obligation is a violated actual obligation. The difference between the an\u00ad tecedent of the second and third obligation is represented in the deontic states of the update semantics by two different orderings: the second gives rise to levels of exceptional\u00ad ity (inspired by preference-based approaches to defeasible reasoning) and the third gives rise to levels of ideality (in\u00ad spired by preference-based approaches to deontic reason\u00ad ing). Summarizing, if there is a fence without a cliff, then the first obligation is overshadowed (by the third obliga\u00ad tion) but not cancelled (by the second obligation). it is still in force thus it is violated. The defeasible obligations discussed in this paper should not be confused with prima facie obligations (Ross, 1930; Asher and Bonevac, 1996; Morreau, 1996; van der Torre and Tan, 1998b). The typical example of prima facie obli\u00b7 gations is that you have a prima facie obligation to keep your promises, but this prima facie obligation does not turn into an actual obligation when it leads to a disaster. The dis\u00ad tinctive property is that the obligation 'there ought not to be a fence' is completely cancelled if your cottage is next to a cliff. However, if you have to break a promise to prevent a disaster, then the obligation to hold promises still holds as a prima facie obligation. Consequently, prima facie obliga\u00ad tions have properties defeasible obligations considered in this paper do not have, such as reinstatement (van der Torre and Tan, 1997). The layout of this paper is as follows. First, we intro\u00ad duce prescriptive defeasible obligations in update seman\u00ad tics. Second, we show that the logic formalizes the speci\u00ad ficity principle without introducing an irrelevance problem. Third, we show how test operators can be introduced in the logic. Due to space limitations we do not discuss per\u00ad missions, a first -order base language, nested conditionals, background knowledge, authorities, agents, actions, and time. In the context of deontic update semantics some of these have been discussed in (van der Torre and Tan, 1999b). 2 DEFEASIBLE OBLIGATIONS INDUS In this section we define prescriptive defeasible obligations in update semantics. The logic handles conflicts of hier\u00ad archic obligations, which normally exist, but might be dy\u00ad namically re-evaluated. Two characteristic properties of the logic are that obligations are overridden by more specific and conflicting obligations, and that unresolvable strong conflicts like 'p ought to be (done) and \u2022p ought to be (done)' are 'inconsistent' in the sense that they derive all sentences of the deontic language. We start with the basic definitions of Veltman's update se\u00ad mantics (Veltman, 1996). To define a deontic update se\u00ad mantics for a deontic language L, one has to specify a set E of relevant deontic states (called information states in (Velt\u00ad man, 1996)), and a function [] that assigns to each sentence \u00a2 an operation ( \u00a2] on E. If u is a state and \u00a2 a sentence, then we write 'u( \u00a2]' to denote the result of updating u with \u00a2. We can write 'u(\u00a21] ... [1/>n]' for the result of updating u with the sequence of sentences 1/>1, ... , 1/>n. Moreover, one of the deontic states has to be labeled as the minimal deontic state, written as 0, and another one as the absurd state, written as 1. Definition 1 (Deontic update system) A deontic update system is a triple (L, E, [ ]) consisting of a logical lan\u00ad guage L, a set of relevant deontic states E and a function [ ] that assigns to each sentence \u00a2 of L an operation. E contains the elements 0 and 1. Veltman explains what kind of semantic phenomena may successfully be analyzed in update semantics and he gives a detailed analysis of one such phenomenon: default rea\u00ad soning. To define obligations in update semantics we have to define the deontic language, the deontic states and the deontic updates. The deontic language is a propositional language with the dyadic operator oblige( a I !3), read as 'normally a ought to be (done), if /3 is (done).' Definition 2 (Deontic language) Let A be a set of atoms and L\ufffd a propositional language with A as its non-logical symbols. A string of symbols \u00a2 is a sentence of Lf if and only if either \u00a2 is a sentence of L\ufffd or there are two sen\u00ad tences 1/JJ and 'lj;2 of L\ufffd such that\u00a2= oblige(1/JJI1/J2). We write oblige 'lj; for oblige( 'lj; IT), where T stands for any tautology. A deontic state is a possible worlds model written as u = An Update Semantics for Defeasible Obligations 633 (W, ::;I, ::;;N, V), where W is a set of worlds, \ufffdI is an ac\u00ad cessibility relation for ideality, \ufffdN is an accessibility rela\u00ad tion for normality, and V a valuation function for proposi\u00ad tions at the worlds. For propositional\u00a2 and world w E W we write rT, w f= <P if the classical interpretation repre\u00ad sented by V ( w) satisfies \u00a2. We add the following features to these deontic states. Explicit sub-state. We extend the possible worlds model with a second deontic state, which is a sub-state of the first one. The complete state is used for the context of justification and the sub-state is used for the context of deliberation, see (van der Torre and Tan, 1998a). W hereas in Kripke semantics a unique world is sin\u00ad gled out, called the actual world, we single out a set of worlds, called the context of deliberation. Full models. We define an update system for a specific A, W and V. In this paper, we assume that the deontic state contains a world for each interpretation of L\ufffd . If we want to represent background knowledge, then this assumption has to be dropped (van der Torre, 1994; Lang, 1996). Non-transitive ideality relation. We assume that the bi\u00ad nary ideality relation is reflexive, but we do not as\u00ad sume that it is transitive or total. There is a tech\u00ad nical problem related to the formalization of condi\u00ad tional obligations, discussed in (van der Torre and Tan, 1998a). A consequence of this problem is that we cannot have transitivity for the relations in the dean\u00ad tic states. We take the transitive closure of this re\u00ad lation only when we determine the preferred worlds. In (van der Torre and Tan, 1998a) we showed that a de\u00ad antic state can be interpreted as a set of orderings, one for each factual sentence, instead of a unique ordering. However, this technical problem is not relevant for the intuitions of our deontic update system and the inter\u00ad pretation of most examples, and the deontic state can usually be identified with a single transitive ordering. Definition 3 (Deontic state) Let Lf be a deontic lan\u00ad guage. Assume a set of worlds W and a valuation function V for L\ufffd such that for every interpretation of L\ufffd there is at least one corresponding w E W. A deontic state is a tuple rT = (W, W*, \ufffdI, \ufffdN, V) consisting of the set of worlds W, a possibly empty subset w\u2022 <; W, a reflexive binary relation \ufffdI on W representing ideality, a transi\u00ad tive, reflexive and totally connected binary relation \ufffdN on W representing normality, and the valuation function V. 0, the minimal state, is (W, W, W x W, W x W, V), 1, the absurd state, is (W, 0, W x W, W x W, V). The deontic updates are operations on the deontic states that either zoom in on the deontic state (for facts), or ereate ideality and normality levels (for obligations). The pre\u00ad scriptive obligations have the dynamic component of creat\u00ad ing a new deontic state. We first define the reduction of the ideality relation by an obligation. The following two def\u00ad initions are extensions of definitions of the non-defeasible case in (van der Torre and Tan, 1998a). In that case, to evaluate 'a ought to be (done) if /3 is (done)' the a A /3 and -,a II /3 worlds are compared. In a defeasible deontic logic, to evaluate the obligation 'normally, a ought to be (done) if /3 is (done),' only the most normal a A /3 and the most nor\u00ad mal -,a A /3 worlds are compared in the ideality relation. To facilitate the definitions we assume that the normality ordering has minimal elements; the generalization to infi\u00ad nite descending chains is standard and straight forward (see e.g. (van der Torre and Tan, 1997)). Definition 4 (Reduction) Let CT = (W, w\u00b7, \ufffdI, \ufffdN, V) be a deontic state, and let W1 and W2 be the set of respec\u00ad tively the most normal..,a II /3 and a A /3 worlds ofW. The reduction ofrT by oblige(al/3), denoted by the symbol-, is defined as follows. \ufffd\ufffd=\ufffdI -{wl \ufffd w21 Wt E wl andw2 E W2} rToblige(al/3) = (W, w\u00b7, \ufffd\ufffd. \ufffdN, V) In the non-defeasible logic, the update rT[oblige(a I /3)] is the reduction of rT by oblige( a I /3) if afterwards the best /3 worlds are a worlds. Otherwise there is a con\u00ad flict. For this definition of deontic updates we need a test whether the best (or preferred, or minimal) /3 worlds are a worlds. This test is analogous to the satisfaction test of a dyadic obligation in the Hansson-Lewis semantics (Hans\u00ad son, 1971; Lewis, 1974), and to the test whether a set of formulas preferentially entails a conclusion in preferential entailment (Shoham, 1988). In the defeasible deontic logic, we test whether the best most normal a A /3 worlds are bet\u00ad ter than the best most normal ..,a A /3 worlds. Note that this test is different from 'the best of the most normal /3 worlds are a worlds' (Makinson, 1993) or 'the most nor\u00ad mal of the best worlds are a worlds' which have the coun\u00ad terintuitive property 'what normally is (done) ought to be (done).' Definition 5 below combines the standard defini\u00ad tion with taking the transitive closure, see (van der Torre and Tan, 1998a). Definition 5 (pref) Let CT = (W, W*, \ufffdI,\ufffd N, V) be a de\u00ad antic state, let W1 and W2 be the set of the most normal -,a A /3 and a II /3 worlds of W, and let \ufffd!3 be the transi\u00ad tive closure of \ufffdI in Wt U W2, i.e. the smallest superset of \ufffdI such that for all /3 -worlds Wt, W2, Wa E Wt u w2 with Wt \ufffd!3 w2 and w2 \ufffd!3 wa we have Wt \ufffd!3 wa. We write pref(rT, /3) =a if and only if for all worlds W1 E Wt there is a world w2 E W2 such that w2 :::;;!3 Wt and there is no W3 E W1 such that Wa \ufffd{3 W2. If there is a conflict, then we introduce another exceptional\u00ad ity level. In this exceptional level, the previous distinction 634 van der Torre and Tan in the ideality relation is repaired. Definition 6 (Exception) Let a = ( W, W*, ::;I. ::;N, V) be a deontic state and let W1 and W2 stand for the most normal /3 and ..,13 worlds, respectively, and let W1,1 and W1 ,2 stand for the partition of W1 in a II fJ and ..,a 11 fJ worlds. The introduction of an exceptionality level in a by oblige(al/3), denoted by the symbol-N, is defined as fol\u00ad lows. ::;\ufffd=::;/ +{wi::; w2l WI E W1,1 andw2 E W1,2} ::;\ufffd=::;N -{ WJ ::; w2 I WI E W1 and w2 E W2} a-N oblige(al/3) = ( W, w\u00b7, ::;\ufffd , ::;\ufffd , V) Putting it all together we define the updates. The gen\u00ad eral principle is that in case of conflict when updating with oblige( alfJ) a new exceptionality level for fJ is introduced. Finally, Von Wright's contingency principle, i.e. the obli\u00ad gation 'a ought to be (done) if /3 is (done)' implies the con\u00ad sistency of a II /3 and -,a II /3, is formalized by a test on the existence cf a II fJ and -,a II fJ worlds. Definition 7 (Updates) Let a = ( W, W*, ::;1, ::;N, V) be a deontic state. The update function a[c;i>] is defined as fol\u00ad lows. \u2022 if c;l> is a factual sentence of L\ufffd , then ifW' = {w E W* I a, w f= \u00a2} f. 0, then a[\u00a2]= ( W, W', ::;1, ::;N, V); otherwise, a[c;i>] = 1. \u2022 ifc;l> = oblige( al/3), then if a f. 1 and there are WI, w2 E W such that a, WI f= -,a II /3 and a, w2 f= a II /3, then * ifpref(aoblige(al/3), /3) =a then a[\u00a2] = aoblige(al/3) * otherwise if pref(a N oblige(al/3)oblige(al/3), /3) = a then a[\u00a2] a-N oblige(al/3) oblige(al/3) otherwise, a[\u00a2] = 1 otherwise, a[\u00a2] = 1. A crucial notion of update systems is acceptance. The for\u00ad mula c;l> is accepted in a deontic state a, written as a II-\u00a2, if the update by c;1> results in the same state. In that case, the information conveyed by \u00a2 is already subsumed by a. Acceptance is the counterpart of satisfaction in standard se\u00ad mantics. Definition 8 (Acceptance) Let a be a deontic state and\u00a2 a formula of the deontic language Lf . a II\u00a2 if and only if a[c;i>] =a. If an update is accepted, then the deontic state usually has a specific content. For example, it is easily checked that a fact a is accepted if all the worlds of W* f. 0 satisfy a, or a= 1. The notion of acceptance is used to define notions of valid\u00ad ity. An argument is I h valid if updating the minimal state 0 with the premises t/!I, . . . , t/Jn, in that order, yields a deontic state in which the conclusion is accepted, and an argument is I f-. valid if all deontic states constructed by updating the minimal state 0 with the premises t/J1, . . . , t/Jn in some order such that the premises are accepted, also accept the conclusion (van der Torre and Tan, 1998b). Note that the order of the premises is only relevant for lh, not for I f-. . Definition 9 (Validity) Let t/JJ. . . . , t/Jn and c;1> be sentences of the deontic language Lf. The argument of\u00a2 from the premises tPI , ... , tPn is valid, written as tPI , ... , t/Jn 11-1 \u00a2, if and only if O[tf;I] ... [t/Jn]llc;l>. The argument of c;l> from the premises tPI, ... , tPn is nonmonotonically valid, written as tPI, ... , tPn I f-. c;i>, if and only if for all permutations 1r of 1 . . . n such that t/J,(I)\u2022 ... , t/J,(n) ll-1 tf;; for 1 ::; i ::; n we have t/J,(!), ... , t/J,(n) ll-1 c;l>. It is clear that checking entailment for all possible orders in which the obligations are taken into account leads to a factorial number of entailment problems. The complexity of the inference is therefor very high. Below some simple examples of the validity relation are given that do not create exceptionality levels, see (van der Torre and Tan, 1998a ). oblige(pi T) If-oblige(plq) oblige(plr), oblige(qlr) If-oblige(p II qlr) oblige(plqllr), oblige(qlr) If-oblige(pllqlr) oblige(pi T) llfoblige(pv qi T) oblige(plq), oblige(plr) I If oblige(plq v r) In the following section we illustrate that one of the fea\u00ad tures of I f-. is that more specific and conflicting obliga\u00ad tions are only accepted if they are later than more general ones. Hence, more specific and conflicting obligations cre\u00ad ate exceptionality levels and override more general ones. Moreover, we also illustrate how the logic deals with the diagnostic problem.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
