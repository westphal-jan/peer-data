Unfortunately, researchers working in this paradigm have restricted much of their attention to rather simple representations of belief states, namely logically closed sets of propositional sentences. In our opinion, this has resulted in a too abstract categorisation of belief change operations: expansion, revision, or contraction. Occasionally, in the AGM paradigm, also probabilistic belief changes have been considered, and it is widely accepted that the probabilistic version of expansion is conditioning. However, we argue that it may be more correct to view conditioning and expansion as two essentially different kinds of belief change, and that what we call constraining is a better candidate for being considered probabilistic expansion.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:01:26 GMT  (271kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6746v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["frans voorbraak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6746"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6746.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Probabilistic Belief Change: Expansion, Conditioning and Constraining", "authors": ["Frans Voorbraak"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}], "references": [{"title": "Belief change and possibility theory, in: P.
