Multiply sectioned Bayesian networks (MSBNs) extend the HUGIN inference for Bayesian networks into a coherent framework for flexible modeling and distributed inference.Lazy propagation extends the Shafer-Shenoy and HUGIN inference methods with reduced space complexity. We apply the Shafer-Shenoy and lazy propagation to inference in MSBNs. The combination of the MSBN framework and lazy propagation provides a better framework for modeling and inference in very large domains. It retains the modeling flexibility of MSBNs and reduces the runtime space complexity, allowing exact inference in much larger domains given the same computational resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:01:37 GMT  (380kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6749v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yanping xiang", "finn verner jensen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6749"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.6749.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Inference in Multiply Sectioned Bayesian Networks with Extended Shafer-Shenoy and Lazy Propagation", "authors": ["Y.
