The key concept of acceptance makes it possible to distinguish arguments from opponents: the certainty of an approach can then be evaluated by the most acceptable arguments for this thesis. In this essay, we examine different complementary viewpoints: an acceptance based on the existence of direct arguments and an acceptance based on the existence of arguments based on the existence of arguments based on the existence of arguments based on the existence of arguments based on the existence of arguments. Pursuing previous work based on argumentation principles we argue, we impose both viewpoints by taking into account preference orders for the comparison of arguments.
