It presents several syntactic combination rules to merge possibilistic knowledge bases, provided by different sources, into a new possibilistic knowledge base. These combination rules are first described at the meta-level outside the language of possibilistic logic. Next, an extension of possibilistic logic, where the combination rules are inside the language, is proposed. A proof system in a sequent form, which is sound and complete with respect to the possibilistic logic semantics, is given.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:02:23 GMT  (403kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7359v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["salem benferhat", "claudio sossai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7359"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.7359.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Merging uncertain knowledge bases in a possibilistic logic framework", "authors": ["Salem Benferhat", "Claudio Sossai"], "emails": ["benferhat@irit.fr", "sossai@ladseb.pd.cnr.it"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it will be able to retaliate until it realizes that it is able to retaliate, that it is able to retaliate, and that it is able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "IIAII A IIEII", "text": "IIAIIV IIEII IIAII X IIEII1\\ IIA (u) ll uEDV IIA (u) ll uEDIIA- + Ell IIAII =: > IIEII II \u00b7 AIIIlLIIlla El1 Lll = \u00b7 IIAIIAw. {Aw. {1 if w E Modn (L) 0 otherwise1 if w E Modn (L) Cl'otherwiseThe following property shows that the classical logic is contained in LPL.Fact 6 For each domain D, the amount ED = {1r E PD I for allw E MD, 1r (w) E {0, 1} is a boolean algebra contained in the structure PD.
