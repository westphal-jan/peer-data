{"id": "1301.7360", "review": {"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-Jan-2013", "title": "A Hybrid Algorithm to Compute Marginal and Joint Beliefs in Bayesian Networks and Its Complexity", "abstract": "There exist two general forms of exact algorithms for updating probabilities in Bayesian Networks. The first approach involves using a structure, usually a clique tree, and performing local message based calculation to extract the belief in each variable. The second general class of algorithm involves the use of non-serial dynamic programming techniques to extract the belief in some desired group of variables. In this paper we present a hybrid algorithm based on the latter approach yet possessing the ability to retrieve the belief in all single variables. The technique is advantageous in that it saves a NP-hard computation step over using one algorithm of each type. Furthermore, this technique re-enforces a conjecture of Jensen and Jensen [JJ94] in that it still requires a single NP-hard step to set up the structure on which inference is performed, as we show by confirming Li and D'Ambrosio's [LD94] conjectured NP-hardness of OFP.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:02:29 GMT  (317kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7360v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mark bloemeke", "marco valtorta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7360"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.7360.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Hybrid Algorithm to Compute Marginal and Joint Beliefs in Bayesian Networks and Its Complexity", "authors": ["Mark Bloemeke", "Marco Valtorta"], "emails": ["bloemeke@cs.sc.edu", "mgv@cs.sc.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}], "references": [{"title": "Complexity of finding embed\u00ad dings in a k - tree", "author": ["Stefan Arnborg", "Derek G.
