We develop a family of algorithms for structured reachability analysis of MDPs that are suitable when an initial state (or set of states) is known. Using compact, structured representations of MDPs (e.g., Bayesian networks), our methods, which vary in the tradeoff between complexity and accuracy, produce structured descriptions of (estimated) reachable states that can be used to eliminate variables or variable values from the problem description, reducing the size of the MDP and making it easier to solve. One contribution of our work is the extension of ideas from GRAPHPLAN to deal with the distributed nature of action representations typically embodied within Bayes nets and the problem of correlated action effects. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can be made more complete by using k-ary constraints instead of binary constraints. Another contribution is the illustration of how the compact representation of reachability constraints can be exploited by several existing (exact and approximate) abstraction algorithms for MDPs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:02:33 GMT  (142kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7361v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"], ["v2", "Tue, 23 Apr 2013 15:58:57 GMT  (474kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7361v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["craig boutilier", "ronen i brafman", "christopher w geib"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7361"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.7361.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Structured Reachability Analysis for Markov Decision Processes", "authors": ["Craig Boutilier", "Christopher Geibt"], "emails": ["@cs.ubc.ca", "@cs.bgu.ac.il", "@htc.honeywell.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to survive themselves without there being a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process, in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, and a process, a process, a process, and a process, a process, a process, a process, and a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, and a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, and a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process, a process,"}, {"heading": "5 Concluding Remarks", "text": "We have described an algorithm for conducting a structured accessibility analysis of an MDP, using DBN intelligence information that allows you to weigh the complexity of the analysis with completeness. Our approach is inspired by the GRAPHPLAN algorithm, but generalizes the concepts that are introduced there by addressing conditional effects and cor relationships, and provides the flexibility to adjust the degree of accessibility in all cases. We have shown how this can be exploited in certain MDP abstraction algorithms to provide deeper MDP reductions when starting states are set. Accessibility cannot be expected to play a substantial role in MDP reduction (ergodic MDPs, for example), but it can be significant in many cases, for example when rewards are conditional, when certain vari capabilities are observable but uncontrollable (e.g. road conditions, weather, the set of accessible resources, or when states are more constrained)."}], "references": [{"title": "Dynamic Programming.
