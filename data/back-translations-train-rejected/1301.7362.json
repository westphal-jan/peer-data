In the case of a stochastic system, these tasks typically involve the use of a belief state- a probability distribution over the state of the process at a given point in time. Unfortunately, the state spaces of complex processes are very large, making an explicit representation of a belief state intractable. Even in dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), where the process itself can be represented compactly, the representation of the belief state is intractable. We investigate the idea of maintaining a compact approximation to the true belief state, and analyze the conditions under which the errors due to the approximations taken over the lifetime of the process do not accumulate to make our answers completely irrelevant. We show that the error in a belief state contracts exponentially as the process evolves. Thus, even with multiple approximations, the error in our process remains bounded indefinitely. We show how the additional structure of a DBN can be used to design our approximation scheme, improving its performance significantly. We demonstrate the applicability of our ideas in the context of a monitoring task, showing that orders of magnitude faster inference can be achieved with only a small degradation in accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:02:39 GMT  (430kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7362v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["xavier boyen", "daphne koller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7362"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.7362.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Tractable Inference for Complex Stochastic Processes", "authors": ["Xavier Boyen", "Daphne Koller"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in a country, in a country, in a city and in a country, in which it is a country, in a country, in a country, in a city and in a country, in a city and in a country, in a country, in a city and in a country, in a city and in a country, in a city and in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country and in a country."}, {"heading": "Factl For any t, Ep(t>[D[Orh[uC\u2022t)JIIOrh[u(tt)]]] :=:;", "text": "In fact, we are shifting the problem from one place to another."}], "references": [{"title": "Dynamic net\u00ad work models for forecasting", "author": ["P.
