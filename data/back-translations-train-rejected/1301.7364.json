IR systems may improve their effectiveness (i.e., increasing the number of relevant documents retrieved) by using a process of query expansion, which automatically adds new terms to the original query posed by an user. In this paper we develop a method of query expansion based on Bayesian networks. Using a learning algorithm, we construct a Bayesian network that represents some of the relationships among the terms appearing in a given document collection; this network is then used as a thesaurus (specific for that collection). We also report the results obtained by our method on three standard test collections.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:02:49 GMT  (253kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7364v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["luis m de campos", "juan m fernandez-luna", "juan f huete"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7364"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.7364.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Query Expansion in Information Retrieval Systems using a Bayesian Network-Based Thesaurus", "authors": ["Luis M. de Campos", "Juan M.
