If two variables are independent of each other, the corresponding nodes should not be connected by a path. Likewise, if the independence between the variables X and Y is indirect and by a third variable Z (that is, if X and Y are conditionally independent), we show Z as a node that intersects the path between X and Y, i. e, Z is a cutset between the variables X and Y. This correspondence between dependence and cutset separation in undirected graphs forms the basis of the theory of Markov fields Markov fields (Isham [5], Lauritzen [6], Wermuth and Lauritzen."}, {"heading": "7I = {Vz}, 72 = {l/4}, 73 = {Va},", "text": "the boundary hypergraph HA of V\\ A is the hypergraph: {VI, V3}, {Vs}."}, {"heading": "3 THE MARGINAL OPERATOR FOR UNDIRECTED GRAPHS", "text": "Theorem 1 (The Marginalization Theorem for Undirected Graphs) Let g be the undirected graph (V, E) and P be the probability distribution over V.
