The corresponding utility is expressed by a sup-min expression, called Sugeno (or fuzzy) integral. Technically speaking, Sugeno integral is a median, which is indeed a qualitative counterpart to the averaging operation underlying expected utility. The axiomatic justification of Sugeno integral-based utility is expressed in terms of preference between acts as in Savage decision theory. Pessimistic and optimistic qualitative utilities, based on necessity and possibility measures, previously introduced by two of the authors, can be retrieved in this setting by adding appropriate axioms.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:03:31 GMT  (316kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7372v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["didier dubois", "henri prade", "regis sabbadin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7372"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.7372.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Qualitative Decision Theory with Sugeno Integrals", "authors": ["Didier Dubois", "Henri Prade", "Regis Sabbadin", "Paul Sabatier"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is the case that you are able to put yourself at the centre, both in terms of policy and in terms of policy."}, {"heading": "2 SAVAGE'S AXIOMATICS FOR EXPECTED UTILITY", "text": "The question that arises is, if and in what form and in what form the people in the USA, in Europe, in Europe, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the, in the world, in, in the world, in the, in the world, in, in the world, in the, in the, in the, in the, in, in, in the world, in, in the, in, in, in the, in, in, in the, in, in the, in the, in the, in the, in, in the, in, in, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in, in, in the, in, in the, in, in the, in, in, in the, in, in, in, in the, in, in the, in the, in the, in, in, in, in, in, in the, in, in, in"}], "references": [{"title": "On the axiomatization of qualitative", "author": ["M. holtz"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "holtz,? \\Q1997\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "holtz", "year": 1997}, {"title": "A unified ap\u00ad", "author": ["M.T.
