For many applications involving interactive systems this overhead precludes the use of formal decision-theoretic models of preference. Instead of performing elicitation in a vacuum, it would be useful if we could augment directly elicited preferences with some appropriate default information. In this paper we propose a case-based approach to alleviating the preference elicitation bottleneck. Assuming the existence of a population of users from whom we have elicited complete or incomplete preference structures, we propose eliciting the preferences of a new user interactively and incrementally, using the closest existing preference structures as potential defaults. Since a notion of closeness demands a measure of distance among preference structures, this paper takes the first step of studying various distance measures over fully and partially specified preference structures. We explore the use of Euclidean distance, Spearmans footrule, and define a new measure, the probabilistic distance. We provide computational techniques for all three measures.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:04:06 GMT  (389kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7379v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vu a ha", "peter haddawy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7379"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.7379.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Toward Case-Based Preference Elicitation: Similarity Measures on Preference Structures", "authors": ["Vu Ha", "Peter Haddawy"], "emails": ["@cs.uwm.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, we have reached the point where we see ourselves as being able to live and live in the real world without being able to move in the real world."}], "references": [{"title": "Counting linear exten\u00ad sions", "author": ["G.
