We describe a Bayesian approach to modeling the relationship between words in a user's query for assistance and the informational goals of the user. After reviewing the general method, we describe several extensions that center on integrating additional distinctions and structure about language usage and user goals into the Bayesian models.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:04:21 GMT  (244kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7382v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"], ["v2", "Sat, 16 May 2015 23:11:26 GMT  (120kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7382v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["david heckerman", "eric j horvitz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7382"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.7382.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Inferring Informational Goals from Free-Text Queries: A Bayesian Approach", "authors": ["David Heckerman", "Eric Horvitz"], "emails": ["}@microsoft.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of us are able to set out in search of new ways to travel the world, to conquer the world."}], "references": [{"title": "The formalism of probability the\u00ad", "author": ["W.
