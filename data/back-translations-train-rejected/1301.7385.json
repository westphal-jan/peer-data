We review work on Bayesian user models that can be employed to infer a users needs by considering a user's background, actions, and queries. Several problems were tackled in Lumiere research, including (1) the construction of Bayesian models for reasoning about the time-varying goals of computer users from their observed actions and queries, (2) gaining access to a stream of events from software applications, (3) developing a language for transforming system events into observational variables represented in Bayesian user models, (4) developing persistent profiles to capture changes in a user expertise, and (5) the development of an overall architecture for an intelligent user interface. Lumiere prototypes served as the basis for the Office Assistant in the Microsoft Office '97 suite of productivity applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:04:36 GMT  (398kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7385v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["eric j horvitz", "john s breese", "david heckerman", "david hovel", "koos rommelse"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7385"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.7385.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Lumiere Project: Bayesian User Modeling for Inferring the Goals and Needs of Software Users", "authors": ["Eric Horvitz", "Jack Breese", "David Heckerman", "David Hovel", "Koos Rommelset"], "emails": ["}@microsoft.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of us are able to survive ourselves, and that they are able to survive themselves, \"he told the German Press Agency in an interview with\" Welt am Sonntag. \""}], "references": [{"title": "Towards a Bayesian model for keyhole plan recognition in large domains", "author": ["D.
