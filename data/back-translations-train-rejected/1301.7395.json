We present two techniques that combine qualitative and numeric probabilistic reasoning to resolve such tradeoffs, inferring the qualitative relationship between nodes in a Bayesian network. The first approach incrementally marginalizes nodes that contribute to the ambiguous qualitative relationships. The second approach evaluates approximate Bayesian networks for bounds of probability distributions, and uses these bounds to determinate qualitative relationships in question. This approach is also incremental in that the algorithm refines the state spaces of random variables for tighter bounds until the qualitative relationships are resolved. Both approaches provide systematic methods for tradeoff resolution at potentially lower computational cost than application of purely numeric methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:05:25 GMT  (311kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7395v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["chao-lin liu", "michael p wellman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7395"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.7395.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Incremental Tradeoff Resolution in Qualitative Probabilistic Networks", "authors": ["Chao-Lin Liu"], "emails": ["@umich.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "2.
