Moreover, it was observed that iterative application of the (linear time) Pearl's belief propagation algorithm designed for polytrees outperformed state of the art decoding algorithms, even though the corresponding networks may have many cycles. This paper demonstrates empirically that an approximation algorithm approx-mpe for solving the most probable explanation (MPE) problem, developed within the recently proposed mini-bucket elimination framework [Dechter96], outperforms iterative belief propagation on classes of coding networks that have bounded induced width. Our experiments suggest that approximate MPE decoders can be good competitors to the approximate belief updating decoders.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:06:34 GMT  (385kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7409v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["irina rish", "kalev kask", "rina dechter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7409"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.7409.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Empirical Evaluation of Approximation Algorithms for Probabilistic Decoding", "authors": ["Irina Rish", "Kalev Kask", "Rina Dechter"], "emails": ["@ics."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take one year to move on to the next round."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "It was recently shown that the problem of de\u00ad<lb>coding messages transmitted through a noisy<lb>channel can be formulated as a belief up\u00ad<lb>dating task over a probabilistic network (14).<lb>Moreover, it was observed that iterative ap\u00ad<lb>plication of the (linear time) belief propa\u00ad<lb>gation algorithm designed for polytrees (15)<lb>outperformed state of the art decoding algo\u00ad<lb>rithms, even though the corresponding net\u00ad<lb>works may have many cycles.<lb>This paper demonstrates empirically that<lb>an approximation algorithm approx-mpe<lb>for solving the most probable explana\u00ad<lb>tion<lb>(MPE) problem, developed within the<lb>recently proposed mini-bucket elimination<lb>framework (4), outperforms iterative belief<lb>propagation on classes of coding networks<lb>that have bounded induced width.<lb>Our ex\u00ad<lb>periments suggest that approximate MPE de\u00ad<lb>coders can be good competitors to the ap\u00ad<lb>proximate belief updating decoders.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
