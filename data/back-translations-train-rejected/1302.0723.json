This paper presents two principled approaches to efficient information-theoretic path planning based on entropy and mutual information criteria for in situ active sensing of an important broad class of widely-occurring environmental phenomena called anisotropic fields. Our proposed algorithms are novel in addressing a trade-off between active sensing performance and time efficiency. An important practical consequence is that our algorithms can exploit the spatial correlation structure of Gaussian process-based anisotropic fields to improve time efficiency while preserving near-optimal active sensing performance. We analyze the time complexity of our algorithms and prove analytically that they scale better than state-of-the-art algorithms with increasing planning horizon length. We provide theoretical guarantees on the active sensing performance of our algorithms for a class of exploration tasks called transect sampling, which, in particular, can be improved with longer planning time and/or lower spatial correlation along the transect. Empirical evaluation on real-world anisotropic field data shows that our algorithms can perform better or at least as well as the state-of-the-art algorithms while often incurring a few orders of magnitude less computational time, even when the field conditions are less favorable.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Feb 2013 15:34:12 GMT  (598kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0723v1", "12th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2013), Extended version with proofs, 15 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Feb 2013 05:50:14 GMT  (598kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0723v2", "12th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2013), Extended version with proofs, 15 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2013), Extended version with proofs, 15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.MA cs.RO", "authors": ["nannan cao", "kian hsiang low", "john m dolan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.0723"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.0723.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Multi-Robot Informative Path Planning for Active Sensing of Environmental Phenomena: A Tale of Two Algorithms", "authors": ["Nannan Cao", "Kian Hsiang Low", "John M.

The columns are indexed in an increasing order from left to right. k robots are forced to simultaneously explore a column from left column \"1\" to right column \"n\" forward, so that each robot tries one place per column for a total of n locations. Therefore, given its current position, each robot can move to any of the places in the adjacent column where it is maneuverable on its right side. In practice, the transit sampling task is particularly suitable and is performed by mobile robots with limited maneuverability."}, {"heading": "2.2 Gaussian Process-Based Anisotropic Field", "text": "An environmental phenomenon is defined as a realization of a rich class of Bayesian non-parametric models called the Gaussian process (GP) [20] that can formally characterize its spatial correlation structure and be refined with increasing number of observations.

Let D be a set of sampling locations represent the domain of the environmental phenomenon such that each location x-D is associated with a realized (random) measurement zx (Zx), if x is sampled / observed areas of the phenomenon.Let {Zx} x denote a GP, that is, every finite subset of {Zx} x-D has a multivariate Gaussian distribution [20]."}, {"heading": "3.

CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper describes two principle-driven information-theoretical path planning algorithms based on entropy and mutual information criteria (MEPP (m) and M2IPP (m)) for active mapping of GP-based anisotropic fields. Two important practical implications derive from the theoretical guarantees for the active mapping performance of our algorithms (theorems 2 and 4): Increasing m leads to an improvement in computing power (theorems 1 and 3) for better active mapping performance, and our algorithms can take advantage of a low spatial correlation along the transect to improve time efficiency (i.e., they require only a small m) while at the same time delivering near-optimal active mapping performance, motivating the use of earlier knowledge, if available, of a low spatial correlation to align it with the horizontal axis of the transect."}, {"heading": "7.
