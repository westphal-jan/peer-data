Since each note could potentially follow any other, the graph of all possible associations would be a reflexively directed k graph with 24 nodes and 576 vertices. As an example, we show a fully connected directed k graph for 12 notes (one octave) in Figure 1. For comparison, a network for a complete standard piano would require 88 nodes, with 7744 memories to model, as in Figure 2. In the real network, a transition (e.g. A5 \u2192 B [5) would be recorded in series with the memory by an ampermeter. Similarly, the timing of notes was constructed by a network. In the actual device, we would expect that the memory peaks provide the tempo information, for our simplified model, a second (much simpler) network built for tempo."}, {"heading": "2.2 Memristive Connections", "text": "In the memristor network, the connection weight is the conductivity of the memristor. Figure 2.2 shows the conductivity of a memristive connection that increases under a constant voltage (showing a linear conductivity profile for comparison). Since each transition is either heard or generated, the conductivity of the memristor moves up this curve. Since music is a directed graph (it depends on whether we are going from C \u2192 A or A \u2192 C), there will be a second memristor that is inversely wired going down the curve. This property means that the reverse transition is less likely when the melody is transition.Storage is defined [5] as: V = M (t) I, we use the meme-con model of the memricant [14] M (t) = Me (t) + Rcon (t), which has the advantage of being adapted to the devices, in our laboratory units, so that we can later measure the conductivity (i.e. the G) of the unit."}, {"heading": "2.3 Seeded graphs", "text": "To sow the melody network, we converted several different pieces of music into a list of notes in the key of C major, transposed them into the key of C and arranged them according to the two octave ranges available to us. To sow the tempo network, the tempo was converted into reduced units in which a time of \"1\" equals 1 crochet, allowing us to normalize for beats-per-minute variations between the seed music. This approach separates the tempo from the notes we thought were precise, since melody rarely correlates the speed of the note with its pitch (as many baseline singers will say, the baseline of harmonizing choral pieces is usually the bar and therefore involves fewer variations in tempo).From a frequency analysis of the number of transitions, a transition matrix was populated with the expected conductor values based on the memristoral guiding curve in Figure 2.2."}, {"heading": "3 Music Generation", "text": "Now that we have sown our network, we will discuss how to use it to produce music. We will first examine how memristor networks work, and then look at the approaches that need to be made to model them in the simulation."}, {"heading": "3.1 Memristor Networks", "text": "Figure 5 shows an example of memristor peaks. There is a recovery time when the system relaxes to its long-term value, which takes about [20] s and can be tuned by different device parameters. Generally speaking, the greater \u2206 V, the greater the spike. Interestingly, these peaks lead to a complex behavior. Consider the circuit in Figure 7 A DC voltage source, which is used by a Keithley 2400 source source source (drawn as a battery, as is common in such circuits), this would apply a sharp step function of 0V to the set voltage for a single memristor in the first step and then hold it there. Figure 5 shows the reaction of a memristor to such voltage. If there are several memristors in a circuit, the spike from the voltage application is not present, instead you get a complex behavior such as that can be seen in Figure 6, this is a reaction of the Ammeter AT."}, {"heading": "3.2 Time dependence", "text": "The time dependence due to the delay of signal (current) propagation in a memristor network has been discussed; the other relevance time is the relaxation time, \u03c4r. When a memristor, which represents a transition from X \u2192 Y, in which X, Y and {CD] [DE [EFG [GA [AB [B]]], increases and changes its resistance, the reverse transition, that of Y \u2192 X, is slightly inhibited because both memristors have been changed between nodes X and Y. The lifetime \u03c4r determines how long the memristors take to balance each other. Previously, the spikes are smaller when they go in the same direction, and larger when they go in the opposite direction. These interactions in timing will also cause the spikes to occur in an irregular rhythm, thereby avoiding boring musical tempi. However, the interactions that lead to the oscillations lead to a concept of a beat."}, {"heading": "4 Modelling a spiking memristor network for", "text": "If we have a seeded memristor network and turn on a constant voltage, we should create a spiking network. If each spike is considered a transition from one note to another, the network activity generates music. Just as the network generates music, it also learns, so the network responds to the music it generates, changing the connectivity of the k graph and thus the music it generates."}, {"heading": "4.1 Problems with attempting to model a memristor", "text": "There are two main problems with modeling such a network. The first is the problem of modeling transient V, which is relatively easy to solve. In the real network, we would set up the wired network and record what it produces. In the simulation, we do not need a background voltage and can therefore set the current note as the source. This is a current area of investigation. The second problem is insolvable. We need to know when and if a memristor rises. It is not known if the spikes are in nature."}, {"heading": "4.2 Using a simplified memristor network model to", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people are able to survive themselves if they do not put themselves in the position in which they find themselves.

Looking at the tempo changes in Figure 12, we see that jazz standards make the most use of the different lengths, with crochet and underarm tones being the most popular. Both rock'n'roll and light classical music are \"faster\" because they overwhelm cuboids (note that this is not true for all music in this genre), as well as Elvis \"danceable melodies. Strangely, the light classics have fewer variations in timing than rock'n'roll. As the graphics in Figure 11 show, we are less able to understand the rock'n'roll tracks."}, {"heading": "5 Time variance of this system", "text": "As explained, time dependence and spiking behavior will generate feedback in the structure of the network, altering the system over time. It should produce a robust and interesting system for music generation, but can also produce static solutions such as a dead network (no spikes), epileptic network (many spikes in full synchrony), dormant network (spikes in a repetitive, boring oscillation). As these solutions have not yet been observed in memristor laboratory tests, we are optimistic to avoid such solutions. Nevertheless, all three of these stable state solutions can be reset by wiping and realigning the network."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We have shown with our simplifications that it is worth pursuing them. We have identified characteristics of memristors that are useful for such a network, and tested simple 3-memristor proof-of-concept prototypes. The problem of building a memristor-based music composer is an interesting one, because it involves many of the same challenges as building a memristor-based brain. Perhaps producing recognizable music is a good test for creating a functioning brain. Moreover, the problem of creating music is much more tractable than that of creating a brain, since everyone can see a good final solution (\"Does it sound like music or noise?\"), while no one can really detect a functioning intelligence when looking at the tips in a neural network. Generating a 7,744-memristor network goes a little beyond the current state of the art. In our laboratory, memristors are interconnected for the price of currently hundreds, not like a synthesizer, but like a network of many outside synthesizers."}], "references": [{"title": "From Utopian to Genuine Unconventional Computers", "author": ["A.
