Relevance", "text": "The explained problem is very urgent nowadays, because there is currently no unified theory that deals with the definition of algorithmic or formal systems that are able to solve intelligent problems that a human being can solve. Examples of such problems are: - External information perception and its interpretation in the sense of the Internet address of an intelligent system; - Classification and identification (including associative) of accepted information, e.g. objects, scenes, processes; - Definition of a cognitive space-time environmental model based on the results of recognition; - Determination of objectives (generation of hypotheses) and their solution (proof of hypotheses) based on a cognitive space-time model; - Implementation of communicative functions of interaction with other systems; - Systems theory using other systems and self-teaching. Modern mathematical methods used for models of knowledge and data representation (e.g. semantic networks, artificial neural networks, artificial neural networks, etc.) that allow intelligent problems to be solved only in the field of knowledge, specific ones."}, {"heading": "2. The main results of scientific research", "text": "Formal Intelligent System (FIS) is considered to be a data system capable of independently solving intelligent problems on the basis of a given set of formal rules as a result of the automatic objective generation of well-formed formulas (WFF), i.e. hypotheses that have a semantic interpretation, testing or refutation as a result of the application of an effective resolution algorithm without specific mathematical methods. Effective resolution algorithm (effective algorithm) is considered to be an algorithm capable of defining through a limited number of steps for each WFF whether it is a theorem or not (if it is a part of the set of true formulas T or a part of the set of false formulas R), i.e., capable of proving or refuting a hypothesis. The proposed theory is based on the Vernon B. Mauntcastle hypothesis [1], which states that brain modules or similar hierarchical structures exhibit a hierarchical structure."}, {"heading": "2.1 Mathematical grounds of the theory", "text": "It reflects the actual perception of external objects, processes, phenomena and their internal perception in the FIS language, which depends on the technical complexity of the system. Definition 1. FIS subsystem, which perceives data about actual objects, processes and phenomena in parallel-serial input data streams and reforms, assumes that these are preceded in the FIS language by alphabetical symbols for the development of data, is referred to as a formal subsystem or perception system (PS). Later in the FIS, continuous data is preceded and segmented, i.e. each perceived object, process and phenomenon is matched with defined expressions - sequence of FIS language symbols. This sequence is initially an internal conception of corresponding objects, processes or phenomena. This initial conception will be called presentation. Definition 2. FIS subsystem dealing with presentations is referred to as a presentation subsystem or system (PSS)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Principles of FIS construction and functioning", "text": "We show that this efficient algorithm exists and defines its properties. This paper looks at the general approach of constructing presentations of static individual contour images, which include reactions of straight line segments on a surface. FIS detectors are based on neural elements - detectors of perception, representation and representation of income images. The set of similar detectors, which define (construct) the representation of images of the same class of reactions, form zones of detectors that form such a zone are called zone detectors. Zones of detectors are FIS memories. As zones are made in different steps and stages of data processing, FIS memory is distributed across all its structures. Data in FIS is processed at each stage due to the operation of detectors of specific structure, i.e. processors. Generally, while the data is processed upstream, output signals are perceived by zone detectors that are placed in lower hierarchies."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 Zone detectors", "text": "Consider the nature of zone detectors as reactions fed by a particular detector controlling the zone, i.e. identifying the individual signals (i.e. the response to the input signal sequence of certain detectors placed, for example, on a lower hierarchical level of data processing); the uniqueness of each detector is defined by its place in the FIS structure, i.e. by its address (number); thus, each detector responds to its excitation by \"placing\" its address at the output. Suppose that each zone detector forms only one output signal, i.e. each detector is \"assigned to a particular presentation structure (substructure).\" Suppose that in the initial phase functioning detectors are not connected to information, i.e. that each detector does not know \"which input signal sequence is formed by the processor to which it must respond, and forms a signal that forms its address. The signal that provides such a connection is the control signal.\""}, {"heading": "2.2.2 The levels of excitation of zone detectors", "text": "Let us define three levels of zone detectors that define three different states: actual level (actual state), i.e. the level of maximum excitation; latent level of the detector (the state of pre-selection) and the level of residual excitation (dormant state), i.e. the actual level of minimum excitation and the level of residual excitation have a number of values, i.e. degree of excitation. Thus, at the actual level, a detector has several degrees (values) of excitation depending on the chain length, i.e. the amount of sequential elements in the order formed by the processor that agrees with the concept. The more characteristic signals at the output of the processor coincide with the concept, the higher the level of actual excitation of ZI and the corresponding zone detector. If this sequence coincides completely with a certain zone concept (Qi), then ZI of this zone and the corresponding zone detector will have the maximum degree of actual excitation."}, {"heading": "2.2.3 Processors", "text": "These neural elements in data processing function as only a structural detector that responds to each response. Each level of data processing in FIS is associated with a specific internal representation or representation of coordinates. For example, at the level of perception, this is the perception coordinate system (PCS) that defines the arrangement of stimuli (primitive structural elements of the contour image, i.e. points) in the realm of perception; at the level of representation of individual images and scenes, this is the orientation coordinate system (OCS); at the level of presentation of elements of the world, this is the egocentric coordinate system (ECS); at the level of representation of events that are extended over time; at the level of production of temporary coordinates (TCS); at the level of production of representations of these semantic coordinate systems (SCS). Each coordinate system has its own axes, i.e. a number of characteristics."}, {"heading": "3. Conclusions", "text": "Currently, there are two classic approaches to building intelligent systems (IS) based on artificial neural systems (ANS) and based on semantic networks (SN). IS based on ANS are designed practically only for the detection of images in a narrow area. FIS PSS are designed not only for the universal detection of image elements (associative detection), the motion, the whole image, scenes and events, i.e. processes that are extended in time, but also for the internal representation of objects of the world. These representations are necessary to verify the hypotheses of FIS RS. If on SN models the process of arguing in a natural language or a language that is close to nature, then FIS RS are designed to generate hypotheses, FIS PSS learning with a \"teacher\" based on communicative functions. This paper reflects the idea of FIS buildings based only on this simplified RS-validity system can serve as a model."}], "references": [{"title": "The mindful brain.
