However, contrary to classical approaches to decision theory, we try to do it without resorting to any numerical representation of utility nor uncertainty, and without even using any qualitative scale on which both uncertainty and preference could be mapped. It is shown that although many axioms of Savage theory can be preserved and despite the intuitive appeal of the method for constructing a preference over acts, the approach is inconsistent with a probabilistic representation of uncertainty, but leads to the kind of uncertainty theory encountered in non-monotonic reasoning (especially preferential and rational inference), closely related to possibility theory. Moreover the method turns out to be either very little decisive or to lead to very risky decisions, although its basic principles look sound. This paper raises the question of the very possibility of purely symbolic approaches to Savage-like decision-making under uncertainty and obtains preliminary negative results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:55:15 GMT  (751kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1537v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["didier dubois", "helene fargier", "henri prade"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1537"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.1537.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Didier Dubois", "Helene Fargier", "Henri Prade", "Paul Sabatier"], "emails": ["@irit.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is as if most of them are able to survive themselves.
