Unlike the traditional interpretation, the new interpretation renders the notions the direct analogues of their probabilistic counterparts. To capture these notions formally, we appeal to the notion of utility distribution, introduced in previous paper. We show that utility distributions, which have a structure that is identical to that of probability distributions, can be viewed as a special case of an additive multiattribute utility functions, and show how this special case permits us to capture the novel senses of conditional utility and utility independence. Finally, we present the notion of utility networks, which do for utilities what Bayesian networks do for probabilities. Specifically, utility networks exploit the new interpretation of conditional utility and utility independence to compactly represent a utility distribution.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:59:02 GMT  (860kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1568v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["yoav shoham"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1568"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.1568.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Conditional Utility, Utility Independence, and Utility Networks", "authors": ["Yoav Shoham"], "emails": ["shoham@cs.stanford.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "We present a new interpretation of two newly defined terms that include conditional utility and utility independence. In contrast to traditional methods of interpretation, the new interpretation of the terms is the direct analogy of their prob-abilistic counterparts. To formally grasp these terms, we must stick to the concept of utility distributions that have a structure identical to that of utility distributions, which can be regarded as a special case of an additive multi-attribute utility function, and show how this particular case allows us to grasp the novel meaning of utility-distribution independence and utility independence.
