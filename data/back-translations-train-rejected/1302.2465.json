However, misleading meta information might result in a dramatic decrease of the performance and its assessment is only possible a-posteriori. Consequently, as long as the actual fault is unknown, there is always some risk of suboptimal interactions. In this work we present a reinforcement learning strategy that continuously adapts its behavior depending on the performance achieved and minimizes the risk of using low-quality meta information. Therefore, this method is suitable for application scenarios where reliable prior fault estimates are difficult to obtain. Using diverse real-world knowledge bases, we show that the proposed interactive query strategy is scalable, features decent reaction time, and outperforms both entropy-based and no-risk strategies on average w.r.t. required amount of user interaction.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Feb 2013 12:53:47 GMT  (645kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2465v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1209.3734"], ["v2", "Wed, 6 Mar 2013 14:46:03 GMT  (643kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2465v2", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1209.3734"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1209.3734", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["patrick rodler", "kostyantyn shchekotykhin", "philipp fleiss", "gerhard friedrich"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.2465"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.2465.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "RIO: Minimizing User Interaction in Debugging of Knowledge Bases", "authors": ["Patrick Rodler", "Gerhard Friedrich"], "emails": ["firstname.lastname@aau.at"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it is so far that it will be able to erenie.n the aforementioned lcihsrcnlrVo"}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "To define all role names (binary predicates) and NI a set of individuals (constants), each role can be either complex or complex."}, {"heading": "3 Risk Optimization for Query Selection", "text": "The proposed Optimization Algorithm (RIO) extends to the ENT strategy with a dynamic learning procedure, which is learned by reinforcing how to select optimal queries. Behavior is determined by the performance achieved in terms of diagnosis elimination rate. Good performance means similar behavior to ENT, whereas the tightening of performance leads to a gradual neglect of the given meta-information. Like ENT, RIO continually improves the previous error probability based on new insights gained from queries to a user. We define a \"Caution\" parameter, the allowable values of which are captured by the user-defined interval [c, c]. The relationship between c and queries is as follows: Definition 4 (Caution of a query)."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": "This evaluation should show that (1) there is a significant discrepancy between SPL and ENT in terms of the number of questions in which the winner relies on the quality of the meta-information, (2) that he is well suited for an interactive debugging method.
