Introduction", "text": "Since its inception by Morgenstern and von Neumann [Mo-vN44], the fundamental challenge of modern game theory has been to predict what actions a human player would apply in a strategic situation. A first prediction was suggested in an earlier paper by J. von Neumann [vN28] for two-person zero-sum games and then generalized to each finite game by J. Nash. Since then, Nash Equilibrium has certainly used the most remarkable and applied concepts of solution in game theory. Nevertheless, over the last sixty years it has been recognized that there are bad predictions for the human game and indeed a large number of experiments have been conducted for which it has not been dramaturgically possible to predict human behavior. There are many reasons for this failure; if there are multiple balances, it is not clear which we expect to play."}, {"heading": "2.

In fact, the idea is very simple, even if the complete formalization requires a number of preliminary definitions given in the next section. Consider the following variant of the traveller's dilemma: Two players have the same strategy S1 = S2 = {180, 181,., 300}. Profit works areg1 (x, y) = x + 5 if x < y if x = y \u2212 5, if x > y \u2212 5, if x > y, and g2 players the deviation (x, y) = 5 if x > y -5, if x < y. The usual reverse induction implies that (180, 180) is the unique Nash equilibrium. Nevertheless, numerous experimental studies reject this prediction and show that humans play significantly larger strategies."}, {"heading": "4.

Let P (X) override the series of probability measures on the finite setX plane.

Examples and experimental evidence", "text": "The results we get are encouraging, since the predictions of the cooperative equilibrium are always satisfactorily close to the experimental data. We also present two examples in which the cooperative equilibrium makes new predictions that are completely different from all standard theories. These new predictions are partially supported by experimental data, but we have not provided enough precise data to say that they are strongly corroborated. Example 5.1. Let G (b) be the parameterized traveller's dilemma, which in Example 4.6 is the same as bonus penalty. Let PC = ({1, 2}) be the cooperative coalition. Let us remember that in Example 4.6 we have shown that the profile of strategies (300, 300) is the unique acceptable equilibrium for the PC. To calculate the values of the PC, let i = 2 be the same, by symmetry."}, {"heading": "In particular, the cooperative equilibrium of G(\u00b5) verifies the following appealing property:", "text": "(1) It predicts the defection for \u00b5 = 0, (2) It moves continuously and monotonously from defection to cooperation as there is an increase, (3) It moves closer to cooperation as \u00b5. Proof. The cooperative coalition structure pc = ({1, 2}) results in a one-player game whose unique Nash equilibrium is the cooperative profile (C, C). The value of this coalition is, for both players, v1 (pc) = (1 + \u00b5) (1 \u2212 11 + \u00b5) = \u00b5.The selfish partition ps = ({1}, {2}) gives rise to the classic Nash equilibrium (D, D). The value of ps is then for both players, v1 (ps) = v2 (ps) = v2 (ps) = v2 (ps) = 1Therefore, for \u00b5 < 1 man v1 (pc) = v2 (pc) = v2 (pc) < v2) < v2 < &lt2 &lt2 &lt2 < &lt2 &lt2 (< &lt2; &lt2) &lt2 < &lt2 (pc) &lt2 < < &lt2 (pc) < (1) &lt2) &lt2 < < &lt2 (pc) < 1) &lt2 &lt2 (pc) &lt2 (v2) < 1; 1) &lt2 &lt2 < 1; (pc) &lt2."}, {"heading": "6. Towards cumulative prospect theory", "text": "In the previous section, we discussed a number of examples in which the cooperative equilibrium under the expected benefit theory satisfactorily predicts human behavior. On the other hand, since we work with profit functions, it is natural to use cumulative benefit theory instead of the expected benefit theory. But, before describing the cooperative equilibrium under the cumulative benefit theory, we will discuss a few examples in which the transition from the expected benefit theory to cumulative benefit theory depends on the cooperative benefit theory: they first decrease when the number of players increases, but then when the number of players is sufficiently large, they rise again. This behavior is not predicted by the cooperative equilibrium under the expected benefit theory, which predicts that contributions under the expected benefit theory decrease as the x ability increases. Nevertheless, this behavior is consistent with the cooperative equilibrium under the cumulative benefit theory."}, {"heading": "7. A brief introduction to cumulative prospect theory", "text": "The examples described in the previous sections provide further motivation to abandon the expected benefit theory and use cumulative prospectus theory. Before we begin describing the cooperative equilibrium under cumulative prospectus theory, we will take this short section to give a brief introduction to this theory. By definition, a perspective is p = (x-m, p-m;.;. x-1, p-1; x0, p0; x1, p1;.; xn, pn) gives a greater prospect prospect prospect prospect prospect prospect prospect. < x-1 < x0 = 0 < x1 < xxi = 0 < xn with probabilities pi > 0, because i 6 = 0, and p0 based on 1.Expected benefit theory was founded by Morgenstern and von Neumann in [Mo-vN47] to predict the behavior of a decision maker who must select a perspective from among some."}, {"heading": "8. Iterated Deletion: the set of playable strategies", "text": "The cooperative equilibrium theory and the consideration of altruism are defined in two steps. < 1) In the first step, we use the altruism functions aij to eliminate the strategies that are not good for collectivity. < 1) The second step is the theoretical analogy of the procedure described in Section 4, which is applied to the subgame obtained after the elimination of the strategies in the first step. (In this section, we describe the first step of the construction, which we call iterated strategies iterated deletion. as is well known, iterated deletion of strategies is a procedure common to most solution concepts (in Nash theory, one will delete the dominated strategies; in iterated regret minimization theory, strategies that are not minimized; in Bernheim's and Pearce's rationalization theory ([Be84] and [Pe84], a deletion of strategies that are not defensible)."}, {"heading": "9. The cooperative equilibrium under cumulative prospect theory", "text": "In this section, finally, we define the cooperative equilibrium for games in explicit form G = G (P, S, g, g, a, f) in complete universality. In the previous section, we have limited the sets of pure strategies and we have defined the sets of playable strategies Pli. We refer to this reduced definition of Red (G), i.e., the subset of G defined by the strategy subsets Pli. The cooperative equilibrium of G (taking into account altruism) is actually achieved by applying the construction described in section 4 to the reduced game Red (G), i.e. if one eliminates the application theory of G, one weakly dominates the strategies in the traveler's dilemma, before applying the regret of minimization, one obtains the cumulative equilibrium theory. To this end, note that the construction presented in section 4 is based on only two points: (1) We have used the expected benefit theory (1) to use the expected benefit theory (1)."}], "references": [{"title": "Le comportement de l\u2019homme rationnel devant le risque", "author": ["M.

These findings suggest that humans have attitude to cooperation by nature and the same person may act more or less cooperatively depending on the particular payoffs. In other words, people do not act a priori as single agents, but they forecast how the game would be played if they formed coalitions and then they play according to their best forecast. In this paper we formalize this idea and we define a new solution concept for one-shot normal form games. We prove that this cooperative equilibrium exists for all finite games and it explains a number of different experimental findings, such as (1) the rate of cooperation in the Prisoner\u2019s dilemma depends on the cost-benefit ratio; (2) the rate of cooperation in the Traveler\u2019s dilemma depends on the bonus/penalty; (3) the rate of cooperation in the Publig Goods game depends on the pro-capite marginal return and on the numbers of players; (4) the rate of cooperation in the Bertrand competition depends on the number of players; (5) players tend to be fair in the bargaining problem; (6) players tend to be fair in the Ultimatum game; (7) players tend to be altruist in the Dictator game; (8) offers in the Ultimatum game are larger than offers in the Dictator game.
