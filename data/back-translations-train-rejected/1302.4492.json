INTRODUCTION", "text": "It is the product of scientific and technological development. It is the quantity of technical words or expressions used in specific contexts that denotes the core concept in a formal discipline. It can be applied in the research field of natural language processing (NLP), information gathering, machine translation and data mining. There are two characteristics of terminology in a discipline, so the use and users are limited. General words are more acceptable and recognizable in other areas as terminology. Compared to general words, terminology always has a single meaning in a particular domain. These two characteristics of terminology can be composed by termology. The higher the terminology is, the better the ability to distinguish different areas of terminology."}, {"heading": "2.

Design/methodology/approach: A method based on multi-level termhood is proposed. The new method computes the termhood of the terminology candidate as well as the sentence that includes the terminology by the comparison of the corpus. Since terminologies and general words usually have differently distribution in the corpus, termhood can also be used to constrain and enhance the performance of term alignment when aligning bilingual terms on the parallel corpus. In this paper, bilingual term alignment based on termhood constraints is presented. Findings: Experiment results show multi-level termhood can get better performance than existing method for terminology extraction. If termhood is used as constrain factor, the performance of bilingual term alignment can be improved. Originality/value: The termhood of the candidate terminology and the sentence that includes the terminology is used to terminology extraction, which is called multi-level termhood. Multi-level termhood is computed by the comparison of the corpus. The experiment results show that the multi-level termhood can get better performance than standard method. Bilingual term alignment method based on termhood constraint is put forward and termhood is used in the task of bilingual terminology extraction. Experiment results show that termhood constraints can improve the performance of terminology alignment to some extent.", "creator": "Server http://www.activepdf.com"}}}
