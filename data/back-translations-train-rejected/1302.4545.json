The unconscious is an interdisciplinary subject that fascinates economists, computer scientists, logicians, and philosophers alike. While epistemic characterizations are interested in epistemic models, most economists are mainly interested in the behaviors of people who are unconscious. In the literature, this question has been epistemically defined with syntactic and semantic approaches. While epistemic characterizations are conceptually revealing, the behavioral content of unconscious is less clear."}, {"heading": "2 Unawareness Structures", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 State-Spaces", "text": "For the sake of simplicity, we assume in this essay that each S is finite.
