(Keyword: language network, complex network, scale-free network, visibilitygraph.Construction of networks with text elements, words, phrases or fragments of natural language as nodes in some cases allows to detect the structural elements of the text critical for its connected structure and find informational significant elements, as well as words that are secondary for understanding of the text. Such networks can also be used to identify unconventional text components such as collocations, supra-phrasal units [1], as well as to find similar fragments in other texts [2].There are a variety of approaches to building networks from the texts (so-called language networks) and different ways of interpreting nodes and links that cause correspondingly different representations of such networks."}], "references": [{"title": "Explorations in the Semantics and Pragmatics of Discourse", "author": ["Dijk van T.A.
