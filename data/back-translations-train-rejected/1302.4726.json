Our approach takes into account the limitations expressed in the existing statute. We decided to apply our work in the context of the French Scientific and Technical Centre for Construction (CSTB) to help it write technical assessments. The problem is to determine how such an assessment document is produced and how its structure can be standardised using models and adaptive semantic services. A technical assessment (in French: Avis Technique ou ATec) is a document containing technical information on the usability of a product, material, component or component of an innovative character. We chose this technical assessment as a study model because the CSTB has the mastery and broad experience in this type of technical documents. We were able to conduct interviews on the CSTB side of Sophia-Antipolis with experts directly involved in the preparation of technical assessments."}, {"heading": "2 PROCESS OF EDITING TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS", "text": "The industry begins by submitting a request for a technical evaluation of the relevant departments within the CSTB. Then the CSTB instructors are examined by a specialized group responsible for providing the technical evaluation. Industry is asked to fill out the form and send a complete document to CSTB, which in turn sends an estimate of the technical evaluation to the industry."}, {"heading": "3 MODELLING THE PROCESS OF CREATING TECHNICAL AND", "text": "Continuing the work of the CSTB (Yurchyshyna 2009) on building ontology and conformity assessment of construction projects (Gehre and Katranushkov 2005), we propose to model the process of preparing the technical dossier using an ontological approach in order to create a semantically rich model of the shot of the technical document."}, {"heading": "3.1 Construction of the technical document ontology", "text": "We have examined the technical documents issued by the PV group within the CSTB with the aim of establishing an ontology of the area based on the terms identified from the shot of the technical document. Many solutions for the manual construction of ontologies have been proposed, in particular (Gruninger and Fox 1995), (Ushold and King 1995), methontology (Gomez-Perez et al. 2003), and on-to-knowledge (Staab et al. 2001). The common idea in these solutions is to reuse as much as possible existing ontologies related to the domain of the model. This is the approach we have chosen: we do not address the problems of NLP 1, we only build an ontology based on expert interviews and by reusing existing ontological resources. In particular, with the help of PV experts, we began to identify what knowledge is to represent and with what degree of accuracy."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Extracting concepts and relations", "text": "For this task, we used the REEF resources, which contained the majority of the units in the construction sector. For example, the core concept of \"\u00e9tanch\u00e9it\u00e9\" (tightness) is linked to several more specific concepts (narrower concepts) such as \"joint d'\u00e9tanch\u00e9it\u00e9\" (watertight connection) or \"\u00e9tanch\u00e9it\u00e9 \u00e0 l'air\" (air tightness). It is also linked to the concept of \"calfeutrage\" (design review) 1 by a relation of \"broad.\" In order to hierarchically classify the concepts of the REEF thesaurus based on the relationship \"subclass of\" in the conceptual scheme of ontology, some hierarchical relationships between concepts are derived directly from explicit links in the thesaurus. In order to extract the relationships of the thesaurus, the relationships of \"closer\" and \"broader\" are taken into account. If these relationships between concepts are selected as potential candidates, then a relation between the A and the class B is not relevant."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Merging REEF ontology and ontology of technical document", "text": "Once we have established the REEF ontology, we have begun the part of the integration that is to bring the REEF ontology concepts closer to the concepts of the ontology of the technical document (OntoDT) that have the same label. We aim to clarify the semantics that are vague (soft) around the REEF terms by limiting them to the regulatory aspect of the PV field. To achieve this integration, we have decided to merge the REEF ontology with the terms of the technical document (OntoDT), the resulting ontology unifies and replaces the original ontology. The most common approaches to merging the ontologies use the union or the intersection to connect the resulting ontology with the original ontologies."}, {"heading": "3.2 Modelling the technical document", "text": "We use our ontology of the technical document to represent the technical document. Our approach is to model the semantics translated into formal knowledge by the technical document. We have changed the formatting of the technical document as a series of interconnected forms, each of which is relative to a component of the product to be described. Each form contains components that represent the nomenclature of the same product, the component itself can be formed of one or more elements. For example, a PV glass polymer module (a component) enters the composition of a PV panel (the product). This glass polymer module is composed of several elements: polymer film, photovoltaic cell, etc. To model this composition, any concept that represents a component or an element or product is defined by an axiom. Axioms are used in the definition of an ontological class, they are form A, where a concept B is mitive."}, {"heading": "3.3 Modelling the process of writing a technical document", "text": "The dynamic lies in the fact that the forms that need to be filled depend on the way the previous forms are filled: we want to adapt to the information that is required for a product. Any information provided by the industry is confronted with the ontology and will determine the next interaction."}, {"heading": "4 SUPPORT TOOL FOR THE CREATION OF TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS", "text": "This application was developed in J2EE and corresponds to the three-stage architecture. The first third consists of a web page on the customer side (GUI) that supports various forms that need to be filled out by the industry; the second third on the server side is a servlet that contains a business code that interacts with the GUI part and the business part; it is connected to the semantic machine CORESE 5 (Corby et al. 2004) to query the ontological knowledge that represents the technical documents and generates the RDF model of the completed technical document; the last third is relative to the data. It includes the ontology of the technical document and the information of the product stored as RDF annotations. Our tool provides the industrialists with a rich interface, interactive and easy to use. At the introduction of the application, a first general form allows to define the context of its technical document."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSION", "text": "This knowledge is exploited through a semantic query pattern to establish a dynamic concatenation of forms. The creation of this query pattern enables a dynamic concatenation of forms consistent with user entries, where no component of the product is missing, where all product-specific elements are shown. We have developed a tool to support the creation of technical documents based on such a dynamic concatenation of forms. It is based on the languages and techniques of the Semantic Web, ensures the interoperability of knowledge and manipulates the results A first version exists that allows us to validate our approach. We must now enrich the ontology to compare our tool with a real use case."}], "references": [{"title": "Reef s\u00e9mantique, Diffusion et application des textes technico-r\u00e9glementaires, Accompagnement des pouvoirs publics dans la r\u00e9daction des textes officiels, Livrable 4, CSTB", "author": ["N Bus"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Bus,? \\Q2009\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bus", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Querying the SemanticWeb with Corese Search Engine", "author": ["O Corby"], "venue": "Proc. of the 16th Eureopean Conference on Artificial Intel- ligence,", "citeRegEx": "Corby,? \\Q2004\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Corby", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Ontology translation by ontology merging and automated reasoning", "author": ["DOU D"], "venue": "Proceedings of EKAW Workshop on Ontologies for Multi-Agent Systems", "citeRegEx": "D,? \\Q2002\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "D", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Towards semantic interoperability in virtual organisations", "author": ["A Gehre"], "venue": "Proc. of the 22nd Conference on Information Technology in Construction,", "citeRegEx": "Gehre,? \\Q2005\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Gehre", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Ontological Engineering: With Examples from the Areas of Knowledge Management, E-commerce and the Semantic Web\" Springer Verlag Advanced Information and Knowledge Processing", "author": ["A G\u00f3mez-P\u00e9rez"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "G\u00f3mez.P\u00e9rez,? \\Q2004\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "G\u00f3mez.P\u00e9rez", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Methodology for the Design and Evaluation of Ontologies", "author": ["M Gr\u00fcninger"], "venue": "Proceedings of the IJCAI-95 Worshop on Basic Ontological Issues in Knowledge Sharing", "citeRegEx": "Gr\u00fcninger,? \\Q1995\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Gr\u00fcninger", "year": 1995}, {"title": "Understanding building, and using ontologies", "author": ["N.
