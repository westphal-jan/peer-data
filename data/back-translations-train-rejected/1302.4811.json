In this paper, we are particularly interested in the modeling of the regulatory constraints derived from the Technical Guides issued by CSTB and used to validate Technical Assessments. We first describe our approach for modeling regulatory constraints in the SBVR language, and formalizing them in the SPARQL language. Second, we describe how we model the processes of compliance checking described in the CSTB Technical Guides.

However, our goal is to organize these guides on a query basis that can be evaluated by a system.The organization of this database is based on classification criteria that proceed from the structure of the guides. We propose a classification according to three criteria: Organization by documentary source: We classify a query by type and number of regulatory document from which it emerges, and the guides that reference it. Example: Guide \"Coverage and tile,\" result of DTU 40.211, 40.23, 40.22, 40.21. Organization by domain: Each request or interrogation block is related to a specific scope. Example: Accessibility, we can classify by organization, by EST, by technical solutions, etc."}, {"heading": "3.1 Regulatory constraints of guides", "text": "Provisions that validate technical documents are first defined and presented in a language that is understandable to people (experts and non-experts).In guidelines, the provisions have a legal status derived from the DTU. After reviewing various studies related to technical regulations, we have identified a structure to implement a functionally complete process for verifying technical documents. We use the \"Coverage and Tile\" guide, which has been issued by the CSTB in our work as a study model.Our first goal is to build a domain ontology based on the terms identified in the technical documents thread and included in this guideline.This ontology covers the different tile types and their characteristics, and defines its conditions for implementing and verifying various criteria, such as: tiling inclination, support or climatology, where to install.The monitoring of these instructions is drastic, as failure to comply with a requirement leads to non-validation of the technical document. Each tile has a form and criteria based on these."}, {"heading": "3.2 Construction of the technical document ontology OntoDT", "text": "We have dealt with the ontology we have developed. \"(Ushold and King, 1995) Methontology (Gomez-Perez et al. 2003), OnTo-Knowledge (Staab et al. 2001). The common idea in these solutions is to reuse as much as possible existing ontologies in relation to the domain. This is the approach we have chosen: we do not address the problem of NLP, we build an ontology out of expert interviews and by reusing existing ontological resources. Specifically, in our work, with the help of photovoltaic experts, we have begun to identify the knowledge that we represent together with the desired level of accuracy. From the technical documents, we have extracted the terms that correspond to different elements or components of the products we certify. Then, we associate concepts to these terms."}, {"heading": "3.3 Integration of guides into OntoDT", "text": "Each tile is presented as a concept and integrated into OntoDT. Ontology encompasses the entire semantics that reflect the structural and dimensional criteria of a tile, these criteria are represented by properties. To model each type of tile with its properties, we used the term axiom to represent this structure. This knowledge contains specific information on a particular area, called \"domain axioms.\" Modelling as an axiom allows us to describe general knowledge. It includes the definition of concepts and properties. The following axiom provides a definition of PlatClayTile and tiles: tiles: HasaMaterial.Sound: HasaForm.Flat tiles: us4 MODELLING GUIDESWe want to show how it is possible to model the guidelines by displaying the semantics of these rules. This knowledge is manually extracted from texts that derive them."}, {"heading": "4.1 SBVR \"Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules\"", "text": "SBVR stands for \"Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules.\" It is a standard whose ultimate goal is to create, organize, analyze and use a data exchange program for tools (Chapin et al. 2005).The SBVR model facilitates the validation, analysis, alignment and fusion of business rules.
