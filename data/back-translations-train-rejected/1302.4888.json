Cross-domain collaborative filtering (CDCF) has been studied as an effective mechanism to alleviate data sparseness of one domain by transferring knowledge about user preferences from other domains. However, there are two key issues that need to be addressed to make a CDCF approach successful: (a) what common characteristics can be used to establish a link between different domains and (b) how to get each domain effectively and efficiently benefit from such a link. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, Generalized Tag-induced Cross-domain Collaborative Filtering (GTagCDCF), that exploits user-contributed tags as common characteristics to link different domains together. Formulated from the probabilistic point of view, GTagCDCF takes into account all the user-item relations, the user-tag relations and the item-tag relations from different domains, in which the common tags take the role of effectively transferring the knowledge between different domains. Using publicly available datasets to represent three cross-domain cases, we experimentally demonstrate that GTagCDCF substantially outperforms several state-of-the-art single domain and cross-domain CF-based recommendation approaches. GTagCDCF is also shown to be effective for heterogeneous cross-domain cases, in which different domains are characterized by different types of user preferences. In addition, our investigation of the impact of user tagging behavior on GTagCDCF led to the conclusion that users can already benefit from GTagCDCF if they only share a few common tags. Finally, we validate the robustness of GTagCDCF with respect to the scale of datasets and the number of domains, based on a three-domain experiment.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 12:37:33 GMT  (525kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4888v1", "Manuscript under review"], ["v2", "Tue, 24 Dec 2013 16:03:11 GMT  (271kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4888v2", "Manuscript under review"]], "COMMENTS": "Manuscript under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["yue shi", "martha larson", "alan hanjalic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4888"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4888.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Exploiting Social Tags for Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering", "authors": ["YUE SHI", "MARTHA LARSON"], "emails": ["a.hanjalic}@tudelft.nl."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "xxExploiting Social Tags for Cross-Domain Collaborative FilteringYUE SHI, Delft University of Technology MARTHA LARSON, Delft University of Technology ALAN HANJALIC, Delft University of TechnologyOne of the most challenging problems in commender systems based on the collaborative filtering (CF) concept is data sparseness, i.e., limited user preference data is available for making recommendations.

We use this analysis to optimize the parameter setting of the GTagCDCF algorithm. The rest of the experiments will then be performed using the optimized algorithm. We organize the presentation of the results of these experiments to answer the following research questions: (1) Is the proposed GTagCDCF effective in improving recommendation performance in different domains?

By using the validation determined along with the training in P1 and P2, we investigate the impact of the compromise parameters on GTagCDCF by varying their values and measuring the recommendation performance for MAE values on ML1, LT and ML2 records and MAP on LF records. Note that in the experiments reported in this section, we set the state of UPL = 5 for users in the validation group, while the recommendation performance is reported on LF records according to the holdout set of ratings or implicit feedback. We first set \u03b2 = 0 in Equation (1) and examine the effects of \u03b1 as shown in Figure 2 and Figure F domain."}, {"heading": "5.4.

To this end, we demonstrate the variation in the output of objective function and evaluation metrics, i.e. MAE for ML1, LT and ACM Journal, Vol. x, No. x, Article xx, release date: March xxxx.ML2, and MAP for LF on the validation sets, simultaneously during the iterations of the optimization process.

Performance Comparison in the Two-domain Case", "text": "In this section, we compare the performance of the proposed GTagCDCF with a number of alternative recommendations listed below.

Then, the performance of GTagCDCF is measured via 4-fold cross-validation. Due to the relatively large size of the datasets involved, some baselines used in the two-sided case, as in the previous subsection, are too computationally expensive to deploy, such as UBCF and TagCDCF.

Cross-domain collaborative filtering (CDCF) has been studied as an effective mechanism to alleviate data sparseness of one domain using the knowledge about user preferences from other domains. A key question to be answered in the context of CDCF is what common characteristics can be deployed to link different domains for effective knowledge transfer. In this paper, we assess the usefulness of user-contributed (social) tags in this respect. We do so by means of the Generalized Tag-induced Cross-domain Collaborative Filtering (GTagCDCF) approach that we propose in this paper and that we developed based on the general collective matrix factorization framework. Assessment is done by a series of experiments, using publicly available CF datasets that represent three cross-domain cases, i.e., two two-domain cases and one three-domain case. A comparative analysis on two-domain cases involving GTagCDCF and several state-of-the-art CDCF approaches indicates the increased benefit of using social tags as representatives of explicit links between domains for CDCF as compared to the implicit links deployed by the existing CDCF methods. In addition, we show that users from different domains can already benefit from GTagCDCF if they only share a few common tags. Finally, we use the three-domain case to validate the robustness of GTagCDCF with respect to the scale of datasets and the varying number of domains.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
