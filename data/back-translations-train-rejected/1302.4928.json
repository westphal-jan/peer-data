A key technique in achieving these benefits is the idea of graphical modeling. We survey existing notions of independence for utility functions in a multi-attribute space, and suggest that these can be used to achieve similar advantages. Our new results concern conditional additive independence, which we show always has a perfect representation as separation in an undirected graph (a Markov network). Conditional additive independencies entail a particular functional for the utility function that is analogous to a product decomposition of a probability function, and confers analogous benefits. This functional form has been utilized in the Bayesian network and influence diagram literature, but generally without an explanation in terms of independence. The functional form yields a decomposition of the utility function that can greatly speed up expected utility calculations, particularly when the utility graph has a similar topology to the probabilistic network being used.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:18:51 GMT  (284kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4928v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fahiem bacchus", "adam j grove"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4928"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4928.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Graphical models for preference and utility", "authors": ["Fahiem Bacchus", "Adam Grove"], "emails": ["tbacchus@logos.uwaterloo.ca", "grove@research.nj.nec.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "Pl \ufffd ..
