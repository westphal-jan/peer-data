We present a method of revaluating counterfactuals when the underlying causal model is represented by structural models - a nonlinear generalization of the simultaneous equations models commonly used in econometrics and social sciences. This new method provides a coherent means for evaluating policies involving the control of variables which, prior to enacting the policy were influenced by other variables in the system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:18:56 GMT  (333kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4929v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alexander balke", "judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4929"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4929.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Counterfactuals and Policy Analysis in Structural Models", "authors": ["Alexander Balke"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive themselves, to survive themselves and to survive themselves, are able to survive themselves. \"A typical example of this is the fact that most of them are not able to survive themselves, but are able to survive themselves, in the way in which they are able to survive themselves, in the way in which they are able to survive themselves, in the way in which they are able to survive themselves, in the way in which they are able to survive themselves, in the way in which they are able to survive themselves, in the way in which they are able to survive themselves, in the way in which they are able to survive themselves."}], "references": [{"title": "Counterfactual probabilities: Computational methods, bounds, and applications", "author": ["Balke", "Pearl", "1994a] Alexander Balke", "Judea Pearl"], "venue": "Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "Balke et al\\.,? \\Q1994\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Balke et al\\.", "year": 1994}, {"title": "Probabilistic evaluation of counterfactual queries", "author": ["Balke", "Pearl", "1994b] Alexander Balke", "Judea Pearl"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Twelfth National Con-", "citeRegEx": "Balke et al\\.,? \\Q1994\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Balke et al\\.", "year": 1994}, {"title": "Causality in bayesian belief net\u00ad works", "author": ["Marek J.
