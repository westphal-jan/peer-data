It relies on separate descriptions of each component behavior, together with the links between them, which enables focusing of the reasoning to the relevant part of the system. As normal observations do not need explanation, the behavior of the components is limited to anomaly propagation. Diagnostic solutions are disorders (fault modes or abnormal signatures) that are consistent with the observations, as well as abductive explanations. An ordinal representation of uncertainty based on possibility theory provides a simple exception-tolerant description of the component behaviors. We can for instance distinguish between effects that are more or less certainly present (or absent) and effects that are more or less certainly present (or absent) when a given anomaly is present. A realistic example illustrates the benefits of this approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:19:32 GMT  (336kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4936v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["didier cayrac", "didier dubois", "henri prade"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4936"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4936.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Practical model-based diagnosis with qualitative possibilistic uncertainty", "authors": ["Didier Cayrac", "Didier Dubois", "Henri Prade"], "emails": ["@irit.irit.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want to do, and they are able to determine for themselves what they want to do."}, {"heading": "An elementary solution d of the diagnostic", "text": "Problem DP is either: \u2022 a fault mode d = ci _ fault (fault _ modej) of component Ci, or \u2022 a set of abnormal states d = {Ci _ outj (statek),...} on the outputs of Ci, (and d (') QBS = 0: d is not a trivial solution), such that: \u2022 d causes more or less sure all present manifestations: Practical model-based diagnosis with qualitative possibilistic uncertainty 73SDuCXTu {d} 1-M + with a strictly positive necessity degree a, and SDu CXTu {d} uM - is fully consistent with the observations d is then an abnormal observations. \u2022 there is a possible influence path between d and each present manifestation, and d is not completely inconsistent with the observations: d = ci _ fault _ fault _ modej)."}, {"heading": "5.1 A SATELLITE SOLAR ARRAY EQUIPMENT", "text": "\"The aim of regulation is to meet the performance requirements attached to the bus,\" he says, \"but it is impossible to fulfil them.\" (\"It is not possible to achieve them.\") \"It is impossible to understand them.\" (\"It is impossible to understand them.\") \"It is impossible to understand them.\" (\"It is impossible to understand them.\") \"It is impossible to understand them.\" (\"It is impossible to understand them.\") \"It is impossible to understand them.\" (\"It is not possible to understand them.\")"}, {"heading": "Nonmonotonic Reasoning and Uncertainty Reasoning,", "text": "Clarendon Press, Oxford, 439-513.D.
