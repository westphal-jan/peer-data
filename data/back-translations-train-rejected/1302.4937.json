Whether we are building decision analyses to clarify human-oriented pol\u00ad icy decisions or algorithms to approximate intelligent agency in a robot, the question poses a significant chal\u00ad lenge for any methodology which claims to provide a complete, normative basis for action. Planning systems, for example, need rigorous methods for judging whether a particular plan is more \"brittle\" or less \"flexible\" than another, as well as sensible metrics for quantifying those features precisely. Decision consultants, meanwhile, increasingly focus on building strategies that create and sustain value for a decision maker or an organization over time, strategies that are somehow robust in the face of rap\u00ad idly changing circumstances and unanticipated outcomes. 78 Chavez and Shachter The reason we care about notions such as flexibility, brit\u00ad tleness, and robustness in decision-making is that the world is uncertain. If the world were perfectly determinis\u00ad tic -or even approximately so we could simply order our actions to respond to future events using propositional logic. For the many problem areas where such reasoning falls short, we model uncertainty using the axiomatic framework of probability theory. Utility theory provides a normative basis for action using the probabilities assessed by a decision maker. Flexibility enters the discussion because we would like our actions to accommodate uncer\u00ad tain outcomes, and even better, to respond to uncertainties that we perhaps do not explicitly consider at the time we make a decision. As the mechanism through which we reduce uncertainty, information ought to figure promi\u00ad nently in any analysis of flexibility: given more informa\u00ad tion, we might do otherwise and thereby achieve higher value; the revelation of information downstream of a deci\u00ad sion often creates or constrains opportunities to respond effectively to our upstream commitments. Practicing decision analysts use a variety of sensitivity techniques to determine which sources of uncertainty weigh most heavily in the identification of optimal courses of action (see, for example, [Morgan and Henrion, 1990]). Deterministic perturbation, proximal analysis, and rank\u00ad order correlation are useful tools for measuring the relative importance of different uncertainties in a decision model. Value of information is the most powerful approach to sensitivity analysis because it measures not just whether uncertainty in an input variable could affect the output value, but rather whether reducing uncertainty in the input variable could change the recommended decision. Recent research provides efficient techniques for estimating infor\u00ad mation value in very large models [Chavez and Henrion, 1994]. All such sensitivity methods, however, occupy a separate phase of the decision analysis cycle or a special function of a decision support system, in both cases usually at what we might call the back end. They tell a decision maker which uncertainties matter, but they do not provide a nec\u00ad essary loop back to the front end: How should a decision maker use sensitivity measures to gain insight into the rec\u00ad ommended action, or to craft better strategies? How should a decision maker use sensitivity results on vari\u00ad ables to identify strengths and weaknesses in decisions? So far, sensitivity methods provide clues, but no comprehensive basis, for measuring the relative robustness or flexibility of competing plans. In this paper, we study the issue of flexibility using deci\u00ad sion analysis. Our goal is to provide a framework not a theory -for observing and measuring how decision poli\u00ad cies respond to informational perturbations, to gain clues as to how they might respond to unanticipated, possibly unarticulated uncertainties. In Section 2, we distinguish between two central types of uncertainty, in an effort to delineate a more precise sense in which flexibility analysis is possible. In Section 3, we present and motivate a defini\u00ad tion of flexibility developed in the economics literature, and we show how decision theory implicitly accommo\u00ad dates it. In simple terms, decision theory delivers one type of flexibility -what we call flexibility with respect to values on outcomes (F vo>\"for free .\" Though simple, the analysis sets the stage for a more illuminating notion of flexibility which explicitly takes information and uncer\u00ad tainty into account: flexibility with respect to informa\u00ad tion revelation (F1a). In Section 4, we demonstrate how to measure this type of flexibility in a static (i.e., single period) decision model, using a canonical problem from decision analysis. We observe that the most flexible action thus identified is not necessarily the MEU (Maximum Expected Utility) alternative. In Section 5, we extend the analysis for a dynamic model which allows a downstream revision of an upstream commitment decision. 2.0 Distinctions about Uncertainty We can think of flexibility generally as \"the ability to adapt to changing circumstances\" [Mandelbaum, 1978]. Changing circumstances are just the outcomes of random variables: for example, the interest rate suddenly dips, your car's electrical system suddenly blows a fuse, or your apartment is damaged in an earthquake. Adapting to changing circumstances requires that the actions you take now allow you to respond effectively to new discoveries or new situations in the future. As observed in [Ghemawat, 1991], \" ... a strategic option has flexibility value not because it is a sure thing but to the extent that it is an abun\u00ad dant store of potentially valuable revision possibilities.\" For example, if I am attempting to decide what car to buy, I might buy a Jeep instead of a Cadillac if I anticipate hav\u00ad ing to drive along treacherous mountain roads frequently in the future. If an agent is attempting to decide what resources to gather from its environment, it needs to determine which resources will best ensure its long-term sur\u00ad vival given reasonable expectations about future states of the world. We find it useful to fix ideas as follows: \"Flexibility is the ability to achieve greater value given the revelation of missing but knowable information down\u00ad stream.\" 2.1 Small Worlds, Large Worlds, Clairvoyants, and Psychics Missing but knowable information can assume several forms. In addressing issues of flexibility, we have found it useful to distinguish between two broad categories of information or uncertainty: \"Small World\" and \"Large World.\"1 We use the term \"Small World\" to bound the type of uncertainty to which it corresponds: Small World uncertainty can be resolved by observing an outcome on a variable which is clearly and explicitly defined by a deci\u00ad sion-making agent. Decision analysts often use the con\u00ad cept of the clairvoyant to pose and resolve information questions. The clairvoyant is a thought experiment (similar to Maxwell's Demon, for example), a hypothetical person who can answer questions relevant to a decision problem. For example, if you are betting on coin flips, then the clair\u00ad voyant can tell you the outcome of the next flip. The clair\u00ad voyant cannot tell you whether you should consider betting on horses rather than coin flips. Nor can the clair\u00ad voyant offer information, e.g., he cannot suddenly tell you that the next coin flip will turn up something besides heads or tails. He can only answer unambiguous questions of fact. Another type of missing but knowable information relates to those alternatives, uncertainties, or preferences that we have not explicitly defined or articulated. This type of information corresponds to Large World uncertainty. For example, knowing that the next coin flip will cause your opponent to suffer a heart attack at the gambling table cer\u00ad tainly counts as missing, knowable information, but it probably is not anything we explicitly include in our bet\u00ad ting analysis. In general, Large World uncertainties can be resolved only by posing open-ended questions to a psy\u00ad chic: for example, \"Will anything strange happen when I next flip this coin?\" Hypothetical answer: \"Yes, your opponent will suffer a heart attack while it is in the air.\" 1. For treatment of a similar distinction, see [Laskey, 1992a,b]. Decision Flexibility 79 Large World uncertainties are those uncertainties that we have not already specified, even though their outcomes could significantly affect the value we achieve. Missing but knowable information provided by a clairvoy\u00ad ant corresponds exactly to the class of Small World uncer\u00ad tainties. Missing but knowable information provided by a psychic corresponds exactly to the class of Large World uncertainties. 2.2 Missionaries and cannibals revisited The Large World/Small World distinction is key because it draws the line between what's possible and what's infeasi\u00ad ble for flexibility analysis. We worry about flexibility in decision-making because we want our decision strategies to be responsive to a range of uncertain outcomes. But such strategies can be responsive only with respect to uncertainty that we deliberately, explicitly articulate. It is perhaps useful to think of an analogue to the well\u00ad known AI Frame Problem in this context: Suppose you are charged with the task of transporting a group of missionar\u00ad ies safely between opposite sides of a river. Cannibals lurk in the bushes at both banks. A decision-analytic treatment of the problem would take account of the risks of encoun\u00ad tering cannibals at different locations along the banks, given rustling movements in the bushes, say, and the dis\u00ad utility of getting shot by a cannibal's arrow. In implement\u00ad ing a decision strategy for transporting the missionaries, you might attempt to take action that flexibly accommo\u00ad dates all manner of bizarre risks. For example, you might worry about the possibility of an oar snapping in half or the possibility of a sudden, violent thunderstorm erupting while you are crossing the river. Yet it is clearly impossibleand certainly impractical\u00ad to include all such remotely relevant, low-probability uncertainties in your analysis. Suppose for the moment that you construct a plan flexible enough to handle a snap\u00ad ping oar or a violent thunderstorm, and you begin to cross the river. In the middle of the river, your boat pops a leak and sinks; the missionaries drown and die, while the can\u00ad nibals at the banks wail and wring their hands at their loss. Regardless of how flexible you thought your plan was, it certainly was not flexible enough to accommodate this bizarre circumstance. 80 Chavez and Shachter It is important to observe that sometimes the unanticipated event can be beneficial. For example, the cannibals might be away for the wedding of their chieftain's daughter in a nearby village. Yet this is probably outside the realm of anything a reasonable person would include in a plan for transporting missionaries. Trying to accommodate all pos\u00ad sible uncertainty particularly Large World uncertainty -in flexibility analysis is infeasible, and probably inco\u00ad herent in any case. The difficulty with this is that people often evaluate actions retroactively with respect to out\u00ad comes on Large World uncertainties. For example, if the boat pops a leak and sinks, then you are accused of imple\u00ad menting a ''bad\" plan to save the missionaries. If you are a decision analyst, then you respond that a leak in the boat was not even in the realm of discourse at the time you for\u00ad mulated the model; the event was vaguely relevant to the decision, but only marginally more relevant than a host of other variables which appear natural to eliminate from the analysis. The best we can doand this is the thrust of the framework we propose in this paper-is to analyze flexi\u00ad bility with special attention to Small World uncertainty, in an effort to gain clues as to how strategies thus analyzed will behave in the face of Large World uncertainty. 3.0 Flexibility on Outcomes We define a decision problem as a triple [O(X), O(D), v(D,X)], where X is a vector of state variables [X1, ... .Xn1\u2022 n (X) is the space of outcomes over X, and D is a single decision with m alternatives [d1 , ... ,dm1\u00b7 We will use capital letters to denote a variable or decision, and lower-case let\u00ad ters to denote a corresponding value or alternative, respec\u00ad tively: e.g., D denotes the decision, and d1 denotes a particular alternative for it; X is a state variable, and x denotes a particular value for X. We will also use O(X) to denote the set of possible values for X, where X can be a state variable or a decision: e.g., de n (D) and x e n (X) . The value function v(d,x) specifies the pay\u00ad off/value/utility when action dis taken and outcome x e 0 (X) obtains. X may be defined probabilistically. If X is a random vari\u00ad able, then P{XI\ufffd} denotes a probability mass or probabil\u00ad ity density assignment on X, conditional on \ufffd, our prior state of knowledge. We will use E[v(D,X)I\ufffd] to denote the expected value of v(D,X). We will also use Ex[v(D,X)II\ufffd] to denote the same measure, subscripting by X to indicate that the expectation is taken with respect to X. Stigler [1939] presents a useful and intuitive notion of flexibility, which has been studied and extended by a num\u00ad ber of other researchers (see, e.g., Marschak and Nelson [1962], Jones and Ostroy [1984], Epstein [1980], and Merkhofer [1975]). Stigler characterizes the flexibility of two alternative plants using the second derivative of their total cost curves: a less flexible Plant A has a second deriv\u00ad ative that is strictly greater than the second derivative cor\u00ad responding to a more flexible Plant B, for all possible output values X. Figure I demonstrates the idea. FIGURE 1. Stigler's approach to flexibility.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
