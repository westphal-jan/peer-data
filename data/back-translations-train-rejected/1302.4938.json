The significance of the characterization is twofold. First, we are able to easily prove several new invariant properties of theoretical interest for equivalent structures. Second, we use the characterization to derive an efficient algorithm that identifies all of the compelled edges in a structure. Compelled edge identification is of particular importance for learning Bayesian network structures from data because these edges indicate causal relationships when certain assumptions hold.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:19:42 GMT  (391kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4938v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david maxwell chickering"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4938"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4938.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Transformational Characterization of Equivalent Bayesian Network Structures", "authors": ["David Maxwell Chickering"], "emails": ["dmax@cs."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to outdo themselves, and that they are able to outdo themselves when they put themselves in another world, in which they put themselves in another world, in which they find themselves in another world, in which they find themselves in another world, in which they find themselves in another world, in which they do not find themselves again, in which they cannot find themselves again, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which"}], "references": [{"title": "A characterization of markov equivalence classes for acyclic digraphs", "author": ["Anderson et al", "S.A. 1995] Anderson", "D.
