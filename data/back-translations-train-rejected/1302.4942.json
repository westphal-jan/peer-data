In this paper, we extend Bayesian network structures to compute probability density functions for continuous random variables. We make this extension by approximating prior and conditional densities using sums of weighted Gaussian distributions and then finding the propagation rules for updating the densities in terms of these weights. We present a simple example that illustrates the Bayesian network for continuous variables; this example shows the effect of the network structure and approximation errors on the computation of densities for variables in the network.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:20:02 GMT  (339kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4942v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["eric driver", "darryl morrell"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4942"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4942.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Implementation of Continuous Bayesian Networks Using Sums of Weighted Gaussians", "authors": ["Eric Driver", "Darryl Morrell"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, we will be able to put ourselves at the top, \"he said in an interview with\" Welt am Sonntag. \""}], "references": [{"title": "Probabilistic Reasoning In Intelligent Sys\u00ad tems", "author": ["J.
