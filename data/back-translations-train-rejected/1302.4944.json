This paper investigates the subclass of uncertainty measures, expressing confidence, that capture the idea of acceptance, what we call acceptance functions. Due to the monotonicity property of confidence measures, the acceptance of a proposition entails the acceptance of any of its logical consequences. In agreement with the idea that a belief set (in the sense of Gardenfors) must be closed under logical consequence, it is also required that the separate acceptance o two propositions entail the acceptance of their conjunction. Necessity (and possibility) measures agree with this view of acceptance while probability and belief functions generally do not. General properties of acceptance functions are estabilished. The motivation behind this work is the investigation of a setting for belief revision more general than the one proposed by Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson, in connection with the notion of conditioning.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:20:13 GMT  (269kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4944v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["didier dubois", "henri prade"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4944"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4944.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Numerical representations of acceptance", "authors": ["Didier Dubois", "Henri Prade", "Paul Sabatier"], "emails": ["@irit.irit.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}], "references": [{"title": "On the logic of theory change: Partial meet contraction and revision functions", "author": ["C.E.
