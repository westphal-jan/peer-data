This paper is devoted to an extension of the CSP framework enabling us to deal with some decisions problems under uncertainty. This extension relies on a differentiation between the agent-controllable decision variables and the uncontrollable parameters whose values depend on the occurrence of uncertain events. The uncertainty on the values of the parameters is assumed to be given under the form of a probability distribution. Two algorithms are given, for computing respectively decisions solving the problem with a maximal probability, and conditional decisions mapping the largest possible amount of possible cases to actual decisions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:20:24 GMT  (538kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4946v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["helene fargier", "jerome lang", "roger martin-clouaire", "thomas schiex"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4946"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4946.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A constraint satisfaction framework for decision under uncertainty", "authors": ["Helene Fargier", "Jerome Lang", "Paul Sabatier", "Roger Martin-Ciouaire", "Thomas Schiex"], "emails": ["lang}@irit.fr", "rmc@toulouse.inra.fr", "tschiex@toulouse.inra.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is more than ever in the history of the city, where it is so far that it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place."}, {"heading": "C; as the constraint itself, gives the set of all the possible assignments of the variables in V ( C; ): the constraint C; is", "text": "fulfilled by assigning the variables in V (C;) iff this assignment belongs to the set of permissible tuples of C;."}, {"heading": "A solution of the CSP is an assignment of values to all the variables such that all the constraints are satisfied.
