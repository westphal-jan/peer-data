The algorithm takes advantage of both the structure and the quantification of the network and presents a polynomial asymptotic complexity. Predict exhibits a conservative behavior in that it is always sound but not always complete. We provide sufficient conditions for completeness and present algorithms for testing these conditions and for computing a complete set of plausible values. We propose Predict as an efficient method to estimate probabilistic values and illustrate its use in conjunction with two known algorithms for probabilistic inference. Finally, we describe an application of Predict to plan evaluation, present experimental results, and discuss issues regarding its use with conditional logics of belief, and in the characterization of irrelevance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:20:47 GMT  (436kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4950v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["moises goldszmidt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4950"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4950.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Moises Goldszmidt"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The reasons for this success are manifold: they allow the representation of being and uncertain knowledge as a set of if-then-rules, they provide a known mechanism for beliefs linked to notions of conditioning, and finally they provide a link to probability theory [16], conditional logic [3], and other calculations for uncertainty such as possibility theory [1].
