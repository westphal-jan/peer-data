We give an overview of the DRIPS decision-theoretic refinement planning system, which uses abstraction to efficiently identify optimal plans. We present techniques for automatically generating search control information, which can significantly improve the planner's performance. We evaluate the efficiency of DRIPS both with and without the search control rules on a complex medical planning problem and compare its performance to that of a branch-and-bound decision tree algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:20:57 GMT  (361kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4952v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter haddawy", "anhai doan", "richard goodwin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4952"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4952.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Efficient Decision-T heoretic Planning: Techniques and Empirical Analysis", "authors": ["Peter Haddawy", "AnHai Doan", "Richard Goodwin"], "emails": ["@cs.", "rich@cs."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}], "references": [{"title": "Using abstractions for decision-theoretic planning with time constraints", "author": ["C.
