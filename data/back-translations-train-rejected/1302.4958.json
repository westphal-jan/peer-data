In this paper, we examine Bayesian methods for learning both types of networks. Bayesian methods for learning acausal networks are fairly well developed. These methods often employ assumptions to facilitate the construction of priors, including the assumptions of parameter independence, parameter modularity, and likelihood equivalence. We show that although these assumptions also can be appropriate for learning causal networks, we need additional assumptions in order to learn causal networks. We introduce two sufficient assumptions, called {em mechanism independence} and {em component independence}. We show that these new assumptions, when combined with parameter independence, parameter modularity, and likelihood equivalence, allow us to apply methods for learning acausal networks to learn causal networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:21:29 GMT  (329kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4958v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"], ["v2", "Sat, 16 May 2015 23:38:36 GMT  (179kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4958v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david heckerman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4958"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4958.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Bayesian Approach to Learning Causal Networks", "authors": ["David Heckerman"], "emails": ["heckerma@microsoft"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}], "references": [{"title": "A Bayesian method for the induc\u00ad tion of probabilistic networks from data", "author": ["Cooper", "Herskovits", "G. 1992] Cooper", "E.
