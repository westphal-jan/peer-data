The techniques provide tools for real-time control of the configuration and quantity of information displayed to a user, and a methodology for designing flexible human-computer interfaces for monitoring applications. After defining a prototypical set of display decision problems, we introduce the expected value of revealed information (EVRI) and the related measure of expected value of displayed information (EVDI). We describe how these measures can be used to enhance computer displays used for monitoring complex systems. We motivate the presentation by discussing our efforts to employ decision-theoretic control of displays for a time-critical monitoring application at the NASA Mission Control Center in Houston.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:21:34 GMT  (463kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4959v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["eric j horvitz", "matthew barry"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4959"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4959.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Display of Information for Time-Critical Decision Making", "authors": ["Eric Horvitz", "Matthew Barry"], "emails": ["horvitz@microsoft.com", "barry@rpal.rockwell.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it has come to the point where we see ourselves able to change the world and change it until we are able to change the world again, \"he said in an interview.\" We are able to change the world, \"he said.\" We are able to change the world, \"he said.\" We are able to change the world, \"he said.\" We are able to change the world, \"he said.\" We are able to change the world, and we are able to change the world, to change the world. \""}], "references": [{"title": "A utility-based pilot vehicle interface", "author": ["J.
