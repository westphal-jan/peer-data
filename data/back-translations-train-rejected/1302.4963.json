In the standard ID, arrows into a decision node are only informational; they do not represent constraints on what the decision maker can do. We can represent such constraints only indirectly, using arrows to the children of the decision and sometimes adding more variables to the influence diagram, thus making the ID more complicated. Users of influence diagrams often want to represent constraints by arrows into decision nodes. We represent constraints on decisions by allowing relevance arrows into decision nodes. We call the resulting representation information/relevance influence diagrams (IRIDs). Information/relevance influence diagrams allow for direct representation and specification of constrained decisions. We use a combination of stochastic dynamic programming and Gibbs sampling to solve IRIDs. This method is especially useful when exact methods for solving IDs fail.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:21:55 GMT  (569kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4963v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ali jenzarli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4963"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4963.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Information/Relevance Influence Diagrams", "authors": ["Ali Jenzarli"], "emails": ["ajenzarl@cfrvm.cfr.usf.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "However, we assume that this new representation allows an Information I Relevance Influence Diagram (IRID). In an IRID model, we model a decision variable that is constrained by other variables by representing relevance arrows from the other variables to the decision variable. However, we also allow purely infonnational arrows in decision processes. Information / relevance influence diagrams allow direct representation and specification of limited decisions. This representation is a partial solution to the broker problem of representation and resolution of asymmetric decision problems. Asymmetry in decision problems occurs when some decision-making values and / or random variables are not allowed."}], "references": [{"title": "Making Hard Decisions", "author": ["Princeton", "R.T.
