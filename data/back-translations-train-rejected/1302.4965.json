Unfortunately, the special characteristics of dynamic probabilistic networks (DPNs), which are used to represent stochastic temporal processes, mean that standard simulation algorithms perform very poorly. In essence, the simulation trials diverge further and further from reality as the process is observed over time. In this paper, we present simulation algorithms that use the evidence observed at each time step to push the set of trials back towards reality. The first algorithm, \"evidence reversal\" (ER) restructures each time slice of the DPN so that the evidence nodes for the slice become ancestors of the state variables. The second algorithm, called \"survival of the fittest\" sampling (SOF), \"repopulates\" the set of trials at each time step using a stochastic reproduction rate weighted by the likelihood of the evidence according to each trial. We compare the performance of each algorithm with likelihood weighting on the original network, and also investigate the benefits of combining the ER and SOF methods. The ER/SOF combination appears to maintain bounded error independent of the number of time steps in the simulation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:22:06 GMT  (340kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4965v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["keiji kanazawa", "daphne koller", "stuart russell"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4965"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4965.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Stochastic simulation algorithms for dynamic probabilistic networks", "authors": ["Keiji Kanazawa", "Daphne Koller", "Stuart Russell"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The second algorithm, called \"sur vival of the fittest\" (SOF), \"repop ulates\" the set of trial at each step to each step. \"The second algorithm, called\" sur vival of the fittest \"(SOF),\" restructure each time slice of the DPN so that the evidence nodes to the slice into the slice into the state variables. \"The second algorithm, called\" sur vival of the fittest \"(SOF),\" repop \"the set of the slice into the slice into the state variables of the state."}], "references": [{"title": "go with the win\u00ad ners\" algorithms", "author": ["David Aldous", "Umesh Vazirani"], "venue": "In Proceedings 35th Annual Sym\u00ad posium on Foundations of Computer Science,", "citeRegEx": "Aldous and Vazirani.,? \\Q1994\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Aldous and Vazirani.", "year": 1994}, {"title": "Optimal control of Markov de\u00ad cision processes with incomplete state estimation", "author": ["K.J.
