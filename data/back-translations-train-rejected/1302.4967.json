Expert systems model only a limited part of the world. While the explicit management of uncertainty in expert systems itigates the brittleness problem, it is still possible for a system to be used, unwittingly, in ways that the system is not prepared to address. Such a situation may be detected by the method of straw models, first presented by Jensen et al. [1990] and later generalized and justified by Laskey [1991]. We describe an algorithm, which we have implemented, that takes as input an annotated diagnostic Bayesian network (the base model) and constructs, without assistance, a bipartite network to be used as a straw model. We show that in some cases this straw model is better that the independent straw model of Jensen et al., the only other straw model for which a construction algorithm has been designed and implemented.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:22:17 GMT  (269kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4967v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["young-gyun kim", "marco valtorta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4967"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4967.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the Detection of Conflicts in Diagnostic Bayesian Networks Using Abstraction", "authors": ["Young-Gyun Kim", "Marco Valtorta"], "emails": ["ykim@usceast.cs.sc.edu", "mgv@usceast.cs.sc.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves how they have behaved."}], "references": [{"title": "MUNIN\u00ad A Causal Probabilistic Network for Interpretation of Electromyographic Findings.", "author": ["Andreassen et al", "S. 1987] Andreassen", "M.

Since it is impossible to construct this kind of model, we fall back on the next best option, which is to construct a better model and compare results. But the reason for checking conflict is not only to diagnose the model itself, but also to trigger revision for a better model. In other words, we cannot assume the availabil\u00ad ity of a better model; if we had it, we would use it in\u00ad stead of the model for which a conflict is suspected. To overcome this quandary, Laskey [1991] suggests straw models that \"capture some of the expert's intuitions about how the model could go wrong, but are com\u00ad putationally much simpler than the fully specified al\u00ad ternate model.", "startOffset": 87, "endOffset": 599}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "Theorem 1 (Surprise Index) [Laskey, 1991].", "startOffset": 27, "endOffset": 41}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "Finn Jensen et al.
