Nevertheless, the potential negative consequences are so great that some meaningful risk characterisation is needed to make a coherent decision on appropriate measures. This paper examines the problem of risk assessment in an area where chemical carcinogenicity plays an essential role, with quantitative risk assessment playing an important role."}, {"heading": "RISK ASSESSMENT - NOT ENOUGH DEATHS", "text": "In fact, it is so that most people are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want.
