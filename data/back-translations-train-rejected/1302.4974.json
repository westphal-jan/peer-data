Context constraints allow inference to be focused on only the relevant portions of the probabilistic knowledge. We provide a declarative semantics for our language. We present a Bayesian network construction algorithm whose generated networks give sound and complete answers to queries. We use related concepts in logic programming to justify our approach. We have implemented a Bayesian network construction algorithm for a subset of the theory and demonstrate it's application to the problem of evaluating the effectiveness of treatments for acute cardiac conditions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:22:52 GMT  (468kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4974v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["liem ngo", "peter haddawy", "james helwig"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4974"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4974.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Theoretical Framework for Context-Sensitive Temporal Probability Model Construction with Application to Plan Projection", "authors": ["Liem Ngo", "Peter Haddawy", "James Helwig"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, as never before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country"}], "references": [{"title": "Acyclic programs", "author": ["K.R.
