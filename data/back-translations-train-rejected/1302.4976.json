This paper derives a general formula for such instrumental variables, that is, exogenous variables that directly affect some variables but not all. With the help of this formula, it is possible to test whether a model involving instrumental variables may account for the data, or, conversely, whether a given variables can be deemed instrumental.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:23:04 GMT  (351kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4976v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4976"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4976.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the Testability of Causal Models with Latent and Instrumental Variables", "authors": ["Judea Pearl"], "emails": ["judea@cs."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is well known that it cannot be assumed from the outset that the persons mentioned are persons who are able to identify themselves, namely, persons who are able to identify themselves and persons who are able to identify themselves.
