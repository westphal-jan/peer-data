One simple method for conducting diagnostic reasoning is to represent system faults and observations only. In this paper, we investigate how having intermediate nodes-nodes other than fault and observation nodes affects the diagnostic performance of a Bayesian belief network. We conducted a series of experiments on a set of real belief networks for medical diagnosis in liver and bile disease. We compared the effects on diagnostic performance of a two-level network consisting just of disease and finding nodes with that of a network which models intermediate pathophysiological disease states as well. We provide some theoretical evidence for differences observed between the abstracted two-level network and the full network.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:23:19 GMT  (369kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4979v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gregory m provan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4979"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4979.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Abstraction in Belief Networks: The Role of Intermediate States in Diagnostic Reasoning", "authors": ["Gregory Provan"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In recent years, we have seen significant growth in health, social, health, health, health, health, health and health."}], "references": [{"title": "The sen\u00ad sitivity of belief networks to imprecise probabilities: an experimental investigation", "author": ["B. del Favero", "K.
