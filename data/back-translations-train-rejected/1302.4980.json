W hereas most previous approaches have emphasized the relationship be\u00ad tween plans and their observable effects,1 we argue that it is equally necessary to consider evidence that would bear on which plan would have been appropriate for the agent to generate. We demonstrate this point through an example application in traffic monitoring, where the interpretation of an individual vehicle's action depends on the surround\u00ad ing highway context. Our techniques for reasoning about plan-generation context are based on Bayesian networks, as part of a general Bayesian framework for plan recognition. This contribution can be considered a variant extension of the model of Charniak and Goldman ( 1993), and of the ap\u00ad proach advocated by Huber et al. (1994).", "startOffset": 8, "endOffset": 912}, {"referenceID": 10, "context": "Similar distinctions could be supported in lin\u00ad guistic approaches as well, perhaps based on probabilistic grammars (Wetherell, 1980).", "startOffset": 116, "endOffset": 133}], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "Typical approaches to plan recognition start from a representation of an agent's possible plans, and reason evidentially from observations of the agent's actions to assess the plausibility of the various candidates.
