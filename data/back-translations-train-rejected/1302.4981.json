The pruning method for decision trees suggests a slight variant of decision trees that we call scenario trees. In scenario trees, we do not need a conditional probability for each edge emanating from a chance node. Instead, we require a joint probability for each path from the root node to a leaf node. We compare the pruning method to the traditional rollback method for decision trees and game trees. For problems that require Bayesian revision of probabilities, a scenario tree representation with the pruning method is more efficient than a decision tree representation with the rollback method. For game trees, the pruning method is more efficient than the rollback method.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:23:29 GMT  (351kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4981v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["prakash p shenoy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4981"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4981.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A New Pruning Method for Solving Decision Trees and Game Trees", "authors": ["Prakash P.
