Recursive structural equation models are one kind of DAG model. However, non-recursive structural equation models of the kinds used to model economic processes are naturally represented by directed cyclic graphs with independent errors, a characterization of conditional independence errors, a characterization of conditional independence constraints is obtained, and it is shown that the result generalizes in a natural way to systems in which the error variables or noises are statistically dependent. For non-linear systems with independent errors a sufficient condition for conditional independence of variables in associated distributions is obtained.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:23:34 GMT  (420kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4982v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter l spirtes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4982"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4982.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Directed Cyclic Graphical Representations of Feedback Models", "authors": ["Peter Spirtes"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The idea is that people who are able to realize themselves are also able to realize themselves."}, {"heading": "X is not independent of Y given { Z, W} in this distribution because it is not possible to factor it into a product of", "text": "In a directed diagram G, a cycle is a cyclically directed path in which each vertex occurs on exactly two edges.
