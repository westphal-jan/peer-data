A semantics is given with soundness and completeness results. Order of magnitude probability functions are easily defined and turn out to be equivalent to kappa functions, which are slight generalizations of Spohn's Natural Conditional Functions. The calculus also gives rise to an order of magnitude decision theory, which can be used to justify an amended version of Pearl's decision theory for kappa functions, although the latter is weaker and less expressive.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:24:11 GMT  (369kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4989v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nic wilson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4989"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.4989.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Nic Wilson"], "emails": ["nic@dcs.qmw.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will be able to retaliate, \"he said.\" We have never waited so long to be able to retaliate, \"he said."}, {"heading": "An instantiation !! in R for arithmetic formula <p is", "text": "A function from Y to R where Z \ufffd Y \ufffd X and Z replace the symbol set of < p < p < p < p (!!) is then defined as the value of the arithmetic expression < p if the symbol x; is replaced by f!
