However, most existing work deals with networks that simply encode whether relationships exist or not. In contrast, relationships in signed networks can be positive (\"like\", \"trust\") or negative (\"dislike\", \"distrust\"). The theory of social balance shows that signed networks tend to conform to some local patterns that, in turn, induce certain global characteristics. In this paper, we exploit both local as well as global aspects of social balance theory for two fundamental problems in the analysis of signed networks: sign prediction and clustering. Motivated by local patterns of social balance, we first propose two families of sign prediction methods: measures of social imbalance (MOIs), and supervised learning using high order cycles (HOCs). These methods predict signs of edges based on triangles and \\ell-cycles for relatively small values of \\ell. Interestingly, by examining measures of social imbalance, we show that the classic Katz measure, which is used widely in unsigned link prediction, actually has a balance theoretic interpretation when applied to signed networks. Furthermore, motivated by the global structure of balanced networks, we propose an effective low rank modeling approach for both sign prediction and clustering. For the low rank modeling approach, we provide theoretical performance guarantees via convex relaxations, scale it up to large problem sizes using a matrix factorization based algorithm, and provide extensive experimental validation including comparisons with local approaches. Our experimental results indicate that, by adopting a more global viewpoint of balance structure, we get significant performance and computational gains in prediction and clustering tasks on signed networks. Our work therefore highlights the usefulness of the global aspect of balance theory for the analysis of signed networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 23:15:57 GMT  (79kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5145v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Mar 2013 03:35:09 GMT  (74kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5145v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG", "authors": ["kai-yang chiang", "cho-jui hsieh", "nagarajan natarajan", "ambuj tewari", "inderjit s dhillon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.5145"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.5145.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Prediction and Clustering in Signed Networks: A Local to Global Perspective", "authors": ["Kai-Yang Chiang", "Cho-Jui Hsieh", "Nagarajan Natarajan", "Ambuj Tewari", "Inderjit S.

Formally, a homogeneous signed network is represented as a graph with the neighborhood matrix A, which marks relationships between entities as follows: Aij = 1, if i & j have a positive relationship; \u2212 1, if i & j have a negative relationship; 0, if the relationship between i & j is unknown (or missing); we should note that we treat a zero entry in A as an unknown relationship, rather than as a relationship, because we expect two entities to have some (hidden) positive or negative attitudes to each other, even if the relationship itself cannot be observed; from an alternative perspective, we can assume that there is an underlying complete signed network A, which contains relationship information between all entities, but we can only observe some subentries of A that are referred to by A as a unit."}, {"heading": "2.2 Social Balance", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "2.3 Weak Balance", "text": "One possible weakness of the theory of social equilibrium is that the defined equilibrium relationships may be too strict. In particular, researchers have argued that the degree of imbalance in the triad with two positive edges (the fourth triad in Table 1) is much stronger than that in the triad with all negative edges (the third triad in Table 1). Therefore, we can say that the first three triads in Table 1 are poorly balanced. Based on this observation, by also allowing triads with all negative edges, we can define a weaker version of the concept of equilibrium [Davis, 1967].As in the case of (strong) social equilibrium, we start with a definition of the weak equilibrium in a complete network: Definition 6 (poorly balanced complete networks) A complete one is poorly balanced if all triads in the network are poorly balanced. The definition of general incomplete networks can be achieved by assuming the perspective of a missing value estimation of networks (7)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Key Problems in Signed Networks", "text": "As in the classical analysis of social networks, we are interested in what we can deduce from a signed network topology. In particular, we will focus on two core problems - predicting signs and clustering. In the problem of predicting signs, we intend to follow the unknown relationship between a pair of units i and j based on partial observations of the entire relationship network.Specifically, if we assume that we are getting a (usually incomplete) Network A selected from an underlying (complete) Network A, then the prediction task must restore the sign pattern of one or more edges in A. This problem bears a resemblance to the structural prediction problem in unsigned networks on [Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg, 2007]. Note that the problem of temporal linkage has also been investigated in the context of an unsigned network developing over time. The input to the prediction algorithm then consists of looking at a series of networks (not a single problem) in the context of a snapshot and not a single problem."}, {"heading": "3 Local Methods: Exploiting Triads", "text": "Since the basic definition of structural equilibrium is in relation to triangles, there follows a natural approach to the design of sign networks (A = 0), which is followed at the local level in relation to unbalanced triangles. We first define a measure of imbalance based on the number of unbalanced triangles in the graph. Generally, we use SC (A) to denote the set of all possible cycles in network A. A definition that is essentially similar to the above appears in the recent work of van de Rijt, 2011, which indicates that the equivalenceTri (A) = 0 iff A. The basic idea of using a measurement of imbalance to predict a given sign is."}, {"heading": "4 Going Global: Exploiting Longer Cycles", "text": "For an incomplete chart, the imbalance could manifest only if we consider longer simple cycles.

One criticism against using only these triangle-based traits is that there may be many people on the social network who do not share friends. In fact, this is the case in most networks used by Leskovec et al. [2010a]. The reason why their method is able to predict well on such pairs is that they use an additional seven \"grade-based\" traits such as in-degree and out-degree (and their signed variants), so predicting an edge with zero embedding (the number of common neighbors of the vertices of an edge) is entirely dependent on the grade-based traits."}, {"heading": "4.3 Reducing the Number of Features", "text": "The number of features can quickly become uncontrollable, and mathematically unfeasible once it exceeds 5. While the dimensionality of the feature space may be the primary concern, the combinatorial character of the features also raises the following intuitive concern: The interpretability of features represented by high-order cycles, such as when = 6, consisting of different signs and directions, poses a challenge. For example, it is intuitively difficult to determine the difference between the two paths i + \u2192 k1 + \u2192 k2 \u2212 k3 + \u2192 k4 + \u2192 j and i + \u2192 k1 + \u2192 k2 \u2212 \u2190 k3 + \u2192 k4 + \u2192 j. With this knowledge, one way to quickly reduce the number of features but maintain the information in longer cycles is to take into account the underlying undirected graphs, ignoring the directions.

In particular, we consider the Singular Value Projection (SVP) algorithm proposed by Jain et al. [2010], which attempts to solve the low matrix completion problem in an efficient manner. The SVP algorithm considers a robust formulation of (14) as follows: minimizes the value of (X) \u2212 kF s.t. rank (19), in which the projection operator P is defined as: (P (X)) character, ij = {Xij, if (i, j) the optimal formulation of (X)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Sign Prediction via Matrix Factorization", "text": "A classic limitation of both convex relaxation and SVP is that they require uniform scanning to ensure good performance.

Therefore, we use a gradient-based matrix factoring approach as an approximation of the problem of signed network completion. In Section 6, we will see that this matrix factoring approach increases the accuracy of the estimate as well as scalability to large real networks.In the matrix factoring approach, we consider the following problem: min W, H, H, Rn, k, x, (i, j) the accuracy of the prediction (Aij \u2212 WHT) ij) 2, W, 2F, 2F, 2F, 2F, 2F, the difference (20), which is used to ensure (20 million) performance, although the problem is not widespread in filtering, ij) iF, 2F, 2F, 2F, 2F, 2F, 2F, 2F, the performance difference (20 million) that is used as a competitive one, while (20 million) it is not widely applicable in filtering."}, {"heading": "5.4 Time Complexity of Sign Prediction Methods", "text": "There are two essential optimization techniques for solving (21) the general loss (21) with different functions (ALS) and the SGD (SGD).ALS solves the quadratic loss problem (20) by alternately minimizing W and H. When one of the W or H is fixed, the optimization problem becomes a smallest square problem relative to the other variables, so we can use well-developed minimum square solvers to solve each partial problem. Given an n \u00b7 n observed matrix with m observations, it requires O (mk2) operations to form the Hessen matrices, and O (nk3) operations to solve each smallest square problem. Therefore, the temporal complexity of ALS O (mk2 + nk3)) is where t1 is the number of iterations.

To build synthetic networks, we first look at a complete, poorly balanced network A, and sample some entries from A to form the partially observed network A, with three control parameters: sparsity, noise level, and sample process D. The sparsity s controls the percentage of edges we scan from A. The noise level indicates the likelihood that the character of a sampled edge will be reversed. The sample process D determines how the sampled entries are distributed. We will focus in particular on two sample distributions: a uniform distribution and a power distribution called Duni or Dpow. Thus, a partially observed network A can be described as A = A."}, {"heading": "6.2 Evidence of Local and Global Patterns in Real Signed Networks", "text": "We have seen that cycles in significant networks have structural equilibriums (see definition 1) according to balance theory, and that we can use cycles for predictions (see sections 3 and 4).

In all three real networks we are looking at, we tend to look at balanced triads (i.e. 3 cycles), which are much more likely to be observed as unbalanced triads. Our study supports that the local patterns (i.e.) of the three networks tend to be balanced. For each network, we look at all patterns of 3 cycles and 4 cycles in the symmetrical network signs (A + AT). For convenience, we use the pattern of an ith cycle of a cycle.

To perform timing tests on a large signed network, in addition to the three real datasets described in Table 4, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset called Cluster10, in which the number of edges is 100 times higher than epinions. Cluster10 is generated from a 10-weakly balanced network in which clusters are the sizes 20000, 40000,.., 200000.

However, most existing work deals with networks that simply encode whether relationships exist or not. In contrast, relationships in signed networks can be positive (\u201clike\u201d, \u201ctrust\u201d) or negative (\u201cdislike\u201d, \u201cdistrust\u201d). The theory of social balance shows that signed networks tend to conform to some local patterns that, in turn, induce certain global characteristics. In this paper, we exploit both local as well as global aspects of social balance theory for two fundamental problems in the analysis of signed networks: sign prediction and clustering. Motivated by local patterns of social balance, we first propose two families of sign prediction methods: measures of social imbalance (MOIs), and supervised learning using high order cycles (HOCs). These methods predict signs of edges based on triangles and l-cycles for relatively small values of l. Interestingly, by examining measures of social imbalance, we show that the classic Katz measure, which is used widely in unsigned link prediction, actually has a balance theoretic interpretation when applied to signed networks. Furthermore, motivated by the global structure of balanced networks, we propose an effective low rank modeling approach for both sign prediction and clustering. For the low rank modeling approach, we provide theoretical performance guarantees via convex relaxations, scale it up to large problem sizes using a matrix factorization based algorithm, and provide extensive experimental validation including comparisons with local approaches. Our experimental results indicate that, by adopting a more global viewpoint of balance structure, we get significant performance and computational gains in prediction and clustering tasks on signed networks. Our work therefore highlights the usefulness of the global aspect of balance theory for the analysis of signed networks.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
