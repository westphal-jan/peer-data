A new type of formal grammars, called grammars with prohibition, is introduced. Grammars with prohibition provide more powerful tools for natural language generation and better describe processes of language learning than the conventional formal grammars. Here we study relations between languages generated by different grammars with prohibition based on conventional types of formal grammars such as context-free or context sensitive grammars. Besides, we compare languages generated by different grammars with prohibition and languages generated by conventional formal grammars. In particular, it is demonstrated that they have essentially higher computational power and expressive possibilities in comparison with the conventional formal grammars. Thus, while conventional formal grammars are recursive and subrecursive algorithms, many classes of grammars with prohibition are superrecursive algorithms. Results presented in this work are aimed at the development of human-machine interaction, modeling natural languages, empowerment of programming languages, computer simulation, better software systems, and theory of recursion.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Feb 2013 04:58:48 GMT  (97kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5181v1", "2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.FL cs.CL", "authors": ["mark burgin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.5181"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.5181.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Basic Classes of Grammars with Prohibition", "authors": ["Mark Burgin"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "A practical tool for modeling natural language and developing human-machine interaction is being developed in the context of formal grammars and languages.

Prohibition grammars provide more powerful tools for generating natural language and better describe processes of language acquisition than conventional formal grammars. Here, we are examining relationships between languages generated by different grammars with a prohibition based on conventional types of formal grammars such as context-free or context-sensitive grammars. Furthermore, we are comparing languages generated by different grammars with prohibitions and languages generated by conventional formal grammars. Specifically, it is shown that they have considerably higher computing power and expressive capabilities compared to conventional formal grammars.

Type 0 grammars (unrestricted or phrase structure grammatics) encompass all conventional formal grammars and generate recursively enumerated languages, i.e. languages accepted by a Turing machine. We refer to the class of unrestricted grammars of G0 and the class of corresponding languages of L (G0), i.e. languages generated (calculated or recognized) by grammars of G0. 2. Type 1 grammars (context-sensitive grammars) generate the context-sensitive languages, which are exactly all languages accepted by a non-deterministic Turing machine whose band is limited by a constant time the length of the input. We refer to the class of context-sensitive grammars of G1 and the class of corresponding languages of L (G1). 3.
