Measure-by-measure updating of such a set of measures upon acquiring new information is well-known to suffer from problems; agents are not always able to learn appropriately. To deal with these problems, we propose using weighted sets of probabilities: a representation where each measure is associated with a weight, which denotes its significance. We describe a natural approach to updating in such a situation and a natural approach to determining the weights. We then show how this representation can be used in decision-making, by modifying a standard approach to decision making -- minimizing expected regret -- to obtain minimax weighted expected regret (MWER). We provide an axiomatization that characterizes preferences induced by MWER both in the static and dynamic case.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Feb 2013 20:11:12 GMT  (189kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5681v1", "Full version of an article [arXiv:1210.4853] that appeared in UAI '12"]], "COMMENTS": "Full version of an article [arXiv:1210.4853] that appeared in UAI '12", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["joseph y halpern", "samantha leung"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.5681"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.5681.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Weighted Sets of Probabilities and Minimax Weighted Expected Regret: New Approaches for Representing Uncertainty and Making Decisions", "authors": ["Samantha Leung"], "emails": ["halpern@cs.cornell.edu", "samlyy@cs.cornell.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 130 2.56 81v1 [cs.G"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "It is one of the biggest nodes in the world that it has in itself to unite."}, {"heading": "2 Weighted Sets of Probabilities", "text": "A set of P + weighted probability measures on a set of S consists of pairs (Pr, \u03b1Pr), each of which is weighted differently.

We have taken into account preferences indexed by menus here. Stoye [21] used a different framework: selection functions. A selection function assigns each finite set of M actions to a subset M. Intuitively, the set M consists of the \"best\" actions in M. Thus, a selection function gives less information than a preference order; it gives only the most important elements of the preference sequence. The motivation for working with selection functions is that an agent can reveal his preferred actions by selecting them when the menu is offered. In a menu-independent setting, the agent can reveal his entire preference sequence; to decide whether \"f\" we actually have to select the preferred functions among the ones."}, {"heading": "A Proof of Theorem 1", "text": "We show here that when a family of menu-dependent preferences performs a limited number of actions in 21 countries, M can be presented as a constant regret in relation to a set of weighted probabilities and a service function.
