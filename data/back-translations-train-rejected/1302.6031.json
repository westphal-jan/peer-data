From a physical point of view, sound is simply a vibration of air pressure, perceived by humans through a complex series of transformations. First, the vibration of air pressure is transmitted via the ear canal to the bones of the middle ear (and partially amplified by certain frequencies), transmitting vibrations in vibrations of the basil membrane, which in turn stimulate the inner hair cells. By releasing neurotransmitters, mechanical energy is converted into electrical signals that are further processed by the central neural system."}, {"heading": "3 Nonlinear means", "text": "Our primary motivation is the distinction between phonemes. It is well known that the position of formants is an important property of vowels. Therefore, we would like to find other ways than LPC to quantify the \"peak\" of formants in the spectral envelope. However, one way to do this is to start with arithmetic MeansM (x1, x2,. xn) (x1, x2,. xn), to begin with their generalizations, is to use weighted linear combinationsL (x1,. xn,. xn) = a1x1,. The fear leads to approaches such as logistic regression or support for vector machines.We want to investigate nonlinear functions. In nonlinear algebras, useful simplification laws such as commutativity or distributivity of operations, they need not be held."}, {"heading": "4 Quantiles", "text": "Minimum and maximum naturally result as the borderline cases of nonlinear means examined in the previous section, sincelim \u03b1 \u2192 \u2212 \u221e M\u03b1 (x1,.., xn) = min (x1,.., xn) lim \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e M\u03b1 (x1,.., xn) = max (x1,.., xn) A simple but important observation is that both min and max do not generate new values. In particular, the evaluation of an expression of variables x1,., xn only the composition of min and max operators leads to one of x1,.,., xn. A natural class of symmetric operators in algebra generated by min and max are quantiles. In fact, under continuity requirements, they are the only symmetrical n-operators in this algebra. From a computer science point of view, it is natural to quantity xxx."}, {"heading": "5 Fuzzy logic", "text": "The mathematical functions introduced so far (M\u03b1, A\u03b1 and Quantile) are essentially monotonous. As spectral data increase, they also increase. To gain contrast, it is useful to have an unsymmetrical function of, say, two variables that \"increase\" in the first and \"decrease\" in the second. A well-known framework that uses such functions is fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic goes back to works by Lukasiewicz and Post. H. Weyl proposed in 1940 a fuzzy logic in which sentences are assigned values in the unit interval. He generalized ordinary Boolean logic operators as follows: a and b = min (a, b) a or b = max (a, b) not a = 1 \u2212 aa implied b = 1 \u2212 a + min (a, b) = min (1, 1 \u2212 a + b), with a and b taking values in the interval [0, 1]. Many other operators in fuzzy logic have been proposed since then."}, {"heading": "6 Eliminating negation", "text": "The first is due to implementation problems encountered when translating blurred logical expressions into electronic circuits. However, both negation and implication, such as Lukasiewicz's implication, must be implemented with active electronic circuits, a problem that can be partially addressed. Passive circuits whose inputs are normalized to [0, 1] cannot calculate with negation A = not a = 1 \u2212 a if they are prepared beforehand based on minutes of identification (x, y); the second is due to conflict with our understanding of auditory perception; discrepancy-negation conversion for MIN-MAX-AVG circuits described in [24]."}, {"heading": "7 Binary Classifiers arising from MM", "text": "An interesting experiment is described in work [26], [27]. A sentence was processed by a filter with a frequency response approaching the spectral envelope of a vowel. Nevertheless, the vowel was recognized by loudspeakers. Thus, it is not the absolute spectral content that determines phonemes phonemes, but rather relative. This is confirmed, for example, in work [28]. In our context, a binary classifier consists of two components. \u2022 The first is a function f of the KS algebra MM. The second component describes what can be concluded from an evaluation of f on spectral data. < 0 and 2 we can distinguish the following natural variants of classifiers. \u2022 A Z classifier is described by a function f-MM. It decides that this phoneme belongs to the first class if f (s) < 0, and decides that it belongs to the second class."}], "references": [{"title": "Discussion: Probability and fuzzy logic are complementary rather than competitive", "author": ["L.A.
