But allowing a knowledge base to contain only objective information is sometimes limiting. We occasionally wish to include information about degrees of belief in the knowledge base as well, because there are contexts in which old beliefs represent important information that should influence new beliefs. In this paper, we describe three quite general techniques for extending a method that generates degrees of belief from objective information to one that can make use of degrees of belief as well. All of our techniques are bloused on well-known approaches, such as cross-entropy. We discuss general connections between the techniques and in particular show that, although conceptually and technically quite different, all of the techniques give the same answer when applied to the random-worlds method.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:13:44 GMT  (2681kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6783v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fahiem bacchus", "adam j grove", "joseph y halpern", "daphne koller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6783"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6783.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Generating New Beliefs From Old*", "authors": ["Fahiem Bacchus", "Daphne Koller"], "emails": ["tbacchus@logos.waterloo.edu", "grove@research.nj.nec.com", "halpern@almaden.ihm.com", "daphne@cs.berkeley.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own, and they see themselves able to survive on their own."}], "references": [{"title": "Cambridge University Press", "author": ["Judgement"], "venue": "Cam\u00ad bridge,", "citeRegEx": ".lef<J2", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 1992}], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "In previous work [BGHK92, BGHK93], we have studied the random-worlds approach\ufffda particular (and quite powerful) method for generating degrees of belief (i.e., subjective probabilities) from a knowl\u00ad edge base consisting of objective (first-order, slalisti\u00ad cal, and defaull) infonnation.
