The class of A-valuations of plausibility is considered where operations based only on information about linear or\u00ad dering of plausibility values are used. In this class the modus ponens generating function fulfiling to the property of strict monotonic\u00ad ity of conclusions is introduced. 1 STABILITY OF DECISIONS IN INFERENCE PROCEDURES Human judgements about plausibility, truth, certainty values of premises, rules and facts are usually qualita\u00ad tive and measured in ordinal scales. Representation of these judgements by numbers from interval L = [0, lJ or L = [0, 100] and using over these numbers quanti\u00ad tative operations such as multiplication, addition and so on is not always correct. Let's consider example. Let R1 and R2 are two rules of some expert system: Rl: If At then H1,pv(RI), (1) R2: If A2 then H2,pv(R2), (2) where pv(RI) and pv(R2) are the plausibility, cer\u00ad tainty, truth values of rules measured in some linearly ordered scale L, for example L = [0, 1]. Often plausi\u00ad bilities of conclusions are calculated by: pv(Ht) = pv(Rl) * pv(At), (3) pv(H2) = pv(R2) * pv(A2), (4) where pv(At) and pv(A2} are the plausibilities of premises and * is some T-norm, for example multi\u00ad plication operation (Godo, Lopez de Mantaras et al. 1988; Hall1990; Trillas, Valverde 1985; Valverde, Tril\u00ad las 1985; Forsyth 1984). Generally the plausibility of conclusion can be calculated by means of a modus po\u00ad nens generating function mpgf: pv(HI) = mpgf(p\u00b7v(At),pv(Rt)). Let in (1)-( 4) the qualitative information about plau\u00ad sibility values is the next: pv(At) < pv(A2} < pv(R2) < pv(RI), (5) that is the plausibility values of premises are less than the plausibility values of rules, the plausibility value of A1 is less than the plausibility value of A2 and the plausibility value of rule R2 is less than the plausibility value of rule Rl. Let these plausibility values are inter\u00ad preted as the next quantitative values from L = (0, 1]: pv(A1) = 0.3 < pv(A2) = 0. 4 < pv(R2} = 0.6 <", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
