We investigate three possible definitions of dependence, of increasing strength. One of them is the counterpart to the multiplication law in probability theory, and the two others are based on the notion of conditional possibility. These two have enough expressive power to support the whole possibility theory, and a complete axiomatization is provided for the strongest one. Moreover we show that weak independence is well-suited to the problems of belief change and plausible reasoning, especially to address the problem of blocking of property inheritance in exception-tolerant taxonomic reasoning.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:15:38 GMT  (718kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6803v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["didier dubois", "luis farinas del cerro", "reas herzig", "henri prade"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6803"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6803.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An ordinal view of independence with application to plausible reasoning", "authors": ["Didier Dubois", "Luis Farinas del Cerro", "Andreas Herzig", "Henri Prade", "Paul Sabatier"], "emails": ["@irit.fr,"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to assert themselves, that they are able to assert themselves, and that they are able to assert themselves."}], "references": [{"title": "Representing default rules in possibilistic logic", "author": ["S.
