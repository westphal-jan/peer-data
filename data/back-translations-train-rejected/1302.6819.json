Syntactically, this means that a first-order formula is equipped with a possibility degree or a necessity degree that expresses to what extent the formula is possibly or necessarily true. Possibilistic resolution yields a calculus for possibilistic logic which respects the semantics developed for possibilistic logic. A drawback, which possibilistic resolution inherits from classical resolution, is that it may not terminate if applied to formulas belonging to decidable fragments of first-order logic. Therefore we propose an alternative proof method for possibilistic logic. The main feature of this method is that it completely abstracts from a concrete calculus but uses as basic operation a test for classical entailment. We then instantiate possibilistic logic with a terminological logic, which is a decidable subclass o f first-order logic but nevertheless much more expressive than propositional logic. This yields an extension of terminological logics towards the representation of uncertain knowledge which is satisfactory from a semantic as well as algorithmic point of view.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:17:13 GMT  (1102kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6819v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["bernhard hollunder"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6819"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6819.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An Alternative Proof Method for Possibilistic Logic and its Application to Terminological Logics", "authors": ["Bernhard Hollunder"], "emails": ["hollunder@dfki.uni-sb.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, as never before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is not a country, but in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in a country, in a country and in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a"}, {"heading": "It should be noted that the formulas thus obtained be long to a restricted subclass of all first-order formulas with one free variable.", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A terminological knowledge base is described by a set", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want.
