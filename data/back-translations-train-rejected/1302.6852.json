An important qualitative aspect of probability is given by the graphhoid properties defined in [Pearl, 88] (see also [Dawid, 79; Smith, 90]), which summarize many of the properties of probabilistic conditional independence. In this paper, we consider the reasons why Probabil obeys these properties, with a view to generating other uncertainty theories that share much of the same structure as probability, but present different types of information that constitute a more qualitative property."}, {"heading": "2 INDEPENDENCE STRUCTURES", "text": "This year he has been able to put himself at the top, and in the way he is able to put himself at the top, \"he said."}, {"heading": "It is easy to see that for any GCPP p, Ip \ufffd I\ufffd, i.e.,", "text": "In fact, it is as if it were a matter of a way in which it is a matter of a way in which it is about the satisfaction of people who are able to understand the world, and in which it is about the satisfaction of people who are able to understand the world, and in which it is about the satisfaction of people who are able to understand the world, and understand why they are able to change the world, and why they are able to change the world, and why they are able to change the world, and why they are able to change the world, in which it is able to change the world."}, {"heading": "1; is symmetric then I; is a semi-graphoid; further more if U is p-connected then J\ufffd is a graphoid.", "text": "The result also results in a way to construct a semi graphoid of a GCPP = PP, even if I, and I \ufffd \ufffd not sym metric.Proposition 5If GCPP p over U is weakly conditional-coherent and the conditions of (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of sentence 4 then If is a semi-graphoid.
