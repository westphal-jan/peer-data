Several variants and extensions to this problem have since been investigated to cover a wider set of applications. Each time a new variant is considered, however, a new algorithm needs to be developed and implemented. As an alternative, in this paper we propose an encoding of the SMP using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our encoding can easily be extended and adapted to the needs of specific applications. As an illustration we show how stable matchings can be found when individuals may designate unacceptable partners and ties between preferences are allowed. Subsequently, we show how our ASP based encoding naturally allows us to select specific stable matchings which are optimal according to a given criterion. Each time, we can rely on generic and efficient off-the-shelf answer set solvers to find (optimal) stable matchings.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Feb 2013 16:43:43 GMT  (28kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.7251v1", "17 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 2 May 2013 05:39:33 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.7251v2", "26 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["sofie de clercq", "steven schockaert", "martine de cock", "ann now\\'e"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.7251"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.7251.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Modeling Stable Matching Problems with Answer Set Programming", "authors": ["Sofie De Clercq", "Steven Schockaert", "Martine De Cock", "Ann Now\u00e9"], "emails": ["Sofier.DeClercq@ugent.be", "Martine.DeCock@ugent.be", "S.Schockaert@cs.cardiff.ac.uk", "ANowe@vub.ac.be", "Sofier.DeClercq@ugent.be", "Martine.DeCock@ugent.be", "S.Schockaert@cs.cardiff.ac.uk", "ANowe@vub.ac.be"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: response programming, logic rules, stable marriage problem, optimal stable matches."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The problem of stable marriage (SMP) is a matching problem that was first introduced and solved by Gale and Shapley.

[7] The algorithm works as follows: in turn 1, every man proposes his first choice of all women. A woman, when proposed, then rejects all men proposed to her. This first choice becomes her temporary husband. In the next rounds, all rejected men propose their first choice of the subset of women they have not yet rejected, regardless of whether that woman already has a temporary husband. Then, every woman rejects all men, but her first choice among the subgroups of men proposed to her and her temporary partner. This process continues until all women have a husband."}, {"heading": "2.2 Answer Set Programming", "text": "The answer is a form of declarative programming that can be wrong or wrong. Its transparency, elegance and ability to deal with problems make it an attractive method for solving combinatorial search and optimization problems. An ASP program is a finite collection of rules of the first order...., Cn predicates. The semantic rules are defined by the basic version of the program, consisting of all the basic instances of the rules w.r.t. the constants that appear in it (see e.g. [2] for a good overview.

The building blocks of these programs are atoms, letters and rules."}, {"heading": "3 Modeling the Stable Marriage Problem in ASP", "text": "In this section, we will assume variations and generalizations of SMP with ASP. A few suggestions for using non-monotonous justifications for modelling SMP have already been described in the literature. For example, [19] mentions a particular variant of SMP (in which boys know a subset of a group of girls and do not want to agree with a girl) and in [4] an abductive program accepts a stable group of marriages in which two fixed persons are paired with strict, complete lists of preferences. To expand our knowledge, there is no comprehensive study beyond a few specific examples on the use of ASP or related paradigms. In particular, the generality of our ASP framework is described as having unacceptable SMP instances and / or ties as a significant advantage.

The stable set found by the G-S algorithm is M-optimal [22], i.e. every man likes this set at least as much as any other stable set. Interchanging the roles of men and women in the G-S algorithm results in a W-optimal stable set [7], optimal from the point of view of women. While some applications require us to favor either the man or the woman, in others it makes more sense to treat both parties equally. To formalize some commonly held notions of fairness and optimism, we define the cost cx (S) of a stable set S for an individual x, with cx (S) = k if x has been agreed with his or her lowest preferred partner. More specifically, for x = mi a man, we define cmi (S) = wms x: z < mi (M) and y (S)."}, {"heading": "S is a sex-equal stable set iff S is a stable set with minimal sex-equalness cost.

An equivalent stable group is a stable group in which the preferences of each individual are considered equally important. [23] proposes the use of an egalitarian stable group to optimally align virtual machines (VM) with servers in order to improve cloud computing by balancing the importance of migration effort in the data center network and VM migration performance. A minimum stable rate is optimal for the person who is worst off. A maximum or minimum stable group is a stable group, each with as few or as many singles as possible. Examples of practical applications include an efficient kidney exchange program [21] and the National Resident Matching Program3 [18].

Our technique for extending this program to a program that can calculate accordingly the gender equality, equality, minimum regret and maximum cardinality is in any case very similar. We start by declaring it in the case of gender equality. Our first step is to add a set of rules that calculate the gender equality cost of a set of marriages. For each man mi and woman wj so that we use the following rules to determine the cost of mi if wj would be his partners: management costs (i, k), we accept (mi, wj)."}, {"heading": "5 Complexity and Future Work", "text": "The NP complete decision problem \"does there exist a stable problem with cardinality \u2265 k (or \u2264 k) for an SMP instance with unacceptable and connections with k a positive integer?\" [17, 18] has practical meaning, e.g. in the National Resident Matching Program [18]. However, if we add a rule sat \u2190 Singles (X), X \u2264 (n + p \u2212 2k) to the extended induced program psinglesext, this problem can be formulated as follows: \"Is there an answer from the normal ASP program psinglesext that contains the literal sat?\" (i.e. bold reasoning), defines another NP complete problem [1]. Thus, our model provides a suitable framework for this type of decision problems in relation to stable sets in the SMP.Notice that the complexity of this type of decision problem and the problem of subsect mentioned in the last paragraph is not optimal. 3 are a good indication, as opposed to finding a pair, it is difficult to find an optimal (there is a pair)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We formalized and solved various variants of SMP using ASP programs that can be easily adapted to other variants. In addition, we applied saturation to calculate optimal stable sets, with the advantage that these programs can be handled with the efficient commercial ASP solver DLV. To our knowledge, our coding provides the first exact implementation, gender-equal, egalitarian, minimum remorse or maximum cardinality stable sets for an example of SMP with acceptance and commitment. Therefore, our general framework allows us to address a class of problems and requires only small adjustments to easily switch between them."}], "references": [{"title": "Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, and Declarative Problem Solving", "author": ["C.

well-known matching problem first introduced and solved by Gale and Shapley [7]. Several variants and extensions to this problem have since been investigated to cover a wider set of applications. Each time a new variant is considered, however, a new algorithm needs to be developed and implemented. As an alternative, in this paper we propose an encoding of the SMP using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our encoding can easily be extended and adapted to the needs of specific applications. As an illustration we show how stable matchings can be found when individuals may designate unacceptable partners and ties between preferences are allowed. Subsequently, we show how our ASP based encoding naturally allows us to select specific stable matchings which are optimal according to a given criterion. Each time, we can rely on generic and efficient off-the-shelf answer set solvers to find (optimal) stable matchings.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
