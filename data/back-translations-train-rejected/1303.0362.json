However, SSC is a transductive method which does not handle with the data not used to construct the graph (out-of-sample data). For each new datum, SSC requires solving $n$ optimization problems in O(n) variables for performing the algorithm over the whole data set, where $n$ is the number of data points. Therefore, it is inefficient to apply SSC in fast online clustering and scalable graphing. In this letter, we propose an inductive spectral clustering algorithm, called inductive Sparse Subspace Clustering (iSSC), which makes SSC feasible to cluster out-of-sample data. iSSC adopts the assumption that high-dimensional data actually lie on the low-dimensional manifold such that out-of-sample data could be grouped in the embedding space learned from in-sample data. Experimental results show that iSSC is promising in clustering out-of-sample data.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 2 Mar 2013 07:47:21 GMT  (1919kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0362v1", "2 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "2 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xi peng", "lei zhang", "zhang yi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.0362"}, "pdf": {"name": "1303.0362.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 130 3.03 62v1 [cs.LG] 2 Mar 201 3"}, {"heading": "Inductive Sparse Subspace Clustering", "text": "This year, more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country and in which it is a country, in which it is a country and in which it is a country, in which it is a country and in which it is a country."}], "references": [{"title": "Sparse Subspace Clustering: Algorithm, Theory, and Applications", "author": ["E.
