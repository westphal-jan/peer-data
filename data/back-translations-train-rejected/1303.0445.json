Named Entity Extraction", "text": "The term \"entity\" was coined for the Sixth Conference on Information Understanding (MUC-6) [5]. The term \"entity recognition and classification\" (NERC) was recognized as one of the most important subtasks of information extraction and included the recognition of information units such as names, organization and location names, as well as numerical expressions such as time, date, money and percentage expressions from unstructured texts such as newspaper articles. In [4], the authors present an exhaustive collection of work carried out in the field of named entity recognition. The effects of the text genre (journalistic, scientific, informal, etc.) and the domain (horticulture, sport, business, etc.) were rather neglected in the NERC literature. Few studies specifically address different genres and domains. The most frequently studied types are three types of \"proper names.\""}, {"heading": "IV. Existing Techniques of Named Entity Extraction", "text": "The aforementioned extraction methods can be roughly divided into two categories, namely rules-based models and machine learning methods [1]. The advantage of rules-based approaches is that they effectively exploit human knowledge and can be conveniently adapted. On the other hand, machine learning approaches such as maximum entropy or supportive vector machine are language-independent and easy to implement. Rule-based approaches surpass machine learning in MUC-7 tests [1]. The current dominant technique for solving the NERC problem is supervised learning. SL techniques include Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Decision Trees, Maximum Entropy Models (ME), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF).These are all variants of the SL approach, which typically consist of a system that reads a large commented corpus."}, {"heading": "V. Spatial Uncertainty", "text": "Obtaining spatial awareness from raw texts has been a primary area of research in the field of situational awareness. [20] The main questions facing research in this field are modeling / representation, even extraction and disambiguation, query, reasoning, and visualization. [20] Spatial descriptions found in free text are mostly based on human perceptions and perceptions, which are inherently inaccurate. Qualitative approaches to the representation of spatial knowledge are strongly inspired by the way spatial information is expressed verbally. Depending on the context in which they are used, spatial statements can correspond with several different spatial relationships, resulting in a certain degree of spatial uncertainty. One of the sources of uncertainty is the need to express a particular relationship independently of the context in which it occurs [21]."}, {"heading": "VI. Fuzzy Logic", "text": "Fuzzy logic was first developed by Lotfi Zadeh [10] to solve decision-making problems with \"IF-THEN\" rules, later it was used to tackle uncertain and inaccurate data management. Fuzzy logic has been used for several years in various areas, such as automated control, consumer goods, [11] industrial systems, automobiles, decision analysis, medicine, geology, flight control, chemical reactor and processes, and applications of artificial intelligence such as expert systems, pattern recognition, and robotics. The universality of fuzzy logic is necessary to overcome complex problems in the field of search. Fuzzy logic provides a basis for developing new tools for handling natural languages and knowledge representations, such as hasty natural language, theory of hierarchical definition, and unified theory of uncertainty [12]. Fuzzy logic is an easy way to draw definitive conclusions based on vague, ambiguous, and imprecise, and imprecise representations of knowledge, so that it makes quick sense to control knowledge."}, {"heading": "VII. Named Entity Extraction and Fuzzy logic", "text": "There is no exact right or wrong answer for a string to be a name. The only problem is how likely it is. Blurred values represent strings \"probability or reliability to be a name. Names consist of several characters. There are several ways to convert members\" characters into the blurred value of the string. In [2], the authors suggest a blurred logical method to identify isolated Arabic characters from a document. Unigram models are used in their work to simplify data collection and training. In addition, some complementary information such as position characteristics are used to support statistical models.Several models are used to estimate the blurred value of a string from the character-based statistical data. These models include Markov models, bigram models, unigram models, unigrammed models, and so on the number of characteristics that are inevitably used."}, {"heading": "VIII. Proposed Method", "text": "This paper proposes the idea of neuro-fuzzy reinforcement learning to classify the spatial descriptors and expressions in free text documents. The basic idea behind fuzzy reinforcement learning is the application of a fuzzy partitioning scheme to the continuous state space and the introduction of a linguistic interpretation. The proposed method is the use of Adaptive Heuristic Critic (AHC), which typically consists of an action (or control) module and a critic (or evaluation) module. There are two representative neuro-fuzzy reinforcement learning modules: GARIC (Generalized Approximate Reasoning for Intelligent Control) and RNN-FLCS (Reinforcement Neural -Network-based Fuzzy Logic Control System) [22]. The Named Entity Extraction technique can be used to extract the spatial components and also spatial descriptors from the unstructured text."}, {"heading": "IX. Conclusion and Future Works", "text": "Although there are automated tools for extracting spatial information from text, many errors and extraction ambiguities still creep into the output, and this paper suggests a self-learning fuzzy system that would learn to recognize and fix the ambiguities, and the resulting spatial locations can then be further processed using fuzzy logic techniques for efficient and effective spatial queries in a large database."}], "references": [{"title": "Fuzzy Logic approach to Recognition of Isolated Arabic Characters", "author": ["Majida Ali Abed", "Hamid Ali Abed AL-Asadi", "Zainab Sabah Baha Al-Deen", "Ahmad Naser Ismail"], "venue": "International Journal of Computer Theory and Engineering,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Terminology and knowledge acquisition: A text based approach", "author": ["Ahmad", "khurshid"], "venue": "Third international congress on terminology and knowledge engineering", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 1993}, {"title": "Message Understanding Conference - 6: A Brief History", "author": ["Ralph Grishman", "B.
