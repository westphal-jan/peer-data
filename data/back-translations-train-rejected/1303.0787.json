We assume that individuals have preferences pi over candidates in X in the form of strict linear order, i.e. transitive, antisymmetric and complete binary relationships. Individuals express their preferences in the form of a ballot bi (e.g. the front-runner, a set of approved candidates or the complete linear order) and we call the election of a ballot for each candidate a profile b = (b1,.., bn). In this paper we assume that individuals submit their complete linear order as ballot, and we therefore use the two terms of ballot and preference interchangeably. A (non-resolvable) election rule F associates with each profile b = (b1,.,., bn) a non-empty subset of the winning candidates F (b)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Iterative Voting", "text": "The Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem [4, 9] showed that under natural conditions all election rules can be manipulated. Subsequent to this finding, a considerable amount of work was done to avoid manipulation, e.g. in the form of restrictive conditions for individual preferences or in the form of arithmetic barriers that make it too difficult for agents to calculate manipulation strategies [1, 3]. In this paper, we adopt a different attitude to manipulation: we consider the fact that individuals may change their preferences as a positive aspect of the electoral process, which may ultimately lead to a better result after a sufficient number of steps. Thus, we consider a sequence of repeated elections in which one of the individuals may be manipulated at each step, i.e. the vote is considered trustworthy in order to change the election result in their favor."}, {"heading": "2.3 Restricted Manipulation Moves", "text": "The convergence of the iterated version of an election rule can be achieved by limiting the number of manipulation strategies available to agents. We now list a number of restrictions that have been studied in the literature, and we add two new definitions to this list. Let bk be the current profile at step k, b0 is the initial (truthful) profile, and F is a voting rule. Suppose that the manipulation (k) = i.Best answer (no limitation): the manipulator i changes its full ballot by getting the results in the best possible result for their truthful preference b0i [5].k pragmatists: the manipulator i moves to the top of their reported ballot, the most preferred candidate follows b0i among those who score in the top k positions [8]. M1: the manipulator i moves to the top of their reported ballot, which we move to the top of their reported ballot, the second-best candidate is 0bi."}, {"heading": "3 Convergence and Axiomatic Properties", "text": "In this section, we will prove that the iterated version of PSR, Maximin and Copeland has a sufficient score when we use our two new limitations for manipulation, and we will also analyze how many other limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are and how many limitations there are limitations there are."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Evaluation of Restricted Manipulation Moves", "text": "In this section, we evaluate our two limited manipulation steps M1 and M2 under an important aspect: We measure whether the limited iterative version of an election rule has a higher condorcet efficiency than the original election rule, i.e. whether the probability of a Condorcet winner (if there is one) being elected is higher for the iterative and non-iterative rule. We show that in most cases, the condorcet efficiency of an election rule increases when iterative manipulation is allowed using M1 or M2 (except for Copeland and Maximin where Condorcet consistent rules already apply); we also compare our results with the k-pragmatic constraint for k = 2.3. Our results are obtained with a program implemented in Java ver.1.6.0. The software generates profiles with uniform distribution (i.e. impartial culture assumption); the impartial culture assumption has received criticism in recent years."}, {"heading": "4.1 Condorcet efficiency of restricted iterative voting", "text": "Figure 1 compares, for multiple voting rules, the Condorcet efficiency of the respective iterative version with restricted manipulation moves M1, M2, 2-pragmatists and 3-pragmatists. The number of voters is set at n = 50.Except in the case of the Borda rule, the Condorcet efficiency of the iterative version of an election hubbub is considerable in relation to the non-iterated version, and the growth is significantly higher if voters manipulate the election with M2 instead of M1. A plausible reason for this behavior is the difference in the range of candidates that can be supported by the two manipulation steps. While M1 can only help a Condorcet winner if he was elected to second place by some of the individuals, M2 can help a candidate, even if he was classified lower. Let us also emphasize that the increase in Condorcet efficiency with M1 is minimal, it is still surprising that such a simple move can result in a better performance than the more pragmatic version of the original 2 can be performed with relatively higher voting efficiency."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We have presented two new definitions of manipulation movements M1 and M2, showing that they lead to a convergence of all the electoral rules considered (cf. Theorems 1 and 2); we have also shown that most of the axiomatic properties, such as unanimity and consistency of the winner, are retained in the iteration process; our experiments have shown that allowing limited manipulation in iterative voting results in a positive increase in the efficiency of Condorcet; and that the best performance is predictable when more information is passed on to agents (cf. STV with M2). This work gives rise to a number of interesting directions to explore in the future."}], "references": [{"title": "Manipulation of Voting Schemes: A General Result", "author": ["A.
