INTRODUCTION", "text": "The need to adapt to the user context was underlined by the comprehensive development of mobile systems that provide a considerable amount of information (images, texts, videos, etc.).It is therefore crucial to help users by reflecting their working habits. It is very difficult to apply a system that follows the user: - Avoid the intervention of experts. - Experts are not aware of the interest of the user."}, {"heading": "2. State of the art", "text": "The trend towards referral systems today is to recommend relevant information to users by using supervised machine learning methods. However, in this type of technique, the referral system must be guided through two steps: (1) The learning step where examples are presented to the system; it \"learns\" from examples and gradually adapts its parameters to the desired output. (2) The exploitation step: new examples that have never been presented to the system before are asked for generalisation [10]. These approaches have good results. However, they require a lot of experience provided by an expert. They cannot start from scratch and they are slow. Furthermore, the user interest can change over time and the techniques cannot really follow. Some work found in the literature tries to solve these problems, as in what follows."}, {"heading": "3.

A strategy to learn the optimal policy \u043c is to give the agent the opportunity to learn the rating function Q: S \u00b7 A \u2192 R. Each action value Q (s, a) represents the expected costs incurred by the agent when he acts in a state and thereafter follows an optimal policy. the Q learning algorithm [14] is a well-known RL technique, which uses a strategy to learn an optimal policy \u03c0 * by learning the action values. He approaches iteratively Q (s, a), provided the system can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), the amplification function is limited and actions are chosen so that each state action pair will attend an infinite number of times (c), c), (c), the Learning Q-Q (a), c), a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,"}, {"heading": "3.2 Collaborative filtering", "text": "A Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendation system works like this: In a group of transactions D, where each transaction T has the form < id, item, rating >, a recommendation model M is produced. Each element is represented by a categorical value, where the rating is a numerical value on a given scale (e.g. each element is rated from 1 to 5 stars), such a model M can generate a list of Top-N recommended elements and corresponding predictive values from a given set of known ratings [4]. In many situations, ratings are not explicit. For example, if we want to recommend websites to a website visitor, we can use the number of pages he has visited and assign these pages an implicit rate of one and zero to all other pages. In relation to CF, three important classes of algorithms exist: memory-based, model-based, and hybrid prediction systems [1, 4]."}, {"heading": "3.3 Case Based Reasoning", "text": "Case-related reasoning (CBR) [12, 13] uses the knowledge of previous situations (cases) to solve new problems by finding a similar case from the past and reusing it in the new problem situation. According to Lopez de Mantaras et al. [12], solving a problem by CBR involves \"obtaining a problem description, measuring the similarity of the current problem with previous problems stored in a case database with its known solutions, finding one or more similar cases, and attempting to reuse the solution of the case (s) found, possibly after adjusting to the differences in the problem description.\" These are some works found in the literature using this technique [17, 18]."}, {"heading": "3.4 The hybrid Q-learning (HyQL)", "text": "We improve the performance of Q-Learning, in the following point: -Reuse case: To accelerate the Q-Learning algorithm, Q-Learning algorithm, we propose to integrate CBR into the loop of the Q-Learning algorithm. -For each step of the Q-Learning algorithm, before selecting the best action, the algorithm calculates the similarity and, if there is a case that can be reused, the algorithm retrieves random measures and adapts them. -Using social groups: In the Q-Learning algorithm, it is said that for each state one action is chosen a = Q (s) according to the current policy. The choice of measures by the policy must ensure a balance between exploration and exploitation. -Exploitation consists in choosing the best action for the current state and thus exploiting the knowledge of the system. Exploration consists in choosing another than the best measure to establish the consequences, to test the system and to expand the knowledge and balance."}, {"heading": "4. Global mechanism", "text": "In order to evaluate our algorithm, we implement it in a ubiquitous receiver system. Figure 1 summarizes the global mechanism of the receiver system. To recognize the context of the user, the receiver system receives events from the sensor module. These events form the input of the recommendation system and start the thinking module. Based on this input, the thinking module allows the selection of an action to be performed in the environment."}, {"heading": "4.1 Environment", "text": "We consider the environment to be composed of all the contextual dimensions described in [5]: cognitive, temporal, geographical, material, social, source document, qualitative, psychological and demographic."}, {"heading": "4.2 Sensor module", "text": "In our work, the sensor module recognizes time, geographical, social and cognitive dimensions of the context in the following ways: (1) The cognitive dimension is given by all the actions of the user, such as: navigation (reads a document, opens a folder, etc.), sending and calling e-mail. (2) The social group is predefined by the user. We assume, for example, that all marketing users of the company in general probably have the same need and are therefore part of the same group. (3) The time is recorded by the user's mobile phone and the calendar of his company. (4) The geographical dimension is recognized by the user's GPS."}, {"heading": "4.3 Abstraction and aggregation", "text": "The abstraction is based on follow-up rules (e.g. specification / generalization) that are defined on time or space montology. For example, if we look at the results of GPS, we use an operation of \"reverse geocoding\" to determine the name and type of place. Aggregation is the combination of the two dimensions of time and place, e.g. \"morning at home.\" It allows a more detailed description of situations at different levels of granularity. In order to represent and characterize the location of the user, a model for the representation of geographical places is needed. In order to provide an adequate representation of geographical information, the trend is towards semantic approaches with spatial ontology. As in [16] we propose to use ontology to represent and argue geographical data. In order to define the temporal aspects that characterize the situation of the user (morning, evening, weekend...), it is necessary to allow a clear representation based on and reasoning over all time periods."}, {"heading": "4.4 Database", "text": "All modules of the system share a database, which is divided into four parts: users, preferences, history and devices.The history section stores all the events that have occurred and all the actions carried out by the system. This section is useful for deriving the good recommendation to the user, and it is divided into: Action _ History, which contains all the interactions of the system with the environment; Event _ History, which contains all the events that the user has registered in his calendar. The device section contains information about the devices. This knowledge can be used to determine what the device can do."}, {"heading": "4.5 Reasoning system", "text": "In our experiments, the thinking module is controlled by each of the previously presented algorithms: CF, QLearning, CBR and HyQL."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The aim of this work is to investigate the problems we find when trying to adapt a recommendation system to the user in a ubiquitous environment. The recommendation system defines the observable situations and what actions should be performed in each situation in order to provide the user with useful information.To achieve this goal, we propose to mix the RL algorithm with CBR and CF algorithms.
