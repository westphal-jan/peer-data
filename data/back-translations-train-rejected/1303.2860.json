Our motivation is to improve the overall satisfaction of individuals concerned (students, teachers, etc.) by providing a fair timetable to them. The central idea is that undesirable arrangements in the course timetable, i.e., violations of soft constraints, should be distributed in a fair way among the individuals. We propose two formulations for the fair course timetabling problem that are based on max-min fairness and Jain's fairness index, respectively. Furthermore, we present and experimentally evaluate an optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing for solving max-min fair course timetabling problems. The new contribution is concerned with measuring the energy difference between two timetables, i.e., how much worse a timetable is compared to another timetable with respect to max-min fairness. We introduce three different energy difference measures and evaluate their impact on the overall algorithm performance. The second proposed problem formulation focuses on the tradeoff between fairness and the total amount of soft constraint violations. Our experimental evaluation shows that the known best solutions to the ITC2007 curriculum-based course timetabling instances are quite fair with respect to Jain's fairness index. However, the experiments also show that the fairness can be improved further for only a rather small increase in the total amount of soft constraint violations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Mar 2013 12:46:54 GMT  (100kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2860v1", "appeared in PATAT 2012, pp. 114-130"]], "COMMENTS": "appeared in PATAT 2012, pp. 114-130", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["moritz m\\\"uhlenthaler", "rolf wanka"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.2860"}, "pdf": {"name": "1303.2860.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Moritz M\u00fchlenthaler", "Rolf Wanka"], "emails": ["moritz.muehlenthaler@cs.fau.de", "rwanka@cs.fau.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 130 3.28 60v1 [cs.AI] 12 M"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we give a brief overview of the curriculum-based timetable for problem formulation, as well as relevant definitions relating to Max Min Fairness and Jain's Fairness Index."}, {"heading": "2.1 Curriculum-based Course Timetabling Problems", "text": "This year, it is at an all-time high in the history of the European Union."}, {"heading": "2.2 Fairness in Resource Allocation", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to outdo themselves."}, {"heading": "3 Fairness in Academic Course Timetabling", "text": "In this section, we will define two fair versions of the CB-CTT problem, but at least to some extent they are not a suitable concept for exploring the trade-off between fairness and efficiency.

Table 1 refers sbest to the known best solution for each instance. A and A \u2032 refer to the allocation functions stated in (2) and (3).

A critical part of this algorithm is the energy difference that determines the performance of MAXMINFAIR SA. Our test setup was as follows: For each energy difference, we independently performed 50 runs with MAXMINFAIR SA. Temperature levels were determined experimentally, we set a maximum performance level of 5 and more. Cooling rate was set to (9) to establish consistent experimental conditions for fair optimization, we used a timeout that was executable according to the publicly available ITC2007 benchmark."}, {"heading": "5.2 The Tradeoff Between Fairness and Efficiency", "text": "We have proposed the JFI-CB-CTT problem formulation in Section 3, which allows us to examine the trade-off between fairness and efficiency that arises over time. We can observe in column 4 of Table 1 that for all the best solutions from [DGS12] the fairness index is greater than 0.8, i.e. the best solutions are also fair for more than 80 percent of the curricula. To solve the corresponding JFI-CTT instances, we use the multiple optimization algorithm AMOSA, proposed by BSMD08, which is based on a simulated approximation such as MAXMINFAIR SA algorithm. Since we do not expect a general multiple optimization, but solutions that are as good as the best solutions."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced two new problem formulations for the academic curriculum, based on the CB-CTT problem model of lane three of ITC2007, MMF-CB-CTT and JFI-CBCTT.

MMFCB-CTT formulation aims to create fair curricula, while JFI-CTCTT is a biobjective problem formulation based on Jain's Fairness Index."}], "references": [{"title": "Curriculum-based course timetabling with SAT and MaxSAT", "author": ["Roberto As\u0131\u0301n Acha", "Robert Nieuwenhuis"], "venue": "In Proc. 8th Int.
