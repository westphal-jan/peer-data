The ordered pair (U, R) is called approximation space. In an approximation space (U, R), R thus generates a partition U / R = {X1, X2,..., Xm} on U, where X1, X2,..., Xm are the equivalence classes indicated by the equivalence relationship R.

Conclusion", "text": "The reduction of attributes is a NP-hard problem, many methods are proposed to find all reductions or a single reduction, but there are not the optimal solutions for it, so it is still a problem that is worth exploring intensively. To some extent, the construction of a reduction is based on the relationship between attributes. In this essay, we give the substantial conclusions of the attribute character in terms of the relationship between attributes. We point out that the attribute, whether unnecessary or relatively necessary, is determined by the relationship between E (a) and N (a) in virtual form, and whether it is unnecessary or relatively necessary in terms of a reduction, is determined by the relationship of this reduction, E (a) and N (a). In addition, we give a simple and clear description of the characteristics of attributes in topology. In addition, some relationships between attributes are given and this is helpful for the construction of reductions. Finally, a method of reduction is given by attributes on the basis of E (a)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Secondly, more concise and clear results are given about the judgment of the attribute characters through analyzing the properties of refinement and precise-refinement between E(a) andN(a) in topology. In addition, the relationship among attributes are discussed which is useful for constructing a reduct in the last section of this paper. In the last, we propose a reduct algorithm based on E(a), and this algorithm is an extended application of the analysis of attribute characters above.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
