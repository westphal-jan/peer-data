EVALUATING ETHNIC ATTRIBUTION AND HOMOPHILY", "text": "The analysis of the corpus of video dialogues and the evaluation of behavioural candidates by crowdsourcing allowed us to narrow down the number of rich points that represent potential indications of ethnicity. We divided the most striking behaviours into two groups and presented them as two experimental conditions: behaviours of ethnicity Ar (BCEAr) and behaviours of ethnicity AmE (BCEAmE). We assume that these behavioural conditions will have a major effect on the ethnicity of the robot characters as perceived ethnicity Ar. Ethnic mapping families of hypotheses 1Ar and 1AmE: behaviours of ethnicity will have a major effect on the ethnicity mapping of the robot characters. In particular, BCEAr will have a positive effect on the mapping of the robot characters as Ar and BCEAmE will have a positive effect on the mapping of the robot characters as E.We hypotheses that these are also expressed as behaviour2E (behaviour2E)."}, {"heading": "A. Participants", "text": "Education City, Doha, recruited native Arabic speakers, who are also fluent in English, and American native speakers. Data corresponding to one Ar subject and 3 AmE subjects were excluded from the analysis due to lower language levels or discrepancies in the protocol. Subsequently, there were 17 subjects (7 male and 10 female) in AmE state and 13 subjects (7 male and 6 female) in Ar state. The majority of Ar participants were university students (average age 19.5, SD = 1.6), while the majority of AmE participants were university employees or teachers (average age 26.4, SD = 9.2)."}, {"heading": "B. Procedure", "text": "After completing a demographic questionnaire and evaluating their own emotional state (safety part of the Godspeed questionnaire), participants were familiarized with the character of the first robot (Figure 2), were advised that they would interact with four different robot characters by typing in English, and were asked to pay close attention to the instructions they were to retrieve later. Participants were informed that while the robot would only answer in English, it would act as a receptive character of a specific ethnic background: either a native speaker with American English or a native speaker who speaks English as a foreign language. Participants were asked to pay close attention to the behavior of the robot and the content of the speech, as they were asked to rate the likely ethnic background of the character played by the robot. Interaction with each robot character consisted of three directional searches, with the sequence of the four characters varying randomly for each participant."}, {"heading": "C. Stimuli", "text": "The independent variables of the study were robotic behavior (BCEAr or BCEAmE), robot face (1-4) and objectives and corresponding routes for the first dialogue (the offices of the professors).The combinations of conditions were mixed within and across the subjects.Robotic behavior varied through acts of dialogue of greeting, orientation, handling of inconsistencies and handling of failure to give instructions. Combinations of verbal and non-verbal behaviors for each dialogue action and behavior condition are shown in Table I. The robot's response to the final utterance of the user (typically a variant of \"bye\" or \"thank you\") did not vary across the conditions and was identified as appropriate between \"bye\" or \"you are welcome,\" 5.The instructions to the professor's offices began at the actual experimental site and corresponded with a map of an imaginary building. Each route consisted of steps 6 (e.g., turn left to the 5)."}, {"heading": "D. Results", "text": "The results of the Godspeed questionnaire and two terms of ethnic assignment were used as perceptual measures of the robot = = 42. We use the success or failure of the search for the office of the professor on the map as a binary measure of task performance. Godspeed scales showed internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha results above 0.7 for both AmE and Ar participants. All p values are shown before correcting for 2-hypotheses familywise errors for hypotheses 1Ar and 1AmE, or 6-hypotheses familywise errors for hypotheses 2A-2F. Attribution hypotheses 1Ar. The data do not indicate a major effect of BCE or faces on Ar attribution. However, a gradual model selection by AIC indicates a negative effect of the interaction between the surface 4 and BCEAmE on the assignment (F [100], modules = 3.44, between CEP and the interaction between 0.20 and 0.20)."}, {"heading": "IV. DISCUSSION", "text": "The effect of the behavior on the perceived ethnicity of the robot characters was evident in the attributions as native speakers of American English and not as native speakers of Arabic. The fact that the behaviors had an impact on the mapping of the robot characters as Ar suggests that the manipulated behaviors were not only strong enough to distinguish between native and non-native speakers, but that they also had a relevance to the mapping of the robot as Ar. However, coloring the questions for AmE and Ar attributions could suggest to the participants that these two possibilities are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The correlation between the attributions is moderate, though significant, p < 0.0001."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "Establishing ethnically homophilic relationships between humans and robots has the appeal of improving the perception of a robot and the performance of the user, but this has not been tested before, partly because of the difficulty of equipping a robot with ethnicity. We approached this task by trying to avoid overly obvious and potentially offensive labels of ethnicity and culture such as clothing, accent or ethnic appearance (although we control the latter), and instead aimed to evoke ethnic aspects through verbal and non-verbal behaviors. We also highlighted the robot as a performer who acts like a receptionist character. Our experiment with a robot of relatively low human resemblance shows that we can evoke associations between the robot's behavior and its attributed ethnicity. Although we do not find evidence of ethnically homophilic behaviors, we believe that a suggested path can be used to bring about robot characters with higher probability of being homophile and more likely to be perceived."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This publication was made possible by the NPRP Grant 09-1113-1-171 of the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of the Qatar Foundation), for which the authors are exclusively responsible.
