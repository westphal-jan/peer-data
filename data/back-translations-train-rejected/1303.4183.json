In order to increase the effectiveness of the calculations, the algorithm was paralleled with the help of the OpenMP library. We have gained considerable speed on platforms with multi-threaded processors with shared memory access. In the analysis, we have used various modifications of the genetic operator, with which we obtain different evolutionary processes of potential solutions.The results allow to select the best from many methods used in genetic algorithms and to observe the acceleration on Yorkfield, Bloomfield, Westmere-EX and the most recent Sandy Bridge cores.Keywords: artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms, parallel algorithms, extreme functional algorithms"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a type of algorithm inspired by the evolution of living organisms in nature. It is one of the evolutionary algorithms whose idea was initiated by John Henry Holland, the American engineer and scientist. GA searches in a specific way in the area of solving a problem to find the best solution. GA defines the environment in which a specific population of specimens represents possible solutions to the problem. Furthermore, similar to organisms in nature, the specimens are crossed, mutated and the selection of the best solutions is based on the value of the adaptation function. Ideas of the genetic algorithm are presented in the illustration."}, {"heading": "Algorithm", "text": "The implementation of GA, which is described and presented in the thesis, is a fragment of the Olib library. Its sources written in C / C + + language are available at [3] address. In the genetic algorithm, the following crossing methods were implemented: \u2022 single-point crossover, \u2022 two-point crossover, \u2022 uniform crossover (mixing ratio = 0.5), \u2022 uniform crossover (random mixing ratio), \u2022 semi-uniform crossover, \u2022 arithmetic crossover (functions: AND, OR, NOR, NAND, XOR, Random) One-point crossover method was implemented in two ways. In the first implementation, if the result is exceeded, there is always a child. In the second implementation, with 2 / 3 probability, a child is born, with 2 / 9 probability, two children and with 1 / 9 probability, three children."}, {"heading": "Realization calculations", "text": "In recent years, it has become clear that most of them are people who are incapable of defending their interests."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Genetic operators analyzed in the article can be divided into more and less sophisticated methods in terms of the operations performed. In terms of intersections, the Uniform Crossover implementation proved to be the most complex, and in terms of the selection of this tournament method, the complexity of which increases with the increasing size of the tournament group. Genetic algorithms go through relatively well parallel processes. Acceleration is quite noticeable on modern multi-core processors. In the case of more advanced platforms, which are composed of many multi-core processors, problems with appropriate performance scaling may arify. Applying with programmable graphical accelerators, which have become very popular in recent years, can prove to be a very interesting prospect. If used properly, they will certainly enable even faster processing of data."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "The work was prepared with the supercomputer resources of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science of the Maria Curie Sk\u0142odowska University in Lublin and the Institute of Computer Science and Automation of the College of Computer Science and Business Administration in Lomza."}, {"heading": "GENERACJA PRZYBLI\u017bE\u0143 EKSTREM\u00d3W FUNKCJI NIEOBLICZALNYCH ANALITYCZNIE DZI\u0118KI ZASTOSOWANIU ALGORYTM\u00d3W GENETYCZNYCH ZE WSPARCIEM KOMPUTER\u00d3W R\u00d3WNOLEG\u0141YCH", "text": "In recent years, it has become apparent that the number of unemployed who have slipped into unemployment over the last ten years has not decreased.
