This experiment was carried out by considering 50 meters as maxDist, so that trajectories moving in the same street should be considered neighbors following the same path. Minimum support for minSup was set to 4, indicating that candidates will be standards if they have at least 4 candidates in their neighborhood. In this experiment, we considered time tolerance of 30 minutes, as the dataset does not have many synchronized trajectories leaving the regions at a similar time.

Students were divided into 7 groups, with the aim of solving a puzzle. Each pupil was given a GPS that collected his trajectory. This data set is in Figure 14. This data set has 466 trajectories that summarize 62264 points, with aleatory sampling rates. For this experiment, we considered 4 high density regions. A total of 66 candidates (subtrajectories that move between regions) were calculated and are in Figure 15. The following pairs of regions generated candidates: A to B, B to C, B to D, B to A, C to B and D to B. TRA-SOD was carried out taking into account two different parameters.

With an increase in minSup, more candidates are needed to find the standard route, which of course led to a reduction in the number of standards. This is possible because of the 5 standard routes found in Case 1, only 2 were found in Case 2: from B to A and from B to D.

This is possible because of the 10 candidates, only 3 standards crossed the most direct route, as in Figure 19. From B to D, a row of 16 standards and 4 outliers was found, which means that most candidates moved together by the same route. From B to A and from B to D, the number of outliers increased when compared with the result of Case 1, with a lower minimum velocity of the Olier than the Olier.

They do not do a deeper analysis of discovered patterns to give more meaning or semantics. In fact, existing trajectory outliers look for detours across the entire data set. In this paper, we look for outliers among trajectories that have similar goals, i.e., trajectories that move between the same regions. We present the definition of semantic outliers and an algorithm to find such patterns from trajectories, taking into account both spatial and spatial-temporal information. Semantic outliers are those trajectories that move between regions of interest and that follow a path that connects the regions."}], "references": [{"title": "Trajectory clustering: a partition-and-group framework", "author": ["Jae-Gil Lee", "Jiawei Han", "Kyu-Young Whang"], "venue": "SIGMOD Conference,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Discovering chasing behavior in moving object trajectories", "author": ["Fernando de Lucca Siqueira", "Vania Bogorny"], "venue": "T.
