This function is a three-dimensional surface, a marginal probability of one parent as a function of the sup port for their common evidence and the other parent. This \"faith surface\" shows the combined effect on one parent of the diagnostic and inter-causal influence. The applied solution technology is similar to the clique potential methods. All nodes are formed into a clique potential, > II, proportional to the joint for the state space of all nodes. The probability we solve for the rear nodes is the function of the probabilities of other nodes in the network. To specify the sensitivity of one node to the marginal probabilities of other nodes, we think of the \"buttons\" to control the other nodes as pi (>) and lambda."}], "references": [{"title": "The structure of Bayes networks for visual recognition,", "author": ["J.M.

The relation so generated has been termed \"inter\u00ad causal.\" It is shown by construction that inter-causal independence is possible for bi\u00ad nary distributions at one state of evidence. For such \"CICI\" distributions, the two mea\u00ad sures of inter-causal effect, \"multiplicative synergy\" and \"additive synergy\" are equal. The well known \"noisy-or\" model is an ex\u00ad ample of such a distribution. This introduces novel semantics for the noisy-or, as a model of the degree of conflict among competing hy\u00ad potheses of a common observation. In a general Bayesian network, the relation between a pair of nodes can be predictive, meaning we are inter\u00ad ested in the effect of a node upon its successors, or, oppositely, diagnostic, where we infer the state of a node from knowledge of its successors. \\\\1e can define yet a third relation between nodes that are neither suc\u00ad cessors of each other, but share a common successor. Such a relation has been termed inter-causal. (Henrion and Druzel 1990, p.10] For example, in the simplest di\u00ad agram with this property, nodes A and B in Figure one are inter-causally related to each other by their com\u00ad mon evidence at node e. This relation is a property of the clique formed by \"marrying the parents\" of e, not by the individual effects of the arcs into e. In this paper I derive the quantitative inter-causal properties due to evidence nodes constructed from the noisy-or\" model. The interest in inter-causal relations occurs in the pro\u00ad cess of abduction, that is, reasoning from evidence back to the hypotheses that explain the evidence. This arises in problems of interpretation, where more than one hypothesis may be suggested by a piece of evi\u00ad dence. (Goldman and Charniak 1990] Having multiple explanations denotes the ambiguity due to not having enough information to entirely resolve which hypothe\u00ad sis offers the true explanation. This paper shows how to construct an evidence node that expresses this am\u00ad biguity by the degree of conflict between hypotheses. We apply this elsewhere (Agosta 1991] as a compo\u00ad nent in building a \"recognition network\" where rele\u00ad vant hypotheses are created \"on the fly\" as possible interpretations of the evidence. The implicit relation between A and B due to shared evidence has been extensively explored as the prop\u00ad erty of one hypothesis to \"explain away\" another. These are cases where, given evidence and the asser\u00ad tion of one hypothesis, the other hypothesis can be disqualified as a cause of the evidence. This paper ex\u00ad plores how this dependency induced between hypothe\u00ad ses changes with the evidence. Interestingly, with bi\u00ad nary variables, the induced dependency may vary, and as shown by the noisy-or, disappear for certain states of evidence.
