These issues have a common underlying theme: there should be an underlying belief calculus of which the many different reasoning forms are special cases, sometimes approximate. The system presented allows reasoning about defaults, likelihood, necessity and possibility in a manner similar to the earlier work of Adams. The system is based on the belief calculus of subjective Bayesian probability which itself is based on a few simple assumptions about how belief should be manipulated. Approximations, semantics, consistency and consequence results are presented for the system. While this puts these often discussed plausible reasoning forms on a probabilistic footing, useful application to practical problems remains an issue.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:29:51 GMT  (393kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5708v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["wray l buntine"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5708"}, "pdf": {"name": "1303.5708.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Some Properties of Plausible Reasoning", "authors": ["Wray Buntine"], "emails": ["wray@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are in a position to go into a different world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live."}], "references": [{"title": "Probability and the logic of con\u00ad ditionals", "author": ["E.
