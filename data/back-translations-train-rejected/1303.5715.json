The local expression language in SPI is the language in which the dependence of a node on its antecedents is described. The original language represented the dependence as a single monolithic conditional probability distribution. The extended language provides a set of operators (*, +, and -) which can be used to specify methods for combining partial conditional distributions. As one instance of the utility of this extension, we show how this extended language can be used to capture the semantics, representational advantages, and inferential complexity advantages of the \"noisy or\" relationship.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:30:27 GMT  (463kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5715v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["bruce d'ambrosio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5715"}, "pdf": {"name": "1303.5715.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Local Expression Languages for Probabilistic Dependence: a preliminary report", "authors": ["Bruce D'Ambrosio"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it will be able to fix and fix the mentioned bugs."}, {"heading": "T hanks to Bob Fung and Peter Raulefs for many useful discussions.
