This theory is developed with the following view of human belief in mind. Consider the belief that an event E will occur (or has occurred or is occurring).

If the agent chooses to exercise \"the will to believe\" and entertain this belief, he/she/it is entitled to a degree of confidence c (1 &gt; c &gt; 0) in doing so.

So, what view of faith should we adopt? It is, very simply put, anyone's choice. We have chosen to develop our theory of faith for the following reason: surprise is something to do with how we reason and what we actually observe in our everyday lives. It is an intuitive concept that we can feel very comfortable judging its value. Therefore, by adopting the view of faith that we hold in this paper, we can grasp the notion of faith using our measured degrees of surprise. Ultimately, this can contribute to efforts in the field of \"approximate human expertise with the use of computers.\" Also known as artificial intelligence."}, {"heading": "International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,", "text": "In Proceedings of the Eighth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, American Association for Artificial Intelligence, Boston, Massachusetts, 112-119.Hsia, Y.-T.
