One major drawback of this modeling is the inability to model uncertainties, which are often encountered in practice. In this paper, a new tool, called U-yraph, is proposed for environment modeling. A U-graph is an extension of distance graphs with the ability to handle a kind of uncertainty. By modeling an uncertain environment as a U-graph, and a navigation problem as a Markovian decision process, we can precisely define a new optimality criterion for navigation plans, and more importantly, we can come up with a general algorithm for computing optimal plans for navigation tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:32:32 GMT  (335kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5740v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["runping qi", "david l poole"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5740"}, "pdf": {"name": "1303.5740.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "High Level Path Planning with Uncertainty", "authors": ["Runping Qi", "David Poole"], "emails": ["qi@cs.", "poole@cs.ubc.ca"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move in another country than in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another, in another."}, {"heading": "V = IU{s;ali E I; a E !<;};", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A1 = {(i, s;a)li E I; a E K;}", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A2 = {(s;.,j)li,j E I; a E I<;;q(i,j,a) > 0}", "text": "In such a representative graph, a node i E I, designated as a state node, represents an observable state, while node s; a, designated as a non-state node, represents a temporary state, resulting from acting a in state i.

Therefore, we can assign action a as a label for arc (i, s; a) and probability q (i, j, a) as a label for arc (s;., j).
