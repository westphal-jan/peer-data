Algorithms proposed in the literature to reduce these complexities either limit the evidence itself or the reference domain of the variables they model. In this paper, we are interested in showing that some of the theoretical properties underlying the evidence bodies, the set of evidence bodies, can be used to produce algorithms that are efficient in situations where the data cannot be constrained."}, {"heading": "2 BASIC NOTIONS IN EVIDENCE THEORY", "text": "In the framework of the evidence theory, the information supplied by a source about the actual value of a person can also be understood in the same way as it is described in a book.
