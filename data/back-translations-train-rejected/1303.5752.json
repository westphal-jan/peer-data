We study several updating (conditioning) schemes that emerge naturally from a common scenarion to provide some insights into their meaning. Updating is a subtle operation and there is no single method, no single 'good' rule. The choice of the appropriate rule must always be given due consideration. Planchet (1989) presents a mathematical survey of many rules. We focus on the practical meaning of these rules. After summarizing the several rules for conditioning, we present an illustrative example in which the various forms of conditioning can be explained.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:33:33 GMT  (270kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5752v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["philippe smets"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5752"}, "pdf": {"name": "1303.5752.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Philippe Smets"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have established in the past, and they will be able to assert themselves."}], "references": [{"title": "Combination of incomplete probabilistic information", "author": ["J.E.
