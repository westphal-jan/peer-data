PROLIFERATION OF WORLDS An entailment problem in Nilsson's (1986) probabilistic logic derives an estimate for the prior probability of one sentence (hereafter, the \"target\") from the priors for a set of other (\"source\") sentences. The prior beliefs about the source sentences establish constraints of the form P=VW L wi = l Wi <': 0 sum over all \"worlds\"", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
