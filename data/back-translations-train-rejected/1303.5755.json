We present a technique to allow designers to incorporate their own unique attitude towards uncertainty as opposed to those assumed by the domain expert's rules.

We describe a method for integrating quantitative methods of design evaluation that reflect individual individual preferences; the general approach is to identify aspects of heuristic rules that include, directly or indirectly, assumptions about the user's attitude to risk and replace them with the attributes of the individual user; Multiattribute Utility Analysis is used to methodically extract, interpret and manage the user's preferences during the construction of the knowledge base; we present the results of integrating multiattribute benefit analyses with a rules-based system for material selection; 2.1 ANALYSIS OF HEURISTIC RUtility I shows the basic steps; Heuristics used to construct a conventional rule base are based on the subjective sequence of rules."}], "references": [{"title": "Decision-Making in a Fuzzy Environment,\" Management", "author": ["Bellman R.
