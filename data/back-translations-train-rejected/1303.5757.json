This is because the Dempster-Shafer theory, as it is normally implemented, involves a repeated application of the Dempster rule of combination, which requires recording at any stage of any subset of 8 with a non-zero mass. For example, the combination of m simple support functions may have as many as 2q non-zero masses, where q is the minimum of m and 181, making the approach of shafer so computationally unfeasible. There were a number of schemes to deal with this; [Barnett, 81] showed how the calculation of Dempster shafer belief in a very specific case where all ev-sets are singlets or complements of singlets."}], "references": [{"title": "Computational methods for a mathematical theory of evidence", "author": ["J Barnett"], "venue": ".A.,", "citeRegEx": "Barnett,? \\Q1981\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Barnett", "year": 1981}, {"title": "Reasoning, Plausible' in En\u00ad cyclopedia of Artificial", "author": ["P.P.
