{"id": "1303.5759", "review": {"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Mar-2013", "title": "An Efficient Implementation of Belief Function Propagation", "abstract": "The local computation technique (Shafer et al. 1987, Shafer and Shenoy 1988, Shenoy and Shafer 1986) is used for propagating belief functions in so called a Markov Tree. In this paper, we describe an efficient implementation of belief function propagation on the basis of the local computation technique. The presented method avoids all the redundant computations in the propagation process, and so makes the computational complexity decrease with respect to other existing implementations (Hsia and Shenoy 1989, Zarley et al. 1988). We also give a combined algorithm for both propagation and re-propagation which makes the re-propagation process more efficient when one or more of the prior belief functions is changed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:34:07 GMT  (453kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5759v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hong xu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5759"}, "pdf": {"name": "1303.5759.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An Efficient Implementation of Belief Function Propagation", "authors": [], "emails": ["r01505@bbrbfu01.bitnet"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of the people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to play, to dance, to dance, to dance, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to play, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move"}, {"heading": "2 SOME BASIC CONCEPTS ABOUT BELIEF FUNCTION NETWORKS", "text": "It is not as if it is an incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete,"}, {"heading": "3 BELIEF FUNCTION PROPAGATION USING LOCAL COMPUTATION", "text": "It has been shown that if the faith functional network can be represented as a certain type of tree, called the Markov tree, the faith functions can be planted in the Markov tree, (so) that belief in another tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in a tree (so) as in two other different nodes Vi and Vj in G (vinvj).
