As mentioned in the introduction, the first naive way to extend modern SAT solvers to solve the problem of enumerating all modes of a CNF formula is to add a blocking clause every time a model is found. We call this first extension BC-Enum, for the blocking clause-based enumeration solution. The enumeration solver BC-Enum and its improved variants have several disadvantages. The first problem is that the spatial complexity of a BC-Enum-like algorithm is exponential at its worst. In addition to the clauses learned in every conflict through the CDCL-based SAT solver, the number of added blocking clauses remains very important for problems with a huge number of models. The second problem relates to the use of SIDS models that relate to more hypocritical order."}, {"heading": "4 Application to Sequence Mining", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Frequent pattern mining", "text": "Here we give a description of the problem of enumerating all common patterns with placeholders in an order.

Furthermore, Ps refers to the number of symbols that are in the order of the symbols of s. The length of s is characterized by the order of s that is not in the order of p. This symbol corresponds to any symbol of the alphabet, including itself. Definition 1 (pattern): A pattern over the order of symbols of s. A placeholder (or no matter) is an additional symbol that does not belong in the order of p. Definition 1 (pattern) is a minimum number of elements that are in the order of s.

[6] The SAT and CP-based approaches in data mining are proposed to provide declarative and flexible frameworks. [7] In fact, new constraints often require new implementations in specialized approaches, while they are easily incorporated into such frameworks.Let the SAT and CP-based approaches be in one alphabet, s a sequence over length n and a minimum support threshold. It is easy to see that the length of each motif is smaller or equal. [7] In this context, we set the length of each candidate pattern to the upper limit m and we complete the sequence s on the right with m \u2212 1 wildcards.Let p = p0."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "In this section an experimental evaluation of our approach to large real world instances 71 is given. We compare both BR-Enum and BC-Enum implemented on top of the state-of-the-art SAT solver MiniSAT 2.2. We performed two types of experiments. In the first case we looked at the satisfactory SAT instances from the SAT Challenge 2012 2. After a 4 hour time limit, only a few instances are solved, i.e. all models are found. In most cases, the number of models is very large, or the formula contains a small number of models and the proof of unsatisfaction takes a long time. Results are presented in Table 1. As we can see on the solved instances, BR-Enum outperforms BC-Enum significantly. Surprisingly, BR-Enum is even better for detecting unreliability."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we propose a simple enhancement of modern SAT solvers to solve the problem of enumerating all models of a CNF formula. Our enhancement aims to benefit from the efficiency of SAT solvers in finding a single model, while avoiding the main constraints underlying the use of blocking clauses to avoid enumerating the same models. We have shown that our proposed approach exceeds blocking clauses-based enumeration techniques in several orders of magnitude, both in satisfactory cases from the latest SAT challenge and in the SAT instances encoding the sequence-mining problem. In future work, a first improvement of our new BR-Enum algorithm is to integrate the best simplification techniques when a model is found, in order to derive the smallest possible subsequence of decisions that can be extended to the current model by dispersion of units [In addition, we can plan with our model enumeration algorithms, 8,23]."}], "references": [{"title": "An efficient polynomial space and polynomial delay algorithm for enumeration of maximal motifs in a sequence", "author": ["H.
