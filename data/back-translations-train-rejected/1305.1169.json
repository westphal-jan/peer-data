The conclusion is that the indicator-based selection works best using the Hypervolume Difference Indicator [19] - and only this one is used below, here referred to as MO-DaEYAHSP. As explained above, suitability is calculated by YAHSP and YAHSP, as all known planners to date, as a one-objective planner.

In the case of macespan and costs, both of which are to be minimized, each linear combination can be defined by a single parameter \u03b1 in [0, 1]. In the following, F\u03b1 will denote the number of non-dominated individuals within the unification of all end populations7. Note that different alpha runs may have different optimal values for their parameters: a \"run\" of the aggregation method thus boils down to multiple alpha runs and returns the number of non-dominated individuals within the unification of all end populations7.

The case is clear on MultiZeno6, and on the various instances experimented with, where MO-DaEYAHSP finds the entire Pareto front robust (with the exception of the convex instance), whereas Agg-DaEYAHSP performs much worse in all aspects, including the MultiZeno9 instance, despite the better hypervolume indicator: in fact, a few more points are found on the Pareto front, but the global picture remains a poor approximation of the Pareto front. Other experiments on more instances are necessary to confirm these initial results, and the ongoing work concerns resolving instances that are generated from IPC benchmarks, the cost of each and the duration."}, {"heading": "Preface", "text": "This textbook is aimed at students of Physics, Physical Chemistry and Theoretical Chemistry. Here, the reader will be provided with basic knowledge of atomic and quantum physics at the level taught, for example, in the first chapters of our book The Physics of Atoms and Quantum. Here, the physics student will find material that should be included in the basic training of every physicist. Furthermore, the concepts presented in this book are intended to enable students to gain an understanding of the breadth and diversity of the field of molecular physics and its future as a fascinating field of research. For chemistry students, the concepts presented in this book provide a theoretical framework for this entire field of study. By means of these concepts, at least in principle, it is possible to reduce the enormous stock of empirical chemical knowledge to a few basic principles: that of quantum mechanics. In addition, modern physical methods, the basics of which are introduced here, are becoming increasingly important in chemistry."}, {"heading": "Organization", "text": "ECOOP '95 is organized by the Faculty of Computer Science, A Rhus University and AITO (Association Internationa pour les Technologie Object) in collaboration with ACM / SIGPLAN."}, {"heading": "Executive Commitee", "text": "Conference leader: Ole Lehrmann Madsen (A-rhus University, DK) Programme leader: Walter Olthoff (DFKI GmbH, Germany) Organisation leader: J\u00f8rgen Lindskov Knudsen (A-rhus University, DK) Tutorials: Birger M\u00f8ller-Pedersen (Norwegian Computing Center, Norway) Workshops: Eric Jul (University of Copenhagen, Denmark) Panels: Boris Magnusson (Lund University, Sweden) Exhibition: Elmer Sandvad (A-rhus University, DK) Presentations: Kurt N\u00f8rdmark (A-rhus University, DK)"}, {"heading": "Program Commitee", "text": "Conference leader: Ole Lehrmann Madsen (A-rhus University, DK) Programme leader: Walter Olthoff (DFKI GmbH, Germany) Organisation leader: J\u00f8rgen Lindskov Knudsen (A-rhus University, DK) Tutorials: Birger M\u00f8ller-Pedersen (Norwegian Computing Center, Norway) Workshops: Eric Jul (University of Copenhagen, Denmark) Panels: Boris Magnusson (Lund University, Sweden) Exhibition: Elmer Sandvad (A-rhus University, DK) Presentations: Kurt N\u00f8rdmark (A-rhus University, DK)"}, {"heading": "Referees", "text": "V.
