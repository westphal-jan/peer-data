This goes beyond classical sentiment analysis, and also much further than customer profiling. The purpose here is to have a characterisation of users in terms of personality traits, such as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. While this is an incipient area of research, we ask the question of whether cognitive abilities, and intelligence in particular, are also measurable from user profiles. However, we pose the question as broadly as possible in terms of subjects, in the context of universal psychometrics, including humans, machines and hybrids. Namely, in this paper we analyse the following question: is it possible to measure the intelligence of humans and (non-human) bots in a social network or a game just from their user profiles, i.e., by observation, without the use of interactive tests, such as IQ tests, the Turing test or other more principled machine intelligence tests?", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 May 2013 21:39:57 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1655v1", "Keywords: intelligence; user profiles; cognitive abilities; social networks; universal psychometrics; games; virtual worlds"]], "COMMENTS": "Keywords: intelligence; user profiles; cognitive abilities; social networks; universal psychometrics; games; virtual worlds", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jose hernandez-orallo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.1655"}, "pdf": {"name": "1305.1655.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A short note on estimating intelligence from user profiles in the context of universal psychometrics: prospects and caveats", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez-Orallo"], "emails": ["jorallo@dsic.upv.es"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 130 5,16 55v1 [cs.AI] 7There is an increasing interest in deriving some personality traits of users or players in social networks or games, going beyond the classical analysis of the offer and extending far beyond customer profiling, in order to achieve a characterization of users in terms of personality traits such as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, acceptability and neuroticism.

The evaluation of the cognitive abilities of biological beings has been similarly addressed by psychometry [47, 4] for humans and by cognitive science [63] and comparative psychology, although animals are also taken into account. When talking about machines, things are much more dispersed and immature: specific tests (Turing test [66, 57], the entire Turing test [62] and other sensory variations [56]), the bot prize [42], CAPTCHAs [68], the use of human IQ tests for machines [16, 18, 17, 61, 6, 5], the machine intelligence quotient [71, 2],...), contests (RL competition [70], Robocup [49], general game competition [21], the planning of the contest [54],...) and landmarks (Deep Blue [7, Watson [20] The universal intelligence tests and other] problems of the Turing."}, {"heading": "3 Measuring intelligence without profiles", "text": "The best way to evaluate the intelligence of an agent (be it a human or a machine) in a virtual environment is to use an intelligence test (but not a CAPTCHA or Turing test variant, as discussed above), so we will review and examine how intelligence is measured without profiles (below) and with profiles (in the next section), and whether there are other ways to interact with the behavior of agents without actually performing tests."}, {"heading": "4 Measuring intelligence with profiles", "text": "They are judged by what they are able to do or what they have done.

increasing interest in inferring some personality traits from users and players in social networks and games, respectively. This goes beyond classical sentiment analysis, and also much further than customer profiling. The purpose here is to have a characterisation of users in terms of personality traits, such as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. While this is an incipient area of research, we ask the question of whether cognitive abilities, and intelligence in particular, are also measurable from user profiles. However, we pose the question as broadly as possible in terms of subjects, in the context of universal psychometrics, including humans, machines and hybrids. Namely, in this paper we analyse the following question: is it possible to measure the intelligence of humans and (non-human) bots in a social network or a game just from their user profiles, i.e., by observation, without the use of interactive tests, such as IQ tests, the Turing test or other more principled machine intelligence tests?", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
