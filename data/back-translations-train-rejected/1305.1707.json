Introduction", "text": "A data set that is greatly distorted when the sample of one class is higher than that of others [1]. Applications such as predicting a rare but important disease are very important than regular treatment. Similar situations are observed in other areas, such as detecting network interference [10], managing risks and predicting errors in technical devices. In such a situation, most of the classifiers are distorted and show very poor classification rates in relation to smaller classes."}, {"heading": "2.

Discussion", "text": "Many areas are affected by class imbalance problems, and the solution offered by many techniques in data mining is helpful but not sufficient; the consideration of which technique is best suited to dealing with a problem of data distribution depends greatly on the nature of the data used for experiments."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In practice, it is reported that data preprocessing offers a better solution than other methods because it allows the addition of new information or the deletion of redundant information, which helps balance the data. Another method that is helpful to solve the problem of class imbalance is boosting. Boosting is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm that improves the performance of the weak classifier. An algorithm such as RUSBoost, SMOTEBoost is an example of increasing the algorithm. The method of feature selection can also be used to classify imbalance data. The performance of a feature selection algorithm depends on the nature of the problem. Finally, this paper suggests that the use of two or more techniques, i.e. a hybrid approach, provides a better solution to the problem of class imbalance."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2013, "abstractText": "In last few years there are major changes and evolution has been done on classification of data.
