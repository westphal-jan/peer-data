SEMANTIC TRAJECTORIES", "text": "Most of the research on semantic trajectory analysis comes from the community that has grown within the FP6 GeoPKDD project [34], whose initial focus was on the privacy-conscious use of spatiotemporal data. To continue the investigation into the discovery of knowledge and the use of moving object data, GeoPKDD was first followed by MODAP [21] 3 and more recently by SEEK [22]. The same community has recently presented an overview of research in this field [50]. Among the active initiatives aimed at advancing research on the modeling, analysis and visualization of moving objects, a remarkable contribution has also emerged from COST Action MOVE [23]. Another recent overview was presented by Spaccapietra and collaborators [57], the same group that originally developed the first conceptual model for the representation of semantic objects in trajectories [58], which has become a reference model for the trajectory analysis of this model [26], for example [11]."}, {"heading": "A.

DESCRIPTION LOGICS (DL)", "text": "In this section, we present the most important features of DLs [6] that form the basis for our formalization."}, {"heading": "IV. A METHODOLOGY FOR TRAJECTORY PATTERN DISCOVERY", "text": "In this section, we present the methodology we propose for discovering patterns and behaviors in moving object sequences, i.e., our approach is strongly based on ontology and DL formalism: we use ontology to represent the moving object application domain and DL axioms to specify the patterns. 2a TBox is acyclic without using any term itself. We then define the graphic formalism we use in the essay describing the ontology design; then, using such formalism, we introduce a high-level ontology for modeling moving object sequences, namely Moving Object Ontology (MOO). We then discuss how to expand the MOO to formalize the secs of a particular application domain, and finally describe the discovery patterns for formal implementation."}, {"heading": "A. Ontology diagrams", "text": "In the thesis, we introduce the ontology design, which we apply by supporting ontology diagrams that describe the concepts and the roles between them, with concept and role having the semantics we use in Section III. An example of ontology diagrams is given in Fig. 1, which illustrates the MOO design. We present concepts as rectangles with rounded corners, while we present roles as directed arrows. For clarity, we do not report on the structural properties of the concept, but describe them in the text whenever necessary. In the text, the ontology names are highlighted (e.g. Moving Object), but within the discourse, unit and concept names are used interchangeably, where no ambiguity arises. Concept generalizations are presented as straight lines leading from subordinate to uppermost concepts, similar to the ISA relationship of object-oriented models. Starred labels (label *) model one on many relationships are submarines that represent arrows within the respective domains."}, {"heading": "B. Moving Object Ontology (MOO)", "text": "The basic units of MOO abstract the characteristics common to different areas that focus on the movement of any kind of object, such as traffic analysis for route planning, footpath analysis, animal movement analysis, detection of ship corridors for maritime surveillance, etc. The concepts formalizing these units are presented in Figure 1, namely in Moving Object (MO), MO Trajectory, Location, Time, and MO Event. MO formalizes any class of objects that move, such as cars, people, airplanes, buses, etc. MO Itinerary model the semantically enriched motion of the 7MO, defined as sequences of MO events. Events are critical concepts in our modeling because we rely on using trajector semantics."}, {"heading": "C. Domain Ontology and Patterns", "text": "In order to model the entities of the scope of interest, ontological concepts and roles in the MOO need to be expanded. In Fig. 1, for example, we expanded the Moving Object concept to represent cars, people, airplanes and buses. In the next section, we will see how the MOO was expanded to model the field of containerized transportation. In our application scenario, we are interested in formalizing motion patterns and identifying the trajectories that match the behavior that such patterns express. Patterns can be specified as axioms directly in the Ontology domain. An axiom defines a new class of objects using the DL syntax, whose ontology cases are those that verify the axiom conditions.Therefore, to retrieve the trajectories that verify the patterns, it is sufficient to check the pattern axioms against ontology.Alternatively, axioms can be converted into explicit DL queries, which are the most modified QI queries."}, {"heading": "D. Pattern Discovery Workflow", "text": "Once the MOO has been expanded in step (1) to model the application domain and (2) the motion patterns have been defined as described above, we can proceed with the development of the pattern finding tool. In step (3), data must be selected to extract the event sequences, and event semantics must be explicitly represented with comments on the moving object trajectories."}, {"heading": "V. MARITIME CONTAINER ONTOLOGY", "text": "In [62] we proposed the Maritime Container Ontology (MCO) to represent the field of maritime containers. In the rest of the section, we describe the MCO design that extends the MOO formalized above to define containers, container and shipping routes, using the semantics of events. In this section, we do not report on the detailed design of shipments and shipping phases that goes beyond the scope of the essay. We refer the interested reader to [62] for the details. In the ontology diagrams in the section, we use the following convention on role inheritance: roles in italics are inherited by the MOO as they are, while roles whose name is underlined are inherited roles that are specialized to refer to specific sub-concepts."}, {"heading": "A. Containers and Shipments", "text": "In the MCO, each container is modelled by an instance of the container concept, the Moving Object is extended in the 8MOO (see Fig. 1). Each container has a unique identifier that represents an ISO 6346 [33] identification code, i.e. the BIC code 3. Each container belongs to a carrier, i.e. a freight forwarder or leasing company that rents the container to a carrier to which it is connected by the role (see Fig. 3). Each shipment is handled by a carrier to deliver a set of goods and includes the date on which the order was placed, shipped and delivered to a consignee. A shipment is executed by at least one container shipment; each container shipment refers to a single container and has a container route."}, {"heading": "B.

SUSPICIOUS PATTERNS", "text": "In addition to the semantic model that formalizes domain knowledge, we have developed the axioms for detecting anomalous patterns. Specifically, we present two suspicious patterns: loop and unnecessary transhipment. Such patterns were defined in collaboration with experts from the Customs Risk Intelligence Unit and are patterns that potentially indicate fraud activity because they perform unnecessary operations that result in additional costs or delays for the shipper. These patterns are defined in the MCO as DL axioms. Each axiom connects ontology concepts with logical operators and implicitly defines the class of objects that describe container routes according to the appropriate suspicious patterns. Both axioms cross container routes and shipping routes: This is because cargo ships carry thousands of containers during their voyages and usually pass through more than one port for each voyage."}, {"heading": "A.

Unnecessary Transshipment", "text": "Sample Unnecessary transhipment is shown in Fig. 7, where a container loaded at a time t1 on V essel1 in port P1 is transhipped at a time t3 on V essel2 in an intermediate port and then both V essel1 and V essel2 arrive at port P4, which is the destination country of the container, so the transhipment was not necessary. Such manipulation in container routes is often used to disguise the real origin of a shipment in order to take advantage of a convenient customs agreement between the participating countries: In fact, a fraudulent shipper can easily manipulate the container documents by pretending that the shipment originates from the port of departure of V essel2, i.e., port P2, instead of P1. Given the formalization shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5, the DL axiom formalization pattern is as follows: DL axiom (axiom unnecessary transhipment, which is not necessary)."}, {"heading": "VII.

The approach can be applied to the detection of movement patterns and behaviors whenever the semantics of events occurring along the trajectory is, explicitly or implicitly, available. In particular, we tested it against an exacting case scenario in maritime surveillance, i.e., the discovery of suspicious container transportations. The methodology we have developed entails the formalization of the application domain through a domain ontology, extending the Moving Object Ontology (MOO) described in this paper. Afterwards, movement patterns have to be formalized, either as Description Logic (DL) axioms or queries, enabling the retrieval of the trajectories that follow the patterns. In our experimental evaluation, we have considered a real world dataset of 18 Million of container events describing the deed undertaken in a port to accomplish the shipping (e.g., loading on a vessel, export operation). Leveraging events, we have reconstructed almost 300 thousand container trajectories referring to 50 thousand containers travelling along three years. We have formalized the anomalous itinerary patterns as DL axioms, testing different ontology APIs and DL reasoners to retrieve the suspicious transportations. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach is feasible and efficient. In particular, the joint use of Pellet and SPARQL-DL enables to detect the trajectories following a given pattern in a reasonable time with big size datasets.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
