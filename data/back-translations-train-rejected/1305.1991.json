This need is strengthened by increasingly more tasks being analysed for and completed by a wider diversity of systems, including swarms and hybrids. The notion of universal test has recently emerged in the context of machine intelligence evaluation as a way to define and use the same cognitive test for a variety of systems, using some principled tasks and adapting the interface to each particular subject. However, how far can universal tests be taken? This paper analyses this question in terms of subjects, environments, space-time resolution, rewards and interfaces. This leads to a number of findings, insights and caveats, according to several levels where universal tests may be progressively more difficult to conceive, implement and administer. One of the most significant contributions is given by the realisation that more universal tests are defined as maximisations of less universal tests for a variety of configurations. This means that universal tests must be necessarily adaptive.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 May 2013 01:46:38 GMT  (686kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1991v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david l dowe", "jose hernandez-orallo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.1991"}, "pdf": {"name": "1305.1991.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the universality of cognitive tests", "authors": ["David L.

This need is reinforced by an increasing number of tasks, which are analysed and supplemented by a greater variety of systems, including swarms and hybrids. In the context of assessing machine intelligence, the concept of universal testing has recently crystallised to define and use the same cognitive test for a variety of systems, using some principle-based tasks and adapting the interface to each individual subject. However, how far can a universal test go? This paper analyses this question in terms of subjects, the environment, space-time resolution, rewards and interfaces. This leads to a series of insights, insights and limitations, depending on the multiple levels on which universal testing can be increasingly difficult to design, implement and apply.

Hawking has long lost his ability to speak, but he is relatively happy when he has assistants who can follow his facial features, and when he has trained generations of speech. We are not aware of any shortcomings in his input (hearing), but we should deny his remarkable intelligence not only because of his limited performance, but also because he has many limitations in terms of conventional intelligence tests. Other cases, such as deafness-blind and those in the syndrome, are capable of denying his remarkable intelligence only because of his limited abilities (such as an individual's ability to communicate), many limitations of a handicapped (or awkward) communication channel, as well as the development of new semantic signals and languages. Establishing communication through an unconventional channel can be a real challenge for a peer, and it can take months or years before he establishes the first semantic contact with the subject."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "In fact, it is as if most people who are able to survive themselves are able to survive themselves by going in search of themselves.

different kinds of systems such as humans, animals and machines, requires more general ways of assessing their cognitive abilities. This need is strengthened by increasingly more tasks being analysed for and completed by a wider diversity of systems, including swarms and hybrids. The notion of universal test has recently emerged in the context of machine intelligence evaluation as a way to define and use the same cognitive test for a variety of systems, using some principled tasks and adapting the interface to each particular subject. However, how far can universal tests be taken? This paper analyses this question in terms of subjects, environments, space-time resolution, rewards and interfaces. This leads to a number of findings, insights and caveats, according to several levels where universal tests may be progressively more difficult to conceive, implement and administer. One of the most significant contributions is given by the realisation that more universal tests are defined as maximisations of less universal tests for a variety of configurations. This means that universal tests must be necessarily adaptive.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
