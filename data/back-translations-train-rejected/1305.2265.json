An action is defined by a set of preconditions and a set of effects: the action can only be executed if all the conditions are met in the current state, and after an action has been performed, the effects of the action on the state change: the system enters a new state. A plan is a sequence of actions, and a plan is such that the execution of each action is put in the initial state."}, {"heading": "2.1 Multi-Objective AI Planning", "text": "Most existing work in AI planning involves a single goal, although the real problems are generally multi-objective (e.g. optimizing the make-up margin while minimizing costs, two contradictory goals).An obvious approach to multi-objective AI planning is to combine the various goals into a single goal, usually a fixed linear combination (weighted sum) of all goals. The only goal is to be minimized, and the weights must be positive (or negative) so that the goals in the original problem are minimized (or maximized).The solution of an aggregate problem is optimal when all weights are not zero or the solution is unique [12]. It is also well known that regardless of the weights, the optimal solution of an aggregate problem always lies on the convex parts of the Pareto front. However, some adaptive techniques of the aggregation approach have been proposed that partially remedy this disadvantage [13] and are dominated by the search for overall solutions, always by the front."}, {"heading": "City 0 City 4City 2", "text": "Despite the fact that pure multi-objective approaches, such as dominance-based approaches, are capable of generating a variety of Pareto-optimal solutions, which is a serious advantage, aggregation approaches are worth exploring, since they can be seamlessly implemented from almost any single objective algorithm and quickly provide at least part of the Pareto front at low labor costs. This explains why all work in multi-objective AI planning uses objective aggregation to the best of our knowledge5. Early work has taken a certain twist in PDDL 2.0 [16,17,18]. PDDL 3.0, on the other hand, explicitly provided hooks for multiple goals [19], and a new trail of IPC has been devoted to aggregated multiple goals: the \"net benefit\" track took place in 2006 [20] and 2008 [21], but was discontinued in 2011 due to a too small number of entries."}, {"heading": "2.2 Tunable Benchmarks for Multi-Objective Temporal Planning", "text": "For the sake of clarity, it is important to be able to experiment with cases of tunable complexity, for which the exact Pareto fronts are easy to determine, and this is the reason for the design of the MultiZeno benchmark family. By now, the reader will have solved the small puzzle presented in Figure 1, and found the solution with Makespan 8, the reasoning being that no aircraft will ever remain idle. In order to turn this problem into a not too unrealistic logistics multi-target, some costs will be added to all 3 central cities (1 to 3), leading to the MultiZenoCost problems, where the second goal is additive: each aircraft will have to pay the corresponding tax that it lands in that city. In the simplest instance, MultiZeno3, which only affects 3 passengers, there are three obvious points that belong to the Pareto fronts, and the little tricks describe, 5 with the exception of an early proof-down concept for EX."}, {"heading": "3 Divide-and-Evolve", "text": "Let PD (I, G) designate the planning problem defined on domain D (predicates, objects, and actions), with initial state I and target state G. In the STRIPS representation model [22], a state is a list of Boolean atoms defined using the predicates of the domain instantiated with the domain objects. To solve PD (I, G), the basic idea of DaEX is to find a sequence of states S1,..., Sn, and use some embedded planners X to solve the series of planning problems PD (Sk, Sk + 1), for k [0, n] (with the convention that S0 = I and Sn + 1 = G). Creating and optimizing the sequence of states (Si) i [1, n] is driven by an evolutionary algorithm that solves each partial problem (Sk + 1)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Representation, Initialization, and Variation Operators", "text": "Representation An individual in DaEX is a variable list of states of the given domain. However, the size of the space of lists of complete states quickly becomes unstoppable as the number of objects increases. In addition, goals of planning problems must only be defined as partial states that include a subset of objects, and the goal is to find a state in which all atoms of the target state are true. An individual in DaEX is therefore a variable list of partial states, and a partial state is a variable list of atoms (instantiated predicates). Initialization Previous work with DaEX in various areas of planning problems from the IPC benchmark series have shown the need for a very careful selection of atoms that are used to form the partial states [23]. The method used today to form the partial states is based on a heuristic estimation that can become true and mutated for each atom, the earliest time of it being an individual."}, {"heading": "3.2 Hybridization and Multi-Objectivization", "text": "SYYYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYSYSYYYSYSYYYYYSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Conditions", "text": "The aggregation method for multi-objective optimization in turn starts a series of individual objective problems.

Since the range of the makespan values is approximately twice as large as that of the cost, the following values of the \u03b1 values are used instead of regular spatial values: 0, 0.05, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0. Thus, the aggregation method \"boils down\" to the operation of the corresponding eight \u03b1 runs, and the return as an approximation of the pareto front of the non-dominated solutions under the merger of the eight final populations.

In fact, for the AggregHyper approach, ParamILS has found that YAHSP only has the macespan (W cost = 0) for small values of \u03b1, and only the costs for large values of IBP, whereas the exact opposite is true for the AggregFitness approach.

Initially, AggregHyper appears as a clear winner against AggregFitness, as confirmed by the Wilcoxon test with 95% confidence: On both instances, the two lowest lines are the results of total hypervolume for, bottom-up, AggregHyper and AggregFitness, each reaching different values."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Perspectives", "text": "This paper addresses several issues related to parameter optimization for aggregated approaches to multi-objective optimization. For the specific case study in AI scheduling presented here, some conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, the parameter optimization of each individual objective approach should be based on hypervolume (or perhaps another multi-objective indicator) as a quality measure for parameter configurations, rather than the usual fitness of the target algorithm. Secondly, the AggregHyper approach seems to achieve better results than the multi-objective DaEYAHSP presented in [15] in terms of hypervolume, as well as in terms of meeting the points of the Pareto front. However, such a comparison must take into account that a run of the aggregated approach requires eight times the CPU time of a single run: such a fair comparison is the topic of ongoing work. Finally, several specifics of the case studies will make the parameters used in the AI planning very dangerous and others."}, {"heading": "Preface", "text": "This textbook is aimed at students of Physics, Physical Chemistry and Theoretical Chemistry. Here, the reader will be provided with basic knowledge of atomic and quantum physics at the level taught, for example, in the first chapters of our book The Physics of Atoms and Quantum. Here, the physics student will find material that should be included in the basic training of every physicist. Furthermore, the concepts presented in this book are intended to enable students to gain an understanding of the breadth and diversity of the field of molecular physics and its future as a fascinating field of research. For chemistry students, the concepts presented in this book provide a theoretical framework for this entire field of study. By means of these concepts, at least in principle, it is possible to reduce the enormous stock of empirical chemical knowledge to a few basic principles: that of quantum mechanics. In addition, modern physical methods, the basics of which are introduced here, are becoming increasingly important in chemistry."}, {"heading": "Organization", "text": "ECOOP '95 is organized by the Faculty of Computer Science, A Rhus University and AITO (Association Internationa pour les Technologie Object) in collaboration with ACM / SIGPLAN."}, {"heading": "Executive Commitee", "text": "Conference leader: Ole Lehrmann Madsen (A-rhus University, DK) Programme leader: Walter Olthoff (DFKI GmbH, Germany) Organisation leader: J\u00f8rgen Lindskov Knudsen (A-rhus University, DK) Tutorials: Birger M\u00f8ller-Pedersen (Norwegian Computing Center, Norway) Workshops: Eric Jul (University of Copenhagen, Denmark) Panels: Boris Magnusson (Lund University, Sweden) Exhibition: Elmer Sandvad (A-rhus University, DK) Presentations: Kurt N\u00f8rdmark (A-rhus University, DK)"}, {"heading": "Program Commitee", "text": "Conference leader: Ole Lehrmann Madsen (A-rhus University, DK) Programme leader: Walter Olthoff (DFKI GmbH, Germany) Organisation leader: J\u00f8rgen Lindskov Knudsen (A-rhus University, DK) Tutorials: Birger M\u00f8ller-Pedersen (Norwegian Computing Center, Norway) Workshops: Eric Jul (University of Copenhagen, Denmark) Panels: Boris Magnusson (Lund University, Sweden) Exhibition: Elmer Sandvad (A-rhus University, DK) Presentations: Kurt N\u00f8rdmark (A-rhus University, DK)"}, {"heading": "Referees", "text": "V.
