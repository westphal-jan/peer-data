INTRODUCTION Collision testing is a critical bottleneck in robotic motion planning and a key spin to enable more complex real-time robot systems [4]. Collision testing for a multi-robot team is even more difficult than for a single robot. In [1] we show that collision testing for a single robot in a metric space can be significantly reduced by using \"safety certificates\" that record the (normally) collision-controlled distance of one point p to the next obstacle, see Figure 1. When a new node q is pulled within an existing certificate (i.e., p \u2212 q \u00b2 < Dmin), q cannot possibly be in collision and a new test (for q) is inevitable."}, {"heading": "II. MULTI-ROBOT ALGORITHMS", "text": "Assuming that the members of a multi-robot team share a common environment, the multi-robot team configuration room is a Cartesian product of the space of each robot1. R robots that plan in D dimensions result in an RD-dimensional configuration room. In the centralized multi-robot problem, environmental collision testing can be done piecemeal per J. Bialkowski, M. Otte and E. Frazzoli, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. ottemw @ mit.edu1If not all team members share a common environment, it may be possible to reduce the problem by splitting it into a series of fragmented sub-problems, one per robot replacement that is common to a particular environment.In the present work, we will now describe the individual algorithms."}, {"heading": "A. Basic Certificate", "text": "In the Basic Certificate method, certificates are a cartesian product of the D-balls, so there is one D-ball per robot. Consider the case where three robots share a 2-dimensional workspace, see Figure 4. The robots are labeled A, B, and C, and the subscriptions a, b, and c denote the projection of a particular robot of a point. If the team is located at point p within the combined configuration space, then the robot a is at the projected point pa within its own projection of that space. The certificate stored in p is defined to verify [Dmin, b, Dmin, c] a list of radii of its three balls. Point q is certified by p if the projections qa, qb, and qc are in the projected environment, the certificates of pa, pb, and PC (blue, red, and orange balls) are identical respectively."}, {"heading": "B. Partial Certificate", "text": "In the sub-certificate, each robot performs collision tests in its own projection of the entire space (similar to the base certificate), but if a point is not certified as safe with respect to all sub-space projections, then only partial collision testing is required against the projections that have not been individually certified as safe. See Figure 3, if qa and qc are within the certificates of pa or PC, but qb is not within the certificate of pb, then only a 1 / 3 check is required to determine the safety of qb. Implementing this method requires that each node stores R certificate pointers (i.e., instead of the single pointer required in the base certificate).Storing one pointer per robot makes it possible to certify a new node by combining different old nodes and / or calculate its own sub-certificates as needed."}, {"heading": "C. Shared Projection", "text": "common projection is similar to partial certificate, except that all robots perform collision tests in the same two-dimensional projection of the full three-dimensional space, see Figure 4. We assume that this will result in this space being populated more quickly with certificates and therefore requiring less (standard) collision checks. In other words: In contrast to a single projection of the space, R nodes are checked and / or added during each iteration instead of 1. Therefore, we expect that it will require 1 / R iterations to achieve the same amount of certified space vs. partial certificate (and base certificate). Implementation of this method requires an additional three-dimensional kd tree in the common projected space; however, the time complexity only increases from O (RD-log (N)) to O (RD-log (N) + D-log (R)), where D-log (d) is determined by the first two-dimension of the logon (D)."}, {"heading": "III. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "We are now conducting a series of experiments that evaluate the effectiveness of using base certificate, partial certificate and joint projection with RRT and RRT * against different obstacle test times and team sizes. The working area used for all experiments appears in Figure 5, but note that the robots 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are colored blue, red, green, cyan and magenta. If an experiment is performed with a team size of R, robots with the number 1 \u2212 R are used and robots \u2265 R + 1 are removed from the working area. Figures 6 and 7 show the average proportion of points that require a collision test (over 20 attempts) for different team sizes (1 to 5 robots) vs. iteration number (1 to 105). Note that fractional values for partial certificates and shared projection are possible if only some of the robots require verification (over 20 attempts), while 7 have results with RT age 104."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In terms of the proportion of collision tests that are avoided, the Basic Certificate suffers from a curse of dimensionality that limits its usefulness for team sizes greater than 2 (Figure 6). Shared Projection offers significant runtime reductions for all team sizes and difficulty levels (Figure 8); however, there is ultimately a graph size for which the use of certificates becomes more expensive than a traditional collision test. We note that a similar result was observed for the stand-alone robot version of this work, but the overlap point was orders of magnitude higher. We believe that in Shared Projection this occurs due to the fact that R nodes need to be added to the secondary KD tree periteration earlier. In practice, this can be resolved by switching to standard collision testing when the size of the KD tree requires the use of certificates (e.g. going back to the KD tree periteration)."}], "references": [{"title": "Efficient collision checking in sampling-based motion planning", "author": ["J.
