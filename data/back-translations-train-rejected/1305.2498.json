Unlike traditional techniques such as the Mini Max Method (which, by the way, failed for \"Go\"), the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCT) is based on performing simulated self-games, known as \"rollouts\" until the end of the game, when a terminal state has been encountered with a known benefit. A position in a game is represented by a state action pair ~ s = (s, ~ \u03b1), where ~ \u03b1 = (\u03b11, \u03b12,.) is the collection of actions (or movements) available in a position, with the aim of assessing actions through redistribution and aversion. Much effort in current research is devoted to expanding the applicability of the method."}, {"heading": "2 Mathematical Framework and Notation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Set Cover of the State Space", "text": "In practice, of course, it is so that these are O-similar states and that they are O-similar states and that the states O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-"}, {"heading": "2.2 Rollouts and Recombination Operators", "text": "For technical reasons, which will later become apparent that we need them for different purposes, it is also possible that we use them for different purposes (although we assume that they are also required for different purposes).
