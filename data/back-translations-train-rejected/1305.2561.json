Many of these applications require complex models and constituent rules in order to come up with decisions that influence the operation of entire systems. In this paper, we motivate the novel \"strategic planning\" problem -- one of gathering data from the world and applying the underlying model of the domain in order to come up with decisions that will monitor the system in an automated manner. We describe our use of automated planning methods to this problem, including the technique that we used to solve it in a manner that would scale to the demands of a real-time, real world scenario. We then present a PDDL model of one such application scenario related to network administration and monitoring, followed by a description of a novel integrated system that was built to accept generated plans and to continue the execution process. Finally, we present evaluations of two different automated planners and their different capabilities with our integrated system, both on a six-month window of network data, and using a simulator.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 12 May 2013 05:52:08 GMT  (950kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2561v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kartik talamadupula", "octavian udrea", "anton riabov", "anand ranganathan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.2561"}, "pdf": {"name": "1305.2561.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Anand Ranganathan"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 130 5.25 61v1 [cs.AI] 12 May 201 3"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive themselves, to survive themselves and to survive themselves, have to put themselves and themselves in the way.

These rules are usually applied using information obtained from domain experts, and are applied to data collected from the world to come to conclusions. However, such rules do not include the concept of optimization when it comes to choosing those to apply. Given a particular state of the world, any rules that may be applied will catch fire, regardless of whether this application is advantageous for the problem objectives and metrics. Inference rules are also cumbersome to specify, and difficult to obtain. Due to the nature of the inference process, any new rule that is added to the base must be checked for consistency; this means that it will be evaluated against all rules that are currently part of the rule base, and ensure that the introduction of this new rule does not provoke an objection."}, {"heading": "3.1 PDDL Modeling", "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "4.1 Automated Planner", "text": "This means that we will be able to find a solution that we can deal with.
