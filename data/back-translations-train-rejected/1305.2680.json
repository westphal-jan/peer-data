VOT can be utilized by the human auditory system to distinguish between voiced and unvoiced stops such as /p/ and /b/ in English.This search focuses on computing and analyzing VOT of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), within the Arabic language, for all pairs of non-emphatic (namely, /d/ and /t/) and emphatic pairs (namely, /d?/ and /t?/) depending on carrier words. This research uses a database built by ourselves, and uses the carrier words syllable structure: CV-CV-CV. One of the main outcomes always found is the emphatic sounds (/d?/, /t?/) are less than 50% of non-emphatic (counter-part) sounds ( /d/, /t/).Also, VOT can be used to classify or detect for a dialect ina language.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 May 2013 06:38:34 GMT  (557kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2680v1", "18 pages, Signal &amp; Image Processing:An International Journal (SIPIJ), 2013 April"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, Signal &amp; Image Processing:An International Journal (SIPIJ), 2013 April", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SD", "authors": ["sulaiman s aldahri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.2680"}, "pdf": {"name": "1305.2680.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A STUDY FOR THE EFFECT OF THE EMPHATICNESS AND LANGUAGE AND DIALECT FOR VOICE ONSET TIME (VOT) IN MODERN STANDARD ARABIC (MSA)", "authors": ["Sulaiman S.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "1.1. Voice Onset Time", "text": "VOT is a key feature used to distinguish between vocal pitches and voiceless registers. Phonation start, or VOT, is defined as the length of time (period) between the beginning of intonation impulses and the release of the primary vocal tract closure, as shown in Figure 1.1. VOT, as we have just described it, is only relevant for stop consonants [1]. This period is usually measured in milliseconds. Stop consonants are produced with a closure of the vocal tract at a specific location known as the site of articulation [3]. There are three types of VOT. There are zero VOT, positive VOT and negative VOT. VOT means that the beginning of VOT vibration of the vocal folding (approximately) coincides with the explosive release. Positive VOT means that there is a delay in VOT vibration."}, {"heading": "1.2.

Arabic language Overview", "text": "Arabic is a Semitic language, and it is one of the oldest languages in the world. Currently, it is the second language in terms of the number of speakers [18]. Arabic is the first language in the Arab world, i.e., Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Yemen, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, etc. Arabic alphabets are used in several languages, such as Persian and Urdu. The MSA consists of 34 sounds: 28 consonants and 6 vowels [19]. It has three long vowels (/ i: /, / u: /) and three short vowels (/ i /, / a /, / u /), while American English has twelve vowels [20]. The Arabic language has fewer vowels than the English language. However, the sound is the smallest element of a language unit that indicates a difference in meaning, word or sentence."}, {"heading": "1.4. Emphatic Consonants in MSA Arabic", "text": "In the case of Semitic languages, the emphasis is on a phonetic characteristic that characterizes a consonant. There are four emphatic phonemes in MSA Arabic, as in Table 1. Also, some researchers [19] [23] have added / l? / phonemes to emphatic phonemes in word / pronunciation alla: h /. An interesting fact about Arabic is that it is the only language that contains the emphatic phoneme \"dhaad\" / d? / and therefore Arabic is alternatively called the \"dhaad language\" because of its uniqueness. [24] An emphatic phoneme that / d? / is / or? /. Some people nowadays, including some native speakers, have a certain confusion in the appearance and recognition of these two phonemes. This factor adds a greater complexity to the machine-assisted recognition, synthesis and manipulation of the Arabic language, because if people have difficulty in dealing with these phonemes, there will be some confusion in recognizing and recognizing these two phonemes."}, {"heading": "2. EXPERIMENTAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "The group of register tones in the Arabic language consists of eight sounds, and we can divide them into: emphatic and non-emphatic or intoned and non-intonated [26].

Used Speech Corpus", "text": "As a basic step in this work, our search depends on a corpus of words built with the seven targeted phonemes. These supporting words used in our search are clear, as we see in Table 3. This corpus was created in seven weeks. Providing a high-quality corpus saves time and effort for researchers who will perform similar work. As the corpus is very important to ensure the quality of the result, great attention is paid to ensuring the quality of the speaker's pronunciation skills and recording clear text. Speakers who participate in this corpus are carefully selected to ensure the quality of expression required for this work. The best Arabs who can pronounce unique MSA sounds correctly are those who know the Sacred Corpus (THQ). Therefore, the speakers we have chosen for this corpus should not have any confusion in pronunciation.Among the Arabic speakers who can pronounce unique MSA sounds correctly, speaking is not guaranteed by THQ."}, {"heading": "2.2.

The fourth digit \"z\" is a binary flag set to 0 for non-emphatic and 1 for emphatic. The last digit \"w\" is a single digit number representing the trial number."}, {"heading": "2.3. Methodology", "text": "In order to achieve our goals, the research of our experiment mainly depends on the extraction of VOT values of the Emphatic and Non-Emphatic Phonemes in Arabic MSA registers. Our analysis was performed using Wavesurfer tools [27] and spectrogram values. We used signal energy and vibration information of the vocal cords (i.e. basic frequency) to locate the beginning of stop release, closure and intonation. In both cases, we found positive VOT in Wavesurfer signal analyses and in our own developed spectrograms. Voicing onset (i.e. the beginning of vocal band vibration) can initially be observed by observing low frequency periodicity in the wide-band spectrograms, which can be considered vertical lines."}, {"heading": "3.

The / d / VOT values range from 14 to 22 milliseconds and / d? / VOT ranges from 9 to 14 milliseconds. On the other hand, the / t / VOT values range from 32 to 71 milliseconds and / t? / VOT ranges from 13 to 25 milliseconds."}, {"heading": "3.4. A comparison between MSA Arabic with other dialects of Arabic and other languages", "text": "Before this section we discussed the comparison of some stop sounds (/ b / and / k /) with some Arabic dialects and other languages. In this section we will give more details by comparing 14 languages and 5 Arabic dialects, as we see in Table 8, where (N / A) means that this sound is not found in this language and (* *) means that this sound has no calculated VOT value. We observed that the spoken stop sounds in all Arabic dialects are positive VOT values except the Lebanese dialect. Depending on Lisker et al. [1] we found that MSA Arabic and CA Arabic in spoken sounds have short VOT, while unspoken sounds have long VOT. Also, as we know from previous researchers, the / d? /, / t? and / q / sounds are only found in the Arabic language."}, {"heading": "3.5. Studying the dialect effect in MSA Arabic", "text": "In this section, we will examine the effects of some different Arabic MSA dialects on the VOT values. To investigate this, we selected loudspeaker samples as we see them in Table 10. Furthermore, we have specified the qualification as memorization of all Quran chapters and gender as male for these loudspeakers. Information about these loudspeakers is also clear in the following table. From the table, these loudspeakers come from three regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Loudspeakers 1 and 2 are from the region of AlQassem (north of the Kingdom) and speakers 15 and 19 from the region of Jazan (south of the Kingdom) and speakers 6 and 21 from the region of Sader Sader Sader (centre of the Kingdom). We found the range of the VOT value in the region of AlQassem, for / d / is between 17 and 22 milliseconds, for / d? /, for 9 to 16 milliseconds, for / t / 63 milliseconds, and for / t? t / t, between 15 milliseconds and 24 milliseconds."}, {"heading": "3.6. Boundary voiced and unvoiced stop sounds in MSA Arabic", "text": "After all these results, and also depending on previous studies [1] [4], we know that the main goal in measuring VOT is to make a distinction between spoken stop tone and unspoken stop tone. In this section, we focus on the boundary for both classes in the Arabic language MSA. Prior to this section, we know that the Arabic language MSA has positive VOT values. Furthermore, we found that the category MSA Arabic by Lisker et al. [1] spoken sounds have short VOT while unspoken sounds have long VOT. To know the boundary for both classes, we chose a group of loudspeakers such as we found in Table 9. We extracted the boundary from this table, as we see in Figure 5. We found that the boundary average for spoken stop tones is between 11 milliseconds and 15 milliseconds, and unspoken stop tones between 25 milliseconds and 36 milliseconds in the Arabic language MOT."}, {"heading": "4.

many different features, including Voice Onset Time (VOT), which is a very important feature of stop sounds in many languages. The only application of VOT values is stopping phoneme subsets. This subset of consonant sounds is stop phonemes exist in the Arabic language, and in fact, all languages. Very important subsets of Semitic language\u2019s consonants are the Emphatic sounds. The pronunciation of these sounds is hard and unique especially for less-educated Arabs and non-native Arabic speakers. In the Arabic language, all emphatic sounds have their own non-emphatic counterparts that differ only in the \u201cemphaticness\u201d based on written letters. VOT can be utilized by the human auditory system to distinguish between voiced and unvoiced stops such as /p/ and /b/ in English. Similarly, VOT can be adopted by digital systems to classify and recognize stop sounds and their carried syllables for words of any language. In addition, an analysis of any language\u2019s phoneme set is very important in order to identify the features of digital speech and language for automatic recognition, synthesis, processing, and communication. The main reason to choose this subject is that there is not enough research that analyzes the Arabic language. Also, this subject is new because it will analyze Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and other Arabic dialects. This search focuses on computing and analyzing VOT of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), within the Arabic language, for all pairs of non-emphatic (namely, /d/ and /t/) and emphatic pairs (namely, /d ? / and /t ? /) depending on carrier words. This research uses a database built by ourselves, and uses the carrier words syllable structure: CVCV-CV. One of the main outcomes always found is the emphatic sounds (/d ? /, /t ? /) are less than 50% of non-emphatic (counter-part) sounds ( /d/, /t/).Also, VOT can be used to classify or detect for a dialect ina language.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}}
