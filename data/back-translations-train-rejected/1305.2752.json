NEUTRALIZATION PILOT PLANT ARCHITECTURE", "text": "The architectural diagram of the neutralization pilot plant is shown in Fig. 2. This plant is assembled with state-of-the-art industrial instruments and measuring systems. This pilot plant consists of three tanks; VE210 is the alkaline tank, VE200 is the acid tank and VE220 is the mixing tank. P210 and P200 are the pumps used to get the desired amount of acid and base into the mixing tank. FT 210 and FT 200 are the flow motors. The job of the flow motors is to transmit the precisely measured amount of acid and base or to the central computer system. Two control valves CV210 and CV200 are connected to the alkaline and acid pipelines or to the control of the flow of acid and base entering the mixing tank. These control valves are fully digital and are operated by electrical signals. The mixing tank contains a continuous solution holding the mixing tank at the same level as the control tank."}, {"heading": "4.

F1 is the flow rate of acid and F2 is the flow rate of alkaline tank. C1 is the concentration of acid and C2 the concentration of alkaline current. The mathematical equation for the mixing tank can be defined as the rate of accumulation of non-reactive types (within the elemental volume)."}, {"heading": "5. PROPORTIONAL INTEGRAL DERIVATIVE (PID) FLOW-RATE CONTROL DESIGN", "text": "The characteristics for the flow rates of acid and alkaline valves are shown in Fig. 6. It is obvious that the flow control for up- (opening the valve) and downscaling (closing the valve) is not the same. The error varies from 2% to 6%. The PID controller is designed and tuned to capture these variations [3]. Firstly, the proportional gain is set to a minimum value and the other parameters integral and derived terms are adjusted so that it does not show any effect. Then, the proportional gain is gradually increased until oscillations occur in the measured closed circuit reaction of the system. Subsequently, the gain is adjusted so that the oscillations maintain constant amplitude. The value of the integral gain to achieve this state is referred to as the ultimate proportional gain with value (G = 18) over the period (P = 33). Based on Table 2, the proportional gain is derived from 10.8 Kp = 4.5 and the integral gain is derived from Ki = 4.5."}, {"heading": "6. FUZZY LOGIC CONTROLLER DESIGN", "text": "Fuzzy logic controller essentially consists of three parts: (i) Fuzzification: process of converting system inputs (process variables) into classes of membership for linguistic fuzzy sets, (ii) Fuzzy interference: mapping input room into the output room with member functions, logic operations and if-then rule statements, and (iii) Defuzzification: process of producing quantifiable results (control valve inputs for PID controllers) in the light of the given fuzzy sets and membership degree. The overall performance of the fuzzy logic controller depends on the selection of the membership function of the input and output sets. The target value of the desired value is entered manually, while other process control variables are automatically based on the information (feedback) from the plant output logic controller depends on the selection of the input function."}, {"heading": "7. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "The first experiment will be performed to examine the total performance of the hybrid fuzzy logic and the PID controller with the introduction of a static setpoint (value = 7).In this experiment, 0.052M of H2SO4 will be mixed with 0.052M of NaOH. These are the typical values for this type of system. Two stage changes will be made, firstly at the value of 7 and secondly at the value of 10. This experiment is useful in determining the rise time (how long will it take for the output to follow the desired input) and the total response time of the system.The second experiment will be performed to examine the robustness (to determine whether the output of the system is able to track the input or not) of the hybrid fuzzy logic and the PID controller. In this experiment, different setpoints will be introduced at different time steps in the form of a square wave. The amplitude of the shaft is set to 1.5 and the period is configured to 600 sec."}, {"heading": "8. RESULTS", "text": "Fig. 10 shows the results of the first experiment. First, the value is set to 7. In time step 300 sec, the input of the system changes to = 10. In time step 380 sec, the input follows = 10. However, the output is delayed because the flow rate of the PID controller depends on the mechanical flow valves of the acid and base currents. In time step 600 sec, the input falls to = 7, but the output value begins to decrease at 610 sec and settles at 660 sec to = 7. Ascent and descent time delays of the system differ because the control valve has different rise and fall times.Fig. 11 shows the result of the second experiment. The output of the system follows the input square wave, which indicates the robustness of the controller. If the input value differs from 7 to 10, the output follows the input and fall times.Fig. 11 shows the result of the second experiment. The output of the system follows the input wave, the robustness of the controller."}, {"heading": "9. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS", "text": "This paper represents a hybrid control (PID and fuzzy-logic controller) for neutralization pilot plant. It covers the entire operating range and is more robust against variation of the uncertainty value. It is noted that the proposed hybrid controller is more stable than the fuzzy-logic controller. The process modeling approach applied in this paper is based on physico-chemical principles and basic laws. A conventional mathematical modeling process is included. Practical tests are performed on the actual system to estimate manipulative variables not known before the experiments. The design methodology presented in this paper (derivation of dynamic nonlinear equations) is generally applicable to a neutralization plant based on a continuous steering reactor. The robustness of the hybrid controller depends on the process variables, i.e. acid flow / base flow controllers, and can be used as a manipulator in the process controller, i.e., during the flow rate / base flow meter."}, {"heading": "10.
