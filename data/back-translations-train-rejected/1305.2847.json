Moreover, 70% of the Indian population live in rural areas, making it even more important for them to have a language application built in their native tongue. [2] India is going through the phase of the computer revolution, so it is time for speech recognition technology to be developed for Indian languages. Speech recognition systems refer to the ability to hear (typed into audio), identify spoken words and identify different sounds."}, {"heading": "1.1 Existing System", "text": "Although some promising solutions for speech synthesis and speech recognition are available, most are aligned in English. Tirunelveli-Tamil Nadu, PIN-627 012, INDIA The acoustic and linguistic model for these systems is for the English language. Most of them require a lot of configuration before they can be used. There are also projects that have tried to adapt it to Hindi or other Indian languages. Explains how an acoustic model can be created using an existing acoustic model for English [3]. SIP [4] and Sphinx [5] are two of the well-known speech recognition software in open source. A comparison of public domain speech recognition software tools [6].Some commercial software such as IBM's Via Voice is also available."}, {"heading": "2 How Speech is produced?", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "3.2 Feature Extraction", "text": "Most of them are able to abide by the rules they have imposed on themselves.

A language model contains the structural constraints that exist in the language to generate the probabilities. Although there are words that have similar-sounding phones, people generally do not find it difficult to recognize the word. This is mainly because they know the context and also have a pretty good idea of what words or phrases may occur in the context. Providing this context to a speech recognition system is the purpose of the language model. The language model determines what the valid words are in the language and in what order they may occur. In general, small tasks with limited vocabulary such as telephone dialing can be modeled using a grammatical approach, where such large applications as transmitting messages require a stochastic approach."}, {"heading": "4.

Here, time and frequency are plotted along the x or y axis. Amplitude at a given frequency and at a given time is indicated by the darkness of the corresponding languages. Dark areas of the spectrogram indicate a phantomatics. Samped segments are much louder than unspoken."}, {"heading": "6.
