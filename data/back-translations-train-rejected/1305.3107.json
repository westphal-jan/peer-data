Twitter prohibits the distribution of raw tweets, and its terms of service insist that any tweet collection must take into account posthoc deletion requests, meaning that at any time in the future, a user can request Twitter to delete a tweet. Predicting when a tweet is likely to be withdrawn by a user has important applications: \u2022 Security. Twitter has become so ubiquitous that users often do not consider the potential confidentiality implications before tweeting. \u2022 Regret. Users may post an inappropriate or offensive tweet in the heat of the moment that they regret it later when the results are deleted."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Predicting deleted messages has already been dealt with in the context of messages (Dabbish et al., 2003; Dabbish et al., 2005). For example, it was found (Dabbish et al., 2003) that the most important factors influencing the likelihood of deletion of an email is past communication between the two parties and the number of recipients of the email. However, it should be clear that people use tweets in very different ways than email. The most similar work to ours is the recent analysis of censorship in Chinese social media (Bamman et al., 2012), where the problem studied is that the government deletes posts on the Chinese social media site Sina Weibo (Chinese equivalent of Twitter). Authors analyze different terms suggesting that a tweet will be deleted and the difference between the appearance of certain political terms on Twitter and on Sina Weibo. However, they make no attempt to predict what will be deleted, and only briefly delete deleted messages in Twitter."}, {"heading": "3 Task Description", "text": "There are several ways in which a tweet can be deleted, the most obvious being if the author explicitly deletes it (this is usually done by clicking the delete button that is available in most Twitter clients); another way in which a tweet is effectively deleted is if a user decides to protect his tweets. Although the user's tweets are still legible to his friends, no one has access to them anymore (unless the user decides to make them public again); eventually, the entire user account could be deleted (either at their own discretion or via Twitter), meaning that all of his tweets will also be deleted. In the public streaming API, Twitter does not differentiate between these different scenarios, so we will break them all down into a single task: predict for each tweet whether it will be deleted by one of the above-mentioned ways. 1These results have also been confirmed (Tschang, 2012)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Example Deleted Tweets", "text": "Table 1 shows some examples of the different types of deleted tweets we have discussed (identifiable information has been replaced with * * *). Although we can never be sure why someone deletes a tweet, the reason is often fairly obvious. Tweet 1, for example, was most likely deleted because the author regretted posting it because of its somewhat inappropriate content. Tweet 2, on the other hand, was most likely posted by a spammer and was deleted when the author's account was deleted. Tweet 3 is probably an example of deleting a tweet for privacy reasons - the author posted his email publicly, making it an easy target for spammers. The fourth tweet is an example of a deleted tweet written by a Canadian politician (obtained from the politwitter.ca / page / deleted website). Finally, Tweet 5 is an example of a false rumor on Twitter. This tweet was retweeted many times immediately after it was posted, but once it became clear that the message was not true, many users deleted it."}, {"heading": "4 Predicting when Tweets will be Deleted", "text": "We now show the extent to which the deletion of tweets can be predicted automatically."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data", "text": "We use tweets collected in January 2012 from Twitter's Streaming API. This data consists of 75 million tweets, divided into a training set of 68 million tweets and a test set of about 7.5 million more recent tweets (roughly equivalent to tweets written during the last three days of January 2012). A tweet is labeled 1, meaning it was deleted if the news of its deletion appeared in the Streaming API by February 29, 2012. Otherwise, we assume that the tweet was not deleted. In total, 2.4 million tweets in our data set were deleted before the end of February."}, {"heading": "4.2 Features", "text": "We use the following characteristics for this task: \u2022 Social characteristics: number of friends, followers, status (total number of tweets written by a user), number of lists in which the user is included, the tweet is a retweet, the tweet is a response. In addition, we include the number of hashtags, mentions and links in the tweet under social characteristics, even if they are not strictly \"social.\" We do this because these characteristics are dense and therefore much more similar to other dense characteristics (the \"real\" social characteristics) than to omit characteristics such as author and text characteristics. \u2022 Author characteristics: user identification, \u2022 Text characteristics: all words in the tweet. Due to the user IDs and lexical characteristics, the characteristics we use are quite large. In total, we have over 47 million characteristics where 18 million characteristics are user IDs, and the rest are lexical characteristics (social characteristics make up only about a dozen characteristics)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Learning Algorithm", "text": "In all our experiments, we use a support vector machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) implemented in Liblinear (Fan et al., 2008). We note that SVMs are generally considered very effective for a wide range of problems, but are not well suited for large streaming problems. A potential limitation is the fact that they require batch training, which can be prohibitive both in terms of space and time when dealing with large data sets. For this reason, we have also investigated the use of the passive-aggressive (PA) algorithm (Crammer et al., 2006), an efficient online method with maximum margin for forming a linear classifier. Therefore, we also present results for PA as an alternative for cases where the data is simply too large to train an SVM."}, {"heading": "4.4 Results", "text": "We formulate predicting deletions as a binary classification task - each tweet is labeled 0 (will not be deleted) or 1 (will be deleted). Since the two classes are not equally important, i.e. we are usually more interested in correctly predicting followers when something is deleted than correctly predicting when something is not deleted, we use the F1 score to measure performance. F1 Score is standard, for example in the information query, where one class (relevant documents) is more important than the others. Results are shown in Table 2, which is randomly assigned to one of the two labels assigned to each tweet, while the majority of Baseline always assigns a label (will be deleted) to each tweet. We can see from the absolute numbers that this is a tough task, with the best F1 score of only 27.0. This is not very surprising, as there are many different reasons why a tweet could be deleted."}, {"heading": "5 Why are tweets deleted?", "text": "One of the basic questions regarding deleted tweets is why are they deleted at all? Here, we try to answer these questions by looking at the following three questions: Is it the case that most of the deletion notices we see in the stream are there because users have deleted their accounts? Or is it the case that most of the deleted tweets tweets have been deleted? Here, Baseline # in TestsetFollowers Tweets contain tweets tweets significant followers < 1, 000 17.8 5.8 6.8M followers accounts that have deleted all other tweets whose accounts are deleted.

The third column shows our results for named groups. The last column shows the number of users in the test set who are deleted from tweets that come in each category of users, because they fall into each category of users, or because we are publishing them."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We proposed a new task: predicting which messages on Twitter will be deleted in the future. We presented an analysis of deleted messages on Twitter and gave insights into the various reasons why people delete tweets. To our knowledge, we are the first to do such an analysis. For example, our analysis showed that tweets containing swear words are more likely to be deleted. Finally, we presented a machine learning approach and showed that it can predict deleted messages for certain groups of users with very high accuracy."}], "references": [{"title": "Censorship and Deletion Practices in Chinese Social Media", "author": ["Bamman et al.2012] David Bamman", "Brendan O\u2019Connor", "Noah A.
