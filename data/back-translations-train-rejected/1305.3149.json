Introduction", "text": "It is a question of whether and to what extent the American economy is able to control the quality of the oil and the raw material. (...) In order to evaluate the quality of the oil and to recognize its adulteration, it is necessary to take a series of measures aimed at the adulteration of edible oils. (...) In order to evaluate the quality of the oil and its adulteration, a series of measures must be taken aimed at the adulteration of oil imports. (...) In order to evaluate the quality of oil imports, the number of adulterations of oil imports must be investigated. (...) It is a question of whether the dissemination of oil imports in the world of the world is at all possible. (...)

Data analysis", "text": "In our work, we apply three types of methods to analyze the oil samples in machine learning: First, we apply the classification method to distinguish the adulterated oil from the pure oil; second, we consider the pure oil as the sample with only one label and the adulterated oil as one with multiple labels; and then we revert to the multi-stage learning method, which can not only assess whether the oil is pure or adulterated, but also effectively detect the composite components of the adulterated oil. Finally, we use MLLVQ to forward analyze the relative ratio of the different components in the adulterated oil; and, as a reference, we also give the analysis results to the most advanced methods, including SVM and PCA, where SVM Burges (1998) constructs a hyperplane or a series of hyperplanes in high-dimensional space to maximize the margin."}, {"heading": "2.4.1. Adulteration detection with binary AdaBoost.MH", "text": "The classic AdaBoost.MH Schapire & Singer (1999) is introduced as follows: Consider a marked dataset D = {(xn, tn)} N = 1. We often use + 1 and -1 to label the oil sample as adulterated oil or pure oil.The following classification model builds by using a nonlinear function from the input data to the real number.By using the sign f (x) we can predict the unknown sample x as falsification if f (x) > 0 otherwise is pure oil.AdaBoost.MH 1 combines the final hypothesis by repeatedly invoking the weak learner in a series of rounds in a different data distribution. In each round, the weights of each wrongly classified example are increased and the weights of each correctly classified example are reduced, so that the next new classifier focuses on the previously correct examples."}, {"heading": "2.4.2. Detection of ingredients in non-pure oil with multi-label AdaBoost.MH", "text": "In the context of multi-label classification, we can consider the oil sample as an example with multiple labels. Thus, the pure oil and adulterated oil are provided with only one label or more than one label. In predicting the unknown oil sample, the multi-label classification algorithm can not only detect the components of the adulterated oil, but also detect the adulterated oil like the binary AdaBoost.MH in Section 2.4.1. We will introduce the multi-label algorithm Schapire & Singer (1999) below. Consider a labeled datasetD = (xn, tn) n = 1, where tn is the subset of L = {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7, L} instead of {+ 1, \u2212 1}. Successful multi-label learning will result in a ranking of possible labels to classify the results in the label1Schapire & Singer."}, {"heading": "2.4.3. Analysis of the relative ratio on components with ML-LVQ", "text": "It is worth noting that the multi-step labeling AdaBoost.MH can predict the components of the adulterated oil, but cannot effectively determine the relative ratio of the ingredient in the adulterated oil. For example, although we know that the adulterated oil consists of soybean oil and peanut oil, it is not clear whether the soybean oil in the peanut oil is adulterated or the peanut oil in the soybean oil is adulterated. ML-LVQ Jin et al. (2012) effectively considers the ranking problem when assigning multiple labels to the example. ML-LVQ extends LVQ to the problems with multiple labels where the minimal classification error on the labels can approximate the rank loss. ML-LVQ minimizes the upper limit of the ranking loss due to stochastic labeling. When the n-th training example is given in the prediction metry, two prototypes from the positive class for the respective label are selected."}, {"heading": "3. Results and Discussion", "text": "For 370 oil samples, the benchmarks of all algorithms in the oil data set were determined by 10 runs of 5-fold cross-validation to avoid the randomness introduced by the data set partition. 1. For each run, the data set was randomly divided by layered samples into five subsets of approximately the same size. We maintained the same classifications for all learning algorithms. 2. Each of five subsets was used as a test set and the remaining data was used for the training. 5 subsets were used for the rotational tests to evaluate the performance of machine learning methods. 3. During each training process, the training parameters were determined as follows: First, we kept 1 / 3 of the training parameters ready for validation by layered samples, while the model parameters were estimated on the remaining 2 / 3 of the data (the distribution of training data is the same for all learning algorithms). After selecting training parameters, the training parameters that provide the highest accuracy for each training dial were used."}, {"heading": "3.1. Overview of HPLC spectra of edible oil", "text": "Fig. 1 shows the chromatographic data of two types of pure oil and their mixture. There is a lot of overlap between these samples except for a small difference in the web tip. The similarity of the spectra makes detection with the craft characteristics so difficult, and then we resort to machine learning techniques to detect the difference."}, {"heading": "3.2. Evaluation Measures", "text": "Accuracy is a widely used measure used in the classification algorithm to evaluate performance. In terms of evaluating multi-label algorithms, we use both the dichotomy and the ranking Tsoumakas et al. (2010) with respect to the accuracy of data from multiple labels. The dichotomy measures the average difference between the actual and the predicted set of labels, including the macro averaging and the microaverage of F1 (mac-F1 and mic-F1). The ranking measures the average difference between the true ranking and the predicted ranking, including the error and the average accuracy (avg-prec). We also specify the accuracy measurement to contrast with previous binary classification problems. Finally, we supply the detectrate (detectrate) to evaluate the predicted set of labels or not."}, {"heading": "3.3.

Conclusions", "text": "The HPLC data of the cooking oil with its mixture were examined to answer the following questions: Is the oil sample adulterated? How is it composed? What is the main component of the adulterated oil? In our study, we used the practical AdaBoost.MH to determine that the oil sample is adulterated or not in order to achieve a higher accuracy than the state of the art SVM. Furthermore, AdaBoost.MH with PCA does not show the better performance than one without pre-processing, as PCA cannot guarantee class separation in terms of characteristics. Finally, we used the multi-label AdaBoost.MH and ML-LVQ to identify the ingredient and its ratio in the intake of the adulterated oil and the pure oil as examples with multiple labels or labels. Finally, the comparisons between the multi-label methods AdaBoost.MH and MLVQ for the quantification of these ingredients show that MLVQ is the least suitable in our 2008 detection method (also MLVL-promising)."}, {"heading": "5.
