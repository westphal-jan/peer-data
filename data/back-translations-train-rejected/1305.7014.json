The package is written in R-Long Eye and uses matching R-Packages. The model of tweets has been considered. We have also compared stock exchange charts with frequent keywords in Twitter microblogs.

(This characteristic determines the availability of the study of microblogs through the use of data mining to identify semantic relationships between the main concepts and topics of discussion in microblogs.) Very promising is the analysis of the predictive ability of time dependencies of the main quantitative characteristics of thematic concepts in Twitter microblogs \"messages. The peculiarities of social networks and user behavior are explored in many studies. (1) Microblogging phenomena have been investigated. The influence of users on Twitter has been analyzed in social networks. (3) In [4] the methods of opinion formation of Twitter corpus have been analyzed. Several papers are devoted to the analysis of possible predictions of events in microblogs."}], "references": [{"title": "What is Twitter, a social network or a news media", "author": ["H. Kwak", "C.
