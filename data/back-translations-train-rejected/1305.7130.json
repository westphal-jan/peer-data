It is a vital component of the way in which we as human beings operate on a day to day basis. Given a particular situation, decisions are made and actions undertaken in response to that situation based on our memory of related prior events and experiences. By utilising our memory we can anticipate the outcome of our chosen actions to avoid unexpected or unwanted events. In addition, as we subtly alter our actions and recognise altered outcomes we learn and create new memories, enabling us to improve the efficiency of our actions over time. However, as this process occurs so naturally in the subconscious its importance is often overlooked.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 May 2013 15:05:10 GMT  (257kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7130v1", "University of Nottingham, 2005"]], "COMMENTS": "University of Nottingham, 2005", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["william wilson", "uwe aickelin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.7130"}, "pdf": {"name": "1305.7130.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Memory Implementations - Current Alternatives", "authors": ["William Wilson", "Uwe Aickelin"], "emails": ["wow@cs.nott.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people are able to save themselves if they cannot save themselves.

The system is then able to use this generalized signature as a starting point and look around the local design space of this starting point to detect mutations in a specific signature. In this way, the system does not have to remember every single signature variation, but rather a generalized abstraction of it. The system has the ability to associate a novel signature with one of its existing storage elements."}, {"heading": "2.

However, in most cases, an expert is not immediately available. To solve this matter, \"expert systems are constructed by obtaining this knowledge from a human expert and encoding it in a form that a computer can apply to similar problems.\" [22] This knowledge is then summarized in a number of facts and these facts are used to create a set of \"if-then\" rules, which can then be taken and examined in the context of the rules created; a non-expert would be expected to receive the same diagnosis as the expert by identifying the rules that are fulfilled by the scenario. In the context of an IDS, a computer virus expert could identify the facts associated with a particular electronic virus. These facts could be used to create a set of rules that could diagnose such a virus from a pre-conceived scenario."}, {"heading": "3.
