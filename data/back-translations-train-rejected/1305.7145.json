Another related issue is improving security throughout the supply chain, i.e. achieving supply chain integrity (Loss and McGarrell 2004), where simulation modeling is widely used to analyze the system. Thus, Sekine et al (2006) use the reaction area method for a trade-off analysis of port security to design a number of Pareto optimal solutions."}, {"heading": "3 RESEARCH CHALLENGES", "text": "We have divided our research questions into two categories, one that focuses on simulator development and one that focuses on DRM development. Research questions related to the simulator: [a] What limits of the system need to be modeled? [d] How can we get a good estimate of how many flocks, weapons or drugs cross the borders? [c] How should we model the people in our system (e.g. officials or blind passengers) - as simple resources or as autonomous units? [d] How can we get a good estimate of how many flocks, weapons or drugs cross the borders? Especially the last question will be quite difficult to answer."}, {"heading": "4 DEVELOPMENT OUTLINE FOR THE DETECTION RATE MATRIX", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want to do."}, {"heading": "5 CASE STUDY #1", "text": "For our first case study, we selected the ferry port in Calais (France), which connects Calais to Dover (UK). This page is ideal to start our study because the existing security measures focus only on identifying a threat, illegal immigrant or illegal immigrant, as they are called by the UK Border Force. Clandestines are people found on a lorry trying to get into the UK without a passport or other papers, which can be individuals or groups. Clandestines come in the hope of a better future in the UK, the lack of national identity cards and the possibility of illegal work. If clandestines are found with little or no publicity, it perpetuates the misconception that clandestines are always successful. On the other hand, for every successful clandestine arrival in the UK, the word is found that the process is successful, which seems to generate even more attempts at illegal immigration (Brown 1995). In 2003, the UK moved its border controls to Calais and worked in the port area to stop people from entering the UK."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "As we are only at the beginning of our project, we hope that the workshop will give us additional ideas on how to estimate the missing data and how to better understand the current situation and the impact of future investments through simulation. So far, we have developed an initial model of the freight screening process of our case study system using AnyLogic 6 and its corporate library.In the future, we plan to implement some scenarios for attackers, taking into account the evolution of the strategies of defenders and attackers over time, without having to focus on the process and focus on the behavior of the actors. As DES usually models people as resources, it is not well suited for this task. ABS is commonly used to model such scenarios."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This project is supported by EPSRC grant number EP / G004234 / 1 and the UK Border Agency."}], "references": [{"title": "Human Occupancy Detection", "author": ["D.A.

Another research field that might provide some useful ideas in this instance is Risk Analysis, which also looks at rare events. In particular aspects of normal accident theory or high reliability theory might be useful (Sagan 1993). In our research we attempt to identify and test innovative methods in order to advance the use of simulation for supporting decision making at the strategic and the operational level of the cargo screening process. Wilson (2005) confirms the usefulness of simulation for this and states that \u201cSimulation modeling allows the analysis or prediction of operational effectiveness, efficiency, and detection rates (performance) of existing or proposed security systems under different configurations or operating policies before the existing systems are actually changed or a new system is built, eliminating the risk of unforeseen bottlenecks, underor over-utilization of resources, or failure to meet specified security system requirements.", "startOffset": 111, "endOffset": 594}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "With regards to the DRM development a report has been found during the literature review that describes the development of such a matrix on an experimental basis (Klock 2005).", "startOffset": 162, "endOffset": 174}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "Leone and Liu 2005; Wilson 2005) have been found that use simulation modeling to evaluate key design parameters for checked baggage security screening systems in airports, in order to balance equipment cost, passenger and baggage demand, screening capacity, and security effectiveness in an attempt to meet the requirements imposed by the checked baggage screening explosive detection deadline established by the US Aviation and Transportation Security Act.
