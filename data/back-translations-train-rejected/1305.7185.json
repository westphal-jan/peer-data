To this end, a protocol has been presented in the fourth (and most important) part of this article, which makes it possible to encourage people to gradually integrate their knowledge into a well-organized (formal or semi-formal) KB without having to agree on terminology or beliefs. As I said, it seems that all other knowledge-based cooperation protocols currently based on the comparison or integration of whole KB are not based on the comparison and lossless integration of all their objects into a KB. Other elements required for a cbwoKB-2 also implement the research results: expressive and normalizing notations, methodological guidance, a large general ontology, and an initial cbwoKB core for the application domain of the intended cbwoKB."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "This article first lists reasons why in the long term or when creating a new knowledge base (KB) for general knowledge sharing purposes collaboratively building a well-organized KB does/can provide more possibilities, with on the whole no more costs, than the mainstream approach where knowledge creation and re-use involves searching, merging and creating (semi-)independent (relatively small) ontologies or semi-formal documents.
