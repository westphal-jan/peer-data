REPRESENTING KNOWLEDGE", "text": "Most textual notations for KRLs are either relation / predicate-based, English-based, XML-based or HTML-attribute-based. < < < any kind of statement also means that these elements and relations are defined. < p: The more precisely these elements and relations are defined, the better. There are many types of knowledge representation languages (KRLs), with different logical models (and therefore expressions) and types of notations. Graphic notations are nice to look at, but not precise, are often poorly expressive, have no standard formats and their use is time-consuming. Thus, in the same way that graphical programming languages are difficult to use to develop large applications, graphic notations KRLs are difficult to use, but they are not precise."}, {"heading": "3.

EVALUATING KNOWLEDGE AND AUTHORS", "text": "The resulting argumentation structure is an organized multiple-point of view on an object (idea, method,...), something that is difficult to invent, even if you read many articles. Thanks to it, each person can make his own judgement on the basis of his goals and their associated limitations. Assessing a simple statement (with qualitative / quantitative values) according to one of the above criteria is somewhat arbitrary. Assessing a group of statements (formal or informal) is even more arbitrary. Combining the different rates given by one or more people is in turn more arbitrary and semantically meaningless, unless one group of statements is better than another."}, {"heading": "5. SUMMARY OF ADVANTAGES AND DRAWBACKS", "text": "It is as it is that it is a purely reactionary project, in which it is a reactionary project, a reactionary project, a reactionary project, a reactionary project, a reactionary project, a reactionary project, a reactionary project, a reactionary project, a reactionary project."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The current use of research articles - and peer reviews of them - as a principal means of diffusion and validation of research results is known to have many problems. This article identifies the main cause of these problems as the use and verification of entire informal documents, but only variations of the \"research results\" seem to have been discussed or tried out, for example, \"open access to articles\" (after a certain time, or directly if the authors pay for them)."}, {"heading": "7.
