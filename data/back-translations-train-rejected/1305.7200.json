It permits to compare these techniques and have a synthetic organized view of what can or should be done for knowledge sharing purposes. This ontology is part of a general knowledge base that can be accessed and complemented by any Web user. Thus, it can be seen as a cooperatively built library for the above cited elements. Since they permit to evaluate information objects and create better ones, these elements also permit knowledge-based tools and techniques - as well as knowledge providers - to be evaluated and categorized based on their input/output information objects. One top-level distinction permitting to organize this ontology is the one between content, medium and containers of descriptions. Various structural, ontological, syntactical and lexical distinctions are then used.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 May 2013 18:40:30 GMT  (138kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7200v1", "7 pages, 10 tables, conference"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 10 tables, conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["philippe a martin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.7200"}, "pdf": {"name": "1305.7200.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Organizing Linked Data Quality Related Methods", "authors": ["Philippe A.

The more \"presentation differs from content\" and the more structured (fine-grained) the content, the more the presentation can be customized for different types of users and by end users. To this end, the W3C advocates the use of XML-based languages (e.g. RDF / XML) as well as CSS, XSLT and GRDDL. This last language indicates which XSLT scripts can be used to translate some knowledge published in some XML-based KRLs into other knowledge presentation languages (KRLs). Fresnel [28] can be viewed as a kind of advanced CSS for RDF-based menus."}, {"heading": "4 Description container quality", "text": "Description container quality functions evaluate the way in which a particular description container - e.g. a PD file or a distributed KB server - modularizes, stores, retrieves and makes accessible (i.e., how it \"publishes,\" and ii), checks or queries the description objects. Compared to the independent and direct use of static files (e.g. RDF files), the use of knowledge servers facilitates modeling and reduces the implicit inconsistencies and redundancies between their knowledge statements. A KB server can also use static input / output files and offers much more flexibility than static files. It can also offer more services than those of a description container (e.g. it can reduce the implicit inconsistencies and redundancies between its knowledge statements. A KB server can also use static input / output files and offers more flexibility than static files."}, {"heading": "5 Some other categorizations", "text": "In order to show how these knowledge criteria / quality ontology expand, generalize, and organize the elements of their sources, Figure 9 shows the structure of the four most organized sources that previously seemed to exist for linked data, although they are essentially only two levels deep. \"SF:\" is for [21], \"Kahn\" is for [19], \"LDpattern:\" is for [18], and \"OPD:\" is for [17] (this last source has three 3-level low categories and one 4-level low category). The first two sources deal with quality criteria, the last two of best practices. Their categories - the ones shown below - appear to be concept types. To allow maximum integration of the various sources, they have been integrated into this quality ontology via function types, as illustrated by the previous indented lists. From these function hierarchies, the concept types of OPD substances can be generated. In the following lists of 9 substances, without the substances being pre-selected within their lowest categories, most are given."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "This article presents the top level of an ontology that organizes the exchange of knowledge about best practices, design patterns, evaluation criteria, and benchmarks in a systematic, non-redundant, and scalable manner (e.g., by relying on differences over information objects and not on processes).Some other research on this topic mainly includes proposed lists of categories with, sometimes, some implementations (e.g., through SPARQL).The integration of these categories into this quality ontology shows that the results of this work cover only specific cases that could sometimes be easily generalized, and this ontology also allows a more synthetic view of things that can be evaluated or performed during knowledge exchange, or suggested by knowledge engineering tools.This ontology can be expanded by web users via the server on which it is hosted [29] and could then be used as an index for elements of other libraries or ontologies. To this end, the more useful it becomes."}, {"heading": "7 References", "text": "[1] A. Palma, P. Haase, Y. Wang, M. d'Aquin. \"D1.3.1propagation models and strategies.\" NeOn deliv. D1.3.1, 2007.
