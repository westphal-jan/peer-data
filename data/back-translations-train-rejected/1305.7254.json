HARMONY SEARCH", "text": "The harmony search algorithm is designed to mimic the behavior of the musician.

Musical harmony is improved after practicing based on the pitches played by each instrument. Also, the fitness function is improved by iteration, making derived information unnecessary. Figure 3 shows this analogy. HS does not require initial values for decision variables. In addition, it uses a stochastic random search based on harmony memory rate and pitch adjustment rate.

Based on these results, it is clear that the number of container types is important, the execution time and worse is the fitness value.

COMPARATIVE STUDY", "text": "The LIFO algorithm consists of storing the last container placed in a stack for the first time, and this principle is applied in most port container terminals, where manual planning is carried out based on experience and rules for allocating each container to a particular storage block. Ayachi et al., [1] proposed the genetic algorithm to solve the same problem (SSAP for multiple container types), which can be described as follows: First, a first generation is randomly generated, followed by a two-point crossover operator with two parents selected using the roulette wheel method, and the mutation operator consists of the permutation of two randomly selected container types of the same type. Five cases studied are defined by varying the container numbers and types to verify the performance of the three approaches."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSION", "text": "In the real case, there are different types of containers such as refrigerated containers, open side, empty, dry, open top, tank... Each type of container has limitations on the allocation of storage space, which complicates the problem, i.e., refrigerated containers must be assigned to blocks equipped with the power supply, tank containers must be placed on top of each other, etc. Despite this difficulty, the proposed approach led to good results in a reasonable execution time. Experimental studies confirm this and show the effectiveness of applying the search for harmony in solving this problem. An important extension of this research would be to formulate the problem as dynamic storage space allocation in order to solve it and decide in real time."}, {"heading": "9.
