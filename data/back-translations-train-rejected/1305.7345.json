Qualitative relationships serve to explicate knowledge relevant to a task while at the same time abstracting from irrelevant knowledge. Often, these relationships aim to relate to cognitive concepts. Qualitative spatial and temporal considerations link cognitive approaches to the representation of knowledge with formal methods. In mathematical terms, qualitative spatial and temporal argumentation is largely associated with satisfaction problems over infinite domains where qualitative relationships serve as constraints. Typical domains include points and intervals that are on the spatial side, regions or oriented points on the euclimatic level."}, {"heading": "2 Qualitative Representations", "text": "In this section, we will formulate minimum requirements for qualitative calculations, discuss their relevance to spatio-temporal representation and reasoning, and list existing calculations.

R4 (and SA, WA) is helpful for modelling; it allows us to write longer intervals corresponding to the shorter combinations. This statement is only a conjunction of the relations between A, the unnamed intervals B, C and D. When we evaluate them, it does not matter whether we give priority to the composition of the relations between A, B and B, C or the composition of the relations between B and C.

Moreover, R7 meets the requirement that a calculation has a strong inversion. This will be achieved by the following Lemma.Lemma 11. Let C = (Rel, Int,) be a qualitative calculation.

(For example, one might know how many relationships are typically sufficient to describe a scene of n objects unambiguously or with a specific residual uncertainty.) To this end, we have developed two empirical measures that characterize certain aspects of qualitative calculations that are relevant for applications. (1) How well can calculations with many relationships make use of the normally higher information content? (2) Does the information content differ significantly between the six classes of calculations specified in Section 4? The first measurement we consider to be the information content of the composition operation is the estimation of how much additional information can be obtained by applying a composition operation. This allows us to estimate whether, for example, we have observed relationships r (A, B, C) and r (B) in a scene that is worth observing."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We looked at the spatio-temporal representation and reasoning from an algebraic perspective, examined the effects of algebraic properties on the modelling and reasoning of algorithms, and tested these properties on a representative corpus of existing calculations; the resulting classification shows that calculations described in the early literature tend to be located in the upper part of Figure 1; that is, they tend to have a rich algebraic structure. Few recently developed calculations are based on generalizations and have a weaker structure. We concluded that common reasoning methods for the latter class of calculations are wrong, and have proposed a corrected universal a-closure algorithm that applies reasoning optimizations where they are permitted. Furthermore, we found that algebraic properties are not necessarily related to how much information is preserved in successive reasoning steps. An interesting and significant line of future work by Jaicka is to support the extension of Jaicka's calculations to Andreae 401."}, {"heading": "A Additional proofs from Section 2.1", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A.1 Proof of Fact 4", "text": "Considering a qualitative calculation (Rel, Int) and relations (Rel) (Rel) (Rel, Int) and relations (Rel) (Rel) (Rel, Int) (Rel, Int) and relations (Rel) (Rel) (Rel) (Rel: Rel: Rel: (R) (R) (R) (R) (R) (R: (R))."}, {"heading": "B Additional proofs from Section 3", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "B.1 Proof of Fact 8", "text": "(R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R = 1 R (R = 1) R (R = 1) R = 1 R (R = 1) R (R = 1) R (R = 1 R) R (R = 1 R) R (R = 1 R) R (R = 1 R) R (R = 1) R (R = 1) R (R = 1) R (R = 1) R (R = 1) R = 1 (R) R = 1 (R) R) R (1) R = 1 (R = 1) R 1 (R) R) R (R = 1) R (1) R = 1 (R) R = 1 (R) R) R (R = 1) R (R = 1) R (R = 1) R (R = 1) R = 1 (R) R) R (R = 1) R (R = 1) R (R) R (R = 1) R = 1 (R = 1) R (R = 1) R (R) R) R (R = 1 (R) R = 1 (R) R) R (R = 1 (R), 1 (R) R (R) R (R) = 1 (R) R (R) = 1 (R) = 1 (R) R (R) = 1 (R) R (R) = 1 (R) R (R) R (R) = 1 (R) = 1 (R) (R) (R) = 1 (R (R) = 1) R (R) R (R (R) = 1 (R) = 1 (R (R) = 1 (R) = 1 (R) 1) R (R) R (R) = 1 (R (R) 1 (R) = 1 (R) 1 (R) = 1 (R) 1 (R) = 1)"}, {"heading": "C Detailed description of the test results in Section 4 by calculus", "text": "9-Cut HETS: all axioms met. - SparQ: passed all 6 tests."}, {"heading": "Allen\u2019s interval relations", "text": "- [25]: this calculation is a relation algebra. - HETS: all axioms are fulfilled. - SparQ: all 6 tests passed."}, {"heading": "Block Algebra", "text": "- HETS: all axioms are satisfied. - SparQ: all 6 tests are passed.Cardinal Direction Calculus- [25]: this calculus is a relation algebra, as already reported in [16]. - HETS: all axioms are satisfied. - SparQ: all 6 tests are passed.Cardinal Direction Relations- HETS: R6 is violated for all base relations but one, R6l for only 209 base relations, R7 for 214 base relations, R9 for 5,607 pairs, R10 for 41,834 pairs, PL for 22,976 triples, R4 for 2,936,946 counters, and SA for 38 base relations."}, {"heading": "Dependency Calculus", "text": "- [25]: this calculation is a relation algebra (and homomorphic embedded in RCC-5). - HETS: All axioms are fulfilled. - SparQ: All 5 tests pass."}, {"heading": "Dipole Calculus", "text": "- HETS: and DRAf violates R4 for 71,424 triples of base relationships.
