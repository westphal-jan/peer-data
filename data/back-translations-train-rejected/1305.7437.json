Agent-Based Simulation of Office Building Electricity Consumption: A Case Study", "text": "As the behaviour of electricity consumers is significantly influenced by the power management technologies and strategies / regulations in an office building, the above equation potentially integrates the four elements mentioned above (i.e. energy management strategies / regulations, energy management technologies, electrical appliances / devices and user behaviour) and provides a theoretical basis for the development of an agent-based simulation model of power consumption of office buildings. Here, we are developing an agent-based model of power consumption of office buildings based on an academic building at the School of Computer Science in Jubilee Campus, University of Nottingham. We chose this case because it is very convenient for us to conduct surveys to understand the behaviour of users at school, and also the Estate Office, which is responsible for energy management at the University of Nottingham, kindly provided us with data on power management technologies and actual power consumption in the school building."}, {"heading": "3.1 Electricity Consumption in the School Building", "text": "In fact, we will be able to change the world without destroying it, without destroying it, without destroying it, without destroying it, without destroying it, without destroying it, without destroying it. \""}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Behaviour of Electricity User Agents", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far in the United States as it has this year."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Behaviour of Light Agents", "text": "In the simulation model, we treat the lamps in the school building as passive agents, which means that these agents do not have a proactive behaviour, but react passively to the behaviour of the consumers of electricity. Behaviour of the lamps is relatively simple, as they can only be either switched off or switched on, as shown in the light scale (Figure 4). In the case of a light, the transition from the switched-off state to the switched-off state is linked to the presence of consumers of electricity when the light is automated by light sensors, or to the behaviour of switching on when there is a light switch that enables consumers of electricity to have control over the light. Conversely, the transition from the switched-on state to the switched-off state is linked to leaving the consumers of electricity when the light is automated by light sensors, or to the behaviour of switching off when there is a light switch."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 Behaviour of Computer Agents", "text": "Similar to lamps, computers are treated as passive agents in our simulation model. Computers can be on, off, or in standby mode. Thus, in a computer's state plan, we look at these three states, as shown in Figure 5. For a computer, the transitions between off, on, and stand-by depend on the behavior of the power user agents when using the computer. According to our survey, the total power of a computer is 0 when the mode is off; 25 watts in standby mode; and about 400 watts when the mode is on."}, {"heading": "3.2.4 Model Implementation", "text": "The model was implemented in the simulation package AnyLogic 6.5.0 [13] on a standard PC running Windows XP SP3. We set each time step in the simulation model to one minute and simulate the day-to-day work of the School of Computer Science staff and observe and analyze how their behavior can lead to systemic power consumption of the entire floor. Lighting and computer agents are assigned to each room based on their real physical distribution in the school. Electricity consumers come to school every morning, walk through the hallways and enter their own offices to work. They can also leave their offices, walk through the hallways and enter other rooms to use facilities such as toilets and kitchens. They interact with each other in relation to energy issues in the school, and this type of interaction can increase their energy conservation capacity. They also interact with passive light and computer agents, and this type of interaction can lead directly to systemic power consumption in the school. An overview of the model is shown in Figure 6."}, {"heading": "4.

Conclusions", "text": "This paper describes an agent-based model of the energy consumption of office buildings. We started the work with an argument for integrating the four elements involved in the energy consumption of office buildings, and then described the agent-based simulation method and the reasons for developing an agent-based model for investigating the power consumption of office buildings. We then developed an agent-based model of the energy consumption of office buildings using the example of the School of Computer Science, Jubilee Campus, University of Nottingham, and presented the simulation results. We focused on two objectives: First, integrating the four elements involved in the energy consumption of office buildings into one model. The other is the development of a multi-layer framework for investigating practical issues of energy management for an organization. From the research results we reported in this paper, we conclude that while it is not possible to perfectly replicate the real organization, the agent-based simulation as a novel approach that integrates the four elements of the energy consumption of office buildings is a very useful tool for the office building."}], "references": [{"title": "Using results from field surveys to predict the effect of open windows on thermal comfort and energy use in buildings, Energy and Buildings", "author": ["H.B.
