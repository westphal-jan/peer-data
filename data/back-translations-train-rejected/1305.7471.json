The mathematical models chosen vary greatly within these aspects and therefore we can carry out a more robust analysis of our experiments, as in Table 1. The first case study considered is based on an ODE model that includes interactions between tumour cells and generic effector cells. The second case study supplements the previous model with the influence of IL-2 cytokine molecules on the immune reactions of effector cells against tumour cells. The final case study includes an ODE model of the interactions between effector cells, tumour cells and IL-2 and TGF-3 molecules. In all case studies both the mathematical model and the ABMS model are presented, the results are compared and the benefit of each approach is evaluated. The models differ in terms of the complexity of the interactions we are involved in the study, the number of the interactions of the substances and the problems of the BMS."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it will happen, until it does."}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "In this section, we will outline the activities and methods necessary to achieve our objectives. We will examine case studies of established mathematical models that describe some immune cells and molecules that interact with tumor cells. These case studies were selected taking into account aspects such as the behavior of the units of the model, the size (and number) of populations involved, and the modeling effort involved. The original mathematical models are based on an agent-based approach and results in comparison. ABMS is able to represent space; however, since we have selected mathematical models that do not take into account spatial interactions, our respective ABMS models do not take into account space (distance) and how it would affect simulation outcomes. The results obtained from ODEs and ABMS were statistically compared with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test to formally determine whether they differ statistically from each other. This test is applied because it is robust if the populations are not normally distributed, the samples are not identical to the OBMS, and if the samples are not statistically accurate to the OBMS."}, {"heading": "The agent-based model development", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "The mathematical model", "text": "The interactions between tumor cells and immune effector cells can be defined by the following equations: = Tf (T) \u2212 dT (T, E) = pE (T, E) \u2212 dE (T, E) \u2212 aE (E) + \u03a6 (T) (6) where T is the number of tumor cells, E is the number of effector cells, f (T) is the growth of tumor cells, dT (T, E) is the death (apoptosis) of effector cells, pE (T, E) is the proliferation of effector cells, dE (T, E) is the death of effector cells, aE (E) is the death (apoptosis) of effector cells, 10 \u03a6 (T) is the treatment or the influx of cells.

The parameters and behaviours of the active substances corresponding to each state are shown in Table 3. All behaviours are derived from the mathematical model. In the table, each active substance has two different types of behaviour: reactive and proactive behaviour. State tables are frequently used in ABMS to show the different states in which entities may be located and how they move from one state to another (transitions).In our models, we also use events that should occur in the course of the simulation.The state table for the tumour cells is shown in Figure 2 (a), in which an active substance dies with increasing age or is killed by effector cells.In addition, the tumour cells contribute to the damage to the effector cells at a certain rate.

Four scenarios were examined taking into account small population numbers, and for only one of them the ABMS results were similar to the mathematical model. Observed differences were explained by the way each simulation approach is implemented, including their representation and processing of data. ODE simulations treat continuous values for entities, while ABMS are discrete agents. Furthermore, the stochastic behavior of ABMS and how it affects small populations also appears in the ODEs that the individual interactions between populations in ABMS lead to more chaotic behavior that does not occur at a higher aggregated level. Results analysis also shows that the conceptualized proliferation of the ABMS model from the mathematical equations does not always produce the same results from the ABMS results, 2 an alternative to achieve better results for a drug-based cell development in DE."}, {"heading": "The mathematical model", "text": "The _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _"}, {"heading": "The agent-based model", "text": "The populations of the active agents are therefore the effector cells, tumour cells and IL-2 and their behaviour is shown in Table 7.

Therefore, the numbers corresponding to the ABMS results plotted ten different runs to illustrate the variations.The observed differences occur for two reasons: (1) the ABMS stochasticity and (2) the agents individual behavior and their interactions.

These models, however, are not effectively capable of representing problems involving individual localisation, memory and emerging properties, which are common characteristics of cells and molecules of the immune system. Agent-based modelling and simulation is an alternative paradigm to ODE models that overcomes these limitations. In this paper we investigate the potential contribution of agentbased modelling and simulation when compared to ODE modelling and simulation. We seek answers to the following questions: Is it possible to obtain an equivalent agent-based model from the ODE formulation? Do the outcomes differ? Are there any benefits of using one method compared to the other? To answer these questions, we have considered three case studies using established mathematical models of immune interactions with earlystage cancer. These case studies were re-conceptualised under an agent-based perspective and the simulation results were then compared with those from the ODE models. Our results show that it is possible to obtain equivalent agent-based models (i.e. implementing the same mechanisms); the simulation output of both types of models however might differ depending on the attributes of the system to be modelled. In some cases, additional insight from using agent-based modelling was obtained. Overall, we can confirm that agent-based modelling is a useful addition to the tool set of immunologists, as it has extra features that allow for simulations with characteristics that are closer to the biological phenomena.", "creator": "Microsoft Word - bmc_Figueredo_2.docx"}}}
