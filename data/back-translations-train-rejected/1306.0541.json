Overview", "text": "In order to simulate the measurements of a large collection of biomedical sensors, a classification system and several calculation methods were developed. It consisted of three operational stages - 1) sampling - the method for capturing time series over a pre-defined period, 2) classification - the method for identifying similarities between time series and 3) tracking - the method of a user or an automatic monitoring process - the ability to observe in real time time time time time time time series that were classified as similar during the sample and classification phases and to act on them."}, {"heading": "B. Sampling", "text": "The sampling stage consisted of the sampling of m time series, which were sampled several times from time 1T to time 2T (Fig. 1). The sampling of time series includes an initial sampling of the values of m time series, which were measured at time 1T, several further sampling of the values of m time series (e.g. every ten seconds) and a final sampling of the values of m time series, which were measured at time 2T. The number of samples, n, is determined in advance, as is the interval between samples. However, there is no restriction to having an identical interval value between samples. When the sampling ends, the vectors of the values (e.g. prices, which represent financial instruments) are displayed as in (1)."}, {"heading": "C. Classification", "text": "The classification phase identifies pairs of similarly behaving financial instruments. Steps are based on the application of several methods, including self-identification, decision-tree learning and similarity ranking. When the classification phase ends, a subset of the original time series is stored in a database, containing pairs of time series that behave similarly, described in more detail in Section III."}, {"heading": "D. Tracking", "text": "In addition to each financial instrument presented in real time, there are several parameters, including its current price (expressed in US dollars), the change in price since tracking began (expressed in percent) and its sector (Figure 2). A sector could have one of the following values: 1) Services, 2) Healthcare, 3) Utilities, 4) Financial services, 5) Consumer goods, 6) Basic materials, 7) Conglomerates, 8) Industrial goods and 9) Technology. The user has the option of presenting only pairs in which the financial instruments in each pair belong to the same sector. Financial instruments are visualized in real time so that the user can monitor and monitor the data collected."}, {"heading": "III. TIME-SERIES CLASSIFICATION", "text": "A.

EXPERIMENTS", "text": "To evaluate the classification accuracy of the simulator, the sampling period followed by the classification (January 24, 2013, 15: 03: 50 PM - 15: 10: 06 PM) was observed. 202 pairs were identified as pairs, while in each pair the two Financial Instruments behaved similarly (see examples in Fig. 5). The 20 similarly behaved pairs with the same sector for the two Financial Instruments in a pair together with the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient Values (r) for each pair are presented in Table A. The correlation of 90% of the pairs (18 of 20) was positive, indicating a high classification accuracy. The average of the 20 pairs was 0.63 (SD: 0.39)."}, {"heading": "V. DISCUSSION", "text": "The provision of classifications for signals or time series is well discussed in the literature, but what is important here, as described in (1) - (4), is an improvement in self-labeling that facilitates the application of monitored learning methods to unlabeled datasets. Another important aspect facilitates the classification of time series - the similarity ranking applied to a decision tree learning algorithm to classify time series regardless of type and quantity.The methods described in the paper could be applied to a large collection of biomedical sensors - the simulator presented in the paper allows the acquisition and classification of unspecified time series measurements. Additional financial measurements, i.e. sensor measurements, could be acquired without changing the design and without having to develop additional software components. Another advantage of the methods is that they have the potential to reduce the complexity of sensors detected by ignition of sensors."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "The simulator is based on: a sampling method that enables the acquisition of samples of 7,871 financial instruments traded in real time on three American exchanges: NASDAQ, NYSE and AMEX; a classification method for identifying similarly behaved pairs; and a user interface that enables real-time observation of the identified pairs. Positive high correlations were repeatedly observed for pairs containing similarly identified patterns; the classification is based on new machine learning techniques: self-labeling that enables the application of monitored learning methods to blank time series and similarity ranking applied to a decision-tree learning algorithm for classifying time series regardless of type and quantity; and the classification approach proposes addressing the expected scalability constraints associated with multiple-sensing-based systems as it enables the classification of measurements regardless of the type and quantity of measurements."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The author would like to pay tribute to Mr. David Orange, BSEE, JD and LLM (The University of Washington) for their tremendous support and help."}], "references": [{"title": "Advanced Wearable Health Systems and Applications - Research and Development Efforts in the European Union", "author": ["A.
