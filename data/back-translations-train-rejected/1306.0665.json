For example, narratives are interpreted in the context of formalisms such as situational calculation and event calculation as \"a sequence of events about which we may have incomplete, contradictory, or false information\" (Miller and Shanahan 1994; Pinto 1998). The interpretation of narrative knowledge in this paper relies in particular on these characteristics, especially with regard to the representational and thinking tasks that arise during the modeling of the perceptibly grounded, narrativated epistemic state of an autonomous agent. In this paper, we deal in particular with large-scale cognitive robotic systems, in which symbolic planning and control at the highest level of an autonomous agent's subcomponents determine the most autonomous status and composition."}, {"heading": "Perceptual Narratives and Postdiction", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take a few days until it will be so far again, until it is so far again."}, {"heading": "Approximate Epistemic Planning as ASP", "text": "We choose HPX as the theoretical basis for our framework because it provides native and elaborate support for postdictory thinking along with low computational complexity (the plan existence problem is in NP).For alternative PWS-based formalisms, plan existence is a problem that relies dynamically on its knowledge base, e.g. (Baral, Kreinovich, and Trejo 2000).2The advanced plan system uses the online ASP rationality oclingo (Gebser et al. 2011a), which applies its knowledge base according to the sensitization outcomes. To get the most out of our knowledge, no other implemented formalism supports postdiction in this complexity class. Support for postdiction is critical to realize abnormal and explanation-based error tolerance in robotic systems: If sensing shows that the effect of an action is not intended, then postdiction can be used to explain the reason for failure."}, {"heading": "Narrativised Online Robot Control", "text": "The original h-approximation formalism and planning system is designed for offline problem solving, i.e., a conditional plan is created and the projected future world states are checked to see if a predefined goal holds. In this work, we extend the h-approximation so that it is able to plan online and provide abductive explanations. In addition, we define several measures for assessing the quality of a plan (e.g. robustness in the face of unknown contingencies). An essential feature of the h-approximation is support for the shift; we use the shift to find explanations of why an action was successful or not. We propose to model actions so that the absence of an anomaly is a condition for the success of the action. After the action is performed, the sensor can check whether an action was successful, and thus to determine whether an anomaly was determined by other types of reasoning - for example, can be used."}, {"heading": "I. An Extended Online h-approximation", "text": "The general h-approximating architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2: it consists of an online ASP solver and a controller that acts as an interface to human input devices and the robotic environment; the complete LP to be projected is the linking of the LP translation of domain specification D, the target specification G, and an execution statement N: LP (P) = LP (G).Here, the execution narrative contains information about what actions have actually been performed and what results are actually obtained.4The number of child branches is randomly selected via a selection.Once a stable model SM (P) is found, it is sent to the controller that interprets this as a conditional plan and starts executing it. It reports the execution narrativeN back to the solver."}, {"heading": "II. Assessing Plan Quality", "text": "So far, we have considered \"raw\" weak plans in which the goal is achieved, then the strength of the plan is in practice (e.g. because they contain cycles, it is unlikely to lead to the goal or include many exogenous events. We use several optimization criteria to assess the quality of the plans. However, an optimal plan should contain few exogenous measures to achieve the goal for as many contingencies as possible. (With the priority of these criteria in the given order.) Plan Strength The plan strength reflects how many contingencies the plan strength reflects, i.e. unknown world properties, the goal is solved.Definition 1 (Strength of a plan). In the face of a plan p and a plan problem P (p, P) the number of leafs of the search tree and ng (p, P) the total number of leafs in which the goal is reached is then determined."}, {"heading": "Case Study: Abnormality Aware Wheelchair Robot", "text": "Our framework is integrated into a larger assistance system in a smart home environment, namely the Bremer Ambient Assisted Living Lab (BAALL) (Krieg-Bru \ufffd ckner et al. 2010). The environment has many actuators and sensors such as automatic doors, a smart TV and also an autonomous robot wheelchair. A typical (simplified) use case in this environment is in Fig. 3: 9However, work is currently being done on it and planning begins. The solver finds the first plan with a horizon of 7 steps. The plan is sent to the controller and execution begins. Door d1 is opened and its open state is checked."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "The current work is accomplished through planning, dynamic planning, abductive explanations, and subsequent action. Therefore, we are interested in other frameworks that have similar characteristics. There are many action theory frameworks and implementations that include incomplete knowledge, such as the Shanahan quota planning (2000), but these often assume complete knowledge of the world and have no semantics that extend to action capture."}, {"heading": "Conclusion and Outlook", "text": "We have formalized and implemented an online planning framework and demonstrated its application in a smart home environment. Error tolerance is achieved by deferring anomalies, which requires a formalism such as HPX to support capture along with postdiction. On the application side, work is currently underway to integrate the online approach of this paper into the general experimental cognitive robotics framework ExpCog (Listing 1; (Suchan and Bhatt 2012)).This integration will allow us to release the online planner so that it can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of robot control tasks and existing platforms such as ROS (http: / / www.ros.org).On the theoretical side, we are currently investigating domain-independent heuristics and their formalization in the sense of ASP to improve the overall performance of the planner: A huge corpus of heuristics in planning can be found in the PDL planning literature, but translated into the PASP planning literature."}], "references": [{"title": "Computational complexity of planning and approximate planning in the presence of incompleteness", "author": ["C.
