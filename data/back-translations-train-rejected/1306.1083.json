By combining contrast terms with prior terms, it provides accurate segmentations of medical images in a fully automated manner. However, one of the main drawbacks of using the RW algorithm is that its parameters have to be hand-tuned. we propose a novel discriminative learning framework that estimates the parameters using a training dataset. The main challenge we face is that the training samples are not fully supervised. Speci cally, they provide a hard segmentation of the images, instead of a proba-bilistic segmentation. We overcome this challenge by treating the optimal probabilistic segmentation that is compatible with the given hard segmentation as a latent variable. This allows us to employ the latent support vector machine formulation for parameter estimation. We show that our approach signi cantly outperforms the baseline methods on a challenging dataset consisting of real clinical 3D MRI volumes of skeletal muscles.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Jun 2013 12:48:02 GMT  (57kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1083v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["pierre-yves baudin", "danny goodman", "puneet kumar", "noura azzabou", "pierre g carlier", "nikos paragios", "m pawan kumar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.1083"}, "pdf": {"name": "1306.1083.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Discriminative Parameter Estimation for Random Walks Segmentation: Technical Report", "authors": ["Pierre-Yves Baudin", "Danny Goodman", "Puneet Kumar", "Noura Azzabou", "Pierre G.

Considering a 3D surface model, simplex meshes are discrete meshes in which each vertex has exactly 3 neighbors. The position of a pixel, which is called x, can simply be parameterized as a linear combination of the positions of the three neighbors plus a local height concept parallel to local normality: x = 1x1 + \u03b52x2 + (1 \u2212 \u03b51 \u2212 \u03b52) x3 + hn.

Let's also designate a set of labels - one per object to segment - as S. The goal of the random path algorithm [10] is to calculate an assignment probability of all voxels to all labels. These probabilities depend on: i) contrast between adjacent voxels, ii) manually - that is, deterministically - mapping some voxels, called seeds, and iii) before the assignment probability. The probabilities contained in vectors can be achieved by minimizing the following function values: ERWprior (x, y) = y Ly y y \u2212 (x)."}, {"heading": "3 Derivation of the Latent SVM Upper Bound", "text": "Considering a dataset D = {(xk, zk), k = 1,.., N}, which consists of input xk and its hard segmentation zk, we would like to estimate the parameters w in such a way that the resulting inferred segmentations are accurate.
