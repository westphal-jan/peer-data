SentiWordNet is a generic (or global) lexicon, i.e., its results are considered universally applicable regardless of the specific domain of the text to which the ratings are assigned. SentiWordNet's hypothesis about the global applicability of ratings to terms may not include all possible terms in any domain, but from a practical perspective it should apply to a large proportion of cases. In SentiWordNet, this hypothesis is stronger because the application of ratings to any unique sense of a term allows a good number of otherwise sentimentally ambiguous cases to be distinguished, for example, blue in terms of color or mood."}, {"heading": "2 Collecting the feedback", "text": "Feedback from users was collected in two ways: (i) from the web interface and (ii) from the download interface. The web interface allows the user to search for any term in WordNet and displays all synsets that may include the term with relative SentiWordNet values. Each synset has a \"Feedback!\" link that opens a feedback dialog (see Figure 2) that allows the user to submit his proposed triplet of values (which may differ or be identical to the SentiWordNet triplet). When a user clicks on the link to the SentiWordNet download page, the actual download link is presented along with a feedback dialog (see Figure 3) that represents the triplet for a synthesis and prompts the user to check, confirm or submit a triplet of corrected values."}, {"heading": "3 Releasing the feedback", "text": "Prior to the release of the feedback, we were faced with the requirement to respect the privacy of the users who contributed their feedback, while at the same time we wanted to store some information about the event that generated the feedback, which could be useful for analyzing data. We therefore turned each IP into a unique identifier, so that it is still possible to group feedback generated by the same IP, but not to determine its exact source. We also added the country in which the IP is located using the WHOIS protocol. Although the information obtained in this way is only a rough approximation of the location of the feedback source, it does not provide information about the sender's English skills, it may be useful for future analyses concerning grouping or filtering in geographical areas. Accurate time information has been removed so that only the date of submission is known. The feedback entries per line will be put together with one of the following text files in a back file."}, {"heading": "4 User feedback statistics", "text": "A total of 3,510 feedback entries were collected (an average of about 3.5 per day).The feedback entries were submitted from 1,209 different IP addresses, which is an average of 2.9 entries per IP address, and the distribution follows a performance law, as shown in Table 1. Regarding the geographical origin of the feedback, 350 of the 1,209 different IP addresses cannot be assigned to any country (\"xx,\" in Table 2).The remaining IP addresses come from 72 countries, 35 of which contributed at least 15 feedback submissions from at least 5 different IP addresses.3http: / / creativecommons.org / licenses / by-sa / 3.0 / The temporal distribution of feedback submissions (see Table 3) shows a first period in 2010 with a relatively low number of submissions, a second period in 2011-2012 with a higher steady flow of submissions (85 per month on average) and a high peak in the first months of feedback submissions (see Table 3) so we have relatively low levels of feedback, with these numbers being exactly the number of feedback entries (85 per month on average)."}, {"heading": "5 Improving user feedback collection", "text": "In preparing the feedback data, we have noticed some weaknesses in the feedback collection process and we have designed some changes to the user interface and the information collected to improve it.The feedback input interface presented via the download link is vulnerable to repeated transmission of feedback confirming the original SentiWordNet values, due to the fact that this type of input has almost no \"cost,\" i.e. it only needs to click the \"Submit feedback\" button, and that clicking this button repeatedly does not even need to move the mouse. To limit the false confirmation submissions, we have added a confirmation dialog asking the user to actively confirm the submission of feedback. We also have a difference in the role of users between the two possible feedback sources, i.e. the download link and the search interface, which is not searched synchronously."}], "references": [{"title": "Sentiwordnet 3.0: An enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining", "author": ["S.
