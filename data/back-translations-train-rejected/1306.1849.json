Afterwards, we will present two simple results on the existence of Nash balances and strong balances in this environment."}, {"heading": "2.1 Voting rules", "text": "For the sake of completeness, we first define the general voting rules that we are studying in this paper. There are a number of n voters who vote from a number of m candidates. A single vote is a strict sequence of candidates. A voting rule takes all votes as input and leads to a result - a candidate who is declared the winner of the election. Although voting rules are usually defined for a fixed number of candidates, here, of course, we extend the definition to any number of candidates. All voting rules that we consider in this work are deterministic: we first define their non-deterministic version and assume that balances are distributed according to a fixed priority relationship with candidates. Since voting rules apply to different groups of candidates, we assume that equality rules are defined for the entire group of potential candidates and projected onto smaller groups of candidates; in other words, if x takes precedence over y, this will always be the case that c for each group of candidates contains x."}, {"heading": "2.2 Strategic candidacy", "text": "There are a number of X = {x1, x2,.. xm} of possible candidates and a number V = {1, 2,.. n} of n voters. We assume that voters and candidates disagree. As is customary in social election theory, each voter i-V has a preference for the various candidates. In addition, each candidate also has a strict preference for the candidates. (Of course, we assume that the preferences of the candidates themselves are supported - that is, the candidates themselves rank at the top of their order. Leave PX = (PXc) c denotes the preference profile of candidates Y. According to PX, the potential candidates can decide whether to participate in an election or withdraw their candidacy."}, {"heading": "2.3 Game-theoretic concepts", "text": "Once we have defined a normal form game, we can now apply standard game theory solutions. Let's say that a coalition Z'X has an improving move in s if there is s'Z, so that each player z'Z has a \"candidate game.\" Specifically, the improving move is one-sided if | Z | = 1. A (pure strategy) Nash Balance (NE) [12] is a state that has no unilateral improving moves. More generally, a state is a k-NE if no coalition with | Z | \u2264 k has an improving move. A strong equilibrium (SE) ([1]) is a state that has no improving moves. Example 1. Consider the game < {a, b, c, d}, P, PX > where r is the rule, and Pb \u2192 P7 is a state that does not improve."}, {"heading": "2.4 Preliminary results", "text": "Regardless of the number of voters and the voting rule applied, a simple observation is that a three-candidate game is guaranteed to have a NE. Note that this does not apply to SE8.The following result applies to any number of candidates, but is limited to the Condorcet Rules. Suggestion 1: Let's find a very simple proof where r is Condorcet consistent. If P has a Condorcet winner, the analysis becomes more complicated. In our examples, we assume that Y is an SE-consistent Y. We also use the simplified notation Y-Y-Y.The very simple proof can be found in the appendix. If P does not have a Condorcet winner, the analysis becomes more complicated. In our examples, we assume that a lexicographic equality board resolves. We also use the simplified notation Y-7 \u2192 c-x to specify the rule c-."}, {"heading": "3 Four candidates", "text": "With only four potential candidates, we show a sharp contrast between the uniform Condorcet rules, which all have a NE, and the scoring rules."}, {"heading": "3.1 Scoring rules", "text": "To explore the number of voters with each particular profile, we use a very strong result from Saari [15]. It is said that for almost all scoring rules, any conceivable selection function can result from a voting profile. < 1 > 7) This means that our question boils down to examining whether a selection function, along with some coherent candidate preferences, can be found so that no NE with 4 candidates exists. We have solved this question by encoding the problem as an Integrated Linear Program (ILP), the details of which can be found in the appendix. It turns out that such selection functions exist: It then follows from Saari's result that counter-examples for \"most\" scoring rules can be obtained. We show this for plurality and m = 4, there can be no NE.Proof. We have a counter example with 13 voters whose preferences are included in the left part of the table."}, {"heading": "3.2 Condorcet-consistent rules", "text": "It turns out that the presence of NE can be guaranteed for all of them. For m = 4, if r is Condorcet consistent, there is then a \u2192 \u2192 example. We start with a comment: although we do not assume that r is based on the majority diagram, we still prove our result by looking at all possible cases for the majority diagrams (we come back to this point at the end of the evidence).There are four graphs we are looking at (all others are achieved by these criteria by symmetry).a bc dG1a bc dG2a bc dG3a bc bc dG4a bc dG2, each subset of the Condorcet winner is a NE (see Proposition 9).For G3, we assume that a Condorcet loser is N (a, x) for all x."}, {"heading": "4 More candidates", "text": "The first question that comes to mind is whether the absence of a NE transfer to larger groups of candidates is not accompanied by a NE transfer."}, {"heading": "5 Strong Equilibria and Consenting Control", "text": "Now we briefly discuss the link to control by deleting or adding candidates that are so unique. Bartholdi et al. [2] define constructive control by deleting candidates (CCDC) and constructive control by adding candidates (CCAC): an instance of the CCDC consists of a profile P about candidates removing candidates C, a holistic candidate K, and we ask if there is a subset C in which there is a subset C, so that the clear winner is in C. An instance of the CCAC consists of a profile P about candidates, candidates C1, C2, a differentiating candidate C, and we ask if there is a subset C of C2, so that the clear winner in C1 is \"C.\" Destructive versions of control are defined by Hemaspaandra [10]: destructive control by deletion (DCDC) is similar to the CCDC, except that we ask if there is a subset C."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We have further explored the landscape of strategic candidacy in elections, achieving several positive results (for Condorcet-consistent rules with 4 candidates; for two versions of Copeland and for unfunded groups with any number of candidates) and several negative results (for plurality and maximin); we have also established a strong link to a new variant of candidate control that we believe has its own interest. Many outstanding problems remain, especially Borda with more than 4 candidates. Another topic for further research is the study of the totality of states that can be achieved by some (e.g. the best response) dynamics starting from the group or all potential candidates. In some cases, even if the existence of NE is guaranteed (e.g. for Copeland), we may already find examples that none is attainable by a sequence of the best answers. But other types of dynamics can be studied."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank Michel Le Breton and Vincent Merlin for their helpful discussions."}, {"heading": "Appendix A: Proofs", "text": "If P has a Condorcet winner c, then Y is an SE winner, unless c is a NE candidate c-Y-Prof. Suppose c is a Condorcet winner for P-Y-Prof. Suppose c is a Condorcet winner for P-X and let Y-Prof be such that c-Prof. C is a Condorcet consistent candidate, and c is a Condorcet winner for P-Y-Prof. Y-Prof. Suppose c is a dissenting coalition of Y, with Z + the candidates joining the election, and c is a Condorcet winner for P-Y-Y and c has no interest in leaving it. Therefore c is still a Condorcet winner in P-C-Prof."}, {"heading": "Appendix B: ILP formulation", "text": "We introduce a binary variable wsi, which means that Agent i wins in the state s.
