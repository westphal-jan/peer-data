Rational decision making involves the use of information that is almost always imperfect and incomplete, along with an intelligent machine that, when it comes to a human being, is inconsistent in making decisions. In the theory of flexibly limited rationality, this decision is made independently of the fact that the information to be used is incomplete and imperfect, and that the human brain is inconsistent, and therefore that decision to be made is made within the limits of these limitations. In the theory of flexibly limited rationality, advanced information analysis is applied, the correlation machine is used to make missing information complete, and artificial intelligence is used to make more consistent decisions within the limits of which is therefore extended rationality."}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "This paper is an extension of the paper on the theory of flexibly limited rationality proposed by Marwala in 1979 (2013). Making decisions has always been a complex task. In the primitive society that makes decisions, superstition has been confused with superstition, and therefore quite irrational (Vyse, 2000; Foster and Kokko, 2009). Such irrationality in decision-making is even speculated to occur in animals like pigeons (Skinner, 1948). Essentially, superstition, which is irrational, can be defined as supernatural causality, where something is caused by another without being linked to each other. The idea of an event causing another without making a connection between them is characterized as irrational thinking, because it defies logic. This paper suggests that the three foundations of decision-making are information, a correlation machine used to estimate missing data and causal force that relates outputs to rational thinking, as attempts to move away from the concept of decision-making, superstition, and superstition of societies."}, {"heading": "2. Rational Decision Making: A causal approach", "text": "Rational decision-making is defined in this paper as the process by which a decision is made using some gathered information and some intelligence to make an optimized decision. Rational decision-making, as illustrated in Figure 1, involves the use of data and a model (e.g. human brain) to make a decision. The relationship between data and the impact of the decision is used to improve or enhance the learning process. Baker (2013) conducted a case study on rational decision-making in a hybrid organization for a treatment program before the Southwestern Drug Court. Serrano Gonz\u00e1lez et. (2013) successfully applied rational decision-making to identify the optimal structure of transmission systems for offshore wind farms. Salem et. al. (2013) successfully applied rational multi-criterion decision-making to select an operational plan for bridge rehabilitation."}, {"heading": "3. Bounded-Rational Decision Making", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own if they do not put themselves in a position to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "4. Flexibly-bounded Rational Decision Making", "text": "This section proposes the theory of flexibly limited rationality shown in Figure 3. To understand the theory of flexibly limited rationality, it is important to specify a few sentences, and these are: 1. Rational decision-making is a process that enables optimized decisions based on logic and scientific thinking based on information; the problem of optimized decision-making is evoked as decision-making migrates toward intelligent machines; 2. The process of rationality is indivisible; in other words, one cannot be half-rational and half-irrational; if one is half-rational, one becomes irrational; the concept of the indivisibility of rationality and its effects on many facets of life is a powerful concept that requires further investigation; 3. The principle of limited rationality does not cut off the theory of rationality, but merely specifies the limits within which the principle of rationality is applied."}, {"heading": "5. Is Rational Decision Making Process Necessarily Optimal?", "text": "Our definition of rationality encompasses three key concepts: logic (based on scientific principles), information (based on information), and optimisation (based on optimisation). The idea that a rational decision must lead to its optimisation has far-reaching implications for human decision-making. It essentially implies that people are fundamentally irrational beings. An optimised decision essentially implies that such a decision leads to maximisation of benefit (DeGroot, 1970; Berger, 1980). For example, if you have to go from Johannesburg to Vancouver, then you decide to go to London, then to Nairobi, and then to Vancouver for no other reason than to try to get from Johannesburg to Vancouver, then that behaviour will be regarded as irrational. The reason why this is considered irrational is that it is not an optimised decision and therefore wastes resources."}, {"heading": "6. Can rationality be divided?", "text": "The fact that both the theory of limited rationality and the theory of flexibly limited rationality only prescribe the limits within which rationality is exercised implicitly implies that the principle of rationality is not divisible, so the question that should be asked is whether rationality can be shared. In other words, can a person act semi-rationally? To illustrate this point, let us suppose that a young man named Masindi, who has just been diagnosed with a heart problem, decides to consult an astrologer who throws down a few bones and prescribes that Masindi must climb Mount Luvhola to be cured. If Masindi accepts this advice, we declare him irrational. Suppose that Masindi then decides to consult a cardiologist to solve his heart problem, then we declare him rational. If Masindi decides to go and see both the astrologer and the cardiologist as rational, then he acts irrational, then he acts irrational?"}, {"heading": "7. Advanced Information Processing", "text": "This section describes the advanced information processing techniques required to use data to make decisions in the context of flexibly limited rationality, namely time, frequency and time frequency ranges."}, {"heading": "A. Time Domain Data", "text": "When decisions are made, data in the time domain can be used to make decisions. Simply put, data in the time domain means that the dataset is used exactly as it was scanned at a given time. For example, if you want to use temperature per unit of time data today to predict tomorrow's average temperature, you can observe a range of data today to make tomorrow's predictions. Coillet et. al. (2013) successfully applied time domain methods to analyze optoelectronic oscillators based on fluorescent galery resonators. Szurley et. al. (2013) successfully applied time domain technology to improve binaural language. Pereira et. al. (2013) successfully applied time domain data from nuclear magnetic resonance and chemometry to classify fresh plums by sweetness. Herckenrath et. etal. (2013) successfully converted the time domain (saltwater) to the magnetic time domain (2013)."}, {"heading": "B. Frequency Doman", "text": "The basis of the frequency domain method is the Fourier series, and it essentially states that any periodic function can be approximated by a Fourier series, which is a combination of cosine and sine functions of different frequencies (Fourier, 1822; Boashash, 2003; Bochner and Chandrasekharan, 1949; Bracewell, 2000), meaning that a signal can be characterized by a series of cycles with different amplitudes and frequencies. Qu et. al. (2013) successfully applied frequency domain methods to filter gradient images for contour detection, while Oh et. al. (2013) applied hydrodynamic loads in the frequency domain to analyze offshore wind turbines. Mohapatra et. (2013) successfully applied frequency domain electromechanical disturbances to investigate electrical energy systems, while Zhang applied frequency composition (2013) successfully."}, {"heading": "C. Time-Frequency Domain", "text": "Time frequency methods are approaches in which it is possible to view data in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously. There are different types of time frequency methods and these include short-term Fourier transformation (Jont, 1977; Jacobsen and Lyons, 2003), wave transformation (Chui, 1992: Akansu and Haddad, 1992), Wigner distribution function (Wigner, 1932; Qian and Chen, 1992), and Gabor distribution (Daugman, 1980; Jones and Palmer, 1986).Ma et. al. (2013) successfully applied time frequency analysis for blind source separation, while Le and Paultre (2013) successfully applied time frequency analysis for modal identification. Zhang et. al. (2013) successfully applied time frequency analysis for real source separation, while Jiang et. al. (2013) successfully applied time frequency analysis for error diagnosis of healing sound (2013)."}, {"heading": "8. Missing Data Estimation", "text": "In this section, we describe missing data estimation methods as discussed by Marwala (2009). Missing data estimation method is a technique used to estimate data and thus missing information. It requires mathematical models that describe relationships that exist between variables. There are many methods that have been proposed to approximate missing data, one of which is one that successfully applies autoassociative neural networks to capture the interactions of variables and genetic algorithms to identify missing values (Abdella and Marwala, 2006). The other technique used is the hybrid of main component analysis and neuronal networks to capture the relationships that exist between the data, while the genetic algorithm for estimating missing values is successful (Mistry et. al., 2009)."}, {"heading": "9. Intelligent Machines", "text": "The core of the theory of flexibly limited rationality is that it assumes that an artificial intelligent machine is used for decision-making because it is considered to be better than the human brain. There are many different types of artificial intelligence methods that can be used to make decisions, and one of them is the neural network used in this paper. Neural network is an artificial intelligence technique that is inspired by how a human brain is structured in structures that are used to learn patterns from data (Patel and Marwala, 2006). There are many types of neural networks, including the basic radial function and the multilayered neural perceptron network used in this paper."}, {"heading": "10. What is Irrationality?", "text": "In this essay, we define rational decision-making as a process of decision-making based on a logical process that is based on information and optimized. What, then, is irrational decision-making in the face of this definition? A decision-making process becomes irrational when it is not based on information (evidence) or illogical or unoptimized. In the earlier part of this essay, we came to the conclusion that humans are essentially irrational beings."}, {"heading": "11. Irrational Decision Making and the Theory of Marginalization of Irrationality in Decision Making", "text": "The sobering conclusion that people are more than unreasonable in this regard is an additional problem of how they manage to find satisfaction, even if they act irrationally. I go back to the patient Masindi, who after his diagnosis is confronted with a serious heart problem, which he in fact consults an astrologer for help, and then he goes straight to a cardiologist who examines him and tells him that he decides to have surgery the next day. The next day he consults an astrologer to strengthen the chances of success of the theater. Now, in the process of dealing with his heart problem, Masindi, who is rational, is the three aspects of rationality that are discussed in this paper, logical and optimized. Masindi is not logical and certainly his decision is not optimized and irrational in how to make decisions that are not rational in these circumstances."}, {"heading": "13 Conclusions", "text": "This paper introduces the concept of flexibly limited rationality as an extension of the concept of limited rationality. It is based on the principle of rationality but is realized through advanced signal processing, lack of data estimation methods and artificial intelligence techniques. Flexibly limited rationality expands the boundaries within which rational decision-making processes are exercised, increasing the likelihood of accurate decisions compared to the theory of limited rationality. Furthermore, the theory of marginalization of irrationality for the satisfaction of a decision was also proposed, which was applied to analyze a historical representation of an event in South Africa and to show why the result was not satisfactory."}], "references": [{"title": "The use of genetic algorithms and neural networks to approximate missing data in database", "author": ["M.

Rational decision making involves using information which is almost always imperfect and incomplete together with some intelligent machine which if it is a human being is inconsistent to make decisions. In bounded rationality, this decision is made irrespective of the fact that the information to be used is incomplete and imperfect and that the human brain is inconsistent and thus this decision that is to be made is taken within the bounds of these limitations. In the theory of flexibly-bounded rationality, advanced information analysis is used, the correlation machine is applied to complete missing information and artificial intelligence is used to make more consistent decisions. Therefore flexibly-bounded rationality expands the bounds within which rationality is exercised. Because human decision making is essentially irrational, this paper proposes the theory of marginalization of irrationality in decision making to deal with the problem of satisficing in the presence of irrationality.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
