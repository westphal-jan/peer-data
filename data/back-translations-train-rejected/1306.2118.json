The goal of discretization is to reduce the number of possible values that a continuous attribute takes by dividing them into a number of intervals. K-Means is used in this essay, where in gene expression data each gene attribute is clustered with K-Means and the attribute values are replaced by cluster labels, which will act as discrete values for the gene expression data set."}, {"heading": "2.3 Quick Reduct Algorithm", "text": "Rough set theory (Pawlak, 1991) is a formal mathematical tool that can be applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The method of reducing attributes removes redundant input attributes from the dataset of discrete values while ensuring that no information is lost. Reduction of attributes is achieved by comparing equivalence relationships generated by attribute sets. Attributes are removed so that the reduced set of attributes provides the same quality of classification as the original. A reduction is defined as a subset R of the conditional attribute set C, so that the quantitative reduction of attributes in a given dataset can have many attribute sets, so that the set R of all reductions is defined as: Rall = [X | X'C, \u03b3X's = categorical reduction of attributes in a minimum of attributes C."}, {"heading": "2.4 Average Correlation Value", "text": "The average correlation value is used to evaluate the homogeneity of a cluster.

Fuzzy C-Means clustering is used to identify the similar characteristics of genes GCi clusters. Prior to clustering, must specify the number of clusters. The optimal number of clusters is difficult to determine because it will depend on different groups of genes in the study. In this study, the number of clusters is chosen to be five and seven (k = 5, 7), then leukemia data set will share k number of groups using Fuzzy C-Means clustering techniques. According to clustering, properties or genes are selected from a similar GCi cluster. Rough Quick Reduct was used as a feature selection method. The data, which are determined by coarse genes are mainly organized in the form of decision tables.
