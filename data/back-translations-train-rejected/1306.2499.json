Introduction", "text": "The ontologies are known as tools able to manipulate the knowledge behind the concepts. We can use them in several areas such as information search, automatic translation..,. The ontologies can be used at different levels in the IRS. The orjectives of our study is to see the effects of ontologies in the process of indexing documents and queries, we are talking about semantic indexing. In the literature there are many definitions of semantic indexing. The semantic indexing (indexing in the literal sense) aims to correct the problems of lexical allocation by using the semantic indexes instead of simple keywords. The semantic indexing method aims to find the correct meaning of the word in the text from various possible senses of the word, as defined in dictionaries, ontologies and other language resources [1]. It is based on algorithms of word disamurement (SD)."}, {"heading": "2. Architecture of our System", "text": "In this section, we describe the semantic indexing method, which is based on Arabic Word Orders. This approach begins by extracting the concepts of the word network from the documents (or the query), then we extract the senses of these concepts from the synsets of the Arabic word network, and with the method of disambiguation 1, which is based on the calculation of the semantic distances between these senses, we identify the appropriate sense (with only one sense) for each concept from the proposed senses. For terms that do not belong to the vocabulary of the word network, the system extracts their basic form before passing it on through the semantic indexing method described above. For example, the Arabic word network does not contain the concept \"beyond the word network,\" but it contains its basic form. Formally, we consider: D a document of the collection composed of n words. D = {w1, outside the word network,..."}, {"heading": "3. Description of the experimentations", "text": "For our experiments we have used a corpora of over 22,000 Arabic documents (about 180 MB) in various fields (health, sports, politics, science, religion,...). This corpora has about 17 million words with 612,650 different words. A set of 70 keyword queries in different fields are selected for evaluation. Arabic WordNet is a lexical database freely available for standard Arabic. This database follows the conception and methodology of Princeton WordNet for English and EuroWordNet for European languages. Its structure is like a thesaurus, it is organized around the structure of synsets, that is, sets of synonyms and pointers that describe relationships with other synsets. Each word may belong to one or more categories of discourses. These categories are organized into four classes: nouns, verb, adjectives and adverb. Arabic WordNet is a lexical network whose nodes describe synsets and relationships between synthesis."}, {"heading": "1 405 164 11588 6287 518 329 8937 6092", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2 674 272 9332 5071 2579 1630 1914 1265", "text": "In fact, the number of documents found after semantic indexing is very high.

Discussions", "text": "In this experiment, we were interested in testing the semantic indexing strategy to represent the documents and queries, the implementation of our system is organized as follows: we started with the semantic indexing of the collection of documents, which is considered a preparatory step for the search, using a semantic resource (like Arabic word orders); then we tested various methods of search based on the semantic indexing of documents and queries together; another possibility of the search is to semantically index the queries (R2) or semantically index the collection of documents and use a simple query for the search (R3). The goal behind studying all of these methods (R1, R2, R3) is to determine at what level in the IRS the use of semantic documents (in the indexing of documents or queries) produces the best results."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "The idea of this article is to use a lexical resource (Arabic word orders) to index the documents as well as the user query in order to improve the query results. Our experiments based on a middle corpus of Arabic language have shown that semantic resources (in our case, Arabic word orders) improve the quality of IRS and achieve the objectives we initially set. We have noticed that the use of semantic indexing methods for the joint presentation of documents and queries yields better results than the separate use. The contribution of the ontologies in the Arabic language information query system is very interesting, but requires complete lexical resources that are currently not available. Therefore, much remains to be done in the future, and the most immediate extension of our research is to build a semantic core to represent the documents with Arabic word orders, as well as to investigate the effect of any semantic relationship that is used in this process (not synonyontic)."}], "references": [{"title": "Semantic Indexing using WordNet Senses", "author": ["R.
