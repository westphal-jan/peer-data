This behavior appears to run counter to rational models of decision making, and it is sometimes interpreted as evidence of non-rational \"motivated reasoning\". We consider scenarios in which this effect arises in a model of rational decision making which includes the possibility of deceptive information. In particular, we will consider a model in which there are two classes of voters, which we will call trusting voters and suspicious voters, and two types of information sources, which we will call unbiased sources and biased sources. In our model, new data about a candidate can be efficiently incorporated by a trusting voter, and anomalous updates are impossible; however, anomalous updates can be made by suspicious voters, if the information source mistakenly plans for an audience of trusting voters, and if the partisan goals of the information source are known by the suspicious voter to be \"opposite\" to his own. Our model is based on a formalism introduced by the artificial intelligence community called \"multi-agent influence diagrams\", which generalize Bayesian networks to settings involving multiple agents with distinct goals.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 15:45:11 GMT  (391kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2558v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["william w cohen", "david p redlawsk", "douglas pierce"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.2558"}, "pdf": {"name": "1306.2558.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Effect of Biased Communications On Both Trusting and Suspicious Voters", "authors": ["William W.

Sik measures how similar two positions are. Yik is a measure of the support of k that is chosen by voters i to maximize i's usefulness. The Ui utility for voters i is a function of how appropriate Yik is. Finally, Dk is some data on the probabilities generated according to the value of Tk.

However, a more reasonable situation is that Dk and Ti are known to i, but the true position of the candidate can only be indirectly derived from Dk. Fortunately, with standard Bayes network calculations we can also easily give a distribution over Yik Dk. First, note that we P (Dk = d) = beliefs P (Dk = d) P (Tk = t \u2032) P (Tk = t \u2032) P (Tk \u2032) and that the use of Bayes ruleP (Tk = t | Tk = t | P) = P (Dk = d | Tk = t = t) P (Dk = t \u00b2 s \u00b2 s \u00b2."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Positive information increases support", "text": "In a number of recent policy-making studies, it has been observed that negative information about a candidate k influences (rather than weakens) triple turnout.

In this model, there is a punk j =, which, like a voter, has a target candidate position Tj.

(Bk) We assume that Bk will provoke a vote Yik according to the trustworthy voter model Yik. (The utility assigned by j for this result is a function of the vote Yik, the similarity of Sjk to its target Tj, and a \"reputable cost\" Rjk, which is a function of Ck and Bk. For example, Rjk will be zero if bk = ck, and otherwise a measure of how embarrassing it might be if its deception was generated with the replacement of a model."}, {"heading": "4.2 Suspicious voters", "text": "Finally, we present a model for a \"suspicious voter\" SuV (Yik Bk = bk) that is intuitively simple. As before, we assume that j bk votes according to the prejudiced punk model of Eq. 6 - i.e. that j believes to be a trustworthy voter. The suspicious voter will then try to argue correctly with this model, and the probabilities calculated in this model will be called P SuV. This suspicious punk model does not have an easy solution in closed form for P SuV (S), as in the trustworthy voter model. The generative process for the suspicious voter model is identical to the prejudiced punk model, except that according to SuV.6's Bk model, i will select a value of Yik from a distribution P SuV (Yik Bk = bk) that we select using the biased punk model."}, {"heading": "4.3 Implications of the suspicious voter model", "text": "To simplify further analysis, we will make some additional assumptions. \u2022 We assume a deterministic cost of reputation function fR = = = b = = in the biased Pandit model, that the cost of reputation for accuracy is zero, i.e. that the utility (c, c) = 0, and that the utility of the voter is greater than zero, i.e., we assume that the utility of the voter is equal to the utility of the voter, less the reputational cost of changing from c to b - i.e. that fU BiP (r, y) is the utility (s, y) and fUBiP. \u2212 rGiven these assumptions, some observations can now be made.

We will show that this is possible. (Theorem 2) However, it may be the case that information b will decrease support for k in the trusted voter model and increase support for k in the suspicious voter model. (It may be that EPTrV [Yik = b] < EPTrV [Yik] but EPSuV [Yik | Dk = b] > EPSuV [Yik] > support for k in the suspicious voter model. Intuitively, this happens when i strongly believes that j is fraudulent and i has different candidate preferences from j. Theorem claims the existence of such behavior, so we are free to make additional assumptions (preferably those that could be imagined in reality)."}, {"heading": "5 Concluding Remarks", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own, without putting themselves in danger."}], "references": [{"title": "The social calculus of voting: Interpersonal, media, and organizational influences on presidential choices", "author": ["P.A.
