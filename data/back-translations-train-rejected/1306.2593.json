We propose an alphabet as markers in the phonetic subspace, aiming for a resolution sufficient to support recognition of all spoken languages. The prosodic subspace is made up of directly measurable physical variables. With the proposed alphabet, traditional diphthongs naturally generalize to a broader class of language-neutral phonotactic constraints, indicating a correlation structure similar to that of the traditional sonority-based syllable. We define a stochastic structure on the phone strings based on this diphthongal constraint, and show how a specific spoken language can be defined as a specific set of probability distributions of this stochastic structure. Furthermore, phonological variations within a spoken language can be modeled as varying probability distributions restricted to the phonetic subspace, conditioned on different values in the prosodic subspace.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 17:48:01 GMT  (472kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2593v1", "6 pages, 10 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 10 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL", "authors": ["elaine tsiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.2593"}, "pdf": {"name": "1306.2593.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A 10-dimensional Phonetic-prosodic Space and its Stochastic Structure A framework for probabilistic modeling of spoken languages and their phonology", "authors": ["Elaine Tsiang"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "It is a fundamental assumption of phonetics that there is a space of articulating gestures that encompasses all spoken languages. From this space, a particular language selects a series of differences in these gestures to represent the bits required to encode its lexicon, implying that this gestural space is finer-grained than the recognized articulating repertories of certain languages. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) defines this gestural space through markers that support the production of gestures sufficiently to support all spoken languages. Here, we define the space for the perception of these gestures in a sufficiently fine resolution to cover the search space of all linguistic-specific objects of recognition. That is, it supports narrow phonetic-prosodic transcriptions of all languages."}, {"heading": "2.

The phonetic subspace", "text": "We use the names of the traditional phonetic attributes of the way, frontBack, openClose and place to label the four dimensions of the perceptual phonetic space.

Proposed phonetic markers", "text": "We show only the diagrams for glottal friction as representative of all manners of PharynGlottals and similarly only velare for the velarUvulars, the other manners and places are analogous. We show all PALs except for closures. The closures for all values of the place have the same frontBack openClose sub-spaces as the corresponding frictions and are represented by including the corresponding symbol. \"Note that we do not distinguish between spoken and unspoken telephones, and the symbols that have a connotation in the IPA have no such connotation in the IHA. It is known that the spoken vs. unspoken distinction in different languages have different voice minutes [6]. Also, the identification of intonations with periodicity is problematic. Whispering language preserves the perceived difference between spoken and unspoken telephones."}, {"heading": "2.2.1. The vowels", "text": "The IHA considers the vowels to be glottal, making the traditional large gap between vowels and consonants merely a space difference. However, the vowels of the IHA do not treat the non-pulmonary IPA phones due to a lack of data. They are unique in that they have no other place than glottal, and only the glottal place has vowel centers. The glottal vowel subreviation frontBack openClose is identical to the IPA vowel space. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the IPA vowels and the IHA vowels. However, notoriously, the rounded or non-rounded twins are marked with the corresponding rounder (for example) or less rounded (for example u) diacritics."}, {"heading": "2.2.2. The pharynGlottals", "text": "However, the vowels are less unique in the IHA than in the IPA. Firstly, the glottal frontBack openClose subspace, as shown in Table 1, lends a similar aura to the other glottal manners, yielding as many glottal registers, glottal fricatives and glottal approximants as vowels. Secondly, the other pharynGlottals also have a similar aura frontBack openClose subspaces. (The pharynGlottals have no nasals.) In this way, the pharynGlottal plosives, fricatives and approximants can all serve as \"syllables.\" In addition, all the diacritical markings of the IPA for glottalization and pharyngealization are simply pharynGlottals of different frontBack and openClose values, which may lie between a phone and a vowel, or stand alone. Symbols for glottal closures are obtained by replacing the corresponding vowel symbol with \"for example\" glottal \"and\" glottal. \""}, {"heading": "2.2.3. The velarUvulars", "text": "The velaruvulary frontBack openClose subspaces are narrower than the pharynGlottals. The labialized velar, which is considered as an approximate outside the IPA diagram for pulmonary consonants, is simply the narrow posterior velar in the IHA. The IPA lateral velar is also the nearby mid-back velar (thus re-assigning one of the phones to the IPA in the lateral manner).Since we use the same inscription for velarUvulars as for pharynGlottals, we have enclosed the corresponding IPA symbols in brackets. The nasal and explosive closeMid backLike velars are not present in the IPA. The velars with different frontBack and openClosar values also represent the IPA symbols in brackets."}, {"heading": "2.2.4.

Co-articulation", "text": "The labialized velars are already in the velar subspace, so co-articulation does not need to be specifically labeled.

The prosodic subspace", "text": "Instead of defining stress, a complex observability, we present the volume (L) of the phone. Sound (T) is simply pitch. D, T, and L are all represented in quantified logarithmic units. Together with intonation (V) on / off, nasalization (N) on / off, and rounding (R), they form the 6 dimensions of the prosodic subspace. Our distinction between the phonetic and the prosodic does not coincide with the conventional distinction of the phonetic as lexical contradiction for language as code, and the prosodic as qualitative indicator of emotions that are not achieved for many spoken languages. Nor does duration, volume, and pitch coincide with the conventional meanings of symmetric length, stress, and intonation."}, {"heading": "4.

Generalized diphthongs", "text": "Textbooks usually define a diphthong as a transition between two vowels within a syllable. A second common definition assumes at least one of the vowels [e], [] or [o] to one of the two approximate values, [j] or []. This second formulation indicates that there is a correlation between the way that decreases from the vowel to the approximate vowel, openClose, tends to the front or back, and the place that goes from the pharynthos to the PALs. In the IHA, each way has a FrontBack openClose. If we extend the movement from the vowel to the approximate value, we immediately get a broad class of phonotactics. For example, [pig] would be a generalized diphthong, but [fl] it would not be, although it is the incipient version of [lf] that would be based on phonotactics."}, {"heading": "4.2.

Modeling specific languages", "text": "For a specific spoken language, the conditional probability distributions of the phones in beginnings and rhymes would be anything but uniform, resulting in the distinctive syllables, words and possibly higher linguistic units in that language. These unequal distributions can be used to define this specific spoken language. Distributions in the phonetic subspace define the recognized phonemes of that language. In the prosodic subspace, at the lexical level, they dictate how distinctive prosodic dimensions such as intonation or pitch are involved in contrast or not."}, {"heading": "4.4. Modeling phonological variations", "text": "Textbook statements of a language usually cite examples of words, phrases, etc. within the normative ranges for the prosodic variables, especially volume, speed, and pitch, for normal or formal discourses. However, from these normative ranges, especially for increasing volume, speed, and pitch, the execution of speech gestures is increasingly physically limited. Same variations, even at lower probabilities in normal discourse, tend to straighten and shorten, realizing the higher conditional probabilities for these variations due to the louder, faster, or more shrill articulations. The same variations, even at lower probabilities in normal discourse, can trigger long-term deviations in spoken languages."}, {"heading": "5.
