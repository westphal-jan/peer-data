The text sensor takes into account textual similarities between the content of the documents associated with a candidate and the query topics in order to make expert assessments. If there is text evidence for a candidate in which the query topics occur frequently, then it is likely that this candidate is an expert in the topic expressed by the query. The profile sensor takes into account the amount of publications a candidate has made during his or her career. Highly productive candidates are more likely to be considered experts. Finally, the citation sensor takes into account the impact of a candidate in the scientific community and also relies on linkage structures, such as citation graphics, to determine the candidate's knowledge. Candidates with high citation patterns are accepted as experts.The multi-sensor approach proposed in this paper consists of two different fusion processes: (one), each of which is covered by a second sensor event, each of which a different sensor system is associated with a specific event."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Rank Aggregation Fusion Process", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to feel how they want to, and that they will be able to abide by the rules that they have set themselves, \"he said in an interview with the New York Times."}, {"heading": "3.2 The MultiSensor Fusion Process", "text": "The multi-sensor fusion process is responsible for calculating all the mass functions required by the Dempster Shafer Framework, and for calculating the amount of information each sensor contributes to the system through Shannon's entropy formula. This process is illustrated in Figure 4.After the events captured by a number of candidates have been detected and merged, each sensor has a ranking in which the candidates it assumed to be experts come out on top. However, most of the leading experts in these lists disagree, leading to a conflict that needs to be addressed in order to reach a final decision. The Dempster Shafer is then used to calculate the mass functions of each sensor m (a)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Example", "text": "When a user submits a query with a topic of interest, each sensor is responsible for recognizing specific events related to the relationship between a candidate and the query. To give a clear example of how the proposed system works, we assume that a user does not want to know the top experts in information retrieval. The first step of our system is to retrieve all authors who have the query topics in their publications or abstracts. To simplify matters, we assume that the system has only found three authors with such terms: Autor1, Autor2 and Autor3.Each author has a set of documents that are related to them. Each sensor is responsible for recognizing different types of information in these documents. The text sensor recognizes various events such as term frequency, inverse document frequency, BM25, etc. The profile sensor on the other hand is responsible for recognizing the entire publication record of the candidate. And the co-citation sensor must detect events such as the number of work of the author, the number of quotes, the number of candidates, etc."}, {"heading": "4 The Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence", "text": "The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence provides a way of associating uncertainties with sets of hypotheses when the individual hypotheses are imprecise or unknown (Shocken and Humme, 1993).

To confirm this hypothesis, we experimented our multi-sensor approach with various data fusion techniques and compared it to the ranking framework using the same fusion algorithms. Table 13 presents the results obtained for the three sensors proposed, namely the text similarity sensor, the profile information sensor, and the cite sensor. The results in Table 13 show that our multi-sensor approach, using the Dempster Shafer framework, exceeded the general ranking approach. If two sensors do not match, it is difficult to make a final decision whether a candidate is an expert or not. In these situations, a standard ranking approach simply ignores the conflict and applies a data fusion technology to combine the values of the two sensors."}, {"heading": "7.2 Determining the Impact of the Different Sensors in the MultiSensor Approach", "text": "The data gathered in the previous experiment showed that the proposed multi-sensor approach in combination with the Condorcet Fusion algorithm achieved the best results by combining three sensors: the text similarity sensor, the profile information sensor and the citation sensor. In this experiment, we are interested in determining the impact of the different sensors in our multi-sensor approach. To confirm this, we tested our multi-sensor approach separately along with (i) the text similarity and the profile sensors, (ii) the text similarity and the citation sensors, and (iii) the profile and the citation sensors. Table 14 shows that the best results were obtained when the text similarity sensor cooperates with the citation sensor. This means that the presence of the query topics in the author's document, together with information on the author's impact in the scientific community, plays an important role."}, {"heading": "7.3 Performance of the MultiSensor Approach in the Enriched DBLP Dataset", "text": "In this experiment, we are looking at the performance of our multi-sensor approach in enriched datasets, more precisely in the enriched version of the DBLP dataset. Results are presented in Table 15.Table 15 that our multi-sensor approach, together with the Condorcet Fusion algorithm, delivered the best performance, an improvement of more than 46% over the standard rank aggregation approach using the same fusion algorithm. Although our multi-sensor fusion approach using the Dempster shafer outperformed all other standard rank aggregation methods, we cannot conclude that our approach is better as no statistical significance was found. In a separate experiment, we also tried to determine which combinations of sensors provided the best results for this dataset. Table 16 shows the statistical results obtained. In this experiment, the best results were obtained when the similarity of the text or the specific results with the presence of the author are so strong in the connection."}, {"heading": "7.4 Comparison with State of the Art", "text": "In this experiment, we looked at the state-of-the-art effects of our multi-sensor approach. Table 17 presents the results of the basic models proposed by K. Balog (Balog et al., 2006), namely the candidate model 1 and the document-based model 2. To make the comparison fair, we used the code provided by K. Balog at http: / / code.google.com / p / ea. Experiments showed that Model 1 and Model 2 performed similarly in such a data set, but performed less well compared to the multisensor approach. In Model 1, when an author publishes an essay that contains a set of words that match the topics in question, this author scores very highly in this model. Moreover, since we are dealing with very large data sets, there are many authors in such a situation, and as a result, the best-placed authors are dominated by non-experts, while the real experts are ranked lower in the rankings, because we only see the respective titles and some of the summaries in the respective summaries."}, {"heading": "7.5 Comparison with State of the Art Supervised Approaches", "text": "This year, it will be able to leave the country and move into a new world."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "We have a multi-sensor approach using the Dempster Shafer Theory of Uncertainty. To extract different sources of knowledge from these documents, we have defined three sensors: a text similarity sensor, a profile sensor, and a number sensor. The text sensor collects events that are more likely to be considered experts, and the number sensor uses the authority of the candidates and the documents assigned to a candidate. The profile sensor measures the total number of candidates over the course of their career."}], "references": [{"title": "A language modeling framework for expert finding", "author": ["K. Balog", "L.
