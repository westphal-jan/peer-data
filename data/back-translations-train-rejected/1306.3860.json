However, it was only since the 1990s that there has been a significant increase in the number of methods developed. We begin by presenting one of the most groundbreaking projection methods, the metric MDS [26]. Then we refer to Sammon's mapping [27] and the local MDS (LMDS) [28] to the functioning of the standard MDS. The central objective of MDS-based methods is to project high-dimensional data xj onto a two-dimensional data vector yj by maintaining distances. Let's call the distance in the entrance space between xj and xh denoted dx (MDS)."}, {"heading": "C.
