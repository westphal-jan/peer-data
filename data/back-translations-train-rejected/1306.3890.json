The SP system has potential for the discovery of 'natural' structures in big data at various levels of abstraction, including recurrent patterns and associations, and discontinuous dependencies in data. Potential applications include the discovery of recurrent patterns in economics-related data, in meteorological data, in DNA sequences and amino-acid sequences, and in associations between biochemical structures and diseases. Since information compression is at the heart of the SP system, and since the system has potential to achieve relatively high levels of compression, it may achieve useful reductions in the volume of big data and thus facilitate its storage and management. There is potential for substantial economies in the transmission of big data, and for the efficient processing of compressed data, without the need for decompression. In the interpretation of data, the SP system has capabilities that include such things as the parsing and production of language, pattern recognition, and various kinds of probabilistic reasoning. But potentially the most useful facility with big data would be scanning for patterns, with recognition of family-resemblance or polythetic categories, at multiple levels of abstraction and with part-whole hierarchies, with inductive prediction and the calculation of associated probabilities, with a role for context in recognition, and robust in the face of errors of omission, commission or substitution. There are potential applications in several areas including, security, criminal investigations, finance, meteorology, and astronomy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Jun 2013 13:15:41 GMT  (9kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3890v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 20 Feb 2014 16:34:23 GMT  (62kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3890v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 18 Mar 2014 17:18:20 GMT  (69kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3890v3", null], ["v4", "Mon, 31 Mar 2014 19:45:42 GMT  (139kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3890v4", "Accepted for publication in IEEE Access"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j gerard wolff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.3890"}, "pdf": {"name": "1306.3890.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Big Data and the SP Theory of Intelligence", "authors": ["J Gerard Wolff"], "emails": ["jgw@cognitionresearch.org."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "III.

However, for the reasons stated in Section III, it is likely that some of these formalisms or formats will never be replaced or will coexist with the representation and processing by the UFK. \u2022 Translation into the universal framework. Where a stock of information is expressed in one or more non-standardized forms, but is needed in the standard form, it can be translated.

The SP computer model (SP70, [4, Chapter 9], [3, Section 5]) has already demonstrated the ability to detect generative grammars from unsegmented samples of English art languages, including segmental structures, classes of structures, and abstract patterns. In its current form, it exhibits deficiencies outlined in Section 3.3, Section 3.3].

A ROAD MAP", "text": "As mentioned in Section II, it is envisaged that the SP computer model will form the basis for the development of a new version of the SP machine. How things can develop is schematically illustrated in Figure 6. It is envisaged that this new version will be realized as a virtual software machine hosted on an existing supercomputer, that it will have a high degree of parallelism, that it will be accessible from anywhere in the world via a user-friendly interface, that all software will be open source, and that users will be able to create new versions of the system. This highly parallel open source version of the SP machine will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to create new versions of it. As convincingly argued in [2, chapters 5 and 6] and as reflected in this article in Sections IX-A3 and IX-B, it will probably be necessary to get a grip on the development of new architectures for processors."}, {"heading": "XIII. CONCLUSION", "text": "The SP system, designed to simplify and integrate concepts relating to artificial intelligence, mainstream computing and human perception and cognition, has potential in the management and analysis of big data. The SP system has potential as a universal framework for the representation and processing of different types of knowledge (UFK) and contributes to reducing the problem of the diversity of big data: the wide variety of formalities and formats for knowledge and its processing. The system can discover \"natural\" structures in big data, and it has strengths in the interpretation of data, including such things as pattern recognition, processing natural language, different types of reasoning and much more. It is suitable for the analysis of streaming data and helps to overcome the problem of speed in big data. Apart from several indirect advantages described in this article, the information compression in the SP system should bring direct benefits in the storage, management and transmission of big data by reducing it by transferring data."}, {"heading": "XIV.

It has strengths in the unsupervised learning or discovery of structure in data, in pattern recognition, in the parsing and production of natural language, in several kinds of reasoning, and more. It lends itself to the analysis of streaming data, helping to overcome the problem of velocity in big data. Central in the workings of the system is lossless compression of information: making big data smaller and reducing problems of storage and management. There is potential for substantial economies in the transmission of data, for big cuts in the use of energy in computing, for faster processing, and for smaller and lighter computers. The system provides a handle on the problem of veracity in big data, with potential to assist in the management of errors and uncertainties in data. It lends itself to the visualisation of knowledge structures and inferential processes. A high-parallel, open-source version of the SP machine would provide a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to create new versions of it.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
