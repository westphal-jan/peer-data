INTRODUCTION", "text": "A natural language interface to a database (NLIDB) is a system that translates a sentence in natural language (e.g. Punjabi) into a database query. (Androutsopoulos et al., 1995 [1]).NLIDB closes the gap between the languages used by humans and computer systems, since a person without knowledge of database languages can easily and conveniently access the database. NLIDB can be considered a classic problem in the field of natural language processing. [11] A person without knowledge of structured query language (SQL) can see himself obstructed when extracting data from a database management system (DBMS) such as MS Access, Oracle and others. Therefore, companies like Elfsoft (English Language Frontend Software) have developed SQL tutors so that people can interact with the database in simple English instead of learning the syntax of the query language."}, {"heading": "2. INTELLIGENT DATABASE SYSTEM (IDBS)", "text": "An intelligent database [13] is a full-text database that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and interacts with the user to ensure that returned items (hits) contain the most relevant information. Intelligent Database Systems (IDBS) integrate the resources of both RDBMSs and KBSs to provide a natural way to handle information, making it easy to store, retrieve and apply. [11] \"Intelligent Database Systems (IDBS) built from the integration of database technologies (DB) with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques\" [12] 2.1 An ideal IDBS should use [11]: knowledge and conclusions to make it easier to retrieve, view and make decisions with information because more people can use the system because of its ease of use."}, {"heading": "3 TYPES OF INTERFACES", "text": "A user interface is the view of a database interface that is seen by the user."}, {"heading": "3.1 Form-based Interfaces:", "text": "This interface consists of user-customized forms. Users can fill in all fields and add new entries to the database. They are easy to use and have the advantage that the user does not need any special knowledge of database languages such as SQL."}, {"heading": "3.2 Text-based Interfaces:", "text": "Via this interface, users communicate directly with the DBMS in the query language via an input / output window. Text-based interfaces are very powerful tools and enable comprehensive interaction with a DBMS. Their use, however, is based on active knowledge of the respective database language. For example: SQL.3.3 GIS interface: A GIS user interface often integrates features of a database interface. Database interaction occurs by combining different interfaces: Graphical interaction via a selection on the card Combination of form-based and text-based interaction (e.g. special query wizards for easier creation of database queries).

COMPONENTS OF NLIDB", "text": "The problem of accessing a database in natural language is divided into two sub-components: Language component Database component"}, {"heading": "4.1 Linguistic Component:", "text": "This component translates the monolingual input sentence into a formal query and then generates a natural speech response after a database search."}, {"heading": "4.2 Database Component:", "text": "Natural language database systems use syntactic knowledge and knowledge of the actual database to correctly relate the input of natural language to the structure and content of that database. Questions entered in natural language are translated into a formal query, which is then processed by the database management system, and after editing, the result is returned to the natural language component, where generation routines generate a surface language version of the answer."}, {"heading": "5. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF NLIDB", "text": "This section discusses some advantages and disadvantages of NLIDBS and compares them with different types of interfaces."}, {"heading": "5.1 ADVANTAGES OF NLIDB:  No need to learn Artificial Communication", "text": "Language Less training required Easy handling of negations and quantification types of questions Easy handling for multiple database tables Easy and efficient query tolerances for minor grammatical errors."}, {"heading": "5.2 DISADVANTAGES OF NLIDB:  Deals with limited set of natural language", "text": "Linguistic versus conceptual failure Users assume intelligence from Inappropriate medium Lengthy configuration"}, {"heading": "6. APPROACHES FOR DEVELOPMENT", "text": ""}, {"heading": "6.1 Symbolic Approach (Rule Based Approach)", "text": "Knowledge of language is explicitly encoded in rules or other forms of representation. Language is analyzed at various levels in order to obtain information. On the basis of this information obtained, certain rules are applied to achieve linguistic functionality. Rules are established for each level of linguistic analysis. An attempt is made to grasp the meaning of language on the basis of these rules."}, {"heading": "6.2 Empirical Approach (Corpus Based Approach)", "text": "A corpus is a collection of machine-readable text. Corpora serve primarily as a source of information about language. This approach is based on statistical analysis as well as other data-driven analysis of raw data available in the form of text corpora. Empirical or body-based methods automate the acquisition of much of the complex knowledge required for NLP by training it on appropriately commented natural language corpora, such as tree banks of parsed sentences. Various statistical techniques such as hidden Markov models, probabilistic context-free grammars, etc. are used by most empirical NLP methods."}, {"heading": "6.3 Connectionist Approach (Using Artificial Neural Network):", "text": "Since human language skills are based on neural networks in the brain, Artificial Neural Network provides an essential starting point for modeling language processing. Instead of symbols, the approach is based on distributed representations that correspond to statistical laws in language. However, there has been relatively little sub-symbolic learning in recent linguistic research, although some newer systems have successfully used decision tree transformation rules and other symbolic methods. John Carter Wendelken's SHRUTI system is a neutrally inspired system for event modeling and temporal processing at the connectionist level."}, {"heading": "7. ARCHITECTURE OF NLIDB", "text": ""}, {"heading": "7.1 Pattern Matching Systems", "text": "In pattern matching systems, some rules and patterns are defined first. These patterns and rules are fixed. It is stated in the rules that if an input word or sentence is matched with the given pattern, the action has been performed. The main advantage of the pattern matching approach is its simplicity: no complex parsing and interpretation modules are required, and the system is easy to implement. E.g.: SANVY system. [1]"}, {"heading": "7.2 Syntax-Based Systems", "text": "Syntax-based systems use a grammar that describes the possible syntactical structures of the user's questions. The main advantage of syntax-based approaches is that they provide detailed information about the structure of a sentence, e.g.: LUNAR system. [1]"}, {"heading": "7.3 Semantic Grammar Systems", "text": "The basic idea of this system is to simplify the parse tree as much as possible by removing unnecessary nodes or combining some nodes together. Compared to the syntax-based approach, this approach is less ambiguous. The main disadvantage of this approach is that it requires some prior knowledge of the elements in the domain, making it difficult to port it to other domains. A parse tree in this system has specific structures and unique node names that could hardly be useful for other applications. [6]"}, {"heading": "7.4 Intermediate Representation Languages", "text": "In this approach, the system can be divided into two parts: one part starts with a sentence until a logical query is generated; the other part starts with a logical query until a database query is generated. The intermediate logical query expresses the meaning of the user's question in relation to high-level world concepts that are independent of the database structure. Subsequently, the logical query is translated into an expression in the database query language and evaluated against the database. (SQL) An example of the architecture of the intermediate language is Masque / sql [1]."}, {"heading": "8. EXISTING PUNJABI LANGUAGE INTERFACE TO DATABASE REVIEW:", "text": "In India, research is carried out on this subject in many Indian languages such as Hindi, Punjabi, Malayalam, Bengali, etc. Punjabi language is being developed at Thapar University in Patiala. [3] The system used the agricultural sector with farmer, harvest and sales tables. It accepts queries in Punjabi language which are translated into SQL queries by mapping the words of the Punjabi language, with the corresponding English words maintained using the database."}, {"heading": "8.1 Architecture", "text": "The architecture of this system is divided into three phases: tokenization of query mapping and creation of SQL Query Execution of Query."}, {"heading": "8.2 Queries Handled", "text": "This system has been tested for three types of queries: Queries to select all columns Queries to select certain columns Queries to select certain rows from certain columns CONCLUSION The existing Punjabi language interface to the database system [3] has a limited scope. It is domain-dependent and uses only a few tables and simple selection queries. In the future, the existing Punjabi language interface to the database system, developed by Thapar University, Patiala [3], can be expanded to perform queries that merge tables and handle various clauses. It can be designed domain-independent. Developing an interface for administrators This existing system accepts queries only in the appropriate format. To make the system accept all queries, we can use Punjabiparser."}], "references": [{"title": "Natural Language Interfaces to Databases \u2013 An Introduction, Journal of Natural Language Engineering 1 Part", "author": ["Androutsopoulos", "G.D.
