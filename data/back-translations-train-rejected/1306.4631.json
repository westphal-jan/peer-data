In general, book tables of contents are multi-page documents. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize the table of contents page for easy navigation of multi-page documents and also to speed up the retrieval of information for desirable data from the multi-page document. All table of contents pages follow different layouts, different ways of presenting the contents of the document such as chapter, section, subsection, etc. This paper presents a new method for recognizing table of contents using machine learning technology with different characteristics. With the main goal of recognizing table of contents pages, the document is structured according to its contents.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "As today's era moves from the physical object to the digital, all documents such as newsletters, journals and book documents are digitally available in the digital library, and it becomes a common need for all of us. All digitally available books are formatted with table of contents for their organization of contents. In other words, TOC is simply a collection of references to individual articles of a document, no matter what layout it follows. Table of contents includes the title or description of the section and subsection. Along with this content, it also shows the order in which the content appears. It is a great way to organize the contents of a multipage document. It is also an easy way for the user to navigate the pages of the document. In order to retrieve the intended parts as requested by the users, users must go through table of contents. Thus, it requires recognition of the table of contents of the page. Generally, all tables of contents of the pages have different layout structure."}, {"heading": "2. LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "To discover a new approach, different approaches can be combined. S. Mandal et al. [1] proposes a method for TOC recognition based on a morphological algorithm. Here, the first step is to identify TOC based on the search for page numbers related to the names of sections, subsections or chapters. In this first step, the method consists of finding word alos, then finding the most right-hand word, and then recognizing TOC. This method is based on determining the page number and other text layouts using decision structure. Adna Ul-Hasan et al. [2] proposes a method for TOC recognition based on OCR-free recognition. The first step consists in binarized document mapping. Numbers and other text layouts are then extracted using MLP classifiers. Then, the distribution of digits on a page is estimated by vertical projection."}, {"heading": "3. APPLICATIONS OF TOC DETECTION", "text": "Adna Ul-Hasan et al [2] shows that the identified TOC is useful to improve the accuracy of other techniques for understanding documents, for example:"}, {"heading": "1. Advertisement Detection", "text": "The identified TOC can be fed into the Ad Search Component to identify ad pages. In this type of application, TOC pages can be used to: a) mark pages that appear in the TOC as article pages, b) Generally, pages are before TOC pages are ad pages."}, {"heading": "2. Title Detection", "text": "A TOC page offers the possibility to find the title of the article from the text of the TOC pages. Generally, the most important title that the editor wants to use to attract the attention of the reader is placed on the TOC page."}, {"heading": "3. For easy retrieval of information as demanded by user.", "text": "As a user who wishes to retrieve certain information, we can locate this information from the table of contents page, making it easier to retrieve the requested information."}, {"heading": "4. Navigation to specific page document is also become easy and fast.", "text": "Since the user wants to retrieve certain information from the specific page number, navigation to that specific page number becomes easy. All topics are organized into table of contents page with page number."}, {"heading": "5. Table of content pages can also be detected from magazines and journals.", "text": "Table of contents pages can also be recognized from various multi-page documents that follow different layouts of content. For example, journal and journal have a different layout than book documents."}, {"heading": "6. Avoiding Ctrl-F for finding specific topic from multi-page document.", "text": "Normally in e-books, tables of contents are searched by Ctrl-F. So whenever it is necessary to search content, we must search by Ctrl-F. This is disabled in some documents that are merely scanned copies. Therefore, the proposed system provides an easy way to automatically search content.7 For the individual publication of the book, we need to recognize the ToC page in order to customize the book. Custom publishing provides the ability to merge the different modules from different books."}, {"heading": "4. PROBLEM STATEMENT", "text": "For the automatic detection of the table of contents, we apply machine learning. In particular, the decision tree algorithm is applied to e-books or digital libraries. Finally, we calculate the general accuracy based on various attributes such as the presence of the title term, font of the title term, font class of the title term, number of context-dependent terms, normalized frequency of the line beginning with the number, normalized frequency of the line ending with the number, are all English numbers in ascending order and normalized line position of the title term. Many different approaches are available to identify the TOC pages of a multi-page document. Most of the approach refers to specific format characteristics to identify TOC pages for a specific class of documents only. Like decorative elements such as page numbering, chapters, section and subsection numbering of the title term."}, {"heading": "5. CHARACTERISTICS OF TOC PAGE", "text": "1. TOCs are generally available as a whole page in books and reports. It can also be part of a page; some TOCs are available with logos and headlines and all other texts.2. Generally, most columns on the right contain the digits, i.e. page numbers. But it is not necessary that this format is always maintained in every document. It may also be that the page number appears shortly after the name of the sections and sub-section headings. 3. The leftmost columns usually have the section and sub-section numbers. The world gap between the title and the section number is much larger than the normal word gaps. 4. Dotted lines or thin lines appear at regular intervals on the TOC pages. These dotted lines or thin lines show the correlations between the end of the text line and the corresponding page numbers at the right edge of most columns. 5. TOC pages can have multi-line titles. Many TOCs are available with horizontal dividing lines."}, {"heading": "6. PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "As shown in Figure 1, different approaches to implementing the system are available. All chosen approaches are described below. Machine LearningMachine Learning is defined as the art of developing computer programs so that they can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data without being explicitly programmed to do so. Work is to automatically detect ToC pages, so that machine learning provides the efficient path to automation.Figure 1: Flow of Proposed ApproachA ClassificationClassification is a task to assign class labels based on unclassified cases, based on training kits. Classification is a formal method for repeatedly making judgments in new situations.Here is the work of recognizing ToC pages from e-books, dividing pages into ToC and non-ToC pages."}, {"heading": "B Supervised Learning", "text": "Supervised learning means that the results or possible outcomes are already known at an advanced stage from the training data set. Here, the work is done first with the training of the system and then the system learns by itself. Thus, in the training process, the possible outcomes will be well known in advance. C Decision TreeDecision tree is a structure that can be used to split a large collection of data sets into smaller sets one after the other by applying a sequence of simple decision rules. Decision tree provides human interpretability so that it will be easy to train the system."}, {"heading": "7. FLOW OF PROPOSED SYSTEM", "text": "1. Digital library with offline pdf's or another document. 2. Select 15-30% pages of individual document pages. 3. Described TOC and NON-TOC accordingly. 4. Train the system with different attributes of page layout. 5. Feed a new document to test the system 6. Observe the data learned for system performance. As shown in Fig. 2, the proposed system uses the digital library or any multipage document as input. To identify the table of contents, 15-30% pages are first selected from the entire document and given to the system as input. All selected pages are labeled as ToC and NON-ToC accordingly. The labeling is done manually for system training. Train the system with different attributes of content recognition. Content index pages have several different attributes."}, {"heading": "8. PROPOSED ALGORITHM", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to outdo themselves, most of them are not able to put themselves in the position they are in, most of them are able to put themselves in the position they are in, most of them are able to put themselves in the position they are in, most of them are not able to put themselves in the position they are in, most of them are not able to put themselves in the position they are in, to put themselves in the position they are able to survive."}, {"heading": "11. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced professionals with an approach to TOC recognition using a decision tree algorithm with machine learning. To recognize the table of contents, various attributes are derived, such as the presence of the title term, font of the title term, font class of the title term, number of contextual terms, normalized frequency of the Toc section, normalized frequency of the line beginning with the number, normalized frequency of the end of the line with the number, If all English numbers are in ascending order and normalized line position of the title term, all attributes are specified and explained. These attributes are applied to the table of contents recognition. Future work consists in implementing the proposed system and measuring the accuracy of the table of contents recognition."}], "references": [{"title": "Automated Detection and segmentation of Table of Contents Page from Document Images", "author": ["S.Mandal", "S.P.Chowdhury", "A.K.Das", "B.Chanda"], "venue": "Proc.
