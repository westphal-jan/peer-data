The decomposition models the room assignment subproblem as a generalized lexicographic bottleneck optimization problem (GLBOP). We show that the GLBOP can be solved in polynomial time if the corresponding sum optimization problem can be solved in polynomial time as well. Thus, the room assignment subproblem of the MMF-CB-CTT problem can be solved efficiently. We apply this result to a previously proposed heuristic algorithm for the MMF-CB-CTT problem, in which solving the room assignment subproblem is a key ingredient. Our experimental results indicate that using the proposed decomposition improves the performance of the algorithm on most of the 21 ITC2007 test instances with respect to the quality of the best solution found and the average solution quality. Furthermore, we introduce a measure for the quality of a solution to a (generalized) lexicographic bottleneck optimization problem. This measure helps to overcome some limitations imposed by the qualitative nature of max-min fairness and aids the statistical evaluation of the performance of randomized algorithms for such problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 12:54:50 GMT  (19kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5601v1", "16 pages, accepted for publication at the Multidisciplinary International Scheduling Conference 2013 (MISTA 2013)"], ["v2", "Sun, 25 Aug 2013 13:33:24 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5601v2", "revised version (fixed problems in the notation and general improvements); original paper: 16 pages, accepted for publication at the Multidisciplinary International Scheduling Conference 2013 (MISTA 2013)"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, accepted for publication at the Multidisciplinary International Scheduling Conference 2013 (MISTA 2013)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["moritz m\\\"uhlenthaler", "rolf wanka"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.5601"}, "pdf": {"name": "1306.5601.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Impact of Solving Subproblems to Optimality", "authors": ["Moritz M\u00fchlenthaler", "Rolf Wanka"], "emails": ["moritz.muehlenthaler@cs.fau.de", "rolf.wanka@cs.fau.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 130 6.56 01v2 [cs.AI] 2"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "In this section we will provide some relevant background information on fair resource allocation, timetables for university courses and the allocation problem."}, {"heading": "2.1 Fair Resource Allocation", "text": "Fairness comes into play when scarce resources are distributed across a range of stakeholders with demands. Fairness and how to measure it, for example, has received a lot of attention in economics, where the distribution of wealth and income is of interest. [11] In computer science, fairness aspects have been examined for example in the design of network communication protocols, especially in the context of bandwidth allocation and traffic design [18, 13]. Fairness aspects have been explicitly addressed for different types of planning problems, including personnel planning [29], sports planning [27], course planning [22] and flight planning [30]. In the context of resource allocation in general, fairness aspects of resource allocation in relation to fairness have been explicitly examined, e.g. for different types of planning problems, including personnel planning [22], and flight planning [30]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Curriculum-based Course Timetabling", "text": "In Section 3, we will focus on the decompositions of two specific variants of the academic course, the maximum duration of which is a fair conversion, MMF-CB-CTT problem proposed in [22].

MMF-CTT problem differs from the basic CB-CTT formulation only in terms of objective function. We will now introduce some terminology and state definitions that are relevant for the later stages of this thesis. A CB-CTT instance consists of a fixed approach, a fixed approach of a predetermined approach of a predetermined approach of a predetermined approach of a predetermined approach of a predetermined approach."}, {"heading": "2.3 The Assignment Problem", "text": "The assignment problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization that occurs in many applications, such as personnel planning, work scheduling, and object tracking, to name but a few. For a comprehensive overview of the research body on the assignment problem and the applications, see [5, 26]. In the CB-CTT problem, for example, the assignment problem appears as a subproblem [17, 20]. Polynomial time algorithms exist for many variants of the assignment problem. Leave A = {1,., n}, for some n-zeros. Matching the elements of A to the elements of B is a bijective assignment problem: A \u2192 B. Assignment problems are typically optimization problems, i. e, among all biprojections from A to B, we look for one that is optimal in relation to a certain objective function."}, {"heading": "3 Problem Decomposition", "text": "It is a common approach to solving the CB-CTT problem in a manner based on space and time span.

(In this section, we consider a similar result for the MMF-CTT problem. (2) We consider the division of the sum optimization into master and sub-problems so that the sub-problems can be solved efficiently.) We derive sufficient conditions under which such sum optimization transfers a problem to its generalized lexicographic comparison."}, {"heading": "4 Quantifying Max-min Fairness", "text": "When dealing with random optimization algorithms, we can use a wealth of statistical tools to extract meaningful information about the absolute and relative performance of the algorithms. These tools include statistical tests such as the Wilcoxon Ranking Test and metrics such as mean quality of solutions, median quality, quality of best and worst solutions, and so on. In this section, we propose a novel approach to partially overcoming this constraint. Similar to the problem (GLBOP) from the previous section, we consider combinatorial problems such as the cost of a feasible solution as finite multiset. The main idea is to construct an isomorphism from cost multisets, ordered by an interval of natural numbers, ordered by the usual < relationship."}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation", "text": "In this section, we will present experimental evidence for the usefulness of the two algorithms that we have both presented in relation to the problem.

Thus, we will refer to these algorithms used by MMF SA LSR LSR; and the second algorithms, MMMF SA GLBOP, which obtain the MMMF-CTT decomposition of Section 3 and thus the decomposition of Section 3 and thus the optimal spatial mapping for a certain period of time."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this thesis, we proposed a decomposition of the MMF-CB-CTT problem from [22]. Decomposition models the space allocation problem as an assignment problem with a generalized lexicographic bottleneck. Using this decomposition, the space allocation problem can be solved in polynomial time. We use this result to improve the performance of the MAXMINFAIR SA algorithm proposed in [22], which originally modeled the space allocation as LSAP. In our experiments, we compare the performance of two variants of the MAXMINFAIR SA algorithm, which differ in terms of the way the space allocation problem is performed. Our results suggest that the use of the decomposition proposed in Section 3 improves the performance of the MAXMINFAIR SA algorithm on most of the benchmark instances. Furthermore, we proposed a quantitative measurement, such as a fair analysis of how a MAXMAIR-AIR target will be applied to the AIR-MINFAIR result in order to achieve a fair schedule."}], "references": [{"title": "Design and statistical analysis of a hybrid local search algorithm for course timetabling", "author": ["Ruggero Bellio", "Luca DiGaspero", "Andrea Schaerf"], "venue": "Journal of Scheduling,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Partitioning procedures for solving mixed variables programming problems", "author": ["J.F.

a decomposition of the max-min fair curriculum-based course timetabling (MMF-CB-CTT) problem. The decomposition models the room assignment subproblem as a generalized lexicographic bottleneck optimization problem (LBOP). We show that the generalized LBOP can be solved efficiently if the corresponding sum optimization problem can be solved efficiently. As a consequence, the room assignment subproblem of the MMF-CB-CTT problem can be solved efficiently. We use this insight to improve a previously proposed heuristic algorithm for the MMF-CB-CTT problem. Our experimental results indicate that using the new decomposition improves the performance of the algorithm on most of the 21 ITC2007 test instances with respect to the quality of the best solution found. Furthermore, we introduce a measure of the quality of a solution to a max-min fair optimization problem. This measure helps to overcome some limitations imposed by the qualitative nature of max-min fairness and aids the statistical evaluation of the performance of randomized algorithms for such problems. We use this measure to show that using the new decomposition the algorithm outperforms the original one on most instances with respect to the average solution quality.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
