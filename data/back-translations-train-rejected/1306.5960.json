INTRODUCTION", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "2. FUZZY GENETIC", "text": "The fuzzification system developed here is a process that uses fuzzy rules to produce a fuzzy number as a result; the process of generating output from the fuzzy system is known as defuzcification. Mamdani's model was introduced in 1975 by Ebrahim Mamdani, also known as the Max Min Method. He uses Min for implication functions and Max for the composition between implication functions. The computing process is so complex that it takes a lot of time to make the result highly precise. First, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed by John Holland and his colleagues at the University of Michigan for the compilation of implication functions."}, {"heading": "3. THE NUTRIENT NEEDS FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM KIDNEY AND URINARY TRACT DISEASES", "text": "Nutrient is an organic substance needed by an organism to function normally, grow and stay healthy (1). Nutrition can be ingested by foods and beverages, which are then absorbed by the body. Nutrition research focuses on the effects of food and beverages on the body, especially in determining the optimal diet. A careful choice of daily diet will provide all the nutrients needed for the body to function normally. On the contrary, if food is not well chosen, people suffer from a lack of essential nutrients [11]. Nutritional needs are influenced by age, sex, physical activity and special conditions such as pregnancy and lactation. There are several ways to determine the number of basal metabolism (NBM), one of which is the Harris Benedict postulate [1] used in this research."}, {"heading": "4.

The inferential system applied is Mamdanis model. The input parameters of the population is 100 and 150, meanwhile for the generation is 100, 800 and 1500. For a clearer explanation, see Table 5.As shown in the table, the best fitness function is printed in bold form. From the result of the three types of tests on each type of diet is chosen a parameter that can lead to the best fitness function. The test for nefrotic syndrome diet uses the population size of 150, crossover diet uses the probability of 0.6, mutation probability of 0.13 and generation maximum of 1500. The food index results from the experiment error test with the parameters 372, 72, 398, 196, 386, 344, 195, 109."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The real-life test cases show that genetic fuzzy algorithms can be applied to determine the composition of the optimal food ingredients to meet the nutritional needs of patients with kidney and urinary tract disease in one day. Diseases observed in this research include nefrotic syndrome, acute kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, the final stage of kidney disease and kidney stones. However, further research into expanding the disease database by including various other types of diseases, developing a user-friendly user interface and improving the method by combining other soft computing techniques are diseases required, building a user-friendly user interface and improving methods by combining the techniques of other soft computing."}, {"heading": "6.
