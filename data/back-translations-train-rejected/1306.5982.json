Introduction", "text": "Ambient Assisted Living is an emerging area that focuses on helping older people function independently at home. Smart Home is the combination of technology and services through the process of connectivity that is established at home for a better quality of life [1]. The need for such technology is due to the ageing population, high quality of life, costly formal health care and the importance of residents accommodating others in their own homes. Smart Home helps residents to improve living comfort, convenience, safety and energy management [2] [11]. A smart home appears \"intelligent\" because its computer systems can monitor so many aspects of daily life. Residents must complete their activities of daily life (ADLs) [15], such as eating, dressing, sleeping, cooking, etc. Monitoring activities makes it possible to detect the adverse situations that residents are exposed to that can trigger an emergency mechanism. [16] It is necessary to discover the common user behavior and predict their future actions in the home."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "There are two types of pattern mining such as Frequent Pattern Mining and High Utility Pattern Mining [4]. Various algorithms are proposed to find these common patterns. Apriori was the basic algorithm to find common patterns of activity that were proposed by R.Agrawal andR.Srikant in 1994 [5]. This algorithm uses prior knowledge to find out the common patterns. Downward trait is used to crop the rare patterns. If a pattern is rare, then all its superpatterns must be rare. Frequent pattern mining is the process of finding frequent patterns of activity from the input sensor data stream [3]."}, {"heading": "3.
