In general, the methods used for decision-making regarding multiple attributes in this study can be shown in Figure 1.A Fuzzy Topsis Multiple-Attributes Decision Making for Scholarship Selection (Shofwatul \"Uyun). Requirements Analysis Activity is the process of analyzing system requirements based on the list of needs accumulated in previous activities. The method used to determine the appropriate candidates for FMADM cases are TOPSIS dan Weighted Product. The basic concept of the TOPSIS method is that the best alternative has not only the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution, but also the longest distance from the negative ideal solution. Weighted Product (WP) is a standard form of FMADM. This concept has been widely used in several MADM models to solve a practical problem [16]."}, {"heading": "2.1. FMADM", "text": "In general, the decision-making process for blurred multiple attributes follows the following steps: Step 1: Set a number of alternatives and some attributes or criteria. Decision makers define some alternatives that are selected according to multiple attributes or criteria. Example: S = {S1, S2,..., Sm} is the set of alternatives; K = {K1, K2,..., Kn} is the set of attributes or criteria, and A = {aij | i = 1,2,..., m; j = 1,2,..., n} is the matrix decision where aij is the numerical value of the alternative i for attribute j.Step 2: Assessment of blurred properties. In this step, there are two activities: a) Selection of a set of evaluations for the weight of criteria and the degree of suitability for each alternative using the criteria. b) Assessment of the weight of criteria and degree of suitability for each alternative using the criteria."}, {"heading": "2.2.

Conclusion", "text": "From the results and analysis, it can be concluded that UML modeling in FMADM with TOPSIS and weighted product method can be used for scientific selection. Some UML elements have been included in this study, such as activity chart, use case and sequence chart. TOPSIS and weighted product can be used for blurred and / or crisp FMADM data. A selection based on these methods provides a similar product for its initial result. However, the preferential values for both methods differ due to differences in the normalization process of their matrices. A student with the highest value is recommended for the scholarship."}], "references": [{"title": "Fuzzy Systems Theory and Its Applications", "author": ["M. Terano T. Asai K.
