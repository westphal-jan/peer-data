Arabizi is used to represent both modern standard Arabic (MSA) and Arabic dialects. It is often used in informal contexts such as social networks and is often mixed with English. In this essay, we deal with the problems of identifying Arabizi in the text and converting it into Arabic characters. We used word and sequence functions to identify Arabizi mixed with English.

Arabic is often used as Arabic, Arabic, German, French and English. Arabic is used in both Arabic and Arabic. For example, \"2\" and \"3\" represent the letters @ (which sounds like \"a\" as in apple) and \"a\" (which is a guttural \"aa\"). Arabizi is particularly popular on Arabic social media. Arabizi grew out of the need to write Arabic on systems that do not support Arabic script natively. For example, Internet Explorer 5.0, released in March 1999, is the browser's first word to support Arabic representation natively1. Windows Mobile and Android did not support Arabic except through third-party support up to versions 6.5x and 3.x."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into a different world, in which they are able to integrate themselves, in which they are able to live, in which they are able to live, in which they live, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live."}, {"heading": "3 Identifying Arabizi", "text": "As mentioned before, classifying words as English or Arabizi requires the use of words at the word and sequence level. We chose to use CRF sequence labeling to identify Arabizi words. We used the CRF + + implementation with standard parameters (Sha and Pereira, 2003). We created training and test kits for word-level language classification from tweets containing English, Arabizi or a mixture of English and Arabizi. We collected the tweets in the following ways: 1. We frequently used Arabizi words as queries against Twitter several times. These words were \"e7na\" (we), \"3shan\" (because), and \"la2a\" (no). We issued these queries every 30 seconds for about 1 hour. We created large time gaps between queries to ensure that the results were refreshed. We extracted the user IDs of all tweets we found and used on Twitter."}, {"heading": "4 Arabizi to Arabic", "text": "As already mentioned, Arabizi is simply Arabic, whether MSA or dialectal, written with Latin characters. \"We were able to collect Arabizi texts by searching for common Arabizi words on Twitter to identify the authors of these tweets and then find their tweets to find more tweets written in Arabizi.\" In all cases, we constructed a collection containing 3,452 training pairs that have both Arabizi and Arabic equivalents. \"All Arabizi words were manually translated into Arabic by a native Arabic speaker. Some sample pairs are: \u2022 3endek \u2192 \u00bc Y J\" (meaning in your care \") \u2022 bytl3.\""}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we presented methods for recognizing Arabizi, which is mixed with English text and converted from Arabizi to Arabic. For speech recognition, we used a sequence labeler that used word and character properties. Speech recognition was trained and tested on datasets constructed from tweets. We achieved an overall accuracy of 98.5%. For the conversion of Arabizi to Arabic, we trained a transliterator that tried to find the most likely Arabic word that an Arabizi word could have produced. We used both the probabilities for the transliteration of characters and language modeling. We achieved a transliteration accuracy of 88.7%. For future work, we would like to experiment with additional training data and improved language models that take into account the morphological complexity of Arabic. Also, the lack of spelling conventions for Arabic dialects SA may justify the recognition of different spellings of individual words from Mectal words and converting them into Arabic."}], "references": [{"title": "Using foreign inclusion detection to improve parsing performance", "author": ["Alex et al.2007] B.
