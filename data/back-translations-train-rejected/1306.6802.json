Taxonomies are usually either trees in which nodes (classes) each have a single parent, or guided acyclic graphs (DAGs) in which nodes can have multiple parents; see Figures 1 (a) and 1 (b), respectively. In some cases, hierarchies can also be cyclic graphs. In all cases, the hierarchy imposes a parent-child relationship between classes, implying that an instance belonging to a specific class also belongs to all ancestral classes."}, {"heading": "1.1 1.2 2.1 3.1 3.2 3.3", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "1.1 1.2 2.1 3.1 3.2 3.3", "text": "\u2022 Transitivity: If ci-cj and cj-ck, then ci-ck for each ci, cj, ck-C.

A hierarchical performance measurement should use the class hierarchy to properly assess HC algorithms. In particular, one must take into account for several different types of errors according to the hierarchy. For example, the tree hierarchy in Figure 1 (a) will be considered as it makes a prediction in another and unrelated substance. In order to measure the severity of an error in the predicted classes, both systems will be equally punished, but the error of the second system is more severe as it makes a prediction in another and unrelated substance. In order to measure the severity of a hierarchical classification, there are several interesting problems that need to be addressed."}, {"heading": "2.3 Pair-based Measures", "text": "Pair-based measures yi exceed a prediedthreshold (see the long distance problem in Figure 2 (d) class B could pair with A and class C with D, and then the sum of the corresponding costs would give the total misclassification error.Let Y = {y, i, i = 1..

The cost of pairing a class (predicted or true) with a default class is determined as in GIE. The solution to the flow network optimization problem is simple, as the only limitations are that the predicted default class cannot be paired with the predicted true class, and that categories of the same group (predicted or true) cannot be paired with each other. Therefore, each pairing can be solved separately by setting one class with either the default class of the other, or the closest class of the other group."}, {"heading": "2.4 Set-based Measures", "text": "Performance metrics in this category are based on operations on the entire sets of predicted and true classes, possibly including their ancestors and descendants, as opposed to pair-based metrics that only take into account pairs of predicted and true classes. Set-based metrics have two distinct phases: 1. The magnification of Y and Y with information about the hierarchy. 2. The calculation of a cost measurement based on the extended placement. The magnification of Y and Y is a crucial step and attempts to capture the hierarchical relationships between classes. For example, the set metrics can be extended with the ancestors of the true and predicted classes as follows: Yaug = Y (2) and Y (1)."}, {"heading": "2.4.1 Existing Set-based Measures", "text": "In (Kiritchenko et al., 2005; Struyf et al., 2005; Cai and Hofmann, 2007) the ancestors of the predicted and true classes are added to Yaug and Y-aug, as in Equations 2 and 3.

Adding all ancestors has the undesirable effect of excessive errors occurring to nodes with many ancestors. In an attempt to solve this problem, we propose the lowest common ancestors (PLCA), recall (RLCA), and F1 (FLCA) measures that use the concept of lowest common ancestors (LCA) as defined in graph theory (Aho et al., 1973).Definition 1. The lowest common ancestors (n1, n2) of two nodes n1 and n2 of a tree T is defined as the lowest node in T (furthest from the root), which is an ancestor of both n1 and nn."}, {"heading": "3 Case Studies", "text": "In this section, we apply various measures to selected cases to demonstrate their advantages and disadvantages. As representatives of the pair-based measures, we chose the Graph Induced Error (GIE), while we selected the hierarchical versions of precision (PH), recall (RH), F1 measure (FH = 2 \u00b7 PH \u00b7 RH PH + RH) and symmetrical loss of difference (l \u0445 (Yaug, Y, aug) for defined measures, using all ancestors of the predicted (Y) and true (Y) designations to expand the groups of classes. We also use our proposed pair-based measure MGIA and the defined LCA versions of precision (PLCA), recall (RLCA), F1 measure (FLCA) to illustrate their advantages and limitations, as well as the differences between the two types of measures. With respect to the MGIA threshold, we also place in the hierarchy."}, {"heading": "3.1 Handling the Pairing Problem", "text": "In this elementary case, Figures 11 (a) and 11 (b) are two symmetrical variants leading to different but symmetrical hierarchical versions; the results between the hierarchical version and the LCA versions differ because the LCA versions ignore the graph above the node B, which is the lowest common ancestor of the nodes T 1, P1, and P2; the hierarchical versions on the other hand also take into account node A, and in this way they give higher results. This behavior is undesirable because any node above B would increase the results of the hierarchical measures, but do not affect the LCA versions."}, {"heading": "3.2 Handling alternative paths", "text": "In Figure 13 (a) we start from a one-step classification task where the hierarchy is a DAG. In this DAG there are two paths from the root (node A) to node P1. It should be noted that this is the simplest case where both paths {A, B, P1} and {A, C, P1} have the same length. In this case, pair-based measures (Table 3) remain unaffected compared to Figure 13 (b), which is a tree - a desirable behavior due to the use of the shortest path from T1 to P1, while existing defined measures are affected. In particular, they calculate a misclassification error that takes into account both of the two alternative paths to P1. On the other hand, eco-balancing measures behave the same behavior as the pair-based measures due to the use of the smallest common ancestor and again have an advantage over existing defined measures."}, {"heading": "3.3 Combining elementary cases", "text": "In this subsection, we will examine cases where the combination of the problems mentioned above leads to a variable behavior of the set-based measurement scales. Figure 14 represents one such case in which the GIE is affected by the matching problem discussed in case 1, but the set-based methods yield similar results according to Table 4. The phenomenon of multiple paths does not affect the hierarchical versions of Precision, callback, and F1, since all nodes above the lowest common ancestors B and A of T1, P1, and P2 are also shared by all classes (true and predicted). With this example, we want to show that there are certain cases in which existing set-based methods provide the same results as the LCA methods, but we have not identified any cases in which the behavior of an existing set-based measurement would be more desirable than that of the LCA versions. The case shown in Figure 15 differs from the previous case in that the right subgraph now connects only above the nodes A with two different PD and also with the left-C through the PD."}, {"heading": "3.4 Multiple path counting", "text": "By comparing pairs of true and predicted classes, pair-based methods will often count the same path more than once. This multiple counting increases the error estimated by these methods. Figure 16 (a) illustrates such a case. In this case, the edge between T1 and B is counted for the length of both {T1, B, P1} and {T1, B, A, C, D, P2} paths. As a result, pair-based measures tend to overestimate the errors in this case compared to fixed ones. Figure 16 (b) represents a similar example. According to Table 6, the error of MGIA prior to the proposed transformation from 7 is increased by at least 2, while the size of Yaug of fixed measures increases by 1, which seems more reasonable for such a change in the hierarchy. Figure 16 (b) represents a similar example."}, {"heading": "3.5 Very distant predictions", "text": "The aim of this case (Figure 17) is to show how each of the two types of measurements deals with very large distances between predicted and true markers. Pair-based measurements calculate the distance between each pair of predicted and true nodes, and if that distance exceeds a certain threshold, a default maximum distance is assigned. Set-based measurements can use a threshold for the number of ancestors of the predicted and true nodes used in the extended quantities. Using this threshold, for pair-based measurements we specify a common ancestor to connect at least one common ancestor to a true node at a distance equal to the threshold. For example, adding the distance of the lowest common ancestor to the two true and predicted measurements, a maximum distance of 4 is used for pair-based measurements, then it would be useful to request a lowest common ancestor at a distance of 2 for set measurements."}, {"heading": "3.6 Over and under-specialization", "text": "In all previous cases, the predicted and true categories were leaves of hierarchies, but this is not always the case. Figure 18 shows simple examples of an inner node being either a true (Figure 18 (a)) or a predicted (Figure 18 (b)) category. As shown in Table 8, the two cases receive the same rating. Figure 18 (a) shows a case of over-specialization. As described in Section 2.2, different measurement yardsticks treat this type of error differently. One could even argue that since the prediction of P1, T1 is also predicted as a direct precursor of it. This is not the case here, and as shown in Table 8, all measurements treat it as a misclassification error. Regarding sub-specialization, the simplest example is shown in Figure 18 (b). It is also considered an error that is more severe the further away the true category from the predicted. For example, Figure 18 (c) is the predicted node 18 (the previous node)."}, {"heading": "3.7 Summary", "text": "Table 9 shows the advantages and disadvantages of each measure based on the scope of the cases proposed in Section 2.2. All measures can deal with over-specialisation and under-specialisation in some way. All measures set out can deal with the mating problem, as they generate extended sentences, while GIE cannot handle it efficiently, and that is why MGIA was proposed. In view of the remote problem, only pair-based measures can deal with it by definition, while defined measures cannot deal with it without using the threshold changes we proposed in Section 3.5. Finally, multi-path counting is a particular feature of the pair-based measures, which, although most of the time undesirable, could lead to them behaving better than the measures set out in certain cases. As a general conclusion, the proposed measures always behave better or at least as good as the existing measures in their category. Therefore, if you want one of these measures to be used across most of the cases discussed, we should consider the MGIA measures set as a yardstick in certain cases."}, {"heading": "4 Empirical Study", "text": "In this section we apply different evaluation yardsticks to the predictions of the systems participating in the Large Scale Hierarchical Text Classification Pascal Challenges of 2011 (LSHTC2) and 2012 (LSHTC3). The aim of this section is to examine, using real data and systems, to what extent the performance ranking of systems is influenced by the choice of flat and hierarchical evaluation yardsticks as well as by the type of hierarchical yardsticks used. In the first subsection we present the data sets we use, in the second subsection we discuss the evaluation yardsticks contained in the comparison, and in the last subsection we discuss the results of the study. In the third section we have shown that in certain cases some measures behave more desirably than others. In this section we show that the differences between methods also influence the evaluation yardsticks in practice."}, {"heading": "4.1 Datasets", "text": "The first dataset (DMOZ) is based on pages from the Open Directory Project (ODP), but this results in a hierarchy with a maximum depth of 5. This dataset was the smallest of the three, in terms of the number of categories and instances.

This dataset was the smallest of the three, in terms of the number of records and instances. The other two datasets of the LSHTC3 are also used in the fifth level."}, {"heading": "4.2 Evaluation Measures and Statistical tests", "text": "To measure the correlation between these rankings, we used Kendall's rank correlation (Kendall (1938)). In the LSHTC2 challenge, statistical significance tests were used only for the flat benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, the literature does not provide specific statistical significance tests for hierarchical benchmarks. In both this paper and LSHTC3, we have performed a micro-character test (s-test) similar to the test used in (Yang and Liu (1999). Each of the hierarchical benchmarks provides a score for each instance, and this score is always averaged by the number of instances."}, {"heading": "4.3 Results", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to play by the rules we have set ourselves in order to make them a reality."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we investigated the problem of assessing the performance of hierarchical classification methods. Specifically, this paper abstracted and presented the main points of existing performance measures. We proposed grouping the methods into a) pair-based and b) set-based. Measures in the former group attempt to assign each prediction to a true class and measure its distance. In contrast, set-based measures use the hierarchical relationships to expand the sets of predicted and true labels, and then use set operations, such as symmetric difference and intersections, on the extended label sets. To model pair-based measurements, we introduced a novel framework based on flow networks, while providing a framework for set-up measures based on defined operations. Thus, outstanding features of these measures are emphasized and addressed under a common formalism.Another contribution of this paper was the suggestion of two measures (one for each group) that address multiple measures in a hierarchical manner."}], "references": [{"title": "On finding lowest common ancestors in trees", "author": ["Alfred Aho", "John Hopcroft", "Jeffrey Ullman"], "venue": "In Proc. 5th ACM Symp.

An important issue in hierarchical classification is the evaluation of different classification algorithms, which is complicated by the hierarchical relations among the classes. Several evaluation measures have been proposed for hierarchical classification using the hierarchy in different ways. This paper studies the problem of evaluation in hierarchical classification by analyzing and abstracting the key components of the existing performance measures. It also proposes two alternative generic views of hierarchical evaluation and introduces two corresponding novel measures. The proposed measures, along with the state-of-the-art ones, are empirically tested on three large datasets from the domain of text classification. The empirical results illustrate the undesirable behavior of existing approaches and how the proposed methods overcome most of these methods across a range of cases.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
