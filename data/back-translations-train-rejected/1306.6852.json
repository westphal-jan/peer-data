If A3 is not respected, MatrixA (3), where inconsistent preferences are amplified, can be rated less inconsistently than A. \u2022 Consider Example 4 to demonstrate the need for A4. In the example, Matrix A \u00b2 clearly differs from the consistent matrix A \u00b2 more than A \u00b2. As a consequence, A \u00b2 can be rated no less inconsistent than A \u00b2 to show consistency. \u2022 As stated by Barzilai () in 1998, continuity is \"an inconsistency for an inconsistency indicator that it is an inconsistency for an inconsistency 5."}, {"heading": "4.2 Logical consistency and independence", "text": "A natural question is whether the axiomatic properties A1-A5 form an axiomatic system or not. < In an axiomatic system, the axioms must be consistent (in the logical sense) and independent. < The existence of at least one index satisfying A1-A5 proves that the axiomatic system is not logically contradictory and therefore the system is logically consistent. < Another important result concerns the independence of the axioms. Testing the independence would show that the axioms are not redundant and therefore all of them are necessary. Theorem 1. Axiomatic properties A1-A5 are logically consistent and independent.

Let us make a few other comments to clarify A3 and A4. First, we propose a geometric interpretation that could be useful in highlighting the role of A4 in the demand for the non-decreasing property of an inconsistency index as we move away from consistency. Let us present a consistent matrix A * A * as a point in the cartesian space Rn (n \u2212 1) / 2, where the dimension n (n \u2212 1) / 2 is the number of upper diagonal elements necessary and sufficient to identify a paired comparison matrix of the order n *. By increasing (decreasing) the entry matrix, the point A * detaches and moves in the direction of the corresponding axis. Thus, A4 requires that an inconsistency index x does not decrease when A moves away from the original position."}, {"heading": "6.1 Conclusions", "text": "The purpose of this paper was to introduce a formal order into the issue of consistency evaluation of pairs of comparison matrices.
