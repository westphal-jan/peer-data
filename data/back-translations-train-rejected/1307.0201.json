Take, for example, the various chess pieces and the moves they are capable of; or the troops in the game Risk [1] and their offensive and defensive strengths, represented by the number of dice being rolled. In previous games such as these, game mechanics tended to treat skills in a more abstract and simplified way, but as games have become more lifelike, so has the simulation of skills. An important line of development in this area began with roleplaying games at the table, such as the original Dungeons & Dragons [2], and continues to this day, with computer games requiring sophisticated skills."}, {"heading": "2 Skills and Abilities in Games", "text": "In this section, I will briefly discuss some existing approaches to modeling skills. I will start with a variety of models used in tabletop role-playing games, partly motivated by the fact that the descriptions of these models Xiv: 130 7.02 01v2 [cs.GT] 2 6Ju l 2 are much more readily available than those included in the proprietary game code, and partly by the fact that \"most [computer role-playing games] use a system based on an old paper [role-playing game] to manage their game mechanics.\" [3, p. 358] After outlining the main models, I will describe some mistakes in the one most commonly used and outline an alternative."}, {"heading": "2.1 Some Classic Approaches", "text": "A review of published role-playing games shows that a few mechanisms are by far the most common difficulty level. There are significant variations in the details, but nevertheless, a few main models can be distilled. 1Uniform scale. The most popular mechanics is the uniform scale. Although there are different implementations in terms of skill dice, the underlying model is this: skill and difficulty are both represented on the same scale, and the probability of success is a linear function of their difference. A common implementation treats the skill as a fixed probability (or a fixed value on a uniform random scale), and the difficulty as an additive modifier. A uniformly random value is then generated using dice, and if this value is equal to or lower than the modified skill, the action is a success. Another frequent implementation is to allow the skill as an additive modifier on the uniform level of the dice, which increases the difficulty level, of course, to treat the difficulty of the dice that increases."}, {"heading": "2.2 The Problem With Percentiles", "text": "A superficial analysis, therefore, seems to suggest that a bonus of + 10% is clearly more useful to anyone with a skill of 90% or less than those who are more skillful. Instead, we could consider an unlimited scale in which + 10 really always means + 10, for example. If we ignore randomness and assume that the skill level is all that matters to the result, a skill level of a always beats a skill level (or difficulty level) of b if a > b. In a sense, this is the assumption underlying the so-called Guttman scales, and the model discussed in the following sections is an extension to these to take into account random variations of different kinds."}, {"heading": "2.3 The Outline of a Model", "text": "s motivation for his eponymous probability model for skills and levels of difficulty (5, pp. 72-75). Although it does not cover all the details we will examine, it gives us an overview of the shape that our skill model should take. 2What we are looking for is a function f that takes a skill level a and a difficulty level x and produces a probability of success f (a, x). If we assume that both a and x are measured on a multiplicative scale, we expect a person who is twice as skillful to be able to accomplish tasks that are twice as difficult, or generally that f (a, x) = f (ka, kx), for each positive constant k. Let us now look at Person A and Person B, with respective skill levels a and b, and problems X and Y with difficulty levels x and y."}, {"heading": "3 Skills as Evidence: the 1PL", "text": "In this section I show that a more natural interpretation of skill and difficulty as proof for and against a positive result leads to a model that corresponds to all the desired characteristics outlined so far."}, {"heading": "3.1 Bayes Factors and Odds Ratios", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are in a position, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they are able to change, in which they are able to change, in which they are able to change the world, in which they are able to change the world, in which they are able to change,"}, {"heading": "3.2 IRT and Rasch Models", "text": "The model we have derived by looking at skills and degrees of difficulty as strength of proof is actually the one commonly known as the one-parameter logistics model, or 1PL, in the field of psychometric.4 This model was originally introduced by Rasch [5], but has since become a basis for both the so-called invariant measurement in the social sciences [10] and the item-response theory of psychological tests [11].The requirements of invariant measurement limit us to using a sigmoid probability function on an additive scale, as discussed in the introduction. It is possible, say, to use a probit scale, but the logit model is far more common. While a very important reason for this is its ease of calculation, as we have seen in the previous section, there are also philosophical and methodological reasons for favouring it. This use of a logistic distribution can also be found elsewhere."}, {"heading": "4 The 2PL, 3PL and 4PL", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of us will be able to be able to be able to be able, and that they will be able to be able to hold their own."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion and Future Work", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to obey the rules which they have imposed on themselves, and that they are able to obey the rules which they have imposed on themselves.
