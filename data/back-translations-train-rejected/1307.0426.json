Many researchers utilise ground truth (GT) in experiments and more often than not this GT is derived from one annotator's opinion. How does the difference in opinion affect an algorithm's evaluation? Four examples of typical CV problems are chosen, and a methodology is applied to each to quantify the inter-annotator variance and to offer insight into the mechanisms behind agreement and the use of GT. It is found that when detecting linear objects annotator agreement is very low. The agreement in object position, linear or otherwise, can be partially explained through basic image properties. Automatic object detectors are compared to annotator agreement and it is found that a clear relationship exists. Several methods for calculating GTs from a number of annotations are applied and the resulting differences in the performance of the object detectors are quantified. It is found that the rank of a detector is highly dependent upon the method used to form the GT. It is also found that although the STAPLE and LSML GT estimation methods appear to represent the mean of the performance measured using the individual annotations, when there are few annotations, or there is a large variance in them, these estimates tend to degrade. Furthermore, one of the most commonly adopted annotation combination methods--consensus voting--accentuates more obvious features, which results in an overestimation of the algorithm's performance. Finally, it is concluded that in some datasets it may not be possible to state with any confidence that one algorithm outperforms another when evaluating upon one GT and a method for calculating confidence bounds is discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Jul 2013 16:16:40 GMT  (5645kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0426v1", "23 pages"], ["v2", "Sat, 26 Oct 2013 14:39:01 GMT  (5640kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0426v2", "23 pages"], ["v3", "Tue, 26 Apr 2016 11:05:18 GMT  (11559kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0426v3", "16 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["thomas a lampert", "r\\'e stumpf", "pierre gan\\c{c}arski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.0426"}, "pdf": {"name": "1307.0426.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An Empirical Study into Annotator Agreement, Ground Truth Estimation, and Algorithm Evaluation", "authors": ["Thomas A.

METHODOLOGY", "text": "To summarize, this paper aims to show the impact of GT variability on the design, education, and evaluation of segmentation algorithms by examining their performance measured with individual annotations, comparing multiple algorithms using different GTs, and comparing gold standard GT inference algorithms. To achieve these goals, methodological evaluation will revolve around three aspects: annotation agreement; the relationship between annotation agreement and detector performance; and fundamentals and reported detector performance.

For each study, N annotators have provided manual markers with the positions of the foreground target specific to each study. All case studies are binary recognition problems and each annotation has the value one in which the annotator has perceived the attribute of interest as existent and zero otherwise. The result of this process are N binary cards describing the location of the characteristics of interest after each annotator. As such, the output of each annotator is modeled as a function Mn: {0, 1,.., X \u2212 1} \u00d7 {0, 1,., Y \u2212 1} 7 \u2192 {0, 1}, where 0 and 1 represent the absence and presence of the object, respectively n = 1, N."}, {"heading": "B.

Relation between Agreement and Detector Performance", "text": "After analyzing the properties of the annotator agreement, the investigation of its relationship to detector performance follows. Therefore, four detectors are selected from each of the case study ranges and applied to the present detector problem (every effort has been made to select the most powerful detectors within each domain), each of which is evaluated using GTs that are calculated with increasing correspondence levels according to the equivalent. (5), \u03c4 = 1 / N, 2 / N. It is common to measure detector performance by ROC curve analysis, but recent literature indicates that this may overestimate performance when applied to highly distorted data sets (those in which the number of positive, Np and negative, Nn, examples are not balanced) and therefore precision recall (P-R) curves are preferred [36, 34]. Nevertheless, precision is sensitive to the Skew ratio, and the Skew ratio between the two."}, {"heading": "D. Ground Truths and Reported Detector Performance", "text": "The final question this research intends to examine is: What is the impact of different basic truths on the reported performance of an algorithm? To this end, several GTs are calculated according to Equation (5): the combined annotations where \u03c4 = 1 / N, i.e. segments of interest marked by each annotation participant (Any-GT); the consensus of half of the annotation participants or majority votes where \u03c4 = 0.5 (0.5-GT); and the consensus of three quarters of the annotation participants where \u03c4 = 0.75 (0.75-GT). Also included are gold standard GT estimates calculated using STAPLE [8] (without assignment of consensus votes [22], SIMPLE [5] and LSML [6] (using 0.5-GT as the first estimate and 1000 iterations).

Many researchers utilise ground truth in experimentation and more often than not this ground truth is derived from one annotator\u2019s opinion. How does the difference in opinion affect an algorithm\u2019s evaluation? A methodology is applied to four image processing problems to quantify the inter-annotator variance and to offer insight into the mechanisms behind agreement and the use of ground truth. It is found that when detecting linear structures annotator agreement is very low. The agreement in a structure\u2019s position can be partially explained through basic image properties. Automatic segmentation algorithms are compared to annotator agreement and it is found that there is a clear relation between the two. Several ground truth estimation methods are used to infer a number of algorithm performances. It is found that: the rank of a detector is highly dependent upon the method used to form the ground truth; and that although STAPLE and LSML appear to represent the mean of the performance measured using individual annotations, when there are few annotations, or there is a large variance in them, these estimates tend to degrade. Furthermore, one of the most commonly adopted combination methods\u2014consensus voting\u2014 accentuates more obvious features, resulting in an overestimation of performance.
