Introduction", "text": "The SP Theory of Intelligence aims to simplify and integrate concepts on artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, and human perception and cognition, with information compression serving as a unifying theme. This article describes the existing and expected benefits of SP theory and some of its potential applications.The theory is described most fully in [1] and more briefly in an expanded overview [2] This article should be read in conjunction with one or both of these reports. In short, the existing and expected benefits of the theory are: \u2022 Conceptual simplicity combined with descriptive and explanatory power. \u2022 Simplification of computer systems, including software. \u2022 Deeper insights and better solutions in several application areas. \u2022 Seamless integration of structures and functions within and between different application areas. These points are each discussed in a separate section below. But first, there is a small philosophy and an introduction to SP theory with associated ideas as background and context for what follows."}, {"heading": "2. A Little Philosophy", "text": "Among the alternative criteria for the success of a theory, the principle (\"Occam's Razor\") that a good theory should combine simplicity with descriptive or explanatory force seems to be the most widespread. [3] This is in line with the idea - which reflects the underlying theme of SP theory itself - that a good theory should compress empirical data by reducing \"redundancy\" in the data (thereby increasing its \"simplicity\") while retaining as much of its non-redundant \"power\" [4] as possible. As John Barrow has written: \"Science is at its root, only the search for compression in the world.\" [5] These principles are prevalent in most areas of science: the Copernican heliocentric theory of the sun and the planetary theory."}, {"heading": "3. The SP Theory and the SP Machine: A Summary", "text": "It is shown that in the P-2-theory it will be able to develop a P-2-theory, and that it will be able to develop a P-2-theory, and that it will be able to develop a P-2-theory.

Combining Conceptual Simplicity with Descriptive and Explanatory Power", "text": "In principle, it should be possible to evaluate scientific theories fairly accurately in terms of conceptual simplicity and descriptive and explanatory power - and to compare one theory with another - by measuring their ability to compress empirical data. However, for much of science, techniques and technologies are not yet well developed enough to make this possible, and there is in any case the difficulty of rival theories grappling with exactly the same corpus of empirical data. Therefore, in assessing theories we usually have to rely on more or less informal judgments about simplicity and power (see also Section 6.10.7). In these terms, SP theory seems to score well: \u2022 SP theory, including the concept of multiple alignment, is not trivially simple, but not overly complicated either. SP computer model (Sections 3.9, 3.10 and 9.2 in [1]; Section 3.1 in [2], in which the concepts of logic are insoluble, the concept of viable, is the most eptible, since it requires several epts of theory. \""}, {"heading": "5. Simplification of Computing Systems, Including Software", "text": "Apart from the simplification and integration of concepts in artificial intelligence, the principle of multiple naming (Section 4) represents the simplification of computer systems, including software. The principle described here is already known in the way in which databases are stored (DBMS), with a user interface and mechanisms necessary for operation, and also for early expert systems."}, {"heading": "6. Deeper Insights and Better Solutions in Several Areas of Application", "text": "This section describes some potential areas of application for SP theory and its potential benefits, relying on the capabilities of the SP system (described in [1] (chapters 4-11) and [2] (chapters 5-13). These examples are probably just the tip of the iceberg. To mix our metaphors, there is a rich vein that can be mined. Given its importance, I believe it is worth repeating the principle mentioned in Section 2."}, {"heading": "6.1. Unsupervised Learning", "text": "The first area of application to be considered - unattended learning - is slightly different from the others because it is less of a stand-alone application than a contribution to others, in particular autonomous robots (Section 6.3), computer vision (Section 6.4), software development (Section 6.6), big data (Section 6.9), the semantic web (Section 6.10.1), bioinformatics (Section 6.10.2) and the development of scientific theories (Section 6.10.7). Research on the development of computer models for language acquisition (reviewed in [16]; see also [17]) - in particular the importance of information compression in this area - has been one of the most important sources of inspiration for SP theory. But radical restructuring has been necessary to achieve the goal of simplifying and integrating ideas about artificial intelligence, mainstream compression, and human perception and cognition."}, {"heading": "6.2. Applications in the Processing of Natural Language", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to set out in search of a solution that has its origin in the real world, in which they move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live"}, {"heading": "6.3. Towards a Versatile Intelligence for Autonomous Robots", "text": "If a robot survives and thrives in a challenging environment such as Mars, where communication limits the help of humans, there are advantages if it can be equipped with human intelligence and versatility - as much as possible. A theory such as the SP theory, which offers a unified view of several different aspects of intelligence, is a good candidate for developing this general intelligence [21].The SP system has the potential to give robots human flexibility and adaptability. Consider, for example, how top players learn to play games such as pool, billiards or snooker. This is very different from some existing robots playing pool (see, for example, the situation is simplified, which makes a human player with a knowledge of facial features, and where the robot is equipped with knowledge of geometry and related mathematics."}, {"heading": "6.4. Computer Vision", "text": "The SP system has potential in the field of computer vision, as described in [23]. In short, it has the potential to simplify and integrate several areas in computer vision, including the recognition and alignment of features, segmentation, derivation of structures from motion, merging of images, stereo correspondence, scene analysis and object recognition (see for example [24]). With respect to the last two topics, a sentence can be successfully analyzed without explicit markers between consecutive words or clauses, and since the SP system is good at analysis, it has potential in scene analysis. in the same way that a sentence can be analyzed without the need for explicit markers between individual words or between consecutive phrases or clauses, a scene can be analyzed into its components without explicit boundaries between objects and other elements."}, {"heading": "6.5. A Versatile Model for Intelligent Databases", "text": "As described in [15] and outlined in [2] (section 11), the SP system provides a versatile framework that incorporates multiple data models (including object-oriented, relational, network, and tree models), facilitates integration of different models, and provides skills in reasoning, learning, pattern recognition, problem solving, and other aspects of intelligence. An industrial version of the SP machine could prove useful in several areas, including, for example, crime investigations: \u2022 The system would provide a means of storing and managing the data collected in such investigations, often in large quantities. \u2022 It could prove useful in detecting characteristics or combinations of characteristics that link a particular crime to other crimes, either current or past - and also for suspects. \u2022 The pattern-recognition capabilities of the system can also be useful in scanning data to detect indicators of criminal activity. \u2022 It may prove useful in piecing together coherent patterns from partial overlapping information fragments, but not larger in the system [7] that part of the overlapping part of the information is a fictional one, but in more similar ways."}, {"heading": "6.6.

Information Compression", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it will happen, until it does."}, {"heading": "6.8. Medical Diagnosis", "text": "The way in which the SP system can be used in medical diagnosis is described in [35]. Expected benefits of the SP system in this field of application include: \u2022 A format for presenting diseases that is simple and intuitive. \u2022 The ability to manage errors and uncertainties in diagnostic information. \u2022 The simplicity of storing statistical information as a frequency of disease occurrence. \u2022 The system provides a method for evaluating alternative diagnostic hypotheses that yields real probabilities. \u2022 It is a framework that should facilitate unattended learning of medical knowledge and integration of medical diagnoses with other AI applications. The focus in [35] is on medical diagnosis as pattern recognition. But the SP system can also be applied to causal diagnosis ([1] (Section 7.9) and [2] (Section 10.5), which could enable the system in a medical context to establish that \"the fatigue of the patient may be caused by a nutritional deficiency in iron.\""}, {"heading": "6.9. Managing \u201cBig Data\u201d and Gaining Value from It", "text": "The SP system has potential in managing and analyzing the large amounts of data that are now produced in many areas (\"big data\"), as discussed in [36] and summarized here. It can help overcome the problem of diversity in big data: the many different formats of knowledge and the resulting problems in analysis. Given the versatility of SP patterns, within the SP framework to represent different types of knowledge [2], there is potential for them to serve as a universal format for knowledge and facilitate the processing of different types of knowledge. The SP framework can also provide a mechanism for transferring the original data into the universal format.In the interpretation of data, the SP system has capabilities that include such things as parsing and producing language, pattern recognition and various types of probabilistic reasoning."}, {"heading": "6.10. Other Areas of Application", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "7. Seamless Integration of Structures and Functions within and between Different Areas of Application", "text": "This section emphasizes once again the importance of how the SP system can integrate structures and functions both within and between different areas of application. Instead of sometimes unpleasant marriages between incompatible systems, there can be a smooth interaction of, for example, pattern recognition, reasoning and learning, different ways of thinking, different types of knowledge, etc. As mentioned earlier, this facilitates integration: the use of a simple format for different types of knowledge, the use of a system - the multiple alignment framework - for the processing of knowledge, and the overarching principle of information compression through the mapping and unification of patterns. As we have seen, the system provides for the integration of syntax and semantics into the processing of natural language; for the same kind of processing in order to achieve both the analysis and the production of language; for the integration of class hierarchies, sub-hierarchies and other forms of knowledge."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions", "text": "The SP Theory of Intelligence combines conceptual simplicity with descriptive and explanatory power in several areas, including concepts of \"computing,\" the representation of knowledge, natural language processing, pattern recognition, various ways of thinking, storing and retrieving information, planning and problem solving, unattended learning, information compression, neuroscience and human perception and cognition. In the SP Machine there is potential for simplifying computer systems, including software, with corresponding savings in time, effort and cost in developing applications and other benefits related to information compression. As a broad-based theory, the SP Theory promises deeper insights and better solutions in several areas of application, including unattended learning, processing of natural language, autonomous robots, computer vision, intelligent databases, software development, information compression, medical diagnostics and big data; and perhaps also in areas such as big semantic web fusion bioinformatics, structuring of new documents, the use of the theory of viruses, and the theory of the need for data processing worldwide."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "I am grateful to anonymous speakers for many useful comments and Daniel Wolff for pointing out the potential of the SP system in the detection of computer viruses and in the management and analysis of large data.Conflicts of InterestThe author does not declare a conflict of interest.

and some potential applications. The theory aims to simplify and integrate ideas across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, and human perception and cognition, with information compression as a unifying theme. It combines conceptual simplicity with descriptive and explanatory power across several areas of computing and cognition. In the SP machine\u2014an expression of the SP theory which is currently realized in the form of a computer model\u2014there is potential for an overall simplification of computing systems, including software. The SP theory promises deeper insights and better solutions in several areas of application including, most notably, unsupervised learning, natural language processing, autonomous robots, computer vision, intelligent databases, software engineering, information compression, medical diagnosis and big data. There is also potential in areas such as the semantic web, bioinformatics, structuring of documents, the detection of computer viruses, data fusion, new kinds of computer, and the development of scientific theories. The theory promises seamless integration of structures and functions within and between different areas of application. The potential value, worldwide, of these benefits and applications is at least $190 billion each year. Further development would be facilitated by the creation of a high-parallel, open-source version of the SP machine, available to researchers everywhere.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
