However this method is sometimes shown to be too restrictive and unable to adapt in the presence of uncertainty. In this paper we compare type-1 fuzzy control with several other fuzzy approaches under a range of uncertain conditions. Interval type-2 and non-stationary fuzzy controllers are compared, along with 'dual surface' type-2 control, named due to utilising both the lower and upper values produced from standard interval type-2 systems. We tune a type-1 controller, then derive the membership functions and footprints of uncertainty from the type-1 system and evaluate them using a simulated autonomous sailing problem with varying amounts of environmental uncertainty. We show that while these more sophisticated controllers can produce better performance than the type-1 controller, this is not guaranteed and that selection of Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU) size has a large effect on this relative performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Jul 2013 16:34:00 GMT  (1269kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1070v1", "2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, pp 1193-1200"]], "COMMENTS": "2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, pp 1193-1200", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["naisan benatar", "uwe aickelin", "jonathan m garibaldi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1070"}, "pdf": {"name": "1307.1070.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Comparison of Non-stationary, Type-2 and Dual Surface Fuzzy Control", "authors": ["Naisan Benatar", "Uwe Aickelin"], "emails": ["nxb@cs.nott.ac.uk", "uxa@cs.nott.ac.uk", "jmg@cs.nott.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the case concerns a case in which a person has been injured."}, {"heading": "A. Design Decisions", "text": "Stelzer's work on fuzzy sailboats [14], [11] is used as a basis for our controller design. Several changes were necessary because there was no data about our boat model used in the paper to determine some of the parameters, such as the rate of rotation and handling of the boat. Errors were retained as the difference between the current and desired direction in Equation 1, while an additional input, the change of the error, was incorporated into the system. This is defined as the change in the error since the previous iteration of the controller, as in Equation 2.error = Desired Direction (1) Aerror = Current Error = Previous Error (2) Each input has five associated mergers, which are shown in Table II-C. Memberships of the membership in the definition of the definition of Desired Directions - Desired Directors - Desired Directors - Current Directors - Aerror = Previous Error."}, {"heading": "B. Tuning & Optimisation", "text": "While the manual adjustment of the original member functions ([14] and [15]) was performed, we did not perform specific automatic adjustments for two main reasons. First, to ensure universality, and this would not be possible if we were using a specific training data set. Second, it would be difficult to ensure that the same amount of tuning was performed for any other type of fuzzy, as the adjustment requires different methods, such as a type 1 system compared to a type 2, which could potentially lead to unfair comparisons."}, {"heading": "C. Tacking Behaviours", "text": "A disadvantage of using SASP to test these controllers is the limitations of the wind - no boat can sail directly into the wind. To solve this problem, a higher control has been added, which changes the desired direction to the controller. In order to sail into the wind, a turning behavior is required in practice. The design of the courses for our experiments attempts to minimize this effect by setting courses that are designed to avoid the need for turning. The mainsail on the boat is controlled by a simple set of rules that was previously developed in collaboration with the PI controller and has proven to be acceptable."}, {"heading": "III . EXPERIMENTAL SETUP", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Tracksail", "text": "The tracksail simulator used in this research has previously been used for the development and testing of autonomous sailing robotic systems [16], including the development and tuning of the described PI controller. Tracksail is based on Java and communicates with controllers via a TCP / IP socket, which allows any compatible language to be used to control the boat. Each controller is integrated into a common framework that, in addition to any other common code required, provides tactile logic, sensor measurements and motor change routines, ensuring consistency between runs with different controllers. One goal of this work is to investigate changes in the performance of type 2 controllers as the size of the FOU varies. This is facilitated by the simulator by eliminating many categories of uncertainty that are not directly relevant to this investigation, including sensor noise, where the value returned by the sensor does not really reflect the physical value, for example, it measures."}, {"heading": "B. Track Configuration", "text": "Each experiment consists of 30 simulator runs, in which the tested controller attempts to guide the boat to a single waypoint defined as 550 meters west of its starting point, defined by the simulator as a point (0.0). In the first experiment, the wind direction was set to 30 degrees over the boat at a fixed speed of 7 m / s. This means that the wind in this experiment will not cause any noise. Nevertheless, we observed slight differences between runs, which are potentially due to the timing of interacting processes and delays caused by the processing of sockets in the software and operating system. A number of experiments introduced wind-related sounds into the system at two different levels. Noise was defined as a set number of wind changes per second and by the size of the bow defined by the parameters max and min wind direction specified in the simulator, expressed in degrees. Experiment two (average noise seconds) used one wind change every 30 \u00b0 and one wind change every three seconds during a single five \u00b0."}, {"heading": "C. Performance Metrics", "text": "The second measurement is the time the boat takes to complete the set course, which is a straight line distance of 550 meters. The correlation between RMSE and the time required is not as trivial as with a mobile robot, as the boat controller must balance the deviation from a straight line sufficiently to capture enough wind to move forward, against the extra time required for this maneuver. Higher boat speeds in tracksail can be achieved when the boat is travelling parallel to the wind, with the sail set to 90 degrees. However, if this is done throughout the duration, the boat would not reach its destination, so a balance between speed and course must be maintained, which is becoming increasingly important as noise is introduced into the wind direction which is variable."}, {"heading": "IV. CONTROLLER SETUP", "text": "This controller uses the same input value (error between current and desired bearings) as well as its integral over time instead of changing the error. It uses a Pgain value of 1.7 and an I-gain value of 0.01, values derived from previous experiments by Suaze and Neal. The running rate for all controllers is set at 1 Hz. This is chosen to ensure that the more sophisticated controllers can perform a full control loop. This low rate can result in lower performance than exceeding the limit values."}, {"heading": "PI N/A 18.01 0.30 146.56 2.02", "text": "Type 1 N / A 16.32 0.17 140.80 0.66Non-stationary 2 17.03 0.64 139.96 1.16 Non-stationary 5 16.72 0.54 139.28 0.63 Non-stationary 10 16.99 1.14 139.59 1.41 Non-stationary 20 16.74 0.55 140.07 1.10Type 2 15.97 0.62 140.42 1.03 Type 2 5 15.84 0.28 140.65 1.18 Type 2 10 16.04 0.53 140.80 0.66 Type 2 20 18.94 0.57 150.03 2.69Dual Surface 2 19.13 0.61 153.80 1.86 Dual Surface 5 19.34 1.35 150.57 3.35 Dual Surface 10 16.73 0.59 145.43 1.33 Dual Surface 25 15.80 0.24 149.10 7.22 Dual Surface 50 15.99 0.25 142.38 3.59TABLEDI RMSEMBLUTAL TAKE FORCOURE MEDIUM PARPARPARPARAT.THROUGH LIKLIES LIGHLIGHTY INDIBLEGULAR."}, {"heading": "PI N/A 23.25 0.30 204.69 12.97", "text": "Type 1 N / A 24.47 0.76 2221.34 8.46Non-stationary 2 22.86 1.99 160.50 9.17 Non-stationary 5 22.21 4.11 172.53 23.17 Non-stationary 10 20.27 3.18 158.53 3.61 Non-stationary 20 21.09 2.80 161.09 9.23Type 2 25.65 1.39 189.81 11.69 Type 2 5 20.48 3.34 178.64 20.19 Type 2 10 19.32 1.28 168.39 11.24 Type 2 20 26.00 5.31 186.87 5.34Dual Surface 2 20.59 0.96 168.62 7.85 Dual Surface 5 23.06 5.10 181.94 19.03 Dual Surface 10 22.02 0.92 173.54 12.54 Dual Surface 25 19.75 3.84 171.27 12.66 Dual Surface 50 18.81 1.61 174.35 18.10 to Operations in the system, such as floating point arithmetic operations performed in various jobs in the Type 2-based and non-stationary systems.

Hypothesis", "text": "In our experiments, we predict that all controllers will experience a reduction in performance the more noise is released into the environment.

FUTURE WORK", "text": "We have shown that type 2-based systems can certainly be derived from type 1 and, under certain conditions, provide performance that goes beyond type 1 and PI-based approaches described here as an intermediate sound environment. Further work is to formalize these results and develop a method to use noise levels to generate an estimate of the FOU required for optimal performance to meet the given conditions. For example, in the above case, we would like to be able to estimate an effective FOU size based on the size and frequency of wind changes in the environment, and this method could also be applied to non-stationary approaches to observe their behavior and performance in these scenarios."}, {"heading": "VIII.
