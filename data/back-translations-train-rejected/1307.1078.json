INTRODUCTIONThe importance of data mining techniques that could identify potential adverse drug events (ADEs) by analyzing information contained in large electronic medical databases was recognized decades ago. However, the more available type of medical database, the Spontaneous Reporting System (SRS) database, often contains records for thousands of suspected adverse events. However, in SRS databases, there is a link in the database between each drug and suspected adverse event that is reported. The main problems faced by SRS databases are incomplete or erroneous records, limited information, and underreporting [9]. Existing data mining techniques include the report quotas (ROR) [12], the proportional report ratio (PRR) that the report ratio between the reports (PRR), the Bayesian trust dissemination neural network (CPNGift) and the Gamma database (MultiGamma)."}, {"heading": "II. METHODS", "text": "In this paper, we are interested in comparing two of the standard techniques, namely the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and the Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) on two different data sets. Both methods use the values according to a 2 x 2 contingency table presented in Table I.ar Xiv: 130 7.10 78v1 [cs.CE] 3 Jul 201 3"}, {"heading": "A. Reporting Odds Ratio", "text": "The ROR is a ratio of two further ratios. It can be termed as follows: ROR = a / bc / d (1), where the values a, b, c, d are calculated in accordance with Table I. The value (a / b) is the number of patients who had the event of interest and took the drug of interest (a) divided by the number of patients who had the event while taking another medication (b). This results in the ratio of the drug taken in relation to all other medications in patients who had the event of interest. This is then compared with an analogous calculation for all other events, i.e. the number of patients who took the drug of interest but did not have the event of interest (c) divided by the number of people who had other events because they took any other medication (d). The default error (SE) for the ROR method is calculated as follows: SE (lnROR) = 1 + 1 + 1 + b \"(d) where n indicates the natural threshold."}, {"heading": "B. Proportional Reporting Ratio", "text": "The PRR, on the other hand, can be calculated as follows: PRR = a / (a + c) b / (b + d) (3) where a / (a + c) can be considered as the probability of an event of interest because the drug was taken of interest and an event. b / (b + d) can be considered as the probability that the event of interest occurred because another drug was taken and an event occurred. Therefore, the PRR approaches the ratio of conditional probabilities for the event of interest, considering the drug of interest and other medications, or considering the other drug. The standard error (SE) for the PRR method is calculated as follows: SE (lnPRR) = \u221a 1a \u2212 1 a + b + 1 c + 1 c + d (4)"}, {"heading": "C. Standard Error of ROR and PRR", "text": "If the value of the ROR or PRR is greater than one, it indicates that there is a deviation from the background rates resulting from the frequency of events that occur with medications other than the medicine of interest; the signal thresholds for the ROR and PRR are ROR \u2212 1.96 \u00b7 SE > 1 and PRR \u2212 1.96 \u00b7 SE > 1, respectively, which correspond to the lowest value of the 95% confidence interval, which is greater than 1."}, {"heading": "A PATIENT TIME-LINE STARTING FROM THE TIME THE DRUG IS TAKEN,", "text": "T0.

Database Pre-Processing", "text": "In order to calculate the ROR and PRR for the drugs and events in the GP database, it is first necessary to identify suspected drug ADEs by finding events that occur within a specified period of time after taking a drug for each patient. The period used is Tcrit \u2212 T0, where T0 is the time a drug is taken and Tcrit is a value that defines the length of the time frame. A graphic representation of this period is shown in Figure 1.Two values of Tcrit are examined, Tcrit = 2 months and Tcrit = \u221e. The Tcrit = 2 months has been suggested by a medical expert to predict imminent ADEs as people are not allowed to report events immediately, but the extension of the period will lead to more noise. Tcrit = \u221e has been investigated as this can help identify events that do not immediately occur."}, {"heading": "E.

Each time a patient visits the practice, a record of events related to that visit is added. It is mandatory to enter the data. The GPs\" Database examined contains medical records for a total of 69616 patients, covering a period of 107 years from 1902 to 2010 and comprising 1,858,229 medical events and 678,159 drug prescriptions."}, {"heading": "B. Spontaneous Reporting System Database", "text": "The SRS database examined in this paper is the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS), which contains information about potential drug-ADE interactions. It contains information about the medication taken, the potential adverse drug event, the overall outcome of the drug, and patient information, including demographic data. Data is recorded by professionals or the public when there is suspicion of ADE, but not always all information is included. Often, records are incomplete and mistakes can be made. Again, this type of database tends to be inadequate reporting. The period for the records examined extends from the first quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2009. The total number of reported drug sequences is 6,354,539 and the total number of recorded unique event names is 14,064. For general patient information, 51% of records contain missing information about either the age, sex, or date of occurrence."}, {"heading": "C. Tested Hypotheses", "text": "The following null hypotheses, along with their alternatives, are investigated in this work: ROR / PRR ROC (segment) comparison: H0: There is no statistically significant difference between the ranges below the receiver operational characteristic curve (for which FPR is less than n%) calculated by applying the ROR / PRR to the GP and SRS databases. H1: There is a statistically significant difference between ranges below the receiver operational characteristic curve (for which FPR is less than n%) calculated by applying the ROR / PRR to the GP and SRS databases. The ROC segment comparison is investigated (n < 100) as the method performance is only relevant to low FPR's meaning that the actual undesirable events found would be interchanged by an excessive amount of non-undesirable adverse events that are essentially noise."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "A total of 14,064, 10,755 and 9,158 possible adverse events were found in the SRS database, GP with Tcrit = \u221e and GP with Tcrit = 2."}, {"heading": "A. Ethinylestradiol", "text": "The ROC diagrams shown in Figures 2 (a) and 2 (b) show that the maximum TPR for both ROR and PRR is similar in relation to the three datasets. It is also evident that the TPR for all three datasets increases rapidly between the FPR values 0 and 0.1. Between the FPR values 0.1 and 0.2, the methods applied to the SRS database produce the largest TPR values. AUC values over the entire range of FPR values for the application of the ROR method with its corresponding 95% confidence interval are: 0.73 (0.63-0.83), 0.77 (0.68-0.87) and 0.77 (0.67-0.86) for the GP2, GP and SRS respectively. The ROC values for the GP2 database and GP 0.006 show the worse values (zero SR-0.0086)."}, {"heading": "B. Amoxicillin", "text": "Amoxicillin ROC analysis for both ROR and PRR is shown in Figures IV-B and??. PRR and ROR gave similar ROC diagrams for amoxicillin, for which the null hypothesis could not be discarded in all cases, resulting in statistically no significant difference between results. On the contrary, at low FPR values, the standard methods applied to the SRS dataset provide better results than those applied to the GP dataset, although the methods used using the SRS dataset cannot correctly detect all adverse events. On the contrary, the GP dataset enables the correct detection of true adverse events, while the FPR value increases. Overall, the GP2 dataset had the largest AUC. Applying the existing methods to the SRS dataset yielded worse results for known adverse drug events, such as 96 > ROS II., using IALIX \u2212 1.1."}, {"heading": "V. DISCUSSION", "text": "The better results have been applied by the standard methods applied to the SRS database, although the SRS database is an interesting phenomenon; the SRU database does not contain enough information to detect all potential side effects, but the SRU database is only suitable for cases where the SRU database is able to detect all potential side effects."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we examined the applicability of two standard data mining techniques for detecting potential drug adverse events in two different medical databases.The database of the spontaneous reporting system provides a library of suspected adverse events, but with limited information and problems, such as insufficient reporting; the methods developed for this type of database are limited by the quality and scope of data provided by the database; on the other hand, the general practice database provides a more comprehensive medical record of patients, which includes complete medical history and thus provides greater opportunities to find true potential adverse events. Originally, a method for converting the general practice database into a form that can be processed with standard techniques was proposed. Subsequently, statistical tests were used to investigate whether the results obtained for the two different sets of data are identical; the zero hypothesis in the case of comparing the entire recipient operation of characteristic curves was proposed; the standard information was not discarded in general terms, but if the critical part of the curve is seen to be incorrect, the positive part of the curve may be shown to be better."}], "references": [{"title": "Bayesian confidence propagation neural network", "author": ["A.
