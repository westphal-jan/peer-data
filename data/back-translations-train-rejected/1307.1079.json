INTRODUCTION The UK electricity market is currently undergoing a period of great change and will be subject to various pressures, some of which arise from specific situations in the UK, such as the history and current design of the national electricity grid, and others from global trends, such as the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the decreasing sources of hydrocarbon fuels. New technologies, such as electric cars, which require household chargers, are expected to become much more common. Available information to monitor and manipulate electricity consumption will grow very rapidly, particularly with the introduction of smart meters planned in the UK by 2019. In addition, the propulsion technologies to change the mix of power generation technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to reduce the switching from gas to the central grid, will be developed."}, {"heading": "II. BACKGROUND", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves, \"he said in an interview with the\" New York Times. \""}, {"heading": "III. METHODOLOGY", "text": "The approach detailed by Figueiredo has been applied as accurately as possible to the UK data to assess the suitability of the framework application for the UK specific data."}, {"heading": "A. Cleaning", "text": "For some UK readings, readings are missing for a few hours of the day, either due to the way the data was recovered from floppy disks or due to problems with the original collection of the data. For a first look at the data, it was decided to omit all days that contained a missing hourly measurement. Alternative approaches to replace some of the missing data with available data from a particular similar day will be investigated in the future."}, {"heading": "B. Normalisation", "text": "The UK data has been standardised within the daily measurements by scaling all readings using the maximum hourly value on the day set to 1. Thus, all hourly readings are in the range of 0-1. The effect of this standardisation is to focus on the shape of the usage pattern and not on the total usage. Two households of a similar shape (e.g. large usage in the early morning, low usage in the day and then medium usage in the evening) but with different total usage (e.g. if one household is much larger than the other) will have the same normalised load profile once scaling is carried out against the largest hourly value. Households will be presented in further analysis as being grouped similarly, while depending on the definition of \"similar\" it is not the intention to summarise them (e.g. if total electricity consumption is to be the main difference between households)."}, {"heading": "C. Stratifying the data", "text": "The UK data were stratified using a split between weekends (Saturday and Sunday) and weekdays, and were further stratified into winter (the months of November, December, January, February, March and April) and summer (the remaining months). Given the variability of the UK climate, it may be more accurate to stratify the data on the basis of daily temperatures than on the basis of the season, and this will form the basis for future work. Winter weekend data were randomly selected for further investigation, however detailed they are in the rest of this paper. Future work will focus on the other stratifications (e.g. summer weekday), which can be analysed in the same way, and investigations will be carried out on how individual households are allocated to the same or different groups, such as the season or the nature of the day changes. Milton Keynes data show different amounts of valid data for each household depending on the success of data regeneration following their recovery from floppy disks. Winter weekend data consists of between these 25 days and the partial evaluation for each household, with each household having a valid value of 111 days."}, {"heading": "D. Creation of load profiles", "text": "Each household has a representative average load profile, which is generated by calculating the mean for each hourly measurement across all valid readings for the winter weekend. Other methods could be used to calculate a representative profile, but this analysis has doubled the Portuguese work approach."}, {"heading": "E. Application of clustering algorithms", "text": "The Figueiredo approach compares the Kmeans algorithm with both a Self-Organized Map (SOM) using a 3 x 3 grid and a two-step process of creating a 10 x 7 grid SOM (i.e. 70 load diagrams), which is then bundled with the Kmeans algorithm. This approach was replicated with the UK data, although the volume of households is smaller (165 in Portugal, 93 in the UK) and therefore the reduction in dimensions from the first SOM level is not as large as with the Portuguese data. The Kmeans cluster method is based on a random starting situation and requires the input of the desired number of clusters. To minimize the impact of the random starting point, the cluster algorithm was executed 1,000 times with different random seeds. The study of the results suggests that the large number of runs allows the same optimal solution regardless of the initial value of the random sets."}, {"heading": "F. Calculation of adequacy measure", "text": "A good cluster scheme creates clusters in which the members of a particular cluster are tightly grouped, but in which the differences between the members of different clusters (or the representative profiles for the clusters) are well separated. A measure, the mean index adequacy (MIA), is defined in [1] asMIA = \u221a 1 K \u2211 k = 1 d2 (r (k), C (k)))) (2) in which K clusters (k = 1.. K) have been defined is a load profile associated with cluster k, and C (k) is the calculated center of the cluster k. The distance between 2 load diagrams is defined asd (li, lj) = a better bit (li, lj) = 1 H H \u0445h = 1 (li (h) \u2212 lj (h).H is the number of individual values in each load diagram (li, lj)."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "Different cluster approaches have been considered to determine which are best suited to the UK data."}, {"heading": "A. Kmeans", "text": "The cluster results using the Kmeans algorithm can be seen in Figure 3, where the black lines represent the load profiles for the individual households associated with the respective cluster, and the red line shows the calculated representative profile for the cluster (the centroid). Where only one household is associated with a cluster (as in \"Cluster8\"), the red line is crossed over the black line. Table I shows the number of households associated with each cluster through each technique."}, {"heading": "B. Self Organising Map", "text": "The Kohonen Self Organising Map algorithm was applied to the data using a hexagonal grid of 3 x 3 (i.e. 9 clusters), resulting in the load profile map as shown in Figure 4. The representation of household load profiles next to the calculated cluster centers yields the results in Figure 5 with the number of households assigned to each cluster in Table I. The clusters are randomly numbered and the order in the displays has been changed to match the Kmean clusters as much as possible. Agreement between the clusters generated is fairly obvious, with the exception of \"Cluster9,\" which differs significantly."}, {"heading": "C. Two stage process", "text": "The hypothesis in [5] is that applying a Kohonen Self Organising Map algorithm to the data generates 70 (10 x 7) clusters in a hexagonal grid, followed by applying the Kmeans algorithm to the SOM output, produces the best clusters in the sense of the MIA measurement. This work was then replicated using the UK data, although the number of households is lower than that used in the Portuguese work.The intermediate map generated by the SOM is in Figure 6. The intermediate load profiles shown are then entered into the Kmeans algorithm to generate nine definitive clusters.The initial mapping of household load profiles to the intermediate load profiles and from there to the final clusters is then investigated to determine the number of households in each final cluster and to allow the representation of the final cluster profiles alongside the households associated with this cluster."}, {"heading": "D. Comparison of clustering techniques", "text": "The MIA numbers for each cluster approach have been calculated and are listed in Table II, with a lower number indicating more compact clusters, and the results show that the best algorithm for clustering (as measured by the MIA) is the Kmeans approach. MIA measurement is very sensitive to the few profiles that differ from the profile of the generated cluster to which they are assigned. This sensitivity can significantly increase the MIA value as a good measure of cluster success because, while most households may be well grouped, a single household profile that is assigned to one cluster rather than another can significantly increase the MIA value, thereby reducing the measured effectiveness of the cluster. It is proposed in future work to examine alternative cluster measures and to evaluate the sensitivity of the measures to a few profiles that can be difficult clustered to assign. The diagrams that show the clusters produced and the households that appear to each cluster are very similar to each other, but also show some techniques that are very similar to each other."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "The work shows that the domestic load profiles can be successfully clustered and that the visual impression of the cluster representative profiles shows very different forms of use. This shows that the application of appropriate cluster techniques allows for a more precise differentiation between household use patterns than is currently used by industry and leads to more accurate representative profiles that can be used for demand aggregation, supply planning, marketing and other purposes. The selection of nine clusters reflects the decision made in the Portuguese electricity industry and the analysis of cluster dimensions used for demand aggregation."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This data has been accessed through the UK Energy Research Centre Energy Data Centre (UKERC-EDC).
