From Groups to Individuals using Fuzzy C Means Clustering", "abstract": "Changes in the UK electricity market mean that domestic users will be required to modify their usage behaviour in order that supplies can be maintained. Clustering allows usage profiles collected at the household level to be clustered into groups and assigned a stereotypical profile which can be used to target marketing campaigns. Fuzzy C Means clustering extends this by allowing each household to be a member of many groups and hence provides the opportunity to make personalised offers to the household dependent on their degree of membership of each group. In addition, feedback can be provided on how user's changing behaviour is moving them towards more \"green\" or cost effective stereotypical usage.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Jul 2013 15:55:33 GMT  (282kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1385v1", "Digital Engagement 11, Newcastle, November 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "Digital Engagement 11, Newcastle, November 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.LG", "authors": ["ian dent", "christian wagner", "uwe aickelin", "tom rodden"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1385"}, "pdf": {"name": "1307.1385.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Creating Personalised Energy Plans: From Groups to Individuals using Fuzzy C Means Clustering", "authors": ["Ian Dent", "Christian Wagner", "Tom Rodden", "Uwe Aickelin"], "emails": ["ird@cs.nott.ac.uk", "cxw@cs.nott.ac.uk", "tar@cs.nott.ac.uk", "uwe.aickelin@nottingham.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": "Categories and Subject Descriptors", "text": "H.4 [Information Systems]: Miscellaneous"}, {"heading": "General Terms", "text": "Algorithms, Economics, Human Factors"}, {"heading": "Keywords", "text": "Current Load Profiles, Clustering, Fuzzy C Means, Demand Side Management * Corresponding Author"}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "The electricity market in the UK is subject to various pressures, some of which are due to the history and current design of the national electricity grid, and others are due to global trends such as the need to reduce carbon emissions and the decline in sources of hydrocarbon fuels. New technologies, such as electric cars, which require domestic appliance charging stations, will be much more widespread; the information available to monitor and influence electricity consumption will grow rapidly, particularly with the introduction of smart meters to be completed in the UK by 2019; in addition, the drive to change the mix of electricity generation technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the desire to reduce carbon dioxide by changing non-electric demand such as gas central heating in the electricity grid; and the impact of climate change on changing electricity demand and the greater occurrence of extreme weather events will increase the difficulties in providing a stable and cost-effective supply. An approach to addressing this pressure is to achieve the application of DSM (Side and Management) to consumer behaviour."}, {"heading": "2. METHODOLOGY", "text": "The cluster algorithm Fuzzy C Means [4] allows the allocation of households to many clusters together with an indication of the degree to which the household is a member of a cluster. Data were tested on the hourly consumption of 93 households in Milton Keynes over a period of two years. The data is broken down into the winter and summer seasons, as well as into weekdays and weekends. Days that contain missing readings are omitted from the analysis and the data is normalized into a 0: 1 range and the mean value for each hour of the day is calculated. An average measurement is achieved for each of the 93 households, which consists of 24 hourly readings, each day of which is calculated by means of the readings for the winter weekends. [1] The use of fuzzy profiles and the use of self-profiles in the algorithms make it possible to allocate the individual households to associated mgorithms."}, {"heading": "3. RESULTS", "text": "The clusters derived from the Fuzzy C algorithm are shown in Figure 1. Each household has a degree of membership in each of the clusters, as the example in Figure 2 shows, where the household is a member of 5 clusters to some degree."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The proposed approach allows utilities to define offers for each of the nine stereotypical profiles, but to offer their customers individual tariffs based on the degree of their membership in the clusters that are consistent with the stereotypical profiles. As an example of how this can be used, the utility could expect household electricity consumption to move along similar lines to \"Cluster5\" from peak in the early evening to much lower use around the middle of the day. It could develop a tariff offer for \"Cluster5\" and then offer it to its customers, with the weight depending on household membership in that cluster. This could be combined with offers for the other clusters, offering each household an individual tariff consisting of the offer for each cluster, weighted by membership in each cluster. The results could also be used as feedback to consumers on how their daily behavior is changing and how they are progressively moving toward \"green\" usage patterns, weighted by membership in each cluster."}, {"heading": "5.
