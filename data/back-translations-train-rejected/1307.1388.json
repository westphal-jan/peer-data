The model is able to achieve a set of position- and scale-tolerant recognition, which is a central problem in pattern recognition. In this paper, based on some other biological experimental results, we introduce the Memory and Association Mechanisms into the above biologically inspired model. The main motivations of the work are (a) to mimic the active memory and association mechanism and add the 'top down' adjustment to the above biologically inspired hierarchical model and (b) to build up an algorithm which can save the space and keep a good recognition performance. The new model is also applied to object recognition processes. The primary experimental results show that our method is efficient with much less memory requirement.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Jul 2013 16:08:56 GMT  (1948kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1388v1", "9 pages, 10 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["qiao hong", "li yinlin", "tang tang", "wang peng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1388"}, "pdf": {"name": "1307.1388.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Introducing Memory and Association Mechanism Into a Biologically Inspired Visual Model", "authors": ["Hong Qiao", "Peng Wang"], "emails": ["hong.qiao@ia.ac.cn)."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is so far that it is only a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "A.

In the familiarity discrimination of the association process, a special episodic spot text of the candidate Tt is extracted and placed in the C1 layer of the HMAX model. Then, we calculate the S2 and C2 level characteristics of the candidate and the \"known\" objects that have the same prominent semantic attribute.

applied to multiple visual recognition tasks. The model is able to achieve a set of positionand scale-tolerant recognition, which is a central problem in pattern recognition. In this paper, based on some other biological experimental results, we introduce the Memory and Association Mechanisms into the above biologically inspired model. The main motivations of the work are (a) to mimic the active memory and association mechanism and add the \u2019top down\u2019 adjustment to the above biologically inspired hierarchical model and (b) to build up an algorithm which can save the space and keep a good recognition performance. More details of the work could be explained as follows: (1) In objects memorizing process: Our proposed model mimics some characteristics of human\u2019s memory mechanism as follows: (a) In our model, one object is memorized by semantic attributes and special image patches (corresponding to episodic memory). The semantic attributes describe each part of the object with clear physical meaning, for example, if eyes and mouths of faces are \u2019big\u2019 or \u2019small\u2019 and so on. One special patch is selected if the value of the corresponding semantic feature is far from average one. The patch should be the most prominent part of the object. (b) In our model, different features (semantic attributes and special patches) of one object are stored in distributed places and the common feature of different objects is saved aggregately, which can learn to classify the difference of similar features of different objects. The similarity thresholds to each object can be learnt when new objects are learnt. (2) In object recognition process: In biological process, the associated recognition including familiarity discrimination and recollective matching. In our proposed model, firstly mimicking familiarity discrimination (\u2019knowing\u2019 though the episode), we compare the special patches of candidates with that of saved objects using above mentioned biologically inspired hierarchical model, where the candidates and saved objects have the same prominent semantic features. Then mimicking recollective matching, the comparison results of special patches are combined with semantic feature comparison. The new model is also applied to object recognition processes. The primary experimental results show that our method is efficient with much less memory requirement.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
