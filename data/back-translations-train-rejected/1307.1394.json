Today, two major methods of detecting ADRs are the Spontaneous Reporting System (SRS) [2, 3] and Prescription Event Monitoring (PEM) [4, 5]. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a signal in pharmacovigilance as \"all reported information about a possible causal link between an adverse event and a drug, with the relationship previously unknown or incompletely documented.\" [6] For spontaneous reporting systems, many machine learning methods are used to detect ADRs, such as Bayesian trust network prior to the spread of neural networks (BCPNN) [7], decision support method (RSM), knowledge-based approach [10], etc. One limitation is reporting ADRs to a medical mechanism that does not differentiate correctly from other RDR patients."}, {"heading": "A. The Extraction of Feature Matrix", "text": "To detect the ADRs of medications, the first characteristic matrix is extracted from the THIN database, which describes the medical events that patients experience before or after taking medications. Subsequently, the characteristic selection method of the Student's t-Test is performed to select the essential characteristics from the characteristic matrix that contains thousands of medical events. Figure 1 shows the process of detecting the ADRs by the characteristic matrix. Characteristic matrix A describes the medical events for each patient during 60 days prior to taking medications. Characteristic matrix B reflects the medical events during 60 days after taking medications. To reduce the impact of the small events and save computing time and space, we define 100 patients as a group. Characteristic matrix X and Y are characteristic matrix after patients have been divided into groups."}, {"heading": "B. Medical Events and Readcodes", "text": "Medical events or symptoms are represented by medical codes or read codes. In the \"Readcodes\" database, there are 103387 types of medical events. General practice read codes (GP) were invented and developed by Dr James Read in 1982. NHS (National Health Service) has extended the codes to all areas of clinical practice, and the code is hierarchically from left to right or from level 1 to level 5. This means that it provides more detailed information from level 1 to level 5. Table 1 shows medical symptoms based on read codes at level 3 and level 5. \"Other soft tissue diseases\" is a generic term that uses read codes at level 3. \"Foot pain,\" \"heel pain,\" etc. provide more details based on level 5 readcodes."}, {"heading": "C. Feature Selection Based on Student's t-test", "text": "Feature extraction and feature selection are widely used in biomedical data processing [11-18]. In our research, we use student t-test [19] feature selection method to detect significant ADRs from thousands of medical events. Student t-test is a type of statistical hypotheses test based on a normal distribution and is used to measure the difference between two types of samples."}, {"heading": "D. Other Parameters", "text": "Variable R2 represents the ratio of the number of patients after taking the medication to the number of the total population showing a particular medical symptom. R and R2 are defined as follows: N / NB i f NB # 0; NA if NB = 0; R2 = NA I Nwo NB and NA represent the number of patients before or after taking medications for a particular medical event; variable N represents the number of total population taking medications."}, {"heading": "III.
