INTRODUCTIONA fuzzy logic system maps inputs in a fuzzy set using a fuzzifier. The fuzzy set output is then processed as part of a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), where the set is used as input for an inference system and its associated rule base. This results in a new output set that can itself be decentralized into a value suitable for use as a standard (e.g. PID) controller output. The way in which the processing of the fuzzy sets is handled can be varied based on application-specific requirements or limitations, and this leads to three main subcategories of fuzzy control: Type-1, Interval Type-2 and general Type-2. In this paper we look at the type-1 and interval-type-2 based systems and apply both control problems to increasing levels of uncertainty."}, {"heading": "II. BACKGROUND", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Type-1 Fuzzy Logic", "text": "The type 1 fuzzy logic introduced by Zadeh in [15] uses 2D membership functions that are usually triangular or Gaussian in shape. The x-axis represents the amount of possible inputs into the system obtained from the application.The y-axis represents the degree to which the given input is a member of the fuzzy group and has a value between 0 (no membership in the group) and 1 (full membership in the group).One of the main deficiencies of the type 1 fuzzy logic is its limited flexibility. Moving a type 1 controller coordinated in a particular environment to another environment can often lead to significant performance deteriorations unless changes are made to the control.Mendel [3] has found that type 2 control can be advantageous in many areas over type 1, such as in robust control where the information to be processed is uncertain."}, {"heading": "B. Type-2 Fuzzy Logic", "text": "Type-2 fuzzy logic is a development of type-1, and with this development comes greater freedom and flexibility, as discussed by Wu [13]. This can increase performance in certain situations, as investigated by Hagras [2], to the potential cost of increased computing load. Part of the increased flexibility of this type of system can be attributed to the fact that the membership functions in type-2 systems are represented in three dimensions, rather than in the two type-1. This additional dimension leads to what is known as secondary membership functions at the 2D level. They are referred to as upper and lower membership functions (UMF and LMF) 8 July 201 3In an interval type-2 system, the value of the secondary function is binary, whereby interval type-2 systems can be represented by two individual membership functions at the 2D level. They are referred to as upper and lower membership functions (UMF and LMF)."}, {"heading": "III. EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Problem description", "text": "The application to be used as a test case is FLOATS, described in [1]. It is an autonomous sailing boat, originally based on the work of Stelzer in [11] and capable of operating both in the simulation and in the real world. Wind, location, waypoint and direction sensors are used to calculate error and triangular error values, which are used as inputs for a fuzzy inference system that generates an output value for rudder changes. In this paper, we have opted for simulation as an experimental method, with real-life experiments planned for future work. The simulator used, tracksail, was used by others for the development and testing of autonomous sailing robot systems including sauce and neal [7]. Tracksail is a Java-based open source software and communicates with boat controllers using a standard network sock.A value set by this controller would be better reserved for all controllers in the H1 controller."}, {"heading": "B. Hypothesis", "text": "We anticipate that there will be a point at which the difficulty of the course is sufficient that the Type 2 will significantly improve the results of the standard Type 1 controller. We expect this behavior to occur more clearly in situations with a higher uncertainty value as described in Table II and with the additional turns that further exaggerate the effect. The uncertainty value is only used to give an arbitrary order for the configurations and is calculated from the sum of the direction and speed uncertainty values. It is expected that the RMSE will increase in a predictable manner as the various wind configurations are tested - with the A and B configurations having lower RMSE values than, for example, the H and I. We do not expect a linear increase, especially since several configurations have the same uncertainty value. We also expect that with the increase in the FOU size, performance will begin at Type 1 levels. We expect this to coincide with an overall performance increase as the FOU and a larger decrease ensues."}, {"heading": "C. Experimental Design", "text": "The controllers in the test maintained the same membership functions throughout all experiments, showing the Type 1 membership functions in 1 (a). The only change in each run was the horizontal movement of the Type 2 controller, which changes the size of the FOU. We tested six different values for each FOU size, starting at 0 and increasing up to a maximum of 25 in steps of 5. An example of FOU size 10 is shown in Figure 1 (b). In our application, we derive our Type 2 membership function by introducing a horizontal movement into the Type 1 membership functions, varying the amount of movement as a parameter value. Figures 1 (b) and 1 (c) show examples of this, shifting the Type 1 membership function 10 and 20 respectively, to give the shown VOU. Two separate mechanisms were used to gradually increase the difficulty of completing the course, with the aim of testing to highlight the differences in performance that may be achieved in the different systems."}, {"heading": "D. Course Design", "text": "Courses are built from the simplest of all the courses - a straight line with a parallel fixed wind, where the boat simply has to move forward to complete the course. Difficulty is then increased by adding turns with different angles, as shown in Figure 2. It is noted that the courses to be tested contain either one or two turns. Vertical movement required to complete the course, which is defined as either 0, 25, 50 or 100 meters, changes the angle that the boat has to rotate to complete the course. The angle required for the first round is 5.71, 11.42 and 21.84 for 25, 50 and 100 meters vertical movements, respectively, while the second round, which is twice as large, will be 11.4, 22.84 and 43.68 centimeters. Any combination of course layout and wind configurations as shown in Table II is tested with each controller configuration."}, {"heading": "IV.

CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK", "text": "We have shown that type 2-based controllers can perform better than type 1 controllers. However, caution must be exercised when designing the type 2 system, especially with regard to the size of the FOU. Too small an FOU and type 2 FLC will not improve compared to type 1. Too large and it will perform worse. In our chosen application, a FOU size of 20 seems to be the optimal value over a range of experimental conditions. Further work is required to determine the reason for this value. Overall, this work shows that the relationship between performance change and ambient noise is much more complex than previously thought. The statement that increasing ambient noise will lead to an improvement in the performance of type 2 compared to type 1 is not supported by the results in this paper."}, {"heading": "A. Future Work", "text": "The next step in this work will be to conduct these experiments in a real environment and to observe to what extent the results presented here in the simulation are applicable to a problem of real control. Based on the results of these experiments, a generalized type-2 could be a pathway for future work."}, {"heading": "VII.
