CONCLUSION", "text": "We presented an approach to combining HTN and geometric task planning that allows for a more complex reasoning than possible with standard trajectory planning, making room for comprehensive multi-level traceability and networked traceability, we showed how the two planners can be linked together, and gave insights into a methodology for developing HTN GTP domains. Our prototype implementation is capable of performing basic GTP traceability and calculating and sharing symbolic facts that can be used by the HTN developer under preconditions, and finally we presented experimental results that we plan to use as a benchmark for future enhancements and for developing heuristics for GTP."}], "references": [{"title": "Mightability maps: A perceptual level decisional framework for co-operative and competitive human-robot interaction", "author": ["A.K.
