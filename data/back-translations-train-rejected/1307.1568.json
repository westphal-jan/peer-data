The goal of ontology alignment is to identify semantically matching concepts and relationships across independently developed ontologies that purport to describe the same knowledge. In order to handle the widest possible class of ontologies, many alignment algorithms rely on terminological and structural meth- ods, but the often fuzzy nature of concepts complicates the matching process. However, one area that should provide clear matching solutions due to its mathematical nature, is units of measurement. Several on- tologies for units of measurement are available, but there has been no attempt to align them, notwithstanding the obvious importance for tech- nical interoperability. We propose a general strategy to map these (and similar) ontologies by introducing MathML to accurately capture the semantic description of concepts specified therein.

With the introduction of version 3.0, MathML has moved MathML closer to OpenMath, especially in terms of content dictionaries [19]. Obviously, we are interested in content MathML, and for the rest of this work we will use MathML as an abbreviation for content MathML version 3.0.Ontologies that describe units of measurement routinely provide information about their basic physical dimensions (e.g. length, mass, time, etc.) and their conversion value (e.g. Celsius = 5 / 9 (Fahrenheit - 32).)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Minimum Prior Knowledge", "text": "As already mentioned, all units can be described both in SI base units and in derived units, which in turn can be expressed in base units. Therefore, it can be concluded that all units can be described on the basis of the seven SI base units: meters, kilograms, kelvin, seconds, candela, amperes and moles. Therefore, to assign two unit ontologies, only the SI base units need to be compared as a starting point. This is the minimum requirement for processing the MathML labels. Our general approach assumes that the conversion values of the units are always relative to the SI base units and this is reflected in the MathML comparison. If two units of measurement are to be compared ontologies, the user must provide a first comparison between the base units found in each ontology."}, {"heading": "3.2 Generation and Insertion of MathML", "text": "The difficulty of creating MathML and inserting it into an existing ontology depends on the structure of the ontology and what information is present in it. For example, different ontologies will use different properties to indicate that one unit is the quotient of two other units. However, given a well-structured ontology that is consistent in its representation of the units, a repeatable pattern will emerge where the necessary information for the MathML encoding can be found. A program can be written to automatically process these patterns and transform them into MathML code. We have inserted MathML into three existing ontologies, one of which will be examined more closely later, but in the end the effort of inserting MathML will vary from ontology to ontology. For the purposes of our approach, the MathML only needs to be inserted so that it is accessible to our matchers."}, {"heading": "3.3 Processing of MathML", "text": "Before comparing the MathML code, it is expected that each unit being considered and aligned has already inserted the corresponding MathML units. (Extending to this initial mapping of units (i.e. alignment entities without corresponding MathML codes) is a topic of future work (Section 6). As already mentioned, some units do not describe their conversions to SI base units, but derivative units. Both approaches are commonly used when comparing the MathML codes, it must be checked to see if the units can be broken down further."}, {"heading": "4 Application of Approach", "text": "As proof of the concept, the approach outlined in the previous section has been applied to three ontologies. Implementation is divided into two phases. f Phase I includes the following pre-processing steps for each ontology: 1. Determine dimension and conversion data for the units 2. Create MathML based on the information from the previous step and insert asrdfs: Commentary3. Create a modified ontology file with the MathML code Phase II compares two modified ontologies, indicating the initial mappings of the base units: 1. Read the initial comparison file and two ontology files. Extract the MathML. 2. Compare the units (in particular their dimensions and conversion values) and determine which are equivalent 3. Create a file with equivalence rules between the units of the two ontologies. The approach is divided into two phases to make the implementation more modular."}, {"heading": "4.1 Phase I", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive themselves, and they are able to survive themselves, \"he said.\" But it's not as if they are able to survive themselves. \"He added,\" But it's not as if they can survive themselves. \"He added,\" It's as if they are able to survive themselves, as if they were able to survive themselves. \"He added,\" It's not as if they are able to survive themselves. \"He added,\" It's as if they are able to survive themselves, as if they were able to survive themselves. \""}, {"heading": "4.2 Phase II", "text": "Implementing this phase can be a stand-alone program, processing ontology files that contain MathML in their rdfs: comment. In addition, an initial alignment containing equivalences between the seven SI base units is provided to the program. In the following, a detailed description of the steps that MathML contains is applied, the results of this query are assumed to be all processable units, in other words, anything without MathML is ignored (see Future Work, Section 6). MathML is then analyzed to extract the dimensions that MathML contains, and the results of this query are assumed to be all processable units."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "To evaluate our approaches, we have manually aligned the ontologies for comparison (referred to as Reference Units). Following the OAEI comparisons, we calculate the precision, callback and F measurement. Therefore, we use Alignment API version 4.4 to compare the generated alignments with the reference values. Results are listed in Table 1. F measurements, which represent a combination of the precision and recall values, are pretty good."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We have shown that in the field of ontologies, MathML can be used to better represent the semantics of the units to compare them between ontologies. The alignments generated provide good precision and retrieval values compared to manually generated reference alignments. In future work, we intend to improve the results by further testing to ensure that the matching units are both conceptually and mathematically correct. Furthermore, it will be interesting to combine this approach with other methods of ontological alignment. For example, MathML matching can be used as the first match in combination with lexical comparisons for non-mathematical concepts. This initial mapping is then fed into an algorithm that takes structural similarities between the two ontologies into account in order to build on the original matching."}], "references": [{"title": "Ontology matching: state of the art and future challenges", "author": ["P.
