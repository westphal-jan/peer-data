BACKGROUND", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. THIN Database", "text": "The THIN database consists of a collection of information from participating UK GP practices, including information on patients such as their year of birth, gender and family connections, and the demographics of the area in which they live. It also contains temporal information detailing a patient's prescription and medical event histories since registration, using a database of records from 495 general practices for this comparison. This subset of the THIN database contained about four million patients, over 358 million prescriptions and over 233 million medical event records are recorded in the database by a reference code known as a read code. The read codes used in the THIN database are an independent system specifically designed for primary care, but each ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification) code (or analogues) has a corresponding read code that matches patients suffering from redundancy as different reading codes from the medical event, for example."}, {"heading": "B. Drugs Investigated", "text": "The drug nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that helps relax smooth muscles in the heart and blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily and is therefore used to treat angina, high blood pressure or Raynaud's disease. Penicillin benzypenicillin sodium and fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are three antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections; the other two drugs studied are doxepin, a tricyclic antidepressant, and glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were selected to investigate how well the database of drug production is when applied to different drug populations."}, {"heading": "C. Existing Algorithms", "text": "There is limited information about prescription rates and background of medical events, both of which are not known. To overcome these problems, a disproportionate drug algorithm has been implemented, how the calculation of the drug database is independent of the medical event and the drug database, how often the event of interest is compared with the drug of interest, see Table II. For example, how often other events are compared with the drug of interest, compared with other drugs (w01w11), see Eq. 1.ROR = w00 / w10 w11 (1) has examined the use of algorithms developed for SRS databases to compare other drugs of interest."}, {"heading": "III. COMPARISON METHOD", "text": "Each data mining algorithm is applied to the THIN database, and a ranking of medical events is returned; events are classified in descending order of association between the drug of interest and the event, so that events that the algorithm has deemed more likely are classified higher, an example of which can be found in Table III. The algorithm is then analyzed by determining how well it classified each of the known ADRs that occurred in the ranking returned. Known ADRs are those listed in the British National Forms (BNF) [14] for the specific drug, or medical events of the type \"side effects on drug x,\" or the information on the continuation of drug prescription.Based on a ranking of events, we calculate the measure of truth y (i) for the highest-ranking event by allowing y (i) = 1 if the event is known as ADR, and y (i) as otherwise shown in Table III."}, {"heading": "A. Precision K", "text": "The precision of each algorithm is defined as the fraction of known ADRs that occur in the top k events of the list supplied by each algorithm for a given drug, see Equation (12). Precision = \u2211 k i = 1 y (i) k (12) This study examines two k values, k = 10 and k = 50."}, {"heading": "B. Mean Average Precision", "text": "Mean Mean Precision (MAP) is a measure that can be used to determine how well an algorithm generally classifies medical events related to a drug, a measure that has previously been used to compare SRS data mining algorithms adapted to a LOD [7] and was also used in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Cup, a competition in which participants were required to recognize ADRs in a generated LOD [15]. MAP is calculated by determining the average precision for each k corresponding to a known ADR, MAP = \u2211 K: y (K) = 1precision K \u2211 i (i) (13) based on Table III as an example, since two known ADRs are returned (\u0445i y (i) = 2) and the known ADRs in the table are ranked second and third if we examine the known ADRs only rarely and the known RATR situations respectively (RATRs)."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "A. Precision Table IV shows that overall, the HUNT60 had the highest precision 10 and the ROR05 did the worst. At a significance level of 1%, there was insufficient evidence that one of the algorithms had a significantly higher precision 10 than any other algorithm (unilaterally paired Mann-Witney test with multiple test correction, p = 0.01). The HUNT60 also had the highest average precision 50, see Table V. Similar to the Precision 10, none of the algorithms had a significantly higher precision 50 (unilaterally paired MannWhitney U test with multiple test correction, p = 0.01)."}, {"heading": "B. Mean Average Precision", "text": "The results can be divided into three different drug groups: the first drug group, doxepin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, all show a similar trend, with MUTARA (MUTARA60 and MUTARA180) performing best; the next group, glibenclamide and benzyl penicillin sodium, showing that MUTARA outperforms the OE ratio, but the HUNT60 algorithm performs best; and finally, the remaining group, consisting of only one drug, nifedipine, shows a unique trend, with MUTARA performing relatively poorly, while the OE algorithm produces the best result. MAP values for all drugs except glibenclamide are in the range 0.04 \u2212 0.18, with MAP values for glibenclamide in the range of 0.01 \u2212 0.0b - 0.0b, and nibenicdium in the range of 0.05."}, {"heading": "V. DISCUSSION", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "Our results show that no algorithm outperformed others, that existing methods had difficulty detecting rare ADRs, and that none of the algorithms were robust against all drugs studied. Future work will need to examine how appropriate parameters for each algorithm can be found depending on the drug studied and ways to filter disease progression and events of therapeutic failure."}], "references": [{"title": "Quantitative signal detection using spontaneous ADR reporting", "author": ["A.
