If we use the CSP encoding we have given in Example 3, as well as corollary 1, we will show a new result that this problem is traceable when \u03b2 \u03b2 1 is fixed. To simplify the analysis, let us assume that without loss of generality, \u03b1 < V |, which means that each solution has at least one broken edge. We assert that if \u03b2 is specified, then the constraint C\u03b2 = e\u03b2 [\u03b2] is allowed for a partial mapping check, and has only a polynomial number of satisfactory assignments.

In particular, we identify a relationship between the number of solutions and the size of a CSP instance as such a property. On the basis of this insight, we show that known structural constraints are traceable for each class of CSP instances with global constraints that meet this property. In particular, this implies that the structural constraints that we consider traceable apply to classes of instances in which each global constraint has unsatisfactory mappings relative to its size. To illustrate our result, we apply them to a known problem, the associated graph distribution problem, and use them to identify a new traceable case of this problem. We also show how the concept of backdoors, subsets of variables that can make a problem easy to solve once our problem is used in some cases."}], "references": [{"title": "Width Functions for Hypertree Decompositions", "author": ["I.

that is, a set of constraints that must be satisfied simultaneously. Constraints can either be represented extensionally, by explicitly listing allowed combinations of values, or implicitly, by special-purpose algorithms provided by a solver. Such implicitly represented constraints, known as global constraints, are widely used; indeed, they are one of the key reasons for the success of constraint programming in solving real-world problems. In recent years, a variety of restrictions on the structure of CSP instances that yield tractable classes have been identified. However, many such restrictions fail to guarantee tractability for CSPs with global constraints. In this paper, we investigate the properties of extensionally represented constraints that these restrictions exploit to achieve tractability, and show that there are large classes of global constraints that also possess these properties. This allows us to lift these restrictions to the global case, and identify new tractable classes of CSPs with global constraints.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
