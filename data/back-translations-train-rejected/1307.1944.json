The original intention of the REPL model is to externalize the result of the evaluation in a human-readable form, but this can happen many different things for proof assistants. Printing can already happen during the evaluation, as a trace of the ongoing execution. Conceptually, we decorate all prover messages with the ID of the ongoing transaction, to recompile the output stream in the correct order, relative to the original source of the command span or local positions within its source, say for warnings and errors that are attached directly to malformed areas of the source code. The latter helps to reduce the non-determinism of the command transactions, the use of command transactions internally: results of various undervaluations usually refer to different parts of the source text. 5Traditionally, the main result of an interactive proof step is the subsequent proof state \u2192, which implicitly with the print of large states (which often require significant printing of time)."}, {"heading": "3 Protocol Interpreter", "text": "The classic REPL model makes a tight loop around the read-evaluation print phases to immediately synchronize all phases: \"There is only a limited number of commands that re-synchronize the output stream,\" the author continues, \"there is only one main part of the process.\" (\"There is only a limited number of commands that implement the documentary model,\" the author continues), \"but there is only one specific protocol input channel in which it reads protocol commands and evaluates them immediately.\" (\"It is similar to some of the rudiments of the former REPL,\" but we only do unidirectional stream processing without provoking the other side and printing the results. \")\" Protocol \"commands,\" \"it is not just a private input channel where it reads protocol commands, and immediately evaluates them.\" \"It merely resembles some of REPL's previous rudiments, but we do some REPL's only.\""}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "This year, the time has come to be able to live in a country where people are able to move around and explore the world."}], "references": [{"title": "User Interaction with the Matita Proof Assistant", "author": ["Andrea Asperti", "Claudio Sacerdoti Coen", "Enrico Tassi", "Stefano Zacchiroli"], "venue": "Journal of Automated Reasoning", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Proof General: A Generic Tool for Proof Development", "author": ["David Aspinall"], "venue": "editors: European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS),", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2000}, {"title": "A Framework for Interactive Proof", "author": ["David Aspinall", "Christoph L\u00fcth", "Daniel Winterstein"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Pervasive Parallelism in Highly-Trustable Interactive Theorem Proving Systems", "author": ["Bruno Barras", "Hugo Herbelin", "Yann R\u00e9gis-Gianas", "Enrico Tassi", "Makarius Wenzel", "Burkhart Wolff"], "venue": "editors: Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2013}, {"title": "A generic approach to building user interfaces for theorem provers", "author": ["Yves Bertot", "Laurent Th\u00e9ry"], "venue": "Journal of Symbolic Computation", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 1998}, {"title": "Efficient Parallel Programming in Poly/ML and Isabelle/ML", "author": ["David C.J.
