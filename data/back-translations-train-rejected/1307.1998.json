Data Analysis", "text": "The CCCS dataset introduced in [3] is a cross-sectional socio-economic dataset based on data from the Consumer Credit Advisory Service. In its 58 attributes, it contains information about 70,000 customers who contacted the Service between 2004 and 2008 to receive advice on how to overcome their debts. Information was gathered through interviews when each customer first contacted the Service, and it varies from the standard demographic of financial details, spending details and debt details. Based on this fact, we can see that the 58 attributes of the dataset are organized into more general categories of attributes such as the above. They form a sort of hierarchy, shown in Figure 2. Here, the CCCS dataset is divided into 6 broad categories, demographics, debt, assets, expenses, debit details and income. This is similar to the above, the only difference being that financial details are divided into income and assets and unsecured assets and information about debt."}, {"heading": "B. Data preprocessing", "text": "Before moving into the cluster analysis of the data, it is always important to analyze them, find inconsistencies within the data and provide a way to deal with them. In the CCCS dataset, there were a lot of problems before clustering the data in terms of missing values, nominal attributes, duplicates, correlations and a decision about whether we should consider the time parameter. The problems that came to our attention and the measures we have taken to deal with them are the following: Missing attributes. Although the percentage of missing values contains about 18% of the data, they tend to appear in the same clients for the same type of categories. In this sense, we were able to delete the specific clients in terms of the attributes that we were interested in and move to a smaller dataset with a very small percentage of missing values. In the case of using all the attributes, we were able to reduce the size of the dataset to about 37000 with a percentage of 0.8% missing values."}, {"heading": "C.

Selfish/ Non Selfish Characterization", "text": "In an attempt to associate the behavioural groups we discovered with aspects of personality, we processed the selfishness ratings to produce a ranking of the spending attributes as to how strongly they are associated with the Selfish Personality. To achieve this, we calculated a weight of how strongly the individual attributes define the Selfish Personality for each of the attributes we subtracted from the Selfish Method. Finally, weights were normalized and evaluated in descending order. Attributes with their final weights can be subtracted in Table 6 and we can easily see that the attributes Leisure, Travel and Foodare strongly associated with the Selfish Personality."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We would like to thank John Gathergood, Lecturer at the School of Economics, for providing the CCCS dataset and the 52 students in the Department of Psychology for voluntarily participating in the expenditure evaluation."}], "references": [{"title": "Harabasz.\u201dA dedrite method for cluster analysis", "author": ["R.B.
