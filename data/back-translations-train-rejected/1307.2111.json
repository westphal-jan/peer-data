INTRODUCTION", "text": "The electricity market in the UK is undergoing dramatic changes. Legal, social and political impulses for a more carbon-efficient electricity grid, together with the dramatically increased flow of data from households through the use of smart meters, are leading to disruptive changes in existing practices. In particular, changing the scanning of electricity consumption from a 3-month billing cycle to a 30-minute (or shorter) sampling period using smart meters is changing the understanding of household behaviour that is possible [3]. One approach to managing the pressure on the electricity grid is the application of demand side management (DSM) techniques to achieve changes in consumer behaviour at the national level [5]. The Desimax project [4] is the appropriate authority."}, {"heading": "2.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This initial work shows that useful clusters using the concept of flexibility can be derived and can be used cost-effectively to achieve appropriate behavioural changes in those households that are most likely to respond. Thus, households that exhibit high variability in their behaviour could be addressed with a variable pricing initiative to encourage the use of cheaper electricity during off-peak times. These households are unlikely to perceive this as too much disruption to their normal, highly variable behaviour and are likely to respond positively to the initiative. In contrast, households that exhibit stable habitual behaviour are likely to find any open initiative too disruptive to their lifestyle and to be addressed with technological solutions such as in-house batteries that would allow their demand to shift to the electricity grid without affecting their day-to-day behaviour.Future work will broaden the concept of flexibility to explore the identification of repetitive activities (e.g. moving back to bed) by examining the pattern of electricity consumption as they use it on a daily basis."}, {"heading": "5.
