Within the next generation of GIS systems, the basic information theory modalities for undergoing radical transformations are presented: high-level ontological units such as objects, events, actions, and processes, as well as the ability to model and understand them, are expected to be a native feature of the nextgeneration GIS.

Spatial Occurrences: Analyses with Events and Objects", "text": "Our goal is to develop the functionality that makes it possible to think about spatio-temporal narratives that consist of events and processes at the geographical level. We are not trying to perform an elaborate ontological characterization of events and processes, a research topic that has been extensively explored in the research. For the purposes of this paper, we are using a minimal but rich conceptual model that consists of a series of events, so that it can be used for qualitatively grounded metric spatial datasets that consist of spatial and temporal footprints of human and natural phenomena on a geographical scale.Spatial events can be defined on two levels: (I) domain independent and (II) domain dependent:"}, {"heading": "I. Domain Independent Spatial Occurrences.", "text": "These events are those that can be semantically characterized within a general theory of space and spatial change. They can be grounded either in terms of a qualitative theory or an elaborate typology of geospatial events (e.g. Fig. 4 illustrates a typology of changes at the object level). Spatial changes at a qualitative level (relationship) can be regulated as (possibly) by the continuity constraints of the relationship space. At this level, the only identifiable concept of an event is a transition from a qualitative state (relationship) to a state (relationship) other than (possibly) regulated by the continuity constraints of the relationship space. At this level, the only identifiable concept of an event is the qualitative spatial transition to which the primitive objects in theory are subject, e.g. the transition of an object to an object (o1) from separation to another object (o2) to a tangentially appropriate part."}, {"heading": "II. Domain-Specific Spatial Occurrences", "text": "On a domain-dependent level, behavioral patterns can characterize high-level processes, environmental / natural and human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, land-use transformations, etc. These are domain-specific events that trigger a transformation of the underlying spatial structures that can be modeled [Couclelis, 2009]. Essentially, however, these are domain-specific events or actions that exhibit (explicitly) identifiable event criteria and effects that can be defined in terms of qualitative spatial changes, and the basic typology of spatial changes. For example, in Fig. 5, we can clearly see that a region continues to shrink and ultimately disappear during the years 1950 to 1990. Bhatt and Loke [2008] identifies the following general notion of a \"spatial event\": \"spatial events are events or actions with explicitly specifiable event-type events and preconditions and impacts that cause spatial change."}, {"heading": "4.2. Practical Abduction for GIS", "text": "In the context of formal spatio-temporal calculations and logic of action and change, this means the ability to provide scenario and narrative completion capabilities at a high level of abstraction. Consider the GIS domain depicted in Fig. 5 and the fundamental conceptual understanding of spatial events described in Section 4.1. At a domain-independent level, the scene can be described on the basis of topological and qualitative scale relationships. Consequently, the only changes identifiable at the level of spatial theory are shrinkage and eventual disappearance - this is because a domain-independent spatial theory can only encompass a generic typology (appearance, disappearance, growth, shrinkage, deformation, splitting, merging, etc.) that is independent of spatial changes. However, at a domain-specific level, these changes could designate a particular event (or process) as intuitively explainable or inexplicable."}, {"heading": "4.2.1. Scenario and Narrative Completion", "text": "Explanatory problems require the inclusion of a narrative description that, from a logic-based point of view, essentially represents a differentiated course of actual events about which we may have incomplete information [Miller and Shanahan, 1994, Pinto, 1998]. Narrative descriptions are typically available as observations from the real / imagined execution of a system or process. Since narratives inherently belong to actual observations, i.e. they are temporally limited, the goal is often to assimilate / explain them in relation to an underlying process model and an approach to deriving explanations.In the face of partial narratives that describe the evolution of a system (e.g. through temporally ordered scene observations in event-based GIS datasets) in relation to spatio-temporal dates, scenarios, and narrative completion of the narrative corresponds to the ability to derive completions that structure the narrative by interpolating the missing spatial and action-situational information / events in a spatial-situation / specific way in a dynamic domaination6."}, {"heading": "4.3.

Temporal Partitioning and Qualitative Abstraction", "text": "In the geographical area, input data often comes from multiple sources, such as different sensors, remote sensing data, map data, etc., and the data itself is fraught with measurement errors and uncertainties. In order to perform explanatory analyses on a level of qualitative spatial relations, geo-referenced quantitative input data on spatial objects from different sources must be translated into relationships from several qualitative spatial models or calculations dealing with different aspects of space. A prerequisite for applying the qualitative abstraction method is that the input data is distributed in such a way that each part is linked to a certain point in time in an ordered sequence of time. At each point in time, the qualitative abstraction method takes the associated quantitative data and derives the spatial relations from the given qualitative models that exist between the objects involved, resulting in a static qualitative spatial description for each point in time."}, {"heading": "4.3.2.

Methods of data integration and conflict resolution have been investigated, for example, under the terms information fusion Gre \u0301 goire and Konieczny [2006], and are usually classified into quantitative approaches and symbolic approaches. Quantitative approaches mainly use statistical methods such as Dubai square adjustment to deal with multiple observations, while symbolic information fusion deals with the revision of logical theories in the presence of new evidence. An important distinction here is that between revision and updating. In the case of revision, additional information about a particular state of the world becomes available and must be combined with what was previously known. In the case of updating, it is assumed that the state has changed and that the new information is available as the previous knowledge."}, {"heading": "5.

The main aspects of the proposed architecture are the following: - Input data sets. The input consists of data sets from multiple sources such as remote sensing data, spatial databases, sensor data, etc. - Pre-processing. These data sets are then processed to derive qualitative spatial observations linked to specific time points that need to be passed to the actual argumentation components.

Specifically, we say that source 1 contains information about different land use zones including parks, residential zones, industrial zones derived from the analysis of aerial imagery, while source 2 provides information about natural reservoirs, that is, the park and mangroves derived from a spatial database.

In this context, the envisaged paradigmatic extensions to contemporary foundational GIS technology raises fundamental questions concerning the ontological, formal representational, and (analytical) computational methods that would underlie their spatial information theoretic underpinnings. We present the conceptual overview and architecture for the development of high-level semantic and qualitative analytical capabilities for dynamic geospatial domains. Building on formal methods in the areas of commonsense reasoning, qualitative reasoning, spatial and temporal representation and reasoning, reasoning about actions and change, and computational models of narrative, we identify concrete theoretical and practical challenges that accrue in the context of formal reasoning about space, events, actions, and change. With this as a basis, and within the backdrop of an illustrated scenario involving the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban narratives, we address specific problems and solutions techniques chiefly involving qualitative abstraction, data integration and spatial consistency, and practical geospatial abduction. From a broad topical viewpoint, we propose that next-generation dynamic GIS technology demands a transdisciplinary scientific perspective that brings together Geography, Artificial Intelligence, and Cognitive Science.
