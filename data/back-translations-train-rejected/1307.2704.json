All the neighborhoods form a new covering called a covering of neighborhoods. In the course of studying under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is a partition, the concept of repeat degree is proposed, with the help of which the issue is addressed. This paper studies further the application of repeat degree on coverings of neighborhoods. First, we investigate under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is the reduct of the covering inducing it. As a preparation for addressing this issue, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of a set family to be the reduct of the set family. Then we study under what condition two coverings induce a same relation and a same covering of neighborhoods. Finally, we give the method of calculating the covering according to repeat degree.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Jul 2013 07:43:57 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2704v1", "14"]], "COMMENTS": "14", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hua yao", "william zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.2704"}, "pdf": {"name": "1307.2704.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Applications of repeat degree on coverings of neighborhoods", "authors": ["Hua Yao", "William Zhu"], "emails": ["williamfengzhu@gmail.com(William"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 130 7.27 04v1 [cs.AI] 10 Jul 2 01"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In theory, the theory was built on the equivalence of relationships and partitions, but the equivalence of relationships and partitions is too narrow for many of them."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In order to better understand this paper, some basic concepts are introduced in this section.

All the neighborhoods form a new covering called a covering of neighborhoods. In the course of studying under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is a partition, the concept of repeat degree is proposed, with the help of which the issue is addressed. This paper studies further the application of repeat degree on coverings of neighborhoods. First, we investigate under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is the reduct of the covering inducing it. As a preparation for addressing this issue, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of a set family to be the reduct of the set family. Then we study under what condition two coverings induce a same relation and a same covering of neighborhoods. Finally, we give the method of calculating the covering according to repeat degree.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
