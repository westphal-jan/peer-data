MacArthur and Wilson (1963) [21] initially proposed that the number of species of a particular taxon established on an island represents a dynamic equilibrium controlled by the rate of immigration of new species and the rate of immigration (emigration) of already established species. Based on Dan Simon's Dynamic Equilibrium Theory [22] proposed BBO algorithm. Since its initial application, this meta-heuristic approach has been successfully applied to some technical applications. We apply this algorithm to estimate minimum costs. BBO algorithm [23, 24]: \u2022 Initialize the parameters of BBO: o Maximum Species Number Smax and Species Number Probability of each habitat, Maximum Migration Rates E and I, Immigration Rate, Maximum Mutation Rate Mmax, Mutation Rate Mmax, and Changing Probability of Habitat."}, {"heading": "3. System Model", "text": "To analyze and optimize the performance of the routing algorithm of WMN environment simulations, simulations were performed for a predefined scenario in the QualNet Simulator [25]. In this simulation, a network of 25 nodes, placed within a 1500m x 1500m area and operating for over 300 seconds, is used. A twin-beam ground propagation model with normal shadow fading is used, the transmission power of the nodes is set to 15dBm and the transmission range of the nodes is 250 meters, the data transmission rate is 2Mbit / sec. On the physical layer 802.11b and on the MAC layer, MAC 802.11 is used. The traffic source is implemented with constant bit rate (CBR), which is transmitted at a speed of 1 packet / sec."}, {"heading": "4. Path Cost Evaluation", "text": "In our model, we looked at 25, 64, 100 and 2500 nodes in this network. It is assumed that the first node transmits data packets to the last node. To decide which route or route should be used for each type of traffic or condition, depends on the current values of the parameters on the nodes or the nodes. In the proposed work, a routing metric of built-in throughput, end-to-end delay and jitter was considered for each node for all adjacent nodes. Considering only forwarding, a cost function using fuzzy logic was proposed [26]. For our model to work, we assume that each node contains a software-based fuzzy logic cost assessment system, as shown in Figure 4."}, {"heading": "5. Results and Discussion", "text": "Two algorithms BB-BC and BBO were implemented in MATLAB v 7.6.0 (R2008a). Numerical results were calculated for both algorithms and are in Table 1. Figure 5 and Table 1 show that for a 25-node network, the minimum path costs are evaluated with zero errors. Furthermore, only 30 iterations are sufficient to make a quick decision on the shortest / nearly shortest path available to ensure the optimal performance of the model. For 64-node WMN, the BB-BC performs better at first (Table 1). However, as the number of iterations is increased from 30 to 100, the error of the two is reduced to zero. Thus, both again produced shortest paths for the given scenario. But the time needed to search for the shortest path for BBO was 4.96 seconds versus 0.29 seconds for BB-BC. For a 100-node network, we found that the minimum error that BBO can reach after Iterations was 9.12 seconds, compared to 2.36% for BB-0.1 seconds."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion and Future Scope of the Work", "text": "As network complexity increases, the time required to evaluate the exact shortest path increases. In this paper, two newer, soft computing-based approaches to evaluating the shortest path in a WMN are presented. WMNs that are highly dynamic regularly require shortest paths to modify their routing strategies. Furthermore, the method for evaluating the shortest path must be able to calculate an almost shortest path as quickly as possible in order to maintain optimal routing performance. Taking into account routing guidelines, we proposed an integrated path length measurement that takes into account throughput, end-to-end delay and jitter of the connection. To calculate the distance between two adjacent nodes in relation to this integrated metric, a blurred approach was used. Using this integrated cost function as a path length metric, we evaluated the shortest path between source and target nodes using BB-BC and BBO approaches. A large number of experiments were conducted by 64, and one by 25."}], "references": [{"title": "Wireless mesh networks: a survey", "author": ["IF Akyildiz", "X Wang", "W Wang"], "venue": "Computer Networks Journal (Elsevier)", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2005}, {"title": "On the scalability of IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks", "author": ["L.
