In other words, what kind of cognitive processes mediate sensing capability, and the formation of sensible impressions ---e.g., abstractions, analogies, hypotheses and theory formation, beliefs and their revision, argument formation--- in domain-specific problem solving, or in regular activities of everyday living, working and simply going around in the environment? How can knowledge and reasoning about such capabilities, as exhibited by humans in particular problem contexts, be used as a model and benchmark for the development of collaborative cognitive (interaction) systems concerned with human assistance, assurance, and empowerment?", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Jul 2013 10:01:29 GMT  (29kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3040v1", "5 pages, research statement summarising recent publications"], ["v2", "Mon, 31 Mar 2014 10:22:29 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3040v2", "5 pages, research statement summarising recent publications"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, research statement summarising recent publications", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.HC cs.RO", "authors": ["mehul bhatt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.3040"}, "pdf": {"name": "1307.3040.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["bhatt@informatik.uni-bremen.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 130 7,30 40v2 [cs.AI] 31 Mar 201 4Between Sense and Sensibility Explanatory Narrativation of Mental Models as Basis and Benchmark for Visual-Spatial Cognition and Computer-Focused Cognitive Systems"}, {"heading": "Mehul Bhatt", "text": "bhatt @ informatik.uni-bremen.dewww.mehulbhatt.org Keywords computer science; cognitive science; artificial intelligence; cognitive systems; human-computer interaction general keywords computer models of narration; spatial cognition and calculation; common sense; spatial and temporal thinking; action and change; cognitive robotics; design, architecture, urban planning; geographical information systems; spatial assistance systems"}, {"heading": "POSITION STATEMENT", "text": "What lies between \"perception\" and \"sensitivity\"? In other words, what cognitive processes convey perception and the formation of meaningful impressions - e.g. abstractions, analogies, hypotheses and theory formation, beliefs and their revision, argumentation - in domain-specific problem solving or in the regular activities of daily life, working and simply walking around in the environment? How can knowledge and reasoning about such abilities as those shown by humans in certain problem contexts be used as a model and yardstick for the development of cognitive (interaction) systems dealing with human help, safety and empowerment? We raise these questions in the context of a series of assistive technologies dealing with visual-spatial perception and cognitive tasks, which include aspects such as common sense, creativity and the application of specialized domain knowledge and problem-solving thought processes, such as (Bhatt al, al., 2013a) high-level (human) interpretation (of), high-level (human) centricity systems."}, {"heading": "A.
