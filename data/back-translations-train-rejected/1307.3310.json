INTRODUCTION", "text": "While designing a translation model, transliteration proves to be an effective tool for words that are multilingual or that are not present in the training corpus. In a highly flexible Indian language such as Gujarati, naive transliteration, i.e. direct transliteration without rules or restrictions, proves to be not very effective. The main reason for this is that suffixes are attached to the root words as they form a sentence. We suggest the use of stemming and POS tagging (i.e. part-of-speech tagging) for the transliteration process. Stemming refers to the removal of suffixes from the root word. Root is actually the keyword to which suffixes are added. For example, in (striiomaNthii) the root and suffix are described."}, {"heading": "2. LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Two other algorithms deriving from the system were proposed by Hafer and Weiss [2] and Paice [3]. Martin Porter [4] proposed a suffix stripping algorithm in 1980, which is still considered the standard, based on an algorithm derived from purely rules-based algorithms. A further approach to descent was proposed by Frakes and Baeza-Yates [5], who proposed the use of term indexes and its root word in a tabular retrospective. As processing capacities improved, there was a paradigm shift from purely rules-based techniques to statistical / machine learning approaches. Goldsmith [6] proposed an unsupervised approach to the morphological variants of European languages. Snover and Brent [8] proposed a Bayesian model for descent of English and French languages. Freitag [9] proposed an algorithm for clustering words."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED WORK", "text": "There are three genders in Gujarati - Feminine, Masculine and Neutral. Suffixes are added to the stems that give the different morphological variants of the same root word. We propose the use of stemming and POS tagging for the purpose of transliteration. Figure 1 shows our system.Figure 1. Transliteration is tagged with Stemming and Part-of-Speech taggingMany ambiguities are observed while designing a translation model from Gujarati Hindi. Onesuch ambiguity is the distinction of the suffix in various cases. Suppose we have this origin (Raam ne mujhe riport dii.) (Meaning: Ram gave me the report.) | (Maaraa ghare ek bilaadichhe.)"}, {"heading": "4. EVALUATION AND RESULTS", "text": "We tested our system on a total of 500 sentences. The results observed are as follows: 54.48% of the Gujarati words are translated and transliterated in the same way, and the efficiency of our transliteration scheme is 93.09% (about 90%)."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We took a hybrid approach - a mixture of rules-based and corpus-based approaches, using POS-marked corpus and tribal rules to support the transliteration process. We achieved an overall efficiency of the transliteration program of 93.09%, making it a promising approach. It was observed that 54.48% of the words from Gujarati have the same translation and translation. Such a scheme not only reduces the length of the corpus for the translation model, but also helps to resolve ambiguities. It can also be used for other morphologically rich Indian languages. As an immediate extension of this work, we plan to incorporate more machine learning approaches and focus on every single aspect of the scheme so that more accuracy can be achieved in the translation process."}], "references": [{"title": "Development of Stemming Algorithm", "author": ["J.B.
