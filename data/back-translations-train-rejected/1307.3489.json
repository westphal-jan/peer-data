TAGGING TECHNIQUES", "text": "Several approaches have been used to create POS labels, such as the linguistic, statistical, hybrid, memory, and transformation-based learning approach described below."}, {"heading": "2.1. Rule-Based Approach", "text": "This system is based on finding and correcting errors. During the training period and starting from a manually marked training corpus, the system recognizes its own weaknesses and corrects them by building a rule base [1]. Tagger Eric Brill [3] uses two types of rules: \u2022 Lexic rules: Define the name of the word by its lexical properties. \u2022 Context rules: refine the caption, that is, return to previously assigned terms and correct them by examining the local context. Both types of rules take the form: - If a word is in a C context, change it to B (context rule). - If a word has a lexical property P, assign the label A (lexical rule). The limitations of this approach are that rule-based taggers are not automatic, costly and time-consuming."}, {"heading": "2.2. Probabilistic/Statistical Approach", "text": "After the statistical approach of the 1980s [4] [5] [6] was launched and gained popularity, this approach requires much less human effort, successful model during the last few years Hidden Markov models and related techniques have focused on creating probabilistic models for transition sequences of keywords in the sentence. Results produced by statistical keywords provide about 95% -97% of correctly marked words. However, this statistical part of the keywords has several potential disadvantages: they are inflexible (use the same strategy to determine the keywords of each word), the tagging process uses only a small amount of information (the Bigram method uses information from the previous word) [8]."}, {"heading": "2.3. Hybrid Approach", "text": "A combination of both statistical and rule-based methods has also been used to develop hybrid taggers [9] [10] that appear to achieve higher accuracy, with an accuracy of 98% reported by Tapanainen and Voultilainen (1994) [11] [12]."}, {"heading": "2.4. Transformation-Based Learning", "text": "Transformation-Based Learning (TBL), often referred to as Brill tagging [13], was introduced by Eric Brill in 1994 and achieved an accuracy of 97.2% [14] [15] in the same corpus as HMM taggers. The learning algorithm begins by building a lexicon that combines the benefits of rule-based and probabilistic part-of-speech tagging. Normally, the tagger assigns the most likely part-of-speech to each word first, resulting in multiple errors. The next step is to correct as many mistakes as possible by applying transformation rules the tagger has learned."}, {"heading": "2.5. Memory-Based Learning", "text": "Memory-Based Learning (MBL) [16] [17] [18] is a simple learning method in which examples remain massively in memory. Similarity between memory examples and new examples is used to predict the outcome of a new example. MBL contains two components: \u2022 A learning component that is memory storage. \u2022 A performance component that performs a similarity-based classification."}, {"heading": "3. BENIFITS OF GENETIC ALGORITHMS", "text": "The search for an optimal solution in GA is heuristic by its nature; heuristic is a rule of thumb that is likely to lead to a solution. It plays an important role in the search for strategies based on the exponential nature of most problems. Heuristic helps to reduce the number of alternatives from an exponential number to a polynomial number. Possible solutions are proposed and fitness values for the solutions are obtained. GA then provides the possible optimal solutions over generations of evolution. In this way, the time complexity of O (pn) is reduced to O (P * f (n)). The function f (n) [19] gives a dependence between the number of possible selections and the generations needed to provide an optimal solution. [20] The integer n is the number of units in the solution (it corresponds to the number of genes in the chromosome). For a set of 10 words with 4 possible tags each, in GA, the computation of neuralisms is an adjustment of time."}, {"heading": "4. APPLICATION OF GENETIC ALGORITHM IN TAGGING PROBLEM", "text": "The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is the most popular evolutionary algorithm successfully used for difficult optimization and search problems. It consists of a population of studies, a fitness function to assign genotype studies to real numbered phenotypes, and a set of genetic operators to create new studies."}, {"heading": "4.1. Preliminary Data Setup", "text": "Preparing for a particular tool is an important phase in achieving the goal. Therefore, we spent some time compiling this data (hand-tagged corpora, tagset and training tables).For the training corpus, we are obliged to construct our own corpus because of its unavailability for the Arabic language. We took the EASC corpus, which contains many articles about the ten following \"categories\": art and music, education, science and technology, sports, tourism, health, politics. To enrich our work, we decide to highlight some articles from the respective domain, the corpus is constructed as follows: We highlight some articles from science, science and technology, we highlight some articles from the past."}, {"heading": "CN Prep Res Res CN 6", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "PN CN Prep Res Res 1 Null PN CN Prep Res 4 Null Null PN CN Prep 135", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "CN Prep V Null Null 105 ...", "text": "This table, stored in a file, is useful for initializing the first population and during the mutation step.

Individual Representation", "text": "Each gene represents an element. This representation consists of as many genes as there are words in our sentence, and their values are integer numbers. The chromosome indicates the element of each word. This type of coding has an interest in creating operators for simple crossings and mutations."}, {"heading": "4.3. Initial Population", "text": "For a particular set of test corpora, the chromosomes that make up the population are generated by selecting one of the valid keywords from our training corpus for every word that occurs most frequently in this context. Words that do not occur in the training corpus are assigned the keyword that occurs most frequently in this context in the hand-tagged corpora.

Fitness Function", "text": "s fitness is defined as the sum of the fitness of his genes (\u2211 i f (gi)). The fitness of a gene is defined as: (1) Where (P (T | LC, RC) is the probability that the tag of gene g is T, given that its context is formed by the sequence of tags LC to the left context and the sequence RC to the right. This probability is estimated from the training table as: (2) Where occ (LC, T, RC) is the number of occurrences of the tags LC, T, RC in the training table, and T \"is the set of all day.A particular sequence LC, T, RC may not be listed in the training table, because there is inadequate statistics. In these cases, we assume that the genes will be successively reduced CLC, alternatively we will ignore that day (and then most of the remaining steps)."}, {"heading": "5.

Operator of Selection", "text": "This operator is responsible for defining the individuals in the P population that will be duplicated in the new P population and serve as parents (using the crossover operator).There are several selection methods. We use Goldberg's Roulette Wheel Selection (1989) [24] [20].With this method, each individual has a chance to be selected proportionally to their performance, so that the more individuals they are selected, the more likely they are to adapt to the problem."}, {"heading": "5.2. Operator of Crossing", "text": "The purpose of the crossing is to enrich the diversity of the population by managing the structure of the chromosomes. Classically, the crossings with two parents are considered and produce two children. First, to apply a uniform crossover, two individuals are selected with a probability proportional to their fitness. Crossover is applied with a probability given by the crossover rate. Then, a binary array called mask crossover is filled with random values. This mask is intended to know for each place from which parent the first child should inherit the gene in it; if the mask has a place a 0, the child inherits the gene in it from parent 1, if it has a 1, it inherits a parent 2. The generation of child 2 is symmetrical, whereby both individuals are divided into two parts, from which two children C1 and C2 emerge (see Figure 2).)

Operator of mutation", "text": "The operator of the mutation brings to the genetic algorithms the characteristic of ergodicity of space. This characteristic indicates that the genetic algorithm will probably reach all points of the state space without passing through them all in the dissolution process. The mutation is then applied to each gene of the individuals resulting from the crossover operation, with a probability given by the mutation rate. The number of individuals that remain unchanged in a generation depends on the crossover and mutation rate. Finally, the day of the mutation point is replaced by another of the valid tags of the corresponding word."}, {"heading": "6. TAGGING EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In this section, we will explain our experimental results on part-of-speech tagging. Direct comparison of performance between researchers is difficult, amplified by variance in corpora, tagset and grading criteria. To calculate tagging Accuracy Rate (TAR), we use the following formula: (5) We will assess the effects of many parameters related to our implemented tagger.6.1. Influence of the size of training corpus: Figure 3 shows tagger accuracy rate as a function of training corpus size. This curve was generated by training on successive parts of our training corpus. The curve shows that performance gains can be achieved by increasing training corpus size. Figure 3 illustrates performance when using different sizes of corpus and concludes that with the size of the corpus, the performance of the tagger group increases."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have presented a genetic approach to Arabic POS tagging that does not require segmentation, which would be unrealistic for Arabic. The approach is competitive even though it uses a reduced POS tagset that provides interesting results. However, we cannot make direct comparisons with another approach because there is no standardization of data sharing in training and test data. Results from our experiments suggest that the genetic algorithm is a sufficiently robust approach to tagging natural language texts and achieves accuracies comparable to other statistical systems. Tests suggest that the length of the contexts surrounding each word extracted for training and the size of the training body are determining factors for the results. Also, our tagger is based on the genetic algorithm that is susceptible to local maximum values. Crossover, mutation, together with fitness proportional selection, serves as a global strategy that can divert the search algorithm to other global areas."}], "references": [{"title": "A rule-based approach for tagging non-vocalized arabic words", "author": ["A.
