Each entry in the matrix is a measure of the expression level of a particular gene under a particular condition. Analysis of these data sets shows genes of unknown functions and the discovery of functional relationships between genes [18]. The most popular cluster algorithms in gene expression analysis are hierarchical clustering [11], K-Means clustering [3] and SOM [8]."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 K- Means Clustering", "text": "The main objective of cluster analysis is the grouping of objects that are similar in a cluster and separate objects that differ from each other by assigning them to different clusters. One of the most popular cluster analysis methods is the K-Means cluster algorithm [3, 9, 12, 17], whereby objects are assigned to a predefined number of clusters specified by the user (let's assume K clusters). The idea is to select random cluster centers, one for each cluster. These centers will preferably be as far away from each other as possible. In this algorithm, mainly euclidean distance is used to find the distance between data points and centerings [6]. Euclidean distance between two multidimensional data points X = (x1, x2, x3,..., xm) and Y = (y1, y2, y3,..., y3,..., yym) is described as follows: (X, quadrate, Y = the sum of the Y-Means method aimed at adding all clusters)."}, {"heading": "2. Repeat", "text": "Assign each point di to the cluster that has the narrowest centroid; calculate the new mean for each cluster; until convergence criteria are met. Although the K-Means algorithm is simple, it has some disadvantages in terms of the quality of final clustering, as it depends heavily on the arbitrary selection of the initial centroid [1]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques", "text": "ISODATA algorithms Variation is to allow splitting and merging of the resulting clusters. Typically, a cluster is split if its variance is above a predetermined threshold, and two clusters are merged if the distance between their centroids is below another predetermined threshold [14]. With this variant, it is possible to obtain the optimal partition from any initial partition, provided that the correct thresholds are set. ISODATA's well-known algorithm uses more clustering technique of merging and splitting clusters. If ISODATA specifies the \"ellipse\" partition as the initial partitioning, it will produce the optimal threshold of three-dimensional ISODATA partitioning, the clusters {A} and {B, C} will merge into a cluster first, since the distance between their clusters is small and then split the clusters."}, {"heading": "2.3 Automatic Generation of Merge Factor for ISODATA (AGMFI) Algorithm", "text": "Some of the parameters are set by the user as the clusters are merged and partitioned. [10] proposes to automatically initialize the merge factor for ISODATA. AGMFI uses various heuristics to determine when the merge should take place.
