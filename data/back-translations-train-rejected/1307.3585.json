Despite bad worst-case computational complexity results, various MUC- finding approaches that appear tractable for many real-life instances have been proposed. Many of them are based on the successive identification of so-called transition constraints. In this respect, we show how local search can be used to possibly extract additional transition constraints at each main iteration step. The approach is shown to outperform a technique based on a form of model rotation imported from the SAT-related technology and that also exhibits additional transi- tion constraints. Our extensive computational experimentations show that this en- hancement also boosts the performance of state-of-the-art DC(WCORE)-like MUC extractors.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 Jul 2013 21:28:05 GMT  (66kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3585v1", "17 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 3 algorithms, 33 references"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 3 algorithms, 33 references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["\\'eric gr\\'egoire", "jean-marie lagniez", "bertrand mazure"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.3585"}, "pdf": {"name": "1307.3585.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["\u00c9ric Gr\u00e9goire", "Jean-Marie Lagniez"], "emails": ["gregoire@cril.fr", "lagniez@cril.fr", "mazure@cril.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 130 7.35 85v1 [cs.AI] 12 Ju"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In this paper, the focus is on unsatisfactory limitation networks.

Such constraints are referred to as active. Thus, if P is presented as unsatisfactory, active constraints form a core, since the other constraints are not actually part of this evidence of inconsistency. [17] \"s approach continues this process until a smaller set of active constraints is found. Consequently, at the end of this first step, constraints that are not active can be safely removed, while a remaining constraint network that is unsatisfactory remains."}, {"heading": "3.2 Minimization step", "text": "To achieve this, it might be necessary to verify whether or not a constraint belongs in the series of MUCs that are enclosed within a core, which is clearly a task in a network.

Whenever SLS achieves an assignment that meets exactly one condition, it is a transition barrier and belongs to the last MUC. Obviously, such assignment is a local minimum for SLS, which can then explore neighborhood mappings, including other possible transition processes that would need to be detected by recursive model rotation. Therefore, we have explored a generic approach based on SLS, which we call Local Search for Transition Controls. Local Search in the SAT and CSP domains is usually implemented as a tool to search for a model. On the contrary, we make use of SLS to form the neighborhood of a transition control in the search for further transition controls."}, {"heading": "5 Dichotomy Core Extraction with Local Search", "text": "& & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & &"}, {"heading": "6 Experimental Results", "text": "In order to evaluate and compare the actual efficiency of the local search approach with other methods (especially with the DC model), we have considered all benchmarks from recent CSP competitions [6,7], 2 which consider a binary and non-binary method, whereas other CSP instances are considered.

Also, note that we have not tried to refine the various parameters of this local search scheme. In this respect, it would be interesting to develop forms of dynamic settings for these parameters that better take into account the recorded information about the previous search steps, as examined in [14]. In the future, we plan to explore more advanced concepts related to transitional constraints in order to better steer the local search towards promising parts of the search space. In particular, so-called critical clauses [12] in the Boolean framework could be generalized in different ways in the complete network environment."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work has been supported in part by grants from the Nord / Pas-de-Calais region and by grants from the European Federation."}], "references": [{"title": "Boosting local search thanks to CDCL", "author": ["Gilles Audemard", "Jean-Marie Lagniez", "Bertrand Mazure", "Lakhdar Sa\u0131\u0308s"], "venue": "In 17th International Conference on Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Diagnosing and solving over-determined constraint satisfaction problems", "author": ["Ren\u00e9 R.

of unsatisfiability must be understood so that the network can be re-engineered and relaxed to become satisfiable. Despite bad worst-case computational complexity results, various MUCfinding approaches that appear tractable for many real-life instances have been proposed. Many of them are based on the successive identification of so-called transition constraints. In this respect, we show how local search can be used to possibly extract additional transition constraints at each main iteration step. The approach is shown to outperform a technique based on a form of model rotation imported from the SAT-related technology and that also exhibits additional transition constraints. Our extensive computational experimentations show that this enhancement also boosts the performance of state-of-the-art DC(WCORE)-like MUC extractors.", "creator": "gnuplot 4.4 patchlevel 3"}}}
