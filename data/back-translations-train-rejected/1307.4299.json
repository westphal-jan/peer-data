INTRODUCTION", "text": "Tagging is one of the simplest, most constant and statistical models for many NLP applications. Tagging at POS is an initial phase of linguistics, text analysis such as retrieving information, machine translators, text for speech synthesis, information extraction, etc. Tagging is a process of mapping words into a text that corresponds to a specific part of the language. A basic version of POS tagging is the identification of words as nouns, adjectives, etc. POS tagging can be seen as a simplified form of morphological analysis, in which it is just a matter of matching the word with an appropriate part of the language."}, {"heading": "2. PROBLEMS OF PART OF SPEECH TAGGING", "text": "To solve this problem, we look at the context instead of taking just one word. / SYM The same word \"NNPB\" is given a different designation in a sentence. In the first case, it is referred to as a separate noun; in the second case, it is referred to as a general noun because it refers to control. Since the first word \"NNPB\" appears in a sentence as a subject and is then given a different designation, it is referred to as a separate noun in the second case."}, {"heading": "3. PREVIOUS WORK ON INDIAN LANGUAGE POS TAGGING", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where there is such a process, where the question is to what extent this is a country, this is a country, this is a country, this is a country."}, {"heading": "4. POS TAGSET", "text": "Depending on a general principle of the tagset design strategy, a number of POS tagsets have been developed by various organizations based on it. For the POS annotation of texts in Marathi, we have used tagsets developed by IIIT Hyderabad (Bharti, et. al., 2006). [1] The table shows a brief description of the IL POS tag set."}, {"heading": "5. OUR APPROACH", "text": "In this thesis, we describe the trigram model for Marathi POS taggers. Our main goal is to perform POS tagging to determine the most likely tag sequence for a word, since the two preceding tags are given. For trigrams, the probability of a sequence is merely the product of the conditional probabilities of their trigrams. So, if t1, t2... tn is the tag sequence and w1, w2... wn is the corresponding word sequence, then the following equation explains this fact-P (t | w) = P (w | t). P (t | t, t) Where ti denotes the tag sequence and wi denotes the word sequence, P (w | t) is the probability of the current word. (1) P (t | t) here is the probability of a current day in view of the two preceding tags. This provides the transition between the tags and helps to grasp the context of the sentence. These probabilities are calculated by the following equation: P ti (ti / 2-2, multiples of the probability of the two (f) days, ti-2."}, {"heading": "6. EVALUATION", "text": "To test the performance of our system, we developed a test corpus of 2,000 sentences (48,635 words), giving us an accuracy of 91.63%. Accuracy was calculated using the formula: Accuracy (%) =. * 100 test results of our system are as follows: Number of correct POS tags assigned by the system = 44563 Number of POS tags in the text = 48635 Thus, the accuracy of the system is 91.63%. (3)"}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION", "text": "The POS tagger described here is very simple and efficient for automatic marking, but the morphological complexity of the Marathi makes it somewhat difficult. The performance of the current system is good and the results obtained with this method are excellent. In the future, we would like to improve the accuracy of our system by adding more marked sets to our training corpus."}], "references": [{"title": "AnnCorra: Annotating Corpora Guidelines for POS and Chunk Annotation for Indian Languages", "author": ["A.
