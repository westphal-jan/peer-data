INTRODUCTION", "text": "Machine transliteration plays a very important role in gathering interlingual information. The term \"entity of the name\" is widely used in the processing of natural language.Name recognition has many applications in the field of natural language processing, such as information extraction, i.e. extraction of structured text from unstructured text, classification of data, and answering questions. In this essay, we only emphasize the transliteration of proper names and places with a statistical approach. The process of transliterating a word from its native language into a foreign language is called forward transliteration, and the reverse process is called backward transliteration.This essay deals with the problem of forward transliteration, i.e. from English to Punjabi. For example, \"silver\" in English is translated into \"instead of\" forward transliteration \"into Punjabi. Here, our main goal is to develop a transliteration system that can be used to translate the name units, as well as the name sliteration of the target language."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "A lot of work has been done in the field of machine transliteration. Kamal Deep and Goyal [1] have addressed the problem of transliteration Punjabi to the English language with a rules-based approach. The proposed transliteration scheme uses grapheme-based method to model the transliteration problem. This technique has shown that transliteration in WX notation brings improved results over UTF notation by presenting the English-Hindi corpus (of Indian names) with the use of statistical machine translation in different notations. In this paper, they have shown that transliteration in WX notation brings improved results over UTF notation by using the English-Hindi corpus (of Indian names) with phrase-based machine translation."}, {"heading": "3. ANALYSIS OF ENGLISH AND PUNJABI SCRIPT", "text": "Punjabi is an ancient and Indo-Aryan language that is mainly used in the regions of Punjab. It is one of the 14 most widespread languages in the world. Its script is Gurumukhi, which is based on Devanagri. Punjabi is one of the Indian languages and official language of Punjab. Along with Punjab, it is also spoken in neighboring areas such as Haryana and Delhi. There are 19 vowels (10 independent vowels and 9 dependent vowels) and 41 consonants in the Punjab language. English, on the other hand, is based on Roman script. It is one of the six international languages of the United Nations. There are 26 letters in English. Of these, 21 are consonants and 5 vowels."}, {"heading": "4. METHODOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP", "text": "In our work we use a statistical approach to transliteration, i.e. we train and test our model with the help of the MOSES toolkit. With the help of GIZA + + we have calculated translation probabilities based on probability of relativity. In the construction of our rules we use the approach of syllable formation. The syllable is a combination of vowel and consonant pairs such as V, VC, VCC, CVC, CCVC and CVCC. Almost all languages have VC, CV or CVC structures, so we use vowels and consonants as basic phonation unit.Some possible rules that we have constructed for syllabification are presented in [Table 1: Possible combinations for syllable Structures]."}, {"heading": "V=Vowel, C=Consonant", "text": "If we have a word P, it is represented as a syllable in the form of {p1, p2, p3.... pn}, where p1, p2.. pn are the individual syllables."}, {"heading": "Algorithm for syllable extraction", "text": "This year, we will be in a position to be in a position, \"he said in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper."}, {"heading": "5. EVALUATION AND RESULTS", "text": "We used a corpus of 1500 sentences of 15982 words, including 45% bearers of names, i.e. 7192 proper names, places, organization and date and time, including 88% bearers of type person & place, i.e. 6328 were names of persons or place names, which enabled our system to correctly transcribe 6109 bearers of names, while 55%, i.e. 8790 words were those that were not bearers of names and of which our system was able to transcribe 7987 words correctly, giving us an accuracy of 88.19%. Accuracy was calculated using the formula: * 100 (2) Some of the names correctly transcribed by our system are as follows:"}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this work, we conducted our experiment with statistical machine translation tools. We demonstrated how to extract syllables from our input text and perform transliterations of name generators (proper names and places) and other words as units of name in the source language to target language by calculating probability. This transliteration system will prove very useful. By using this approach, we achieved an accuracy of 88.19%. In the future, we will work on remaining name units that were not taken into account in this experiment."}, {"heading": "7.
