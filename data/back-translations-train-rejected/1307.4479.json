Several logics for specifying properties of MAS have been presented in quite a variety of scenarios with bounded resources. In this paper, we study a different formalism, called Priced Resource-Bounded Alternating-time Temporal Logic (PRBATL), whose main novelty consists in moving the notion of resources from a syntactic level (part of the formula) to a semantic one (part of the model). This allows us to track the evolution of the resource availability along the computations and provides us with a formalisms capable to model a number of real-world scenarios. Two relevant aspects are the notion of global availability of the resources on the market, that are shared by the agents, and the notion of price of resources, depending on their availability. In a previous work of ours, an initial step towards this new formalism was introduced, along with an EXPTIME algorithm for the model checking problem. In this paper we better analyze the features of the proposed formalism, also in comparison with previous approaches. The main technical contribution is the proof of the EXPTIME-hardness of the the model checking problem for PRBATL, based on a reduction from the acceptance problem for Linearly-Bounded Alternating Turing Machines. In particular, since the problem has multiple parameters, we show two fixed-parameter reductions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Jul 2013 01:43:23 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4479v1", "In Proceedings GandALF 2013,arXiv:1307.4162"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings GandALF 2013,arXiv:1307.4162", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["dario della monica", "margherita napoli", "mimmo parente"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.4479"}, "pdf": {"name": "1307.4479.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Gabriele Puppis", "Tiziano Villa"], "emails": ["dariodm@ru.is", "napoli@dia.unisa.it", "parente@unisa.it"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In recent years it has been shown that the number of unemployed has decreased by more than half in the last ten years.

In this section, we will demonstrate that an algorithm that behaves asymptotically better cannot exist, thereby proving that the problem is EXPTIME-complete. To prove the inherent difficulty in relation to the multiple input parameters, we will show two reductions: a parametric one in the representation of M (the digit size) that assumes both n and r-constant, and the other parametric one in r, this time assuming constant and the value M.

recently studied taking into account the need of expressing resource bounds. Several logics for specifying properties of MAS have been presented in quite a variety of scenarios with bounded resources. In this paper, we study a different formalism, called Priced Resource-Bounded Alternating-time Temporal Logic (PRB-ATL), whose main novelty consists in moving the notion of resources from a syntactic level (part of the formula) to a semantic one (part of the model). This allows us to track the evolution of the resource availability along the computations and provides us with a formalisms capable to model a number of real-world scenarios. Two relevant aspects are the notion of global availability of the resources on the market, that are shared by the agents, and the notion of price of resources, depending on their availability. In a previous work of ours, an initial step towards this new formalism was introduced, along with an EXPTIME algorithm for the model checking problem. In this paper we better analyze the features of the proposed formalism, also in comparison with previous approaches. The main technical contribution is the proof of the EXPTIME-hardness of the the model checking problem for PRB-ATL, based on a reduction from the acceptance problem for Linearly-Bounded Alternating Turing Machines. In particular, since the problem has multiple parameters, we show two fixed-parameter reductions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
