INTRODUCTION", "text": "Television is now a dominant news source that has a huge impact on many aspects of our lives. The rise of the Web has led to a significant decline in newspaper and radio audiences, but television remains the number one news source in the United States. We analyze the captions of news shows delivered by the news networks themselves. By using these text streams, we examine how each news network can be characterized, each person-related news unit mentioned in the news (news makers), and the relationship between news networks and news makers (for example, the distortions of networks in reporting news that relate to a person). To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to perform a text analysis of content in television news with such broad goals and on such an ambitious scale. We propose a pipeline of tools to process the incoming stream of data (for example, the specific selection of each tool in reporting on a person), to minimize the task of representing the pipeline and its component."}, {"heading": "2.

DATA AND TOOLS", "text": "We use closed captions provided by a software company that develops second-screen experiences, i.e. applications that display additional information about a television show on a smartphone or tablet, and the same data is also available on the Internet Archive1, which recently launched a TV search service and whose archives date back to 2009. Our data set consists of all closed captions from January 2012 to June 2012 for approximately 140 channels. On average, each TV channel generates about 2MB of text per day. Each channel is assigned to the conventional name of its network; for some networks, we have data from the East and West coasts of the United States and refer to them as, for example, ABC-w and ABC-e. The three major news networks according to the number of self-declared regular viewers [1] are Fox News (21%), CNN (16%) and MSNBC (11%). We receive a television plan in advance with the title of each program, the channel on which it is broadcast, the start and end times, as well as a category and subcategory."}, {"heading": "3.1 Text pre-processing", "text": "Closed captions are pure text streams that we process through a series of steps. First, we use a series of heuristics to segment the text stream into sentences, including detection of a speaker change that is conventionally signaled by a highlighter (\"> >\"), using the presence of full stops and time-based rules. We note that there are methods to merge sentences into passages [26, 16], but for our analysis we use individual sentences as basic units of content, and we only group them if they coincide with the same news article as in Section 3.2. Second, we detect and extract named units by using a named entity tagger that works in two steps: entity resolution [30] and \"aboutness\" ranking [22]. We focus on the person type in the rest of this paper, and whenever we find a named entity we extract two entities in the Entities of a closed message list [30] and an Entity in the Entities of a Entity we select:"}, {"heading": "3.2 News matching", "text": "Captions are assigned to the same genre, for example, sentences in sports are assigned to online news in the sports section of the news aggregator. Messages on the website older than three days are ignored; the matching task is the same as that of Henzinger et al. [11], but the approach is based on supervised learning rather than web search.3 For more details, see [removed for double-blind people]. Matching is done in two steps. In the first step, a genre-specific classification model is applied, based on thousands of examples labeled by editors. In this model, the two classes are \"same story\" and \"different story,\" and each example consists of a sentence, a news story and a class name. The classifier characteristics are calculated from each sentence-story pair by applying the entity tagger described in the previous section to both elements of the pair."}, {"heading": "4. NEWS PROVIDERS", "text": "In this section, we examine news providers and try to answer the following research questions: Q1: Styles and Genres. Are there stylistic attributes of news programs that correlate with the genre of each individual provider? Q2: Reach. Do large networks have more coverage of news events than smaller ones? Q3: News. To what extent does breaking a news story depend on covering a large number of news stories?"}, {"heading": "4.1 Styles and genres", "text": "We use FABIA [12] to obtain a soft bi-clustering of news providers according to the words they use more frequently (we ignore for the companies now mentioned, which are considered in Section 5), and the output is shown in Table 1, where we have descriptive providers and words for each cluster. However, most of the related news providers are \"pure,\" i.e., they have a single genre. In addition, the three most popular networks are bundled in the sixth cluster. Of the non-pure clusters, the third provider is the most interesting. E [ent], an entertainment news service, and CNN Headln [gen] clusters revolve around descriptive words such as wearing, love, and appearance strongly related to the world of entertainment news. Such words are expected to be used to be attributed to its similarity to CNN Headln [gen], attributed to at least two factors: (i) a conscious stylistic and content choice to compete with other fast news providers."}, {"heading": "4.2 Coverage", "text": "In this section and in the next section, we use the news matches described in Section 3.2. A provider covers a story if it has at least one qualified match for it. In measuring coverage, we must bear in mind that some news stories are more prominent than others. We call celebrity coverage the percentage of Fox news providers of a particular genre that covers a story, so a story has a prominence of 1.0 if it is covered by all providers of a genre - which is quite rare. Figure 4 (a) shows the likelihood that a general news provider covers a story for different levels of prominence. Some providers, such as NBC, Fox News, CBS and CNN Headln, offer more comprehensive news coverage than others. This broader selection of stories is likely due to access to a larger pool of resources (e.g. employees, budget, partners) compared to other general news providers. This result is expected, but the data also suggests two other relevant outcomes. NBC and CNN Headln seem to have prominent coverage."}, {"heading": "4.3 Timeliness and duration", "text": "In this section, we examine how different providers cover a story over time, and the lifecycle of a prominent news story is illustrated by Figure 5, which shows coverage of an abuse probe involving U.S. Marines over two days in January 2012. Each point represents a match of that news story with a provider. Providers are sorted by the earliest match: in this case, Fox News [gen], CNN Headln [gen], and MSNBC [gen] are the first to broadcast the story within minutes of each other. In fact, there are two time-dependent variables of interest that we can measure. The most important is how often a provider is among the first to broadcast a story (i.e., \"breaks\" a story), and the second is how long providers broadcast a particular story.Given that many news networks operate in cycles of 60 minutes, we consider that a provider \"breaks\" a story if it is one of those that broadcast a story within the first 60 minutes."}, {"heading": "5. NEWSMAKERS", "text": "This section presents an analysis of newsmakers, i.e. people who appear in news reports on television. We look at the following research questions: Q4: People and News. Which people are mentioned more prominently in TV news and how? Q5: Professional newsmakers. Are there observable differences in the way different professions are portrayed in news broadcasts? Q6: Newsmaker groups. To what extent can automatic text analysis identify groups of similar newsmakers?"}, {"heading": "5.1 People in the news", "text": "The number of mentions of people in the news follows a power law, 4 as shown in Figure 7 (a). Sports news providers are the most prolific in terms of the number of mentions of people (ESPN [spt], NFL [spt], ESN [spt] and NBA [spt]), followed closely by the three largest general news providers (Fox [gen], MSNBC [gen] and CNN [gen]). The high number of mentions of people in sports news is probably due to coverage of team sports in which many athletes are mentioned in competition during a short period of time. The distribution of mentions per person is also very skewed, 5 as shown in Figure 7 (b). The three most frequently mentioned persons in our data set are current U.S. President Barack Obama, Republican Party politician Mitt Romney and basketball player LeBron James.The variety of languages associated with the top 30 people with the most mentions in our data set are associated with the use of the English word xy in Bill Clinton."}, {"heading": "5.2 Newsmakers by profession", "text": "We scrape data from Wikipedia info boxes to categorize newscasters by professional areas and activities and get coverage of 98.2% of the mentions in our data. Table 4 shows the 24 most frequently mentioned professions. The table covers a wide range of celebrities, from the most mentioned profession with more than 400k mentions to the last one mentioned in the table with only 3k. The five most prominent occupations in the news are basketball players, football players, Republican Party politicians, Democratic Party politicians and musicians. The rest of the list is dominated by other athletes, artists and entertainers. The relative prominence of various sports probably varies throughout the year: our observation period covers the most important games of the basketball and football season, but only the initial part of the baseball season. Further down the list, businessmen appear in 11th place, and government officials in 19th place."}, {"heading": "5.3 Automatic clustering of newsmakers", "text": "In Section 4.1, we showed that the distribution of language classes can be used to cluster news providers. We tried the same with news providers, but the resulting clustering (omitted due to space restrictions) contains a mixture of homogeneous and heterogeneous groups. This can be explained to a large extent by variations between providers, which we treat in more detail in Section 6.Table 5. It shows clustering based on linguistic attributes for each of the top providers per genre. Interestingly, entertainment and sports programs tend to unite all politicians in a cluster, whereas business and general providers tend to separate them. For example, CNN Headln [gen] generates a clear cluster with all primary candidates, and Fox News [gen] separates primary candidates, Kim Kim Kim, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim, Kim, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim, Kim, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim"}, {"heading": "6. FRAMING AND BIAS", "text": "In a frequently quoted definition, Entman [5] defines framing as selecting \"certain aspects of a perceived reality and highlighting them in a communicative text, in a way that promotes a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral assessment and / or recommended treatment for the article described.\" Editors must create a framework for the benefit of their audience to maximize the information they receive during their attention windows. Bias, on the other hand, is equivalent to presenting a partial perspective on facts [23] or perception as partial [20]. Viewers are likely to perceive prejudices that run counter to their partisan or ideological views [18]: Liberals tend to find conservative bias in the media, while conservatives tend to find the opposite [3]. In this section, we analyze how different news providers frame different people. Specifically, we focus on the following research questions: Q7: Positive versus negative reporting. Are there significant differences in the sensitivity used by a particular person?"}, {"heading": "6.1 Positive vs negative coverage per provider", "text": "Our automatic analysis confirms this result: While Obama and Romney are treated equally by CNN and MSNBC, CNN Headln and Fox News give Romney a more positive treatment. An even greater difference, which favors Romney, is seen by Fox Business.In terms of sports news, we observe an interesting phenomenon. NBA, specializing in basketball, speaks more positively about the football player (Tim Tebow); conversely, the NFL, specializing in football speaks more positively about the basketball player (LeBron James). Tim Tebow receives on average more positive coverage than LeBron James, who was criticized for a team transfer in 2010, among other things, and became one of the most popular athletes in the US.888.http: / / usat.25 / xx25 Jx25"}, {"heading": "6.2 Outlier analysis", "text": "We analyze the outliers based on stylistic attributes (table omitted due to space constraints), and we note that the outliers for each provider tend to include people who are known in areas not normally covered by the provider, similar to Table 5. We show outliers by vocabulary in Table 7. For each provider, we present the people whose word distribution differs most from the background distribution in sentences in which they are mentioned. Except for Fox News [gen], other general news providers use a more specific vocabulary when talking about the current U.S. President Barack Obama. Interestingly, for ESPN News [spt] and KRON [ent], the most significant outliers (Junior Seau and Whitney Houston, respectively) died during the observation period."}, {"heading": "6.3 Athletes, politicians ... or entertainers?", "text": "In other cases, the media focuses its attention on them in a way that emphasizes their celebrity status as media figures more than their professional accomplishments. In Figure 9 (a), we show the number of mentions in sports stories compared to the number of mentions in general and entertainment news for the most frequently mentioned athletes. Those above the diagonal are mentioned more in entertainment and general stories than other equally famous people in sports news. For example, DwyaneWade, Kobe Bryant and Tom Brady are mentioned about as often in sports news, but Tom Brady has a much greater presence in general and entertainment news - for example, he has guest appearances on the comedy Saturday Night Life and in the cartoons The Simpsons and Family Guy.9We draw a similar graph for politicians in Figure 9 (b). Arnold Schwarzenegger, Donald Trump, 10 John F. Kennedy, Sarah Palin and to some extent Hillary Clinton have a relatively strong presence in entertainment programs."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "New areas offer both new challenges for machine learning methods as well as new insights that can be drawn from the data. Closed Captions data for television programs, now available in the Internet archive, bring the television field into the realm of data mining research. As has already happened on the Web, we expect the mining of this new data source to yield a variety of interesting results. We outlined the key findings of an ambitious study of this large collection of closed captions that focuses on the field of news. We demonstrated the richness of this data set by analyzing several aspects, such as the relationship between genres and styles, reach and topicality, and sensations and distortions in mentioning people in the news. The pipeline proposed in this paper breaks down the text stream into sentences, extracts entities, comments on the text with parts of speech tags and sentiments, and finally finds suitable online news articles. These steps provide a fundamental building block for any future task that uses closed capture data, for example, to topically classify sectional and topographic segmentation."}, {"heading": "8.
