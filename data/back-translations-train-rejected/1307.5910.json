INTRODUCTION", "text": "The Constraint Network (CN), also called Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), is first introduced in [1]. It is proving increasingly promising to model and solve a large number of real problems. Many approaches that use Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) have suggested solving CN (see for example [2, 3, 4]). A Constraint Network (CN) is defined by the triplet (X, D, C), where X = {X1,..., Xn} is the set of n variables; D = {D1,..., Dn} is the set of n domains of values; Di is the range of values of the variables Xi and C = {C1,..., Ce} is the set of e constraints of the problem. The solution of a CSP consists in assigning values to variables to satisfy the NEC constraints. Various real problems can be represented in the form of a CSP."}, {"heading": "2.

Problem Formulation", "text": "We assume a fixed N-device network in which a source device can send a message to a target device. Any device in the network can be considered a source or target, and any device can be used as a relay device to reach other devices in the network. However, in the rest of this paper we consider that communication between two devices is not necessarily symmetrical, i.e. that two devices i and j, device i can send a message to device j, but device j cannot necessarily send a message to device i, since i and j do not necessarily have the same power. We assume that if device vi transmits to device vi, then all devices closer to vi than vj will also receive the transmission. As described in [12], the minimum transmission power that enables device vi to send information to device vj is proportional to [d (vi, vj)]."}, {"heading": "3.2. Problem Modelling", "text": "We want to determine the performance level of each unit in such a way that the minimum energy consumed in the MANET is when a message is sent from a device s to a device d at a time t. To this end, we model the mobile ad-hoc network in the form of a restriction optimization COMANET = (X, D, C), where: - X = {vil, xij} (i, j = 1,..., n; l = 1,..., L). The binary variable evil is defined as vil = 1 when and only ifunit vi is at the lth power level. The variable xij device is a binary variable defined as xij = 1, whether and only when the edge (vi, vj) in the graph is induced as vil = 1 when and only ifunit vi is at the lth power level. - D = {0, 1} is the domain of values for binary variables vil and xij.- C is the set of limitations of the problem."}, {"heading": "4. AN ALGORITHM FOR ENERGY MANAGEMENT IN MOBILE AD-HOC", "text": "NETWORK (MANED) Our approach to solving the problem of minimizing energy consumption is to adapt the Dijkstra algorithm to the ad hoc mobile network. We call this new algorithm MANED. The MANED algorithm is a hybrid algorithm that makes it possible to consume the minimum amount of energy when sending a message from the device to the device d on the ad hoc mobile network. This algorithm is based on the Dijkstra algorithm [15]. When applied to a graph, the Dijkstra algorithm quickly finds the shortest path from a selected source to a specific destination. The algorithm finds all the shortest paths from the source to all targets. The graph consists of vertices (or nodes) and edges linking vertices: edges are directed and have an associated distance, which is sometimes referred to as weight or costs.The algorithm 1 divides devices into two different sets of treated devices, which are handled by the devices and the devices are handled untreated."}, {"heading": "7: end if", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "8: end if", "text": "9: End for 10: End for algorithm 2 first generates the directed weighted graph (V, E). If one or more connections between two devices vi and vj are possible, then the edge (vi, vj) is in E and its cost (or weight) is En (l), where l is the lowest level of performance, so that the connection from vi to vj is possible. Algorithm 1 is then applied to find the cheapest route from the output devices to the target device.

IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "We assume that each device has one or more communication levels. Each level has a specific range of transmission. Each device can be located in space by its corresponding coordinates (x, y, z). To simplify the graphical representation, we assume that each device supports at least 3 levels of communication l1, l2 and l3.We will create an ad-hoc random network in a space of size (X, Y, Z) with 0 \u2264 X, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 Y and 0 \u2264 Z. Furthermore, to allow only a 2D representation, we will not consider the third coordinate z (i.e. z = 0) in this paper. To simplify the research of visible neighbors, we divide this space into sectors. The size of a sector is a parameter. The ad-hoc network of N devices is then randomly generated. Each device supports up to 3 communication levels as described above."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this article, we presented a modeling of the problem of ad hoc mobile networks in the form of a problem of constraint optimization called COMANET. Afterwards, we proposed an optimization method under constraints to minimize the power consumption of batteries when sending messages from a source device to a target device. The presented method is based on the adaptation of the Dijkstra algorithm. The resulting algorithm is called MANED. We presented various experiments that illustrate our approach, which can help users control and regulate battery capacities in order to minimize consumption. Experimental results show that our approach yields very promising results."}], "references": [{"title": "Networks of constraints: Fundamental properties and applications to picture processing", "author": ["U.
