Introduction", "text": "The CNF Satisfiability Problem (CNF-SAT) is a version of the Satisfiability Problem (SAT), in which the Boolean formula is represented in the subjunctive normal form (CNF)."}, {"heading": "1.1 Boolean Satisfiability", "text": "In computer science, Boolean satisfaction (SAT) is a problem in determining whether there is a Boolean assignment of values that fulfills the given formula. In other words, given a Boolean expression that is written only with AND (VP), OR (VP), NOT (VP), variables, and brackets, is there an assignment of TRUE and FALSE values to the variables that evaluate the entire expression to TRUE? On the other hand, the formula is unsatisfactory if there is no such assignment, indicating that the entire expression is evaluated for all possible variable assignments to FALSE. For example, there is a Boolean expression that sets the two variables A and B so that the whole set is TRUE, i.e. the expression A-B is satisfactory for all possible variable assignments."}, {"heading": "1.2 Conjunctive Normal Form:", "text": "Conjunctive normal form (CNF) is a formula that is a propositional constellation where the proposition is a disjunction of literals; each formula meets the above conditions, so let's say the formula is in the CNF; and it is a useful representation of the Boolean expression and useful in automated theory testing. For example, formula A * (B * C) is in the CNF. In addition, any propositional formula can be converted into an equivalent formula in the CNF using rules of logical equivalences. In addition, there are other forms such as the disjunctive normal form (DNF) and the horn form. However, here we will focus mainly on CNF."}, {"heading": "2. CNF-SAT Problem", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Practical problem:", "text": "The CNF-SAT problem can be applied to all kinds of practical problems in the real world. Consider a real problem, suppose you have a wedding to plan and want to arrange the wedding seating for a certain number of guests in a hall. The hall has a certain number of tables for seating. Some couples of guests are couples or close friends and want to sit together at a table. Some other couples of guests are enemies and have to be divided up on different tables. The remaining couples are indifferent to each other and do not mind sitting together or not. However, each couple can only have one relationship, friends, enemies or indifferent people. Then, the problem is to find a seating arrangement that meets all the limitations."}, {"heading": "2.2 Convert to CNF-SAT problem", "text": "This problem can be translated into symbolic logic, with each variable being TRUE or FALSE. Consider the example: We can first construct a sentence that may come close to our language, and then convert it to CNF. Then we can get the following restriction: (a) Every guest i should be seated at at at least one table. (b) Every guest i should be seated at no more than one table. (c) Every guest i and j who are friends should be seated at the same table. (d) All two guests i and j who are enemies should be seated at different tables. (b) Then we convert the above sentences to the formula in CNF. Suppose there are a total of M guests and there are N tables in the hall. The number of friends is F, and the number of enemies is E; Let X (i, n) mean that guest i sit at the table n, and we can get the appropriate formulas, and guest i and f are friends, i and e enemies we are, i..."}, {"heading": "2.3 NP-Complete problem:", "text": "CNF-SAT is a kind of NP-Complete (NPC) problem, which means that we cannot find optimal solutions in polynomial time. NPC is a class of decision problems, i.e. if we already have a solution at hand, we can check whether the solution in polynomial time is correct by simply replacing all variables with the Boolean assignment and verifying whether the sentence is true; however, if we find such a Boolean assignment is exponential time. Considering only the use of brute force to solve the above problem of wedding seating order, we try to assign all possible values for the sentence, then space O (2 MN) would be growing exponentially with the increase of M and N. However, if we use AI technology to find the solution more intelligently, we can find the solution faster, but the solution is suboptimal, which we will discuss in detail.3. Solutions and analyses There are already many SAT solution approaches, such as SAT-SAT-SAT problem, etc."}, {"heading": "3.1 PL-Resolution Algorithm:", "text": "The PL resolution algorithm is a solid and complete solution that guarantees whether there is a solution or not. The main idea of this algorithm is to achieve new clauses by resolving each pair of clauses in the Knowledge Base (KB), e.g. clause A, B and clause A, C into a new clause B, C. Then insert the new clauses into the Knowledge Base (KB). In the end, only two results would occur: (1) the resolution step gives us an empty clause indicating that there is a contradiction in KB, which means that KB is unsatisfactory. For example, clause A and clause A would be resolved into an empty clause, moreover, we know that A, \u00ac A is always FALSE; (2) otherwise, the new clauses we win are already contained in KB, which means that there is no contradiction and KB is satisfactory."}, {"heading": "3.2 WalkSAT Algorithm:", "text": "Unlike PL resolution, the WalkSAT algorithm can determine satisfaction (when it finds a model), but it cannot absolutely determine dissatisfaction. WalkSAT is one of the simplest and most effective algorithms. First, WalkSAT randomly generates a model and assigns all variables with that model. If the sentence under that model is unsatisfactory, it will modify the model. It randomly selects a dissatisfied clause and selects a variable in the Taht clause to scroll through each iteration. There are two ways to decide which variable to reverse: (1) \"minconflicts step,\" which minimizes the number of dissatisfied clauses in the new state; (2) \"random walk\" step, which simply selects the random clause to randomly allocate the variable."}, {"heading": "4. Experiment", "text": "We will compare these two algorithms in terms of performance and use the example of the problem of seating arrangement that we have already mentioned. To simulate this problem, we first create a random relationship for each pair of guests by specifying any two guests, are friends with the probability f, or are enemies with the probability e. And two guests are each other with the probability 1-f-e. In addition, we also convert the number of guests to M and the number of tables to N. Then we convert our generated instance of the wedding seating arrangement into a CNF sentence. The difficulty of the wedding seating arrangement mostly results from dealing with the enemy pairs among the guests. We use both algorithms to generate a plot of P, which is the possibility of the instance, as a function of the probability e with which two guests are enemies. Suppose we have a small wedding planning, and set M = 16 and N = 2. To eliminate the influence of the friendship relationship, we set f = 0."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we discussed the CNF-SAT problem, which is a NP-Complete problem, and analyzed two solutions that can solve the problem, the PL-Resolution algorithm and the WalkSAT algorithm. PL-Resolution is a solid and complete algorithm that can be used to determine satisfaction and dissatisfaction with security. WalkSAT can determine satisfaction when it finds a model, but it cannot guarantee to find a model, even if there is one. However, WalkSAT is much faster than PLResolution, which makes WalkSAT more practical; and we have an analysis of performance between these two algorithms, and the performance of WalkSAT is acceptable when the problem is not that hard. Finally, if we just want to solve the problem and need to do it very quickly, WalkSAT is the best choice; we can also adjust the max _ flips argument too high to have more chances of finding the solution."}], "references": [{"title": "Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458", "author": ["Stuart J.
