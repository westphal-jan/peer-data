Process Description and Experiments", "text": "The raw weblog file we used for the experiment contained 5999 web requests, which can be found at http: / / www.vtsns.edu.rs / maja / vtsnsNov16, which include information such as date / time of the request, hit type, page, hostname, referrer, server domain, authenticated user, server manager, page views, size, etc. To prepare the weblog data for the mining process, it must be deleted from irrelevant requests; and converted into a format that can be fed into the clustering algorithm. For pre-processing and creating sessions, a tool called Sawmill (version 7.0), developed by Flower fire Inc., was used. Sawmill calculates session information by tracking the page, date / time and visitor ID for each page view. When a session view is requested, it processes all of these page calls at the time of the request by contributing to each session's initial request."}, {"heading": "3.
