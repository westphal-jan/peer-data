Conclusion In the approach presented in this paper, the dynamic simulation of buildings was effectively used in conjunction with an optimisation process, thereby significantly improving designs; the use of an orientation variable was also included in a process for optimising building energy; the ability of the FPOP module to improve a previously selected set of floor plans according to thermal performance criteria provides the user with thermal information about their preferences and limitations and the potential of each solution.Building orientation is one of the design variables used in optimising the FPOP module. A building orientation operator must take into account two objectives: correct sun orientation, minimising thermal complaints and allowing other design variable operators to achieve their full purpose. Each floor plan has its unique building orientation curve, which means that any change in architectural elements such as walls, openings, spatial dimensions and materials changes the profile of the curve."}], "references": [{"title": "Multiobjective optimization of building design using TRNSYS simulations, genetic algorithm, and Artificial Neural Network", "author": ["L.
