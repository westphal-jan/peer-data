PLAYER DETECTION", "text": "The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to take n training samples and design a classifier capable of distinguishing between different classes M. For a given training set (x1, y1),.., (xn, yn) with xi-1 < N and yi-1 {\u2212 1, + 1} in its simplest form with two classes, LSVM is a classifier that evaluates a sample x with the following function, f\u03b2 (x) = max z-Z (x) \u03b2 \u00b7 \u03a6 (x, z) (1) Here \u03b2 is a vector of model parameters and z are latent values. The set Z (x) defines possible latent values for a sample x. Training \u03b2 then becomes an optimization problem. We approach the posterior probability P (y = 1 | x) of the decision function in an etric form."}, {"heading": "V. TEAM CLASSIFICATION", "text": "Our deformable partial model (DPM) gives a narrowly bounding window of the object (i.e., an ice hockey player) as well as a series of smaller bounding windows of its corresponding parts. Given these bounding windows as prior knowledge, the model learns a color classification function based on deformable parts with the following function: f\u03b3 (x) = Canadis (x, z\u03b2) (3), in which there is a vector of model parameters and z\u03b2 latent values specified by the shape-based DPM detector. Following (Lu et al, 2009; Okuma et al, 2004; Pe \u0435 et al, 2002), we use Hue saturation value (HSV) color histograms. A feature vector x is composed of a series of HSV color histograms, each of which N = NhNs + Nv bins and corresponds to a unique part of the deformable sub-models."}, {"heading": "VI. FIGURE-GROUND SEGMENTATION AND PLAYER TRACKING", "text": "We developed an interactive labeling tool to learn a figureground segmentation model based on a boosting algorithm. Given a small set of manually labeled foreground pixels and background pixels on the first image, we used Gentle Adaboost's OpenCV implementation to learn a set of 150 weighted decision trees2 where the maximum depth of these trees is 10. Then, we used the initial model on additional images, misidentified pixels interactively, and updated the model with these additional labels. The process repeats a few times with no more than 5 images. We also tested a labeling measure called \"objectivity\" (Alexe et al, 2010) because it can be further accelerated in state-of-the-art, poorly monitored approaches to localize generic2Learning and model conclusions by using decision stumps (i.e. single-level decision trees) rather than a number of weak decision trees."}, {"heading": "VII. DATA SELECTION", "text": "As described, a number of tracklets {T} kj = 1 are predicted by combining detection and tracking of the results of hockey players. These tracklets are used as a pool of candidate data, from which we collect a number of training labels to improve the performance of classification models. As this selection process is fully automated, we need a selection criterion that effectively detects additional training labels without accumulating erroneous labels. First, we will throw away short tracklets with less than 10 Bounding windows, because these tracklets are often produced by very sparse detection results and often contain incorrect labels. After the selection process, we have a sophisticated set of tracklets {T} mj = 1, where m < k initiate a pool of candidate data with bounding windows of these tracklets."}, {"heading": "VIII. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own, without having to take responsibility for themselves."}, {"heading": "IX. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Our self-learning approach combines multiple visual cues such as information about the appearance (i.e. shape and color) of players, the limitations of their movements, and the color of the playing field to automatically detect additional labels from unlabeled data. We use the limitations of players \"movements to examine unlabeled portions of sports videos and discover useful labels that the appearance-based player detector cannot find with the current classification power. Field segmentation is effective for eliminating erroneous labels. Our experimental results show that our approach is particularly effective when there is very little labeled data. This paper shows that it is possible to realize fully automated capture of labels when there is a small amount of label data available even in realistic, challenging videos from broadcast sports films. An immediate future direction is to use a game-specific player detector to target other games again (e.g., classic games should be fully automated by re-recording the classic detectors in the past without the trust)."}], "references": [{"title": "What is an object", "author": ["B Alexe", "T Deselaers", "V Ferrari"], "venue": "IEEE Computer Society International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "citeRegEx": "Alexe et al\\.,?
