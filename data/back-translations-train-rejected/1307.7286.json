Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring events occurring in the systems or networks and analyzing them for signs of possible incidents, i.e. violations or threats to computer security policies, acceptable usage policies or standard security practices [1]. This system, which detects intrusion into the system, is known as the IDS (Intrusion Detection System), a concept that has been around for two decades, but has recently experienced a dramatic increase in popularity and integration into the general information security infrastructure [1]."}, {"heading": "2. DETECTION TECHNIQUES", "text": "The first detection technology, also known as pattern-based, searches for evidence that is known to indicate abuse. Whether it is specific log entries or a specific payload in a packet of data, the NIDS / HIDS looks for something it knows about - a signature of abuse. While detection for anomalies looks for signs that something is out of the ordinary that might indicate some form of abuse, anomaly-based systems analyze current activity based on a \"baseline\" of \"normal\" activity and look for deviations outside of what is considered normal [2]. These two techniques have been used for the main classification of IDS called host-based IDS (HIDS), network-based IDS (NIDS), and hybrid IDS [1]."}, {"heading": "3. MACHINE LEARNING BASED", "text": "They can be categorized into genetic algorithms, not only in classical predicate logic, but also in the field of outlier detection [3]. Fuzzy logic fuzzy logic is derived from fuzzy set theory, where the reasoning is more approximate than in classical predicate logic. Fuzzy techniques are therefore used in the field of anomaly detection."}, {"heading": "4. PROS/CONS OF ANOMALY DETECTION", "text": "Because anomaly-based systems are able to detect abuse based on network and system behavior, the nature of the abuse need not be known beforehand, which allows for detection of abuse that a signature-based system may not recognize. While behavior on a system or network can vary widely, anomaly-based systems tend to report a lot of false alarms. The art of detecting \"normal\" activity versus truly abnormal activity is extremely challenging [8] [3]."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this review, types of intrusion detection were discussed, along with a brief introduction to the categories of anomaly detection, which is one of the types of IDS. Machine learning based anomaly detection techniques are also discussed using appropriate references."}, {"heading": "6.
