Knowledge of the robot is divided into two layers: 1) the specific knowledge that the system acquires about the environment, which is called world knowledge; 2) the general knowledge about the domain and its use, which we call domain knowledge. It is important to point out that the two components may resemble the advanced and intensive components of a classical knowledge base, but here are independent of each other. In fact, world knowledge may be incompatible with domain knowledge (e.g. that the robot may have discovered a fridge in the living room, rather than or in addition to that in the kitchen, while domain knowledge states that \"refrigerators are in the kitchen\"). In general, domain knowledge (which represents a priori knowledge about the environment) is only used when specific world knowledge is available."}, {"heading": "3.1 Knowledge about the robot\u2019s world", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "3.2 General knowledge about the domain", "text": "In previous work, domain knowledge has typically been characterized as a conceptual knowledge base that asserts a priori a hierarchy of concepts, including their properties and relationships, as representative of each environment; the conceptual knowledge base contains a taxonomy of concepts related to the environment bound by an actual relationship, as well as their properties and relationships (see [11], [13]); these concepts are used in World Knowledge to characterize the specific instances of the environment, as explained in the previous section. In a typical presentation, three of the highest classes were considered: areas, structural elements and objects. Areas designate places in the environment (corridors, spaces, etc.), structural elements are static units that form the environment and connect the topological areas (windows, doors, etc.), while objects are elements in the environment that are not related to their structure and lie within areas (printers, tables, etc.)."}, {"heading": "4 Acquisition of the Robot\u2019s Knowledge", "text": "The process of building the representation of robot knowledge consists of two phases, which take place with the help of the user after exploring the environment: 1) Metric Map and Instance Signatures Construction. A 2D metric map is generated by an SLAM module and the set of instance signatures is created; 2) Cell Map and Topological Graph Generation. Starting from the 2D metric map, a grid-based topological representation (cell map) is obtained. Subsequently, by processing the instance signatures and the cell map, the topological diagram is created that the robot needs to execute a high level of behavior."}, {"heading": "4.1 Metric Map and Instance Signatures", "text": "In the first phase of the knowledge acquisition procedure (see Fig. 4), the robot is used to navigate the environment to create the 2dmap and to register the positions of the various objects of interest. The user can mark a specific object with a commercial laser pointer (Fig. 5a).While the object is shown by the laser, the user must name the object so that the label can be assigned to it. The image segmentation module is responsible for extracting the 3D shape of the pointed object by exploiting the RGB-D data that come from the Kinect, sensor [26] The laser point is recognized in the RGB image (Fig. 5b) by searching for the color of the emitted light (green in our case).Then all levels in the scene are extracted from the 3D point cloud and those that are not discarded the dotare. The remaining points are analyzed to segment the shape of the object of interest."}, {"heading": "4.2 Cell Map and Topological Graph", "text": "In the second phase of the knowledge acquisition procedure the cell map and the topological graph are generated (see Fig. 6).The cell map contains a high-level description of regions, structural elements and objects in the environment.It is generated both with the instance signatures and with the 2D topological map.The algorithm for creating such a map can be further decomposed into the following steps: 1) raster the metric representation of the map into a grid-based topological representation (grid calculation); 2) including the representations of the objects and structural elements in the environment (object addition).3) automatically the labeling of the areas of the environment (described areas of the labeling), with the contour resolution and region filling the techniques. Application of the Hough Transform in different resolutions to identify the lines that go through the walls is possible."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we propose an approach to build an effective representation of the knowledge of the environment in which the robot works, relying on multimodal interaction with human robots, including natural language. Consequently, the proposed framework for displaying robot knowledge is much richer than previous approaches in the literature; in particular, it supports better performance and greater universality in terms of fully automated methods. By means of the acquired representation, the robot can perform complex tasks, such as \"checking if the third window on the left is open in the corridor,\" retrieving its metric position in the map, planning a path and achieving the specified environment, and executing the task. The proposed approach can be developed in at least two fundamental directions that we are currently investigating."}], "references": [{"title": "Knowing, Reasoning, and Acting", "author": ["L.C.
