In such cases, probabilistic reasoning methods are mostly used due to their ability to model uncertain knowledge and beliefs of robots, although there are also many attempts to develop qualitative approaches inspired by the human way of interpreting the surrounding world. Such methods allow to model inaccurate and uncertain information, vary the grain of reasoning, eliminate information overload and fix program execution (see [5] and [6] for details). The qualitative approach is still being explored, hence a number of new methods are being developed laterally as presented in [2], [11], and [1], among others. The proposed approach is a combination of both approaches: qualitative resonation and probabilistic functions functions functions functions functions functions functions functions. The method developed to present a universally applicable scenario is a scenario that is universally applicable to the scenario."}, {"heading": "2 The formal beliefs\u2019 representation in the Situation Calculus with probabilistic functions", "text": "A specific scenario consists of a plane table with cubic blocks located on their surface and the robot is in front of them. Separate columns are formed with blocks placed on top of each other, as shown in the figure. 1.The robot is equipped with an arm that can grab and move individual objects. Initially, blocks are placed on the table in the requested configuration, which represents a target configuration. The robot observes the configuration and keeps its pure qualitative representation in mind. Afterwards, blocks are mixed and a new configuration called the initial state is shown to the robot. The task of the system is to observe the predetermined configuration and to plan the sequence of actions that brings back the target configuration i.e. At the final configuration height of each column, the same will be as in the target configuration. Predicates used for declarations of faith express qualitative procedures (symbolic)."}, {"heading": "3 The implementation", "text": "The implementation of the described scenario is carried out with the prolog environment. Moreover, IndiGolog [10] - an agent architecture with the situation implementation, fully programmed in Prolog - is a use. It provides all elements of the Situation Calculus language and common programming structures such as the \"if\" condition and the \"while\" loop. The whole argumentation module is fully implemented in the IndiGolog architecture. It consists of five columns in which the expression col (N) means that N is a column. (N = 2; N = 3; N = 5.Fig. 5. Constants represent numbers of columns."}, {"heading": "4 Performance tests", "text": "A series of tests for different initial and target configurations were carried out. However, the same scenario as described in section 2 was simulated, i.e. there were five columns consisting of blocks and four qualities, namely large, medium, small and zero. However, when the initial situation is shown to the robot, it assigns a quality value to each column and keeps only such a qualitative representation in mind. Therefore, the first column with 8 blocks in one starting situation and with 5 blocks in another starting situation can be presented by the robot in both cases in the same way, namely as a middle column. The behavior of this system can lead to incorrect reasoning and inability to accomplish a certain task. Now, we present three different simulations, namely a goal achievement in a well-established starting situation, a goal achievement in a boundary point starting situation and an inability to complete a certain goal in a certain boundary point starting situation."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and future work", "text": "The main advantages of the presented approach are: scalability, formal use of language, incomplete and uncertain representation of knowledge, qualitative thinking without strictly numerical information. These characteristics are indispensable for robotic application, which cannot use quantitative, numerical methods of thinking. Such situations are common and occur in an unknown environment, when sensors are not able to return precise information, or in cases where the argumentation must be reached quickly and classical numerical methods require too much time (or too much computing power).The method was implemented for the problem of moving blocks, but since more fluctuations and rules of thinking can be easily defined, this method can also be used for other problems, or in cases where the argumentation needs to be reached quickly and classical numerical methods require too much time (or too much computing power).The method was implemented for the problem of moving blocks, but since more rules of thinking can be easily defined by general qualitative, for example, this method may not be used for the purpose of further representation of robotic systems, which may also be used for other problems."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The work presented in this paper is supported by a grant from the Polish National Science Center 2011 / 02 / A / HS1 / 00395.
