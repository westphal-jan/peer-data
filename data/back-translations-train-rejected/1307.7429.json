INTRODUCTION", "text": "The expectation of people's political behavior in elections can determine the future perspective of each country's domestic and foreign policies and characterize national and international relations, and this prospect will greatly help candidates to anticipate their success and also provide an opportunity to know the public demands and national will of their chosen topics. Thus, by emphasizing these factors, they can achieve their goals. Furthermore, policies and functions of industry, economics, the market and other sectors are selected on the basis of expert opinions determined by the people. Therefore, economic and other sectors will use these expectations in connection with the predictions of their policies and programs for the future to achieve better efficiency and performance for themselves. Generally, anticipation of public political behavior will show the future perspective of society, in which everyone in each class and position can experience, program and make policies about the future of work, politics, economy, military and other sectors, by informing authorities, military and other sectors in order to virtually analyze the views of the parties and available candidates."}, {"heading": "2. PREVIOUS WORK", "text": "In the first study, the researchers not only pointed out that neural networks are increasingly being used to solve non-linear control problems, but also discussed how to solve the problem of predicting election outcomes by using this model. Firstly, the researchers will use and apply a neural perceptron network to anticipate election outcomes in India and then begin to teach (learn) the network. The authors stressed that during the educational process, it generates minimal disorder and can be used to apply procedures to anticipate and reduce disorder [1]. In the second study, they talked about adopting the concentration of political behavior that worked logically in elections. They also discussed the application of this assumption in voting. The researchers are developing a comparative method in their research approach that applies the differences in voter decision-making processes. The authors point to the fact that the goal of this research is to discover the potential relationships and regulations in the public behavior of Spanish voters."}, {"heading": "3. DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY", "text": "Nowadays, the development of digital media is leading to an increase in data storage technologies in databases, bringing with it widespread capacities and volumes of data around the world. [5] Due to the increasing speed of data volume, the use of traditional methods of obtaining useful and appropriate data patterns has been practically difficult and expensive, sometimes failing to find the potential patterns, making the traditional ones ineffective. Essentially, data mining is defined as the concept where we can gain useful insights into relationships, patterns, tendencies and potential relationships by analyzing automatic patterns and large databases with significant and potential patterns. [6] Data mining is the complicated process of recognizing patterns and accurate, new and potentially useful models in a way that is perceptible to humans."}, {"heading": "4. DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY", "text": "There are many methods and methods of conducting data mining projects, one of which is CRISP. CRISP is the abbreviation for CROSS INDUSTRY STANDARD PROCESS consists of system recognition, data preparation, and evaluation and system development steps [7]. In Figure (1), the procedure of the data mining project is indicated on the basis of this methodology. Data mining algorithm is able to anticipate, classify, and cluster the system. In this section, we offer a general scheme of the architecture of anticipating systems in the presidential campaign using Tools Orange, the general architecture of typical data mining systems, and data mining project procedures based on CRISP, which is specified in Figure (2)."}, {"heading": "5.

ANTICIPATION ALGORITHM TO PREDICT PARTICIPATION RATE IN ELECTION", "text": "In this section we have a review of the algorithms used in the proposed architecture.6.1. Decision tree is a type of appropriate tool and function to classify data, make estimates, and make predictions based on the characteristics and properties that data have so far. [8] We use unique decision-making methods trees that not only do classification, but also facilitate immediate decision-making and correctly define the system. As it can be defined the system in the form of input and output set, decision tree can analyze features and outputs and provide the system as a tree diagram that has led to data classification and system feature representation [9].6.2. Na\u00efve Bayne's algorithm is one of the most important tools to configure various techniques of data mining, is Bayesian thinking. Bayesian theory is a basic method for recognizing pattern recognition costs and establishing compromise functions between the necessary classification functions."}, {"heading": "7.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Anticipating the political behavior of the candidates can determine the future of each country's domestic and foreign policy and its balance sheets. Anticipating the political behavior of the candidates will be a considerable help for the candidates to assess the possibility of their success and to be informed about the public motivations for selecting their candidates. Due to the increasing volume of databases and the inefficiency of traditional statistical methods for gaining knowledge from data, it is nowadays used data mining algorithms to find potential relationships. It is able to anticipate three basic data mining algorithms of KKN, decision-making tree and Bayesian theory. To test and evaluate the proposed model, we use Tools Orange based on CRISP and try to test and evaluate the proposed model. In this system, three basic data mining algorithms of KN, Decision-making Tree and Bayesian theory are used."}, {"heading": "9.
