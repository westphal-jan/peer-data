INTRODUCTION", "text": "Blog as a current social medium in cyberspace is one of the Internet and web services [1, 2], which generally provide free software components to users so that they can participate as a member of the network and the virtual community. It also provides unlimited dynamic and interactive relationships and opinions and messages on specific topics, which are able to inform the other opinions on specific topics [3]. It causes these media, with their specific capabilities, to have a considerable growth around the world and especially in Iran [1, 4]. There is a specific relationship between blog features and bloggers tendency with social, political and cultural patterns of different countries and nations [1, 5]. Thus, the recognition of the trend of blogging in countries such as Iran and other parts of it, which exhibit an increasing rate, can highlight the disadvantages and weaknesses of different countries and the causes associated with blogging technological features as well as [2, 6, 1 and 5]."}, {"heading": "2. PREVIOUS WORKS", "text": "In this regard, it can be noted to the articles in the past such as Zafarani et al. [1] using the blogizer system and selected proper data, and then starting to process them, they try to perceive them by creating lists and extracting keywords. By measuring the meaning and frequency of the data obtained, they point out that social and political issues can be perceived through automatic programming. Nachev and Ganchev [7] propose a new approach based on the Art2 artificial neural network (ANN) as a kind of data analysis that contributes to pattern collection in the data blog and uses it to provide tailor-made content. They filter the data to identify users and meetings, and then obtain result vectors and cluster results by using data published in the blogging space. Kwonm et al [8] find another theory in contrast to the theory of social networks, which is based on data that are published without any relationship whatsoever."}, {"heading": "3. DATA MINING", "text": "Due to the development of technologies and digital media, the data storage technology is provided in the database and has led to large amounts of data mining patterns. [10, 11] Due to the explosive growth of data stored in databases, the need for new tools to automatically find knowledge and patterns from them was felt. In the late 1980s, the concept of data mining was developed further, which was further developed in the 1990s [10]. Basically, data mining was referred to the concept that led to the useful discovery of relationships, patterns, tendencies and potential relationships by using automatic patterns and databases with significant and unknown potential patterns [10, 11,12 and 13]. Data mining is an ingenious process for recognizing patterns and correcting new and potential models that are placed in high volumes of data as data science. It is understandable to humans. At the beginning of the new millennium, the scientific recognition patterns among the most respected patterns of data mining systems worldwide may be considered the biggest changes known in recent decades."}, {"heading": "3.1 Decision Tree", "text": "In fact, the Decision Tree is an example of the right tool and the right handling of the data. Internal nodes are suitable for the specific characteristics and experiments of each country, and the sheets are also responsible for the distributions of the classes."}, {"heading": "4. BLOG WRITING", "text": "With technological advances and in recent years, the web has been seen as a social medium and attempts to obtain it through analysis in order to find knowledge, awareness and useful data [1].Nowadays, as a result of these advances, blogs and blogging societies are being constituted as an important and effective part of the World Web. Thus, digital writing is the process of publishing information as digital data in computer environments that can be facilitated by the Internet. By publishing this data, the new communication styles have been made available in recent years [1].Blogs are also a type of digital writing that can facilitate users \"news from newspapers, personal ideas about books and other written media through computers and, in particular, the Internet."}, {"heading": "As the private satellite networks aren\u2019t allowed to work in", "text": "Most people are therefore looking for a place to publish their ideas and opinions and to analyse them. In this regard, they need cheap and simple tools and blogs can support them. Many people use blogs in Iran to publish their thoughts. Therefore, there are a lot of companies that support free blogs. Although these free facilities are provided to attract more users, to get more income and remuneration for free blog offerings, the wide range of blogs and blogs in Iran, the scientific, social and political conditions in blogs data mining and the view of bloggers will lead to proper and useful analysis of the country."}, {"heading": "5.

CONCLOUSION AND FUTURE WORKS", "text": "In this article, we propose a new approach for presenting the case study of bloggers who tend to recognize parameters through the use of data mining. Based on simulations of input data from 100 users and bloggers from Kohkiloye and Boyer Ahmad Province, and the use of the weka3.6 tool and the c4.5 algorithm to provide a decision tree and achieve users \"future expectations, the results are shown with 82% accuracy. If users are interested in writing memos, the basic factor of the professional approach will be political thinking and academic education as the next step. If political issues are considered important in blogging, attitudes toward local media, political and social conditions function as fundamental factors for the recognition of a professional approach. If users are interested in digital writing in the tourism sector, academic education and political thinking would be fundamental factors for the recognition of a professional approach. Finally, if they opt for topics such as news and science, their professional approach to the decision-making process would be based on our policy-making and policy-making process."}, {"heading": "7.
