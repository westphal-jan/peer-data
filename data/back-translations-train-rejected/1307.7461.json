We identify four distinct strategies for such an integration: (i) low-level checks are done for all possible cases in advance and then this information is used during plan generation, (ii) low-level checks are done exactly when they are needed during the search for a plan, (iii) first all plans are computed and then infeasible ones are filtered, and (iv) by means of replanning, after finding a plan, low-level checks identify whether it is infeasible or not; if it is infeasible, a new plan is computed considering the results of previous low- level checks. We perform experiments on hybrid planning problems in robotic manipulation and legged locomotion domains considering these four methods of integration, as well as some of their combinations. We analyze the usefulness of levels of integration in these domains, both from the point of view of computational efficiency (in time and space) and from the point of view of plan quality relative to its feasibility. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in the light of experimental results and provide some guidelines on choosing proper strategies for a given domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Jul 2013 05:07:57 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7461v1", "In Workshop on Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Robotics (KRR) (International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP) 2013)"]], "COMMENTS": "In Workshop on Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Robotics (KRR) (International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP) 2013)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["esra erdem", "volkan patoglu", "peter sch\\\"uller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7461"}, "pdf": {"name": "1307.7461.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Levels of Integration between Low-Level Reasoning and Task Planning", "authors": ["Esra Erdem", "Volkan Patoglu", "Peter Sch\u00fcller"], "emails": ["esraerdem@sabanciuniv.edu", "vpatoglu@sabanciuniv.edu", "peterschueller@sabanciuniv.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: task planning, geometric thinking, programming of answer sentences."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "Levels of Integration", "text": "R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, A9, A9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, R9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, 9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, A9, 9, A9, A9, A9, 9, 9, A9, A9, A9, 9, A9"}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "We examine the usefulness of the integration levels described above, taking into account two orthogonal characteristics: solution quality and planning efficiency. We quantify these characteristics as follows: solution quality. If a low module L is not integrated into the planning process, some plan candidates will be unfeasible due to the failure of low tests of L. We quantify solution quality by measuring the number of feasible and unfeasible plan candidates generated by searching for a plan. In this way, we obtain a measurement that shows how relevant a given low test is to the feasibility of the plan. Note that in the FILT approach, an unfeasible plan candidate only leads to the creation of a new plan, while in REPL an unfeasible plan candidate causes the calculation of additional limitations and a restart of the plan search. Closely related to the number of feasible and unfeasible solution candidates is the number of feasible and unfeasible candidates to the first number of the feasible and feasible solution candidates to the number of the feasible one."}, {"heading": "Domains and Experimental Setup", "text": "For our empirical evaluation, we use the robotic structures that we claim for ourselves.

In Legged Locomotion, we use a geometric C + + library to perform basic geometric operations sufficient to calculate test results. In Robotic Manipulation, object collision testing (Lpay) works with 3D models of objects and environments, and Lrob additionally requires inverse kinematics to determine the common configuration of each robot that reaches a certain point before it performs collision control between armies. Therefore, any low-level inspection in Legged Locomotion requires less time and memory than in Robotic Manipulation. Information relevant to low-level logic. In Legged Locomotion, we look at low-level problem instances via a 10-10-10 grid.

integration between discrete high-level reasoning and continuous low-level reasoning to address hybrid planning problems in robotics. We identify four distinct strategies for such an integration: (i) low-level checks are done for all possible cases in advance and then this information is used during plan generation, (ii) low-level checks are done exactly when they are needed during the search for a plan, (iii) first all plans are computed and then infeasible ones are filtered, and (iv) by means of replanning, after finding a plan, low-level checks identify whether it is infeasible or not; if it is infeasible, a new plan is computed considering the results of previous lowlevel checks. We perform experiments on hybrid planning problems in robotic manipulation and legged locomotion domains considering these four methods of integration, as well as some of their combinations. We analyze the usefulness of levels of integration in these domains, both from the point of view of computational efficiency (in time and space) and from the point of view of plan quality relative to its feasibility. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in the light of experimental results and provide some guidelines on choosing proper strategies for a given domain.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
