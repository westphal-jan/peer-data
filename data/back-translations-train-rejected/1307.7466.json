As the mind whizzes around, it ponders the placement possibilities, considers combinations and thinks about strategies, the eyes whizz from place to place over the puzzle, examines the pieces relevant for a considered placement, checks edges for compatibility and examines the layout. The eyes react to the consideration of the mind, review expectations and look for necessary information. They assure that the consideration is rooted in the physical reality of the problem. Many problems in robot manipulation require consideration because of the large number of elements involved and their complicated interactions."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "This report is characterized by the fact that it is an empirical study of the embedding of perception planning in a task planning problem, not an application of planning to perception processing, but an investigation of how this integration could also improve the efficiency of planning. In this sense, a more relevant related work reports on a prologue-based decision-making system that uses external calculations to generate and devalue perception hypotheses, such as the missing objects on a table [11], although it should be emphasized that the present report is an empirical study of various ways of embedding such external calculations."}, {"heading": "3 Manipulation Domain Description", "text": "The robotic manipulation domain we are looking at in our experiments involves the capture, transport and placement of objects by robots from a small group of industrially plausible objects (Figure 1) used in the Robocup @ Work 2012 competition. The planning problem is to obtain a sequence of actions that transforms an initial configuration of these objects on a workspace into a final configuration that meets certain target conditions.Perception is used in identifying the shape of objects to check the stability of object stacks and also their accessibility.In this work, the integration of perception with planning is emphasized, unlike in Robocup @ Work 2012, the mobile aspect of the robot.We consider the workspace as a 5-3 grid in which each grid cell has a unique label. We assume that the objects are oriented in three different ways: horizontally to the x-axis, horizontally to the work area, or vertically to the work area."}, {"heading": "3.1 Effects and preconditions of actions", "text": "The direct effects of motion action are described in C + by the following causal laws: motion (obj, loc, orient) causes is ori in (obj) = loc motion (obj, loc, orient) causes is ori (obj) = orientationThe preconditions of this action are also described by causal laws. For example, we can show that an object cannot be moved to a place if it is already there, by the causal law: non-executable motion (obj, loc, orient) if it is at (obj) = place. The precalculation approach (pre) approach to integration also uses causal laws as a way of integrating external calculation. The following causal prediction expresses that an object cannot be moved to another object if this would lead to an unstable stack. Non-executable motion (obj, obj \u2032, orient) is another form if ori (obj \u2032) = oric predictability is objective (obj, obj, obj, obj, obj, obj, obj)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Constraints", "text": "State restrictions ensure that two objects cannot be in the same place and that an object cannot be below itself: Induced false if is at (obj) = loc is at (obj) = loc (obj 6 = obj) induced false if is at (obj, obj) Here is below (obj, obj) is a derivative predicate defined in relation to is at (obj) = loc."}, {"heading": "3.3 Planning", "text": "In view of the partial domain description described above, we can solve planning problems using the CCalc [4] reasoning system with \"queries\" as follows: - query maxstep:: 0.. 3;% initial state 0: is _ at (sco2) = loc _ 0x0, ori _ is (sco2) = vert, is _ at (obj1) = loc _ 2x1, ori _ is (obj1) = vert;% target maxstep: is _ below (loc _ 0x0, obj1). This query requires a shortest plan with a maximum length of 3, after a planning problem with: - initial state: the object sco2 is placed vertically at the workstation at the loc _ 0x0 location and the object obj1 at the loc _ 2x1 location with a vertical orientation, and - destination: a configuration of objects so that obj1 lies above the location loc _ 0x0."}, {"heading": "4 Object Recognition", "text": "The perception data comes in the form of a point cloud from a Kinect RGBD camera, which uses a structured infrared projector and a camera to capture both dense depth and RGB images; the camera is mounted on the robot at an angle to obtain a wide view of the working area; the perception subsystem consists of two phases, the bottom-up and top-down phases; in the first bottom-up phase, candidates are segmented scene objects based on uncoupling in 3D space and positioned in relation to a workstation table; orientation is determined by existing object principles; this requires mapping the perception data into the world coordinate system by using robot localization and calibration of extrinsic sensor parameters; the names of the task-relevant objects are specified in the task specification; and simple data association is obtained based on the climatic distance from an object-specific object, the second object-plane name is automatically generated."}, {"heading": "5 Integration of Task Planning and Perception", "text": "We consider three approaches to integrate perception and task planning, similar to how geometric thinking and task planning are integrated in [1]."}, {"heading": "5.1 Precomputation", "text": "Before: In the precalculation approach, all possible external calculations (i.e. stability and accessibility checks) are completed in the context of perception processing (i.e. the determination of the shapes of all objects), and then the results of these calculations are presented on the basis of external predicates used in the domain description. Practical plans are then calculated. Thus, for example, form information and information about possible occlusions returned from the perception system can be presented as prolog facts as follows: shape _ is _ ext (sco2, bolt _ m20 _ 100). is _ in _ front _ ext (loc _ 0x0, loc _ 1x0). These can then be used in the definition of external predicates as follows: shape _ is _ ext (OBJ1, OBJ1 _ ORIENTATION, OBJ2, _ is _ ext (OBJext, aluprofil _ f20 _ gray)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Filtering", "text": "Filt: In the filter approach, a plan is first calculated on the basis of the domain description without the causal laws dependent on external predicates, and then stability and accessibility checks are performed to determine the feasibility of the plan; if the plan is not feasible, another plan is calculated. This three-step procedure is carried out in a loop until a viable plan is calculated. In the filter condition, external checks are not integrated into the domain description as external predicates, as they are carried out in Pre, but are instead used after the planning process to evaluate the correctness of the planner results; i.e. they are formally not part of the domain description. External calculations check the feasibility of the plan as follows: - It is determined whether the calculated plan attempts a stack, or reaches an area in which an object can be blocked, objectively oriented objectively oriented objectively, objectively oriented objectively, objectively oriented, objectively oriented objectively, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, \"objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented,\" objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, \"objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented,\" objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, \"objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented,\" objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, objectively oriented, \"objectively oriented, objectively oriented,\" objectively oriented, objectively oriented \"objectively oriented, objectively oriented,\" objectively oriently oriented, objectively oriented, \"objectively oriented,\" objectively oriented, \"objectively oriented,\" objectively oriented, \"objectively oriented,\" objectively oriented, \"objectively oriented,\" objectively oriented, \"objectively oriented,\" objectively, \"objectively oriented,\" objectively, \"objectively oriented,\" objectively ori"}, {"heading": "5.3 Replanning", "text": "Repl: The rescheduling approach follows, as in the filter approach, also the three-step approach in a loop. However, in the last step, the planning problem is limited by new information from the perception processing and the planner can be restarted with the new planning problem. for example, consider the planning problem presented in Section 3.3. after calculating an unfeasible plan and identifying the reasons for its unfeasibility, the planning problem can be modified as follows to ensure that no unfeasible plans are calculated with the same reasons for its unfeasibility: - querymaxstep: 0.. 3;% initial state 0: is _ at (sco2) = loc (sco2), is _ at (scoint), is _ at (scoint (2x1), ori _ T: (obj1), ori _ mac: (obj1) = vert;% Constraints T: &ltmaxint; jint-jint: >: 1 (objint: 1), ob.T: (1)."}, {"heading": "6 Experimental Evaluation", "text": "In our experiments, we look at the three different approaches to integrating planning and perception as described above, taking into account three problem cases. RGBD images representing the perception input into the system for each of the three instances, and the planning problem as presented to the planner after the lower perception layer, are presented in Figure 2.Instance 1: The initial configuration of objects in Instance 1, which is visible on the left side of Figure 2, consists of a vertically oriented bolt on the right side, in front of a large nut. A second bolt is visible on the left side. The goal of this scenario is to test the planner in a small jumble to see if profit is made from integrating perception and planning. The task is to move the nut into the center of the workspace (move obj1 to loc _ 2x1)."}, {"heading": "7 Results", "text": "This year, it has never been as good as it has been this year."}, {"heading": "8 Discussion", "text": "We have examined the usefulness of three different approaches to integrate planning and perception: first, where all perception calculations are performed prior to planning to find a feasible plan; filt, where perception calculations are performed after planning to check the feasibility of the calculated plan; and follow-up planning is performed under guidance by incorporating limitations into the planning problem. Experiments comparing these three approaches look at three problem cases of a robot-based manipulation domain that affects industrial objects used in the RoboCup @ Work 2012 competitions. We have observed that in terms of the quality of the solutions (that is the rate of unfeasible plans produced by the planning module) Pre achieves the best results. In terms of computation time, Pre also requires the maximum number of perception queries; the minimum feasibility of the required processing time is increased by the required plurality of the required repetition costs, while the execution time is rapidly increased."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work is partly supported by the TUBITAK scholarship 111E116.
