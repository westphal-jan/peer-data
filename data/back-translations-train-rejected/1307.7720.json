One subclass of human computation applications are those directed at tasks that involve planning (e.g. travel planning) and scheduling (e.g. conference scheduling). Much of this work appears outside the traditional automated planning forums, and at the outset it is not clear whether automated planning has much of a role to play in these human computation systems. Interestingly however, work on these systems shows that even primitive forms of automated oversight of the human planner does help in significantly improving the effectiveness of the humans/crowd. In this paper, we will argue that the automated oversight used in these systems can be viewed as a primitive automated planner, and that there are several opportunities for more sophisticated automated planning in effectively steering crowdsourced planning. Straightforward adaptation of current planning technology is however hampered by the mismatch between the capabilities of human workers and automated planners. We identify two important challenges that need to be overcome before such adaptation of planning technology can occur: (i) interpreting the inputs of the human workers (and the requester) and (ii) steering or critiquing the plans being produced by the human workers armed only with incomplete domain and preference models. In this paper, we discuss approaches for handling these challenges, and characterize existing human computation systems in terms of the specific choices they make in handling these challenges.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Jul 2013 20:02:03 GMT  (247kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7720v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["kartik talamadupula", "subbarao kambhampati"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7720"}, "pdf": {"name": "1307.7720.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Herding the Crowd: Automated Planning for Crowdsourced Planning", "authors": ["Kartik Talamadupula", "Subbarao Kambhampati"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them are able to obey the rules which they have imposed on themselves.

This can itself be seen as part of the Mp model, as the planner has a clear idea of what kind of information can be expected through which channels. For example, the requester can be given a dynamic form to fill in, rather than a box for free-form text. This immediately implies a structure for the information provided and makes it easier for the planner to separate different fields. Similarly, when workers create plans, the system can exert a flow on this process. Such structured data can include information about the requester's preferences, regardless of the dynamics of the domain in question."}, {"heading": "4.2 Steering the Crowd\u2019s Plan", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only be a matter of time before it is so far, until it is so far, until an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we took a first step in exploring the opportunities and challenges for automated planning of intelligence systems in crowdsourced planning scenarios. We identified several roles an automated planner can play in managing human workers in creating effective plans. We then identified two major challenges in adapting automated planning technology to such scenarios: interpreting requester inputs and human worker plans - often expressed in natural language - and criticising these plans in the presence of incompleteness of requester preferences and the planner domain model. We discussed several ways in which these challenges can be addressed, and also characterised the specific (if primitive) decisions made by existing crowdsourced planning systems in dealing with these challenges. We hope that this work will spur research on to the challenges we have identified. References [Allen et al. 2007; J. F. Chambers; L.
