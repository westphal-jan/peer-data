We show how this constrained discrete optimization problem can be formulated as a multi-dimensional parametric mincut problem via its Lagrangian dual, and prove that our algorithm isolates all constraint instances for which the problem can be solved exactly. These multiple solutions enable us to even deal with `soft constraints' (higher order penalty functions). Moreover, we propose two practical variants of our algorithm to solve problems with hard constraints. We also show how our method can be applied to solve various constrained discrete optimization problems such as submodular minimization and shortest path computation. Experimental evaluation using the foreground-background image segmentation problem with statistic constraints reveals that our method is faster and its results are closer to the ground truth labellings compared with the popular continuous relaxation based methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 03:02:44 GMT  (1255kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7793v1", "19 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["yongsub lim", "kyomin jung", "pushmeet kohli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7793"}, "pdf": {"name": "1307.7793.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Multi-dimensional Parametric Mincuts for Constrained MAP Inference", "authors": ["Yongsub Lim", "Kyomin Jung", "Pushmeet Kohli"], "emails": ["yongsub@kaist.ac.kr", "kyomin@kaist.edu", "pkohli@microsoft.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to survive themselves if they do not put themselves in a position to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves.

These minimizers can be used to calculate good approximate solutions to problems with soft constraints (enforced with a higher term in energy). Our algorithm works by exploiting the minimization problem, and requires an oracle that efficiently calculates the values of the double-plane.

Specifically, for the problem of foreground and background image segmentation, the most likely segmentations under the label number constraint have been found to be closer to the basic truth [14, 20]. Another example is the silhouette constraint used for the problem of 3D reconstruction [13, 29]. This constraint ensured that a beam emanating from each silhouette pixel must pass through at least one voxel belonging to the \"object.\" Recently, a dual decomposition has been proposed to prevent such a MAP reference (7, 37)."}, {"heading": "2 Setup and preliminaries", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Energy minimization", "text": "Markov Random Fields (MRF) defined on a graph G = (V, E) is a probability distribution in which each vertex u-V has a corresponding random variable xu, which takes a value from the finite label set L.

DualSearch produces minimizers for a very large number of constraints. One implication is that for each given constraint, DualMax and AdaptSearch can calculate a minimizer that is very close to the original instance. Figure 3 shows an example of a skeleton projected onto a two-dimensional space that is calculated with (20) for a 12 x 12 image. Figure 4 shows experimental results from DualMax and AdaptSearch.

Unlike previous work, we provide a framework for dealing with multiple general constraints.

For example, as shown in the previous section, any submodular constraint hi (x) can be dealt with with restricted constraints. The restricted shortest path problem is a widely studied restricted conversion where each edge has a delay in addition to its length. A path is feasible if its total delay is lower than any threshold D [21].

algorithms for inferring the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) solution of discrete pairwise random field models under multiple constraints. We show how this constrained discrete optimization problem can be formulated as a multi-dimensional parametric mincut problem via its Lagrangian dual, and prove that our algorithm isolates all constraint instances for which the problem can be solved exactly. These multiple solutions enable us to even deal with \u2018soft constraints\u2019 (higher order penalty functions). Moreover, we propose two practical variants of our algorithm to solve problems with hard constraints. We also show how our method can be applied to solve various constrained discrete optimization problems such as submodular minimization and shortest path computation. Experimental evaluation using the foreground-background image segmentation problem with statistic constraints reveals that our method is faster and its results are closer to the ground truth labellings compared with the popular continuous relaxation based methods.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
