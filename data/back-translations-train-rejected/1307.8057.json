Related work", "text": "New research trends in the field of biomedicine include the discovery of hidden compounds in texts to form new hypotheses that can be further explored through conventional experiments. [6] A series of studies by Swanson [13] [14] showed that these hidden compounds can lead us to new discoveries. He reported that fish oil leads to a change in blood viscosity and red blood cell stiffness that helps prevent Raynaud syndrome. [13] Later, research reports began to uncover suggestions for clinical therapies and basic physiological links from bibliographically isolated texts. However, the working principles of Swanson's empirical research include the computational burden of full-text syntactical analysis and include large literature databases such as MEDLINE. Our work, although it does not generate hypotheses, can be a good means of finding implicit connections in texts in which we use fewer compilations of texts (empirical research from them)."}, {"heading": "3.

Results and Discussions", "text": "Table 3 lists the 10 related concepts for an essay on ischemia and glutamate, seven pairs of terms semantically linked by UMLS. Table 4 shows the 10 related concepts for an essay on ataxia and dehydrogenase, eight of which are semantically linked by the semantic UMLS relationship network. Our observation of this area shows that PDHC (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) is manifested in ataxia patients, especially those suffering from Friereich's ataxia. Therefore, the relationships between Friedreich, ataxia and PDHC are graphically illustrated in the listing. Table 5 lists the 10 related concepts for an essay on hypogonadism and gonadotropin. According to the UMLS semantic relationship network, eight of these pairs are semantically related. Steroids have significant effects on diseases such as hypogonmus, which plays an important role in the release of steroids."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we report on the extraction of networked concepts from biomedical texts by evaluating the readability of texts. Text readability is determined by a metric called the Fog Index (FI). We curated 24 random works using four pairs of connected concepts as keywords and applied FI to them. Experimental results showed that sentences have low readability when they contain contiguous concepts. We selected 30 percent of the most difficult-to-read sentences and used an association matrix to locate the most common pairs of terms in them. To remove those pairs of terms that have a rather weak connection, we used the equally weighted harmonic mean of their positive predictive value and their sensitivity as second ranking filters. Results are supported by identifying almost all of the extracted concepts that are semantically connected by the UMLS semantic relationship network."}, {"heading": "6. References", "text": "[1] F.
