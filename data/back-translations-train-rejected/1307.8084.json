At the same time, providing complete domain knowledge in advance is challenging, and humans are unlikely to have the time and expertise to provide elaborate and precise beliefs. (b) The widespread use of robots in our homes, offices, and other complex domains of the real world is therefore a powerful representation of knowledge and reasoning (KRR)."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Algorithms based on probabilistic graphical models such as POMDPs have been used to model uncertainty in the real world of sensors and navigation, enabling the use of robots in offices and hospitals [2,3,4]. Since the rapid increase in state dimensions of such formulations of complex problems makes it difficult for robots to operate in real time, researchers have developed algorithms that break down complex problems into a hierarchy of simpler problems that are mathematically comprehensible [3,5]. However, it is still difficult to use POMDPs and other graphical models in large, complex spaces of action. Moreover, these probabilistic algorithms do not readily support common sense representation and reasoning."}, {"heading": "3 Proposed Architecture", "text": "Figure 1 shows our control architecture. The ASP Knowledge Base (KB) represents domain knowledge (Section 3.1), while POMDPs are likely to model a subset of the state area relevant to the task (Section 3.2). The logical conclusion in ASP is used to calculate (a) previous beliefs relevant to the task that are modeled as Dirichlet beliefs (Section 3.3); and (b) to identify contingencies that are not taken into account by the POMDP formulation based on beta distributions (Section 3.4). The Dirichlet distribution supports Bavarian merging with POMDP beliefs (Section 3.3), while beta distributions support the use of positive and negative observations for early completion of tasks that cannot be performed (Section 3.4).

ASP's signature is a tuple of sets: \u03a3 = < O, F, P, V > that define the names of objects, functions, predicates, and variables that are available for use. ASP's signature is supplemented by species (i.e. types) such as: Space / 1, Object / 1, Class / 1, and Step / 1 (for temporary reasoning). An ASP program is a collection of statements that describe objects and relationships between them. A response set is a set of basic words that represent beliefs of an agent associated with the program. ASP introduces new connectives: Default negation (negation through failure) and epistemic disjunction, e.g., \"other than classical negation.\""}, {"heading": "3.2 Uncertainty modeling with POMDP", "text": "To locate targets, the robot must move and analyze images of different scenes. Uncertainty in sensor input processing and navigation is automatically modeled using hierarchical POMDPs, as shown in Figure 3. For a target, the 3D area (e.g. multiple rooms) is modeled as a discrete 2D allocation grid, each grid stores the likelihood of target existence. Visual perception (VS) POMDP plans an action sequence that maximizes information gain by analyzing a suitable sequence of scenes. For each scene, Scene Processing (SP) POMDP plans the processing of specific regions of images of the scene using relevant algorithms. This formulation uses our previous work on automatic belief propagation and modeling in hierarchical POMDPs [5]; some key features of the hierarchy are briefly described: View the VS POMDP tuple < S, A, Z, grid for localizing an object in one."}, {"heading": "3.3 Generating Prior Beliefs from Answer Sets", "text": "This law is applicable to visual processing, the primary source of this object in relation to the existence of an object. (This section describes the generation of previous beliefs from the ASP KB.) For indoor target localization, the robot calculates the prior existence of desired objects in spaces by means of: (a) knowledge of the hierarchy of object classes and specific objects in the domain; and (b) postulates that the capture of objects co-exists relationships. We illustrate this approach below for target localization and visual processing; some postulates (and their representation) may need to be revised for other sensors or in other domains. Postulate 1: Existence (non-existence) of objects of a primary class (in a room) provides support for the existence (non-existence) of other objects of this class (in space). The level of support is proportional to the number of objects inspired by Fechner's law (psychophysics) that the subjective sensitivity is proportional to the perception of stimuli (logic =)."}, {"heading": "3.4 Using Positive and Negative Observations", "text": "Although it is a significant challenge to draw conclusions using a lack of evidence, negative observations can be used to identify contingencies that are not modeled by the POMDPs (e.g., to support the early completion of tasks that cannot be completed). For example, if observing the target or other related objects in multiple rooms cannot be used to reflect on the absence of the object in the domain; this is not calculated in the standard POMDP model, and the introduction of a (special) end state in the POMDPs will invalidate the invariance properties used for computational efficiency. This section describes our approach to exploiting all observations. Let D be the event that the target is detected is detected; and FoV the event that target is in the robot's field of view."}, {"heading": "3.5 Belief Merging and Information Acquisition", "text": "Belief in the robot summarizes all observations that are directly relevant to the current task, but these observations are obtained with varying degrees of uncertainty. Our previous work has heuristically generated a belief distribution of answer sentences and averaged (weighted) with POMDP beliefs [1]. In this paper supports the use of the Dirichlet distribution to extract previous beliefs from answer sentences based on Bayesian beliefs: p \u2032 (Ek) = p (Ek) \u00b7 p (Ei | D) \u00b7 p (Ei) (13), where p (Ek) is the probability that the target is based in space k, based on POMDP beliefs. Our architecture allows the robot to acquire initial domain knowledge by degrading online repositories and by minimal human input. This incomplete (and possibly contradictory) knowledge is reworked through sensor input and highly human feedback."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results", "text": "The following hypotheses were experimentally evaluated: (H1) The combination of ASP and POMDP improves the accuracy and time of target localization compared to individual algorithms; (H2) the entropy-based strategy enables a robot to make optimal use of human feedback; and (H3) the use of positive and negative observations helps robots identify tasks that are suitable for premature termination. (H2) In evaluating hypotheses H1 and H2, the use of positive and negative observations (Section 3.4) is not included. In addition, our approach to generating and merging ASP and POMDP beliefs with: (a) the non-use of previous beliefs from the ASP KB; (b) the use of relative confidence factors to merge beliefs [1]; and (c) the use of weights from the divergent distribution - likely previous beliefs from the ASP KB - and POMDP - to reconcile the overtones in previous beliefs."}, {"heading": "4.1 Simulation Experiments", "text": "To evaluate the H1 hypothesis, we measured the target accuracy and the time in which the robot is used: (a) ASP only; (b) POMDPs only; and (c) ASP and POMDPs. (c) The robot has first of all the knowledge of the target persons, i.e. it can tell if a particular object exists in a certain room, but not the position of the object in the room. (a) It shows that the robot has the entire domain knowledge (except the target), i.e. it can correctly infer the space that contains the object. (c) The accuracy decreases when the domain knowledge decreases, e.g. with 50% of the domain knowledge, the robot can correctly identify the target position (space)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Robot Experiments", "text": "The robot learns (and revises) a domain card with offices, corridors, laboratories and public areas, e.g. Figure 7 (a), and locates the desired targets - Figure 7 (b). All algorithms have been implemented in the Robot Operating System (ROS). We compared our architecture with two basic strategies: (a) only POMDP beliefs; and (b) a heuristic policy that makes greedy opportunities for action. The robot successfully localized targets in all experimental trials - there was no time limit. Since target localization times vary depending on the starting position of the robot and the targets, we report target localization times of the basic strategies as a factor of the target localization time achieved with our architecture. Over 30 studies with each target object, the localization time with only POMDP convictions is 1.6 times (averaged over all targets) compared with our architecture."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "The experimental results in the context of a mobile robot that locates targets in indoor (office) areas indicate that the architecture enables robots to (a) represent, revise, and argue incomplete domain knowledge from sensor input and human feedback; (b) generate and fuse ASP-based beliefs with POMDP beliefs to adapt sensor and navigation to the task at hand; and (c) make full use of any observations of early completion of tasks that cannot be completed. Future work will further explore ASP's planning capabilities, consider more complex application domains, and explore the closer coupling of explanatory programming and probabilistic reasoning with the long-term goal of reliable and efficient collaboration between humans and robots in real-world applications."}], "references": [{"title": "ASP+POMDP: Integrating Non-monotonic Logical Reasoning and Probabilistic Planning on Robots", "author": ["S.
