CELLULAR PSO", "text": "The original PSO, introduced in the 1990s, was based on swarm behavior. In PSO, each solution is considered to be a particle representing a single bird in a flock. First, the particles are created and randomly positioned within the search space. Afterwards, each particle is iteratively updated according to the best observed value for personal and global fitness to achieve optimal fitness [12]. In the cellular PSO, the search space is divided and a cellular automaton (CA) is built into the divided space to maintain diversity and allow an appropriate search in space. Each cell in the CA searches and controls its corresponding region according to some predefined rules. Each particle is assigned to a cell based on its position in the search process, each cell and its neighbors executed separately using the PSO method, which provides sufficient diversity and the ability to follow several optimal solutions."}, {"heading": "III.
