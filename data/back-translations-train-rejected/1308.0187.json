When combined with the use of the inclusion exclusion format (see Smith, Gogate: \"The Inclusion-Exculsion Rule and its Application to the Junction Tree Algorithm\") which allows for fast computation of many marginals of a potential, the junction tree algorithm can be made significantly faster in many cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 16:56:59 GMT  (5kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0187v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 23 Aug 2013 19:58:11 GMT  (6kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0187v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 12 Sep 2013 18:52:49 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0187v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 27 Oct 2013 11:00:46 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0187v4", null], ["v5", "Mon, 11 Nov 2013 20:51:14 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0187v5", null], ["v6", "Fri, 15 Nov 2013 20:55:47 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0187v6", null], ["v7", "Mon, 25 Nov 2013 20:30:34 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0187v7", null], ["v8", "Thu, 13 Mar 2014 14:52:01 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0187v8", null], ["v9", "Tue, 23 Dec 2014 20:21:52 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0187v9", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["stephen pasteris"], "accepted": false, "id": "1308.0187"}, "pdf": {"name": "1308.0187.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Fast Product Format", "authors": ["Stephen Pasteris"], "emails": ["s.pasteris@cs.ucl.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "We assume that we both need a time of satisfaction (the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the"}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "Preliminaries: Given a set X we define P(X) to be the power set of X (that is, the set of subsets of X) and define |X | to be the cardinality of X (that is, the number of elements in X). A collection is a set that may contain duplicate elements (we use the subset symbol, S \u2286 X , to denote that every element in the collection S is also contained in the set X). This paper assumes we have a alebian group G who\u2019s identity is denoted 1. Given an element a \u2208 G we define a to be the inverse element of a. Given elements a, b \u2208 G we define ab to be the product of a and b in G. Given a finite collection S \u2286 G we define \u220f", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
