Nevertheless, low employment rates show the lack of employment opportunities for more than 785 million people with disabilities, including 110 million with severe deficits, due to factors such as prejudice and the lack of adequate technical preparation (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2003), which leads to the creation of programmes for the social inclusion of people with disabilities. Some of them concern their qualifications (World Health Organisation, 2011), while others ensure the opportunities through quota laws (Lobato, 2009) that countries such as Spain, Japan and Switzerland combine these two forms by creating disabled people (SWDs) (Chaves, 2009), which mainly employ people with disabilities and provide training opportunities."}, {"heading": "1.1 Problem Definition", "text": "Let S be a series of stations, W a group of workers, | W | = | S |, and T a series of tasks. Each work station S is placed along a conveyor belt and assigned exactly one worker W \u00b2 W, who is responsible for performing a subset of tasks xw \u00b2 T. The tasks are partially ordered, and we assume that the partial order is given to the tasks by a transitively reduced steered acyclic graph G (T, E), so that for an arc (t, t \u00b2) no task t \u00b2 precedes the task. Therefore, the station executing the task cannot be placed later than task t \u00b2 on the conveyor belt. The execution time of task t for the worker w is ptw. If a worker w cannot perform a task t \u00b2, ptw is set to task t \u00b2.

Therefore, our model uses variables xwt such that xwt = 1, if task t-T was assigned to the worker w-W, and dvw such that dvw = 1, if the worker v-W must precede the worker w-W. In this way, we obtain a model M2 as follows: Minimize task C, (1) subject to task t-Aw-W-W, w-W-W, w-W-W, (2) reserved task w-W-T, (3) dvw-xvt + xwt-T-worker, (t-T) reserved task E, v-Aw-W, w-W-W, w-W-W, W-W-W, W (4) reserved task W-W-d-W-D"}, {"heading": "2.2 Continuity constraints", "text": "We can strengthen the above model by the following observation: If two tasks i and k are assigned to the same worker w, then all tasks j, which are simultaneously successors of i and predecessors of k, should also be assigned w.

It repeatedly selects an available task for each station until no such task has a execution time less than the idle time of the current station. A task is available if all of its predecessors have already been assigned. If there are several available tasks defined by a priority rule, the task is assigned next. It succeeds when an assignment with a maximum of the available number of stations is found. Station-based procedures can also be applied backwards by assigning tasks whose successors have already been assigned. To do this, it is sufficient to apply a procedure to an instance with reversed dependencies. For ALWABP, we must additionally decide which worker is assigned to the current station. This is achieved by applying the task assignment method to all workers who have not yet been assigned."}, {"heading": "4.2 The interval search method IPBS", "text": "A common strategy is to gradually reduce them by one and try to find a better workable solution through a heuristic algorithm. However, it is known that heuristic mapping methods are not monotonous, i.e. they can find a workable solution for a cycle time but not for longer cycle times. To overcome this, we propose to modify the upper bound search to examine an interval of cycle times ending at the current upper limit.

It focuses on critical stations whose utilization corresponds to the cycle time of the current assignment. It attempts to remove tasks from a critical station in order to reduce the cycle time. As there may be several critical stations, a train is considered successful if it reduces the number of critical stations. Local search applies the following four types of trains until the assignment can no longer be improved. 1. A shift of a task from one critical station to another station. 2. An exchange of two tasks. At least one of the tasks must be on a critical station. 3. A sequence of two shift trains. Here, the first shift train may produce a worse result than the original assignment. 4. An exchange of workers between two stations without assignment of tasks."}, {"heading": "5 Task-oriented branch-and-bound algorithm", "text": "In this case, however, it is a kind of unforeseen state in which most of them feel able to retaliate, \"he said.\" It's not as if they have been able to retaliate, \"he said.\" But it's not as if they have been able to retaliate. \""}, {"heading": "5.1 Valid assignments", "text": "The algorithm maintains a directed graph H on the group of workers to efficiently verify that the priority constraints are met.

Graph H also contains all resulting transitive edges. To assign tasks valid, H must be acylic. If this is the case, each topological assignment defines a valid assignment of workers to stations. The process assignment IsValid (t, w) confirms in time O (| T | W |), if assignment of task t to worker w would insert an arc in H whose reverse arc already exists. Before branching to a new node, the process setting (t, w) that inserts such arcs into H and forms the new transitive closure in time (T | W) is specified."}, {"heading": "5.2 Reduction rules", "text": "After a task t has been assigned to a worker w, and before branching out, we apply several more expensive reduction rules to strengthen the lower limits (line 6).

An application of (10) can assign w more tasks, and the application of (11) can exclude that some tasks w are assigned (whose execution time is set to pt \u2032 w = \u221e). Finally, we can exclude assignment of tasks (t, \"w\") if the total execution time ptw \"+ pt\" w \"u\" i (t, \"t\") puw of tasks i (t \"t\") = (P \"t\" F \"t\" t \") is more or equal to the current limit.

(1997), we solve the all-capacity knapsack problem only once by dynamic programming and use the resulting table during the binary search. The knapsack problems that occur in the calculation of L2 and L2 by substance optimization are similarly solved. Figure 2 shows the average relative deviation in percent from the best known value and the average computing time over all 320 instances. Looking at the models, the lower limit of M2 is significantly better than that of M1, and the addition of continuity constraints improves the relative deviation by a further 10%, with the lower limit of M2 resulting in the lower limit of M2."}, {"heading": "6.3 Comparison of MIP models", "text": "Next, we compare the performance of the new MIP models with that of the M1 model.

Overall, Model M2 requires significantly more nodes than M1 and is a factor of about two slower. It executes more nodes per second and has a better lower limit, but CPLEX is able to apply more cuts to Model M1 at root, so that on average Model M2 has no advantage over the tested instances. However, if the continuity restrictions are applied, Model M3 requires significantly less nodes and time compared to Model M1 (confirmed by a ranking test signed by Wilcoxon with p < 0.01)."}, {"heading": "6.4 Results for the IPBS heuristic", "text": "This year, it is so far that it will only take a few days before it is so far, until it is so far that an agreement can be reached."}, {"heading": "6.5 Results for the branch-and-bound algorithm", "text": "We evaluated the branch-and-soil algorithm on the same 320 test instances.

The proposed heuristic IPBS is competitive with the current best methods, often outperforms them in computation time and quality of solution, and shows robust performance over the entire set of 320 test cases. Finally, the industry-based method can solve cases with a low number of tasks in a few seconds and was able to optimally solve 95 of the 160 cases with a high number of tasks for the first time.

However, in sheltered work centres for disabled this assumption is not valid: some workers may execute some tasks considerably slower or even be incapable of executing them. Worker heterogeneity leads to a problem called the assembly line worker assignment and balancing problem (ALWABP). For a fixed number of workers the problem is to maximize the production rate of an assembly line by assigning workers to stations and tasks to workers, while satisfying precedence constraints between the tasks. This paper introduces new heuristic and exact methods to solve this problem. We present a new MIP model, propose a novel heuristic algorithm based on beam search, as well as a task-oriented branch-and-bound procedure which uses new reduction rules and lower bounds for solving the problem. Extensive computational tests on a large set of instances show that these methods are effective and improve over existing ones.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
