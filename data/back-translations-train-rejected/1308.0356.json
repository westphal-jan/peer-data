The proposed system is included two main steps. In the first one, the human expert's knowledge is designed as decision trees. The second step is included an expert system which is evaluated using extracted rules of these decision trees. Also, to improve the quality of the proposed system, a majority voting algorithm is proposed as post processing step to choose the best lecturer which satisfied more expert's decision trees for each course. The results are shown that the designed system average accuracy is 78.88. Low computational complexity, simplicity to program and are some of other advantages of the proposed system.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Aug 2013 21:04:07 GMT  (635kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0356v1", "4 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["shervan fekri-ershad", "hadi tajalizadeh", "shahram jafari"], "accepted": false, "id": "1308.0356"}, "pdf": {"name": "1308.0356.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Design and Development of an Expert System to Help Head of University Departments", "authors": ["Shervan Fekri-Ershad", "Hadi Tajalizadeh", "Shahram Jafari"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Each university department employs lecturers based on some standard factors such as experience, evidence, qualifications and so on. In this regard, in order to help the leaders, some automated systems have been proposed so far with machine learning methods, decision support systems (DSS) and so on. According to the advantages and disadvantages of previous methods, a fully automated system with expert systems is designed in this paper. The proposed system comprises two main steps. In the first step, the knowledge of the human expert is conceived as decision trees. In the second step, an expert system is included, which is evaluated according to the extracted rules of these decision trees. Also, in order to improve the quality of the proposed system, a majority selection algorithm is proposed as a follow-up step to select the best lecturer, who will satisfy more expert decision trees for each course.The results are shown that the designed system is average accuracy 78.88.
