For example, to enable effective vehicle routing, weighted-graph models of transportation networks are used, where the weight of an edge captures some cost associated with traversing the edge, e.g., greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or travel time. It is a precondition to using a graph model for routing that all edges have weights. Weights that capture travel times and GHG emissions can be extracted from GPS trajectory data collected from the network. However, GPS trajectory data typically lack the coverage needed to assign weights to all edges. This paper formulates and addresses the problem of annotating all edges in a road network with travel cost based weights from a set of trips in the network that cover only a small fraction of the edges, each with an associated ground-truth travel cost. A general framework is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, the problem is modeled as a regression problem and solved by minimizing a judiciously designed objective function that takes into account the topology of the road network. In particular, the use of weighted PageRank values of edges is explored for assigning appropriate weights to all edges, and the property of directional adjacency of edges is also taken into account to assign weights. Empirical studies with weights capturing travel time and GHG emissions on two road networks (Skagen, Denmark, and North Jutland, Denmark) offer insight into the design properties of the proposed techniques and offer evidence that the techniques are effective.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Aug 2013 12:56:19 GMT  (905kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0484v1", "This is an extended version of \"Using Incomplete Information for Complete Weight Annotation of Road Networks,\" which is accepted for publication in IEEE TKDE"], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Aug 2013 20:00:22 GMT  (555kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0484v2", "This is an extended version of \"Using Incomplete Information for Complete Weight Annotation of Road Networks,\" which is accepted for publication in IEEE TKDE"]], "COMMENTS": "This is an extended version of \"Using Incomplete Information for Complete Weight Annotation of Road Networks,\" which is accepted for publication in IEEE TKDE", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DB", "authors": ["bin yang", "manohar kaul", "christian s jensen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1308.0484"}, "pdf": {"name": "1308.0484.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Using Incomplete Information for Complete Weight Annotation of Road Networks\u2014 Extended Version", "authors": ["Bin Yang", "Manohar Kaul", "Christian S.

However, it is of interest to expand the proposed methods to take additional information into account when available. In order to achieve a general applicability of the paper methods, we minimize the requirements of the input graph G \u2032: both PRTC and DATC rely exclusively on the topology of a road network, which can be easily obtained from any digital map. Finally, the problem of weight annotation is solved by solving a system of linear equations, i.e. Equation 12. Alternative edge similarity metrics (i.e. taking into account the shapes and capacities of edges) can be easily integrated into the linear system by adding new terms of shape, the LM."}, {"heading": "5 EXPERIMENTAL STUDY", "text": "We are investigating the effectiveness of the proposed method for indicating the weight of road networks with both travel time (TTWA) and greenhouse gas emissions (GEWA)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "It is only a matter of time before that happens, that it happens."}, {"heading": "5.2 Experimental Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Effectiveness Measurements", "text": "In order to gain insight into the accuracy of the costs obtained based on the actual costs, we divide the set of (travel, cost) emissions (travel, cost) pairs into a training set TCtrain and a test set TCtest.

In the following experiments, we randomly select 50% of the pairs for training and the remaining 50% for testing, unless it is explicitly stated otherwise. Since there are no time-dependent weights for the two road networks, the accuracy of the weights obtained can only be evaluated using the TCtest set TCtest.

NJ has much higher SSL values than SK because there are many more test drives. However, for both road networks, the weights annotated with objective function F4 are the least SSL values. We also observe that the PageRank-based topological restrictions work more effectively on NJ than on SK. This is because Scagen is a small town where few street segments have a similar topology (e.g., similarly weighted PageRank values). In the NJ network, the topological restriction is based on better accuracy as more road segments have similarly weighted PageRank values.

The coverage when using the various objective functions is exactly the same as that in Table 6.

To observe the accuracy of the weight specification for various sizes of the TCtrain, we use 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% of the TCtrain, respectively, to comment on the weights. Results are shown in Figure 11.For the travel time, when only 20% of the TCtrain is used, the accuracy of our method is worse than that of the base method with \u03bb = 1, as the base method has a rough estimate of the cost of all edges, while the 20% of the TCtrain only covers 16.3% of the edges on the road network. Although our method propagates weights to edges not covered by the training trips, the accuracy suffers if the initial coverage of the training method is twice as high as the 40% when the emissions are almost lower."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK", "text": "Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport requires an effective eco-routing method, and road network diagrams in which all edges are provided with accurate weights that capture environmental costs, such as fuel consumption or greenhouse gas emissions, are required for an eco-routing method. However, such weights are not always readily available for a road network. This paper proposes a general framework that takes a measurement of (travel, cost) pairs as a starting point and assigns travel cost-based weights to a chart that represents a road network in which travel cost-based weights can reflect GHG emissions, fuel consumption or travel time. Using this framework, edge weights that capture environmental impacts can be calculated for the entire road network, enabling eco-routing. To the best of knowledge, this is the first work that provides a general framework for allocating travel cost-based edge weights based on a set of (cost - two directions) of future work."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work was supported by the Reduction Project, which is funded by the European Commission as FP7ICT-2011-7 STREP Project No. 288254."}], "references": [{"title": "Using Incomplete Information for Complete Weight Annotation of Road Networks", "author": ["B.

2012, "abstractText": "We are witnessing increasing interests in the effective use of road networks. For example, to enable effective vehicle routing, weighted-graph models of transportation networks are used, where the weight of an edge captures some cost associated with traversing the edge, e.g., greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or travel time. It is a precondition to using a graph model for routing that all edges have weights. Weights that capture travel times and GHG emissions can be extracted from GPS trajectory data collected from the network. However, GPS trajectory data typically lack the coverage needed to assign weights to all edges. This paper formulates and addresses the problem of annotating all edges in a road network with travel cost based weights from a set of trips in the network that cover only a small fraction of the edges, each with an associated ground-truth travel cost. A general framework is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, the problem is modeled as a regression problem and solved by minimizing a judiciously designed objective function that takes into account the topology of the road network. In particular, the use of weighted PageRank values of edges is explored for assigning appropriate weights to all edges, and the property of directional adjacency of edges is also taken into account to assign weights. Empirical studies with weights capturing travel time and GHG emissions on two road networks (Skagen, Denmark, and North Jutland, Denmark) offer insight into the design properties of the proposed techniques and offer evidence that the techniques are effective.
