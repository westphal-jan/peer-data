Enriching the intermediate ontology : A case study", "text": "In this section, we show the enriching process of intermediate ontology created from text by an example. In [13], binary relationships are introduced and a notation is chosen to describe the relationships. We use the same notation throughout the paper. Suppose that a relationship r. Each relationship has a domain that is shown with domain (r) and reach (r). For example, we assume that a geographic ontology that includes concepts like river, city, country, geographical entity (in a nutshell GE), etc., a relationship like: \"pass _ through (r: river, range: GE)\" means that an entity of the type flow can pass through an entity of the type GE. \"Consider now the ontology that is shown in Fig. 1. We call the series of instances in ontology as B. = {,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, we should now have the cartesian (following) as appropriate (B)."}, {"heading": "LIMITATIONS OF THE NAMED ENTITIES", "text": "Many methods of relation extraction limit the simultaneous occurrence of words within a sentence, and the non-ferrous pairs that occur in a sentence are assumed to occur simultaneously; however, there is no limit to the simultaneous occurrence of words in the real world. However, the larger the space we consider for the simultaneous occurrence of two words, the more time we need to search for the relationships of words, because the number of non-ferrous pairs is increasing. Many of such relationships may not be useful in our application, but we believe that the simultaneous occurrence of two words in a sentence can lead to some useful information under this two-component-in-text knowledge, as we have described in the related scenario. In our method of enriching intermedia ontology, we extract hidden claimed knowledge from text by using linked data."}, {"heading": "AND ENRICHING DATASETS OF LINKED DATA", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are in the United States are able to understand the world and what they are doing.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extract hidden or implicit information from texts from which new ontological relationships can be derived. We have shown that the use of linked data can improve the problem of context awareness in the case of an automatic ontological learning process. In this context, we have proposed an algorithm to enrich the non-taxonomic relationships in texts. We have shown that this algorithm can find new non-taxonomic relationships."}], "references": [{"title": "Semantic Text Mining with Linked Data", "author": ["Z. Huang", "H. Chen", "T. Yu", "H.
