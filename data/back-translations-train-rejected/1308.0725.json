Fundamentals of Rough Set on Fuzzy Approximation Spaces", "text": "Rough set of Pawlak [23, 24] was developed as an alternative data analysis tool, but later developed into a very important aspect in the fields of artificial intelligence, knowledge-gathering, decision-making, expert systems, etc. It can also deal with inaccurate, uncertain, and vague data sets [18]. The basic philosophy of the rough theorem is based on indisputability relationship based on a universe U. But indisputability relationship based on an equivalence relationship is not always relevant to real life scenarios. Therefore, it was necessary to make relationships less stringent by excluding one or more requirements of the equivalence relationship and making them more realistic. A blurred relationship is more generalized than binary relationship based on a set U. Fuzzy proximity relation on a universal set U."}, {"heading": "2.1. Almost Indiscernibility Relation", "text": "An information system provides all available information and knowledge about the objects under certain conditions. Objects are perceived only by using a finite number of properties, without taking into account any semantic relationship between attribute values of a particular attribute. Thus, a trivial equality relationship to values of attributes was used to perform quantitative analyses, as discussed in standard coarse quantity theory [22]. But attribute values are usually not exactly identical, but almost identical in real life situations. So Pawlak's idea of an indisputability relationship is generalized to an almost indisputability relationship, which is the reason for a rough definition of a blurred approximation space as discussed in the previous paragraph.Let U be the universe and A be a set of attributes. With each attribute an A associates a set of values aV, which is referred to as domain a. The pair (sew space S is discussed in the preceding section B)."}, {"heading": "2.2. Ordered Information System", "text": "The basis of data mining is to gain knowledge by classifying objects. In this section we have talked about an information system and the almostindiscernibility relationship used in classification, but in real situations we face many problems that are not simply classification. One such kind of problem is the theory formation of objects and their attribute values from certain points of view. An information system is defined as a system of four (,,,) a aI U A V f, where U is a finite, not empty set of objects, A is a finite set of attributes, aV is a non-empty set of values for an A,: a af U V is an information function. Consider the example information system given in Table 1 A = {Attribute (w), Weight (w), Battery life (bl), Battery replace ability (br), HDDspeed (hs), Optical drive od ()."}, {"heading": "3. Proposed Evaluation Index System", "text": "In this section, we propose an evaluation index system that can be used to access the performance evaluation of all educational institutions in the universe for each level proposed in the model. There are many hierarchical maturity models that are developed and analyzed by different researchers. [1, 5, 15] Some of these models are used to achieve the rank of institutions, but they lack an institutional performance evaluation. Many authors proposed a list of quantitative and qualitative matrices that can be used to access the rank of all institutions, such as intellectual capital, infrastructure facilities, placement performance, student satisfaction, internationality, etc. The proposed evaluation index system, as shown in Figure 1, is divided into three layers, such as objective layer, standard layer, and metric layer. The standard layer contains four primary evaluation indices, such as Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4.Literature and numerical values based on different levels were collected and studied and form parameters that form our metric analysis for the universe."}, {"heading": "3.1. Determination of Weighting Coefficients", "text": "Let U be a universe, and let 1 2 3 {,,,} m A a a a a be the attribute set. Let B A. Let B R be a blurred proximity relationship defined by U.

This approach consists of a three-tiered evaluation index system and uses rough measurements of the blurred approximation space with arrangement and information tropie to examine the data of the evaluation index. We achieve performance evaluation for educational institutions through the proposed approach.
