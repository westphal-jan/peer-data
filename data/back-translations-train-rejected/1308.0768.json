Typically, DF systems require a large number of transmitters and receivers to achieve acceptable accuracy, which is not available in many scenarios such as homes and small businesses. In this paper, we introduce MonoStream as an accurate single-stream DF localization system that leverages the rich Channel State Information (CSI) as well as MIMO information from the physical layer to provide accurate DF localization with only one stream. To boost its accuracy and attain low computational requirements, MonoStream models the DF localization problem as an object recognition problem and uses a novel set of CSI-context features and techniques with proven accuracy and efficiency. Experimental evaluation in two typical testbeds, with a side-by-side comparison with the state-of-the-art, shows that MonoStream can achieve an accuracy of 0.95m with at least 26% enhancement in median distance error using a single stream only. This enhancement in accuracy comes with an efficient execution of less than 23ms per location update on a typical laptop. This highlights the potential of MonoStream usage for real-time DF tracking applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 Aug 2013 02:07:54 GMT  (4235kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0768v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["ibrahim sabek", "moustafa youssef"], "accepted": false, "id": "1308.0768"}, "pdf": {"name": "1308.0768.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "MonoStream: A Minimal-Hardware High Accuracy Device-free WLAN Localization System", "authors": ["Ibrahim Sabek", "Moustafa Youssef"], "emails": ["ibrahim.sabek@alexu.edu.eg", "moustafa.youssef@ejust.edu.eg"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In this article, we introduce MonoStream as an accurate DF localization system that utilizes the rich Channel State Information (CSI) and MIMO information at the physical level to enable precise DF localization with only one stream.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year it is as far as never before in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany."}, {"heading": "2. BACKGROUND AND CSI CHARACTERIZATION", "text": "In this section, we briefly present the OFDM modulation and MIMO technologies, as well as the basic information we rely on to build the core system blocks."}, {"heading": "2.1 Channel State Information (CSI) and MIMO Technology", "text": "Many IEEE 802.11 standards (e.g. a / g / n) use OFDM modulation, which transmits signals across multiple orthogonal frequencies, so-called sub-carriers. Each signal transmitted to a sub-carrier has a different signal strength and phase. Typical wireless cards provide only a single received signal strength value (RSS), which represents the superposition of information from all sub-carriers. Recently, some IEEE 802.11n standards-based cards on the market have detailed size and phase information about the different sub-carriers, which are presented as channel state information (CSI). In particular, the Intel 5300 card reports on the CSI for 30 groups of sub-carriers, which corresponds to about one group for each 2 sub-carriers for the 20MHz channels operating at the 2.4GHz frequency [7]."}, {"heading": "2.2 CSI Observations", "text": "In this section, we will show some of our observations of the CSI on which we base the system components. For space reasons, we will focus on the size of the received signal strength (RSS) in this paper and leave the phase information to a future paper. Figure 2 shows the CSI size (profile) for one or more virtual connections, i.e. a pair of antennas consisting of transmitter and receiver, via different packets (each packet is represented by a line) for the 30 subcarriers. The figure shows that the CSI values for each stream form one or more clusters. Figure 3 shows the CSI profile for the silence as well as the presence of humans in two separate locations for a virtual link. The figure shows that the CSI size information can be used to identify human presence and determine its location. Figure 4 shows the CSI profile for two adjacent locations (separated by 1 meter) for a virtual connection."}, {"heading": "3. THE MONOSTREAM SYSTEM", "text": "In this section we explain the details of MonoStream. We start with an overview of the system architecture, followed by the system model, the structure and the system details."}, {"heading": "3.1 Overview", "text": "Figure 5 shows the system architecture. We have two operating phases: offline and online. During the offline phase, a person stands in different places of interest. For each location, CSI values for all transmitter-receiver pairs (i.e. virtual links) are recorded and used to extract characteristics and train a number of classifiers. During the online phase, the system uses the collected CSI positive information to estimate the unknown location of the person. The system is implemented through a series of modules: The CSI preprocessor extracts CSI orders of magnitudes from sent packages for each virtual link and filters out-of-value Positive Positive Positive Positive Positive Positive Positive Positive Positive. The CSI context filter builder constructs the filters (during the offline phase) that are used by the Features Extraction Module to extract the characteristics from the CSI information Positive Positive Positive Positive Positive Positive Positive Positive Positive Positive Positive. These characteristics are used by the Joint Booster Classifier Trainer during the offline phase to train the Positive Positive Positive Classifier during the classification of each location."}, {"heading": "3.2 System Model", "text": "Suppose an area of interest divided into L-fingerprints, i.e. training, locations. This area is covered by only one AP with n MIMO antennas and one MP (e.g. a laptop) with a radio card with m MIMO antennas. This results in n.m virtual connections between transmitter and receiver. Using the OFDM modulation, each transmitted packet with f-sub-carriers is transmitted to each of the n-antennas. 11This results in a total n.m.f virtual streams between each physical transmitter-receiver pair, compared with only streaming using traditional RSS-based techniques [16, 17]. During the training phase, each site l has a human being and at the CSI a set of packets sent by the AP are recorded at the MP. The CSI information of all packets corresponding to the site l is represented by a matrix (Figure 6) of size n.m, the input of which (the CSi, the profile of the CSi) is a high-precision pair of antennas an image (I)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Features and Context Filters", "text": "To detect small discrepancies in the CSI profiles between adjacent sites, MonStream borrows techniques from the field of object detection [10, 18], where the CSI profile of a particular virtual link is treated as an image in a particular location. In particular, to reduce the complexity of these CSI profile images and increase discrimination between adjacent locations, we use a context filter on a CSI profile as a rectangular mask whose width is determined by the circumference of the captured subcarriers; and a height determined by the range of captured CSI magnitudes (Figure 7). For example, we can define a context filter covering subcarriers from 3 to 12, and CSI magnitudes from 32 to 55. A series of d context filters T = {ti}; i = 1,..., d is then defined by selecting a context filter covering subcarriers from 3 to 12, and CSI magnitudes from 5 to 532."}, {"heading": "3.4 Classifier Training Module", "text": "Once the features are extracted, the goal of the Classifier Training Module is to train a binary classifier for each location to distinguish it from all other fingerprint locations based on the training data. To balance computational efficiency and accuracy, we use an AdaBoost-based classifier [5, 12, 19]. AdaBoost is an iterative technique that adds a new simple weak classifier to each classifier in each iteration, with each round assigning higher weights to samples wrongly classified from previous rounds, so that the current weak classifier focuses on their disambiguization. A weight is assigned to each classifier, and the final classifier is defined as a linear combination of classifiers from each iteration. AdaBoost can be considered a feature selection technique that selects the most diverse g characteristics, with g reducing the number of iterations to reduce the total number of features, thus further reducing the number of features."}, {"heading": "3.5 Location Estimator", "text": "The purpose of this module is to estimate the actual user location from a obtained CSI vector / profile S. Starting with the assumption that the user is at one of the discrete fingerprint locations, we generalize this to any position in the next subsection.3.5.1 Discrete space estimator The features extracted from the CSI vector are processed by the Joint Boosting Classifiers to generate the binary decision for each location and the trust associated with it. For a classifier for the fingerprint location l, we let dl be 1 if the classifier recognizes that a person is at that location, and -1 otherwise. In addition, we let cl merge the reliability of that classifier. To merge the output of the different classifiers, we take a probable approach where we want to find the location l \u00b2 l in the fingerprint L that maximizes the probability L."}, {"heading": "3.6 Continuous-space estimator", "text": "The previous estimator always returns one of the fingerprint locations, even if the company is in a location that does not match one of the fingerprint locations. To further increase accuracy, the continuous estimator uses a method of spatial averaging. The spatial averaging method estimates the location as the weighted average of the most likely k locations, with each location weighted by its probability (Eq.4), which is normalized by the sum of all probabilities. Note that MonoStream with the continuous estimator can achieve an accuracy better than the distance of the fingerprint grid."}, {"heading": "4. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION", "text": "In this section, we analyze the performance of MonoStream and compare it with modern DF WLAN localization systems [17, 16, 1]. We begin by describing the setup and data collection, and then analyze the effects of various parameters on system performance. We conclude the section with a comparison with the current state of the art."}, {"heading": "4.1 Testbeds and Data Collection", "text": "We conducted two experiments with different test beds (Figure 8): the first test bed covers a typical apartment of about 100 m2, while the second test bed is a residential apartment of 114 m2, both test beds are equipped with typical furniture, and the area was covered by a single Cisco Linksys X2000 AP and a Dell Adamo XPS laptop as MP. The laptop has an Intel 5300 card that can provide CSI information [7]. The fingerprint is designed for 35 (25) different locations for the first (second) test bed, evenly distributed across the test bed area. An independent test set of 17 locations is randomly selected between the training locations at different times of the day, using different people from the training set. Table 1 shows the default values for the different parameters. For run-time estimation, all the experiments were performed on a Dell Latitude E6510 with an Intel Core i7 CPU drive with 2.7 GHz storage space and second RAM space."}, {"heading": "4.2 Effect of Different Parameters", "text": "4.2.1 Effect of the number of receiver antennas (m) Figure 9 shows the effect of changing the antenna combinations on the mean distance error. The figure shows that different combinations lead to different accuracy, due to the noisy radio channels and the different multipath effects caused by the packets on the different antennas. This means that using more antennas does not necessarily lead to better accuracy. The good news is that the SNR connected to the antennas can be used to determine the best combination. For the rest of this section, we use an-tennas a and c (i.e. m = 2) as they lead to the best accuracy."}, {"heading": "4.3 Comparison with the State-of-the-Art", "text": "Figure 15a compares the CDF distance error for the MonoStream system with the deterministic [17] and probabilistic Nuzzer [16] traditional DF system 4, which was designed for multiple streams, and the MonoPhy system [1], which was designed for a single stream based on a Gaussian blending approach. Table 2 summarizes the results, showing that MonoStream has the best accuracy with an improvement of at least 26.3% in mean distance error compared to the best modern technology in a single stream environment. Figure 15b shows the runtime of the different technology. Figure 2 shows that the accuracy advantage of MonoStream does not compromise efficiency; only 23 ms are required per site update, showing that MonoStream can be executed in real time. 4These techniques do not use the CSI information, but rather the combined RSS performance only as provided by the MAC-Layer.200 12600 3600 67400 400 inect 500."}, {"heading": "5. RELATED WORK", "text": "In radar-based systems, the pulses of radio waves are transmitted to the area of interest and objects can be tracked based on the measurement of the received reflections. However, several approaches have been presented in this class, including ultra-wideband (UWB) systems, Doppler radar systems [11] and MIMO radar systems [6]. On the other hand, camera-based tracking systems are based on the analysis of a set of captured images to estimate the current locations of objects of interest [13, 9]. Sensor-based systems use specially installed sensor nodes to cover the area of interest. For example [23], radiotomographic techniques apply to the measurements of a dense set of sensors to provide precise DF tracking. All of these technologies share the requirement of specialized hardware to perform DF tracking, which reduces their scalability in terms of cost and coverage."}, {"heading": "6. DISCUSSION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Accuracy", "text": "The accuracy of MonoStream is based on three factors: (1) harnessing the rich CSI information; (2) scanning a large number of features that capture small discrepancies between adjacent sites; and (3) using a common boosting technique that selects the combined best features across all sites, avoiding excessive training; these factors make it possible to tolerate a small number of streams and achieve high accuracy."}, {"heading": "6.2 Efficiency", "text": "Increasing the accuracy of MonoStream is not accompanied by increased complexity. MonoStream employs a number of techniques to increase its efficiency and to trade accuracy with efficiency as quantified in the evaluation section, including: (1) the use of easy-to-calculate hair-like features, (2) the use of decision stubs that can be calculated with only a comparative check, and (3) the application of a common boosting approach that selects the best features, reduces training effort and the feature space, which is reflected in the reduction of the running time of the algorithm. Theoretically, the training complexity of the joint enhancement classifier is O (g. | L | 2) [19], while site complexity is O (g. | L |)."}, {"heading": "6.3 Multi-entity Tracking", "text": "Although all of the paper's findings are focused on a single company, extending it to multiple companies is straightforward. Current approaches to multi-company localization, e.g. [15], can be applied directly to the MonoStream system."}, {"heading": "6.4 Dynamic Changes in the Environment", "text": "Another important aspect of the practical use of MonoStream is the handling of dynamic changes in the environment, which may require recalibration of the area concerned. To capture these dynamic changes, various approaches can be applied, including dynamic updating of stored parameters, e.g. using anomaly detection techniques as in [8], and the use of CAD tools for DF systems, as in [3]."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION", "text": "We introduced the MonoStream system, which is based on a novel set of CSI context functions that can capture minimal discrepancies in CSI profiles between adjacent sites. Combined with an efficient AdaBoosting classifier, this allows us to accurately and efficiently locate DF with only a single transmitter and receiver. Experimental evaluations in two typical WiFi test environments show that MonoStream can achieve an average distance error of 0.95 m, which is at least 26% better than the most advanced techniques. This improvement in accuracy goes hand in hand with efficient execution of less than 23 ms per site update on a typical laptop. This underscores the promise of MonoStream for real-time DF tracking applications. Currently, we are expanding MonoStream in multiple directions, including integration of CSI phase information, multi-unit tracking, and entity identification."}, {"heading": "8.

"abstractText": "Device-free (DF) localization is an emerging technology that allows the detection and tracking of entities that do not carry any devices not participate actively in the localization process. Typically, DF systems require a large number of transmitters and receivers to achieve acceptable accuracy, which is not available in many scenarios such as homes and small businesses. In this paper, we introduce MonoStream as an accurate single-stream DF localization system that leverages the rich Channel State Information (CSI) as well as MIMO information from the physical layer to provide accurate DF localization with only one stream. To boost its accuracy and attain low computational requirements, MonoStream models the DF localization problem as an object recognition problem and uses a novel set of CSI-context features and techniques with proven accuracy and efficiency. Experimental evaluation in two typical testbeds, with a side-by-side comparison with the state-of-the-art, shows that MonoStream can achieve an accuracy of 0.95m with at least 26% enhancement in median distance error using a single stream only. This enhancement in accuracy comes with an efficient execution of less than 23ms per location update on a typical laptop. This highlights the potential of MonoStream usage for real-time DF tracking applications.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
