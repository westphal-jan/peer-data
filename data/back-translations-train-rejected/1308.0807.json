In [KIS11], the arguments are constructed from rules, and the reasoning framework appropriately chosen there is DeLP [GS04]. In the present approach, arguments are atomic (i.e., possible worlds), and the reasoning semantics are abstract. Relations between system Z and reasoning could only be established in a few specific cases in [KIS11], while we have a general argumentative characterization of system Z. In [Wey12], Weydert defines so-called ranking models for abstract reasoning frames. He associates with each argument a kind of conditionality that symbolizes the premise and claim of the argument, and interprets attacks in relation to (generalized) ordinary conditional functions. While such functions are also the basis for defining the system Z, the contributions we make to most of our time studies are abstract."}, {"heading": "8 Summary and conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we presented preparatory work for a new semantic conception of abstract argumentation frameworks: stratified labels. We analyzed some general characteristics of our approach and compared it with ranking functions for conditional thinking and similar approaches from argumentation theory. The key difference between our approach of stratified labels and other graduated approaches to semantics is that we measure the controversy of arguments, not their strength."}], "references": [{"title": "Ranking-based semantics for argumentation frameworks", "author": ["Leila Amgoud", "Jonathan Ben-Naim"], "venue": "In Proceedings Seventh International Conference on Scalable Uncertainty Management,", "citeRegEx": "Amgoud and Ben.Naim.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Amgoud and Ben.Naim.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "What does it take to enforce an argument? minimal change in abstract argumentation", "author": ["Ringo Baumann"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 20th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI\u201912),", "citeRegEx": "Baumann.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baumann.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "On extension counting problems in argumentation frameworks", "author": ["P.

Abstract argumentation frameworks only consider the interactions of arguments by means of an attack relation between arguments. Definition 1 (Abstract Argumentation Framework). An abstract argumentation framework AF is a tuple AF = (Arg,\u2192) where Arg is a set of arguments and \u2192 is a relation \u2192\u2286 Arg \u00d7 Arg. For two arguments A,B \u2208 Arg the relation A \u2192 B means that argument A attacks argument B. Abstract argumentation frameworks can be concisely represented by directed graphs, where arguments are represented as nodes and edges model the attack relation. Example 1. Consider the abstract argumentation framework AF = (Arg,\u2192) depicted in Figure 1. Here it is Arg = {A1,A2,A3,A4,A5} and \u2192= {(A1,A2), (A2,A1), (A2,A3), (A3,A4), (A4,A5), (A5,A4), (A5,A3)}. Semantics are usually given to abstract argumentation frameworks by means of extensions [Dun95] or labelings [WC10]. An extension E of an argumentation framework AF = (Arg,\u2192) is a set of arguments E \u2286 Arg that gives some coherent view on the argumentation underlying", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
