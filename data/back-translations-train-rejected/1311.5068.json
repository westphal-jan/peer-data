These perturbations are measured using the Gromov-Hausdorff metric. We study the problem of stability on linkage-based hierarchical clustering methods. We obtain that, under some basic conditions, standard linkage-based methods are semi-stable. This means that they are stable if the input data is close enough to an ultrametric space.
