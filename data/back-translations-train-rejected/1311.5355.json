Conclusions and discussion", "text": "The following conclusions can be drawn from the material presented in this essay: \u2022 The main phases of human thinking in order to arrive at a solution to a problem generally include imagination, visualization, and generation of ideas. The above phases are helpful in understanding the \"ideal behavior\" of the individual during the thought process. However, in real situations, things usually do not happen this way, since human cognition is used in general concepts that are inherently evaluated and therefore blurred. \u2022 In this essay, we constructed a blurred model of the thought process that, by calculating probabilities and possibilities of all possible profiles of the individual, gives a quantitative / qualitative view of their behavior during the process. In this model, the main phases of human thinking are presented as blurred subsets of linguistic labels that characterize the performance of a person at each stage. \u2022 Based on the above model and using the coordinates of the center of gravity of the respective member model, our group of thinking ability is also determined (i.e. we develop a method of measuring the individual's ability for a model)."}], "references": [{"title": "Fuzzy Sets, Uncertainty and Information", "author": ["G.J.
