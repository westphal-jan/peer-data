The first paradox was the lyer of epimenids. It states that \"a man said he was lying. What he said was true or false?\" In another way, we let epimenids say: \"All Cretans are lyers.\" This was considered a paradox by ancient philosophers. By the way: Either epimenids tell the truth, then he lies (because he is a Cretan), so his statement is false (because all Cretans lie). Either, on the contrary, epimenids lie by saying that, then their statement is false: there is at least one Crete who tells the truth, which is not contradictory, because it is the solution of the paradox. In modern mathematics, the logic Russel is the following paradox formulated by this question: \"the class of all classes, which are not an element of itself, is an element of itself.\""}, {"heading": "1.2 Antinomy in linguistics", "text": "Most of them are verbs and adjectives such as: move back / forward, start / stop, rise / decrease, black / white, fast / slow, wet / dry.

In this chapter we try to show some results for an overall overview of closed relationships in the same short documents, which are highlighted by some elements that have to do with specific argumentative relationships. First, we try to explain how contradictions in texts can explicitly occur as specific relationships. Second, two companies have been studied to extract global information, which have common characteristics such as: short document size, technical domain, English language, natural distribution of lexical objects, body size.

Analysis of multiexponential defects often leads to hard interpretation confirming the limited diagnostic value of relaxation times [Perea et al, 2007].

Analysis of the main elements of both regulations confirms that there is an ambiguous interpretation of the so-called Preservation Zone (Suelo de Conservacion), which represents a territory subject to conservation, its ecological value in terms of climate regulation, water enrichment, forest communities, agricultural cultivation and agricultural use.

[Allegro, 1990] examined linguistic form to understand therapeutic effects. He used inkblots as a test when confronted with interpretation problems. [Charash and McKay, 2009] took a test with sixty participants in several groups, were identified and engaged with a masked emotional impact test, implicit memory task and ambiguous interpretation task.

[Poudjom Djomani et al, 2003] explain that the extent of the terrans depends on the ambiguous interpretation of magnetic anomalies. For example, the Birekt terrane is fully detected on geophysical bases, as the foundation is overlaid by up to 10 km of Riphean Schnyll Schnyll, which are being investigated in the time by tuberyl, where for example pairs are compared [Klose, 2006]."}, {"heading": "Medical measure", "text": "The evaluation of the markers was not treated as a universally accepted criterion that can occasionally lead to uncertainty due to variations in these parameters [Casas Pina, 1999].

Confusion in endogenous circuit model specifications can therefore cause problems of interpretation [Huang et al, 1991]. Inspection of the vibration response of a beam with an edge that does not propagate leads to uncertainty. If the injury is small, this is revealed by numerical applications that do not seem to provide information about the location of the crack [Cacciola, 2003].

Many sciences, information and data can lead an expert in a confusing position to offer a precise interpretation.

In case of ambiguity in texts, the two effects of misinterpretation and erroneous results can play an important role."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we present two sources of contradictions that occur in textual data: the first is purely syntactical in nature and refers to the writer's intention in his article; the second is related factual data derived from experiments and leading to an elementary basis of interpretation; the purpose of the essay influences the way an article is written; and if the writer's intention is ethically related to scientific truth needs, ambiguity is based only on difficulties in obtaining unambiguous factual data from experiments caused by noise or the absence of current cataegories to facilitate interpretation. If a writer's intention is motivated by his career and reputation enhancement, data does not play a central role, but only a writer's rethoric discourse that leads to inappropriate relationships but is explained in the same way as real facts. In this study, we have tried to identify the source of uncertainty in order to interpret omissions in data."}], "references": [{"title": "Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules", "author": ["R Agrawal", "R Srikant"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Agrawal and Srikant,? \\Q1994\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Agrawal and Srikant", "year": 1994}, {"title": "On the formulation of interpretations", "author": ["Allegro LA"], "venue": "Int J Psychoanal", "citeRegEx": "LA.,? \\Q1990\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "LA.", "year": 1990}, {"title": "Semantic Disambiguation in Folksonomy: A Case Study, Advanced Language", "author": ["Strasbourg", "P. 2003 Andrews", "J.

Main questions are how to get data and transform them into a good document format. But data can be sensitive to noise oftenly called ambiguities. Ambiguities are aware from a long time, mainly because polysemy is obvious in language and context is required to remove uncertainty. I claim in this paper that syntactic context is not suffisant to improve interpretation. In this paper I try to explain that firstly noise can come from natural data themselves, even involving high technology, secondly texts, seen as verified but meaningless, can spoil content of a corpus; it may lead to contradictions and background noise. keywords paradox ; contradiction ; ambiguity ; semantic relationship ; domain ; information extraction ; corpus INTRODUCTION Human cognition call a diversity of concepts such as memory and brain anatomy, inference and reasoning, motivation, time and space, classification and clustering. Inference tries to identify good relations or properties associated to an object. In this sense it is also possible to test validity or consistency of a relation. Let be the proposition P = \u201ca cat is a stone\u201d is false or contradictory because a stone is not a living organism, though a cat is a living organism. P can be called paradoxal or contradictory. Sometimes society lives with contradictions such as tolerance to lots of death on roads or in wars but intolerance for death with diseases. In this paper we more specifically focuse on sources of potential contradictions which could spoil computation of information extraction. Formal semantics is attached to validate relations between a set of objects. Our focuse is not only to study issues is managing complexity of a logical proposition and how to compute if it true or false but given a text consisting of a set of sentences how to extract relations and see how they be asserted as non contradictory regards others relations extracted in others texts. So texts are the primary material of discussion. Chapter 1 presents relational ambiguities we can find in texts. We start to present a typology of logical relations. Given a type of relations, we explain how to extract such relations with markers in texts. But markers are not sufficient to detect a contradiction. A specialized language such as molecular corpus gives example of ambiguous relations (contradictory) that can not be detected with markers. Hence we show that global overview of words collocations in a corpuscan give a good signal about the structure. In our \u201cpublish or publish\u201d new era of research and development system, production of literature is high but a non-negligible percent of papers becomes false over time. It is possible to compile from Pubmed website 4,800 papers honestly accepted but hence officially retracted. Such amount of information is original to make a corpus of real texts, written with intentional to propose arguments and content to readers, in a real natural language, but knowing that the content has been invalidated ex-post by readers. To build a random text is quite easy but the grammar and arguments will not be normalized by how argumentation is made usually by \u201cnormal writers and experts\u201d, or natural language will not confirm standard used of official grammars and", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}}
