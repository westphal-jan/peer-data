The method", "text": "This year it has come to the point where there is only one city where most people are able to flourish, \"he said.\" This is one of the greatest challenges we have ever faced, \"he said."}, {"heading": "3. Results", "text": "First, we build a network of co-author relationships, and for each work we create an undirected full graph of weight 1 between all authors, and the links that connect the same pair of nodes are then accumulated. In total, there are 4,954,982 links between 662,762 authors with a total weight of 7,133,757. Distribution of degrees for each author is as follows: Figure 1 indicates that the co-author network is quite well suited to power. Thissuggestan assumes that the co-author network may be a scale-free complex network.It also shows an abnormal decrease in the number of authors with grades 2 to 4, which could be the reason that most of the work is published in a group of 3 and not in 1 or 2. It could be that the number of authors in each essay is also decreasing, which could be the reason."}, {"heading": "3.1. Global connection", "text": "In general, Figure 2 maps the coauthor network on the globe. Each line is the geological great circle (i.e. the shortest path between two points on the sphere) of the associated organizations. Of the 4,954,982 coauthor relationships between the authors, we get Figure 2. Global networking of universities, institutes, companies, and other research institutes 6486,120 connections between 29,820 organizations. The connections are all in Figure 2. On the map, it is clear that most researchers are located in the United States of America, China, Japan, and some European countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Research in Brazil, Singapore, India, and Australia is also very active. These national differences are more evident in Figure 3, which accumulates connections to countries. It is significant that the United States and China are leading partners in global research cooperation. Japan, although geologically closely connected to China, is more closely connected with European and academic countries."}, {"heading": "3.2. Global distribution", "text": "With the method described in 3.3, we also obtain maps of activity in each area of AI. It could be seen that the research institutes in areas such as data mining, computer vision, pattern recognition and some other areas of machine learning are fairly uniform, implying strong interaction between the community of each field. The most active research has been conducted in the institutes of the United States, China, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Despite the consistency, there is a small but interesting difference in such areas, that the activity in computer vision, pattern recognition, data mining in descending order for the Western countries (the United States and England), but the rise for the Eastern countries (China and Singapore). It is also clear that the United States are extremely competitive in the research of electronic engineering, especially for the California institutes, which are very strong in the combination of AI with industrial and commercial products."}, {"heading": "3.3. From keywords to fields", "text": "In order to analyze the presentation of entities in different areas, we need a table to assign each keyword to a specific subfield of the AI. There are some ways to accomplish such a procedure as ontology, clustering or just the field manually. In this evaluation, we have the classification via clustering and then manually checks the result.We monitor the most popular 1000 keywords and build a network of their correlations. Each of the keywords of the same paper are associated with an unregulated edge of weight 1, then double edges are accumulated. After building the keyword network, which uses 1000 keywords and 542,048 edges with a total weight of 3,716,812 to recognize the structure of the community."}, {"heading": "3.4. Hot words", "text": "With the field correspondence keyword we received in Section 3.3, we have undertaken further research into the hot words of the last 5 years, covering the 5-year span from 2009 to 2013. As this research is conducted in mid-October, some of the words published in 2013 may not be available at the time our data was collected, the result is shown in Figure 7. It is clearly shown that technically neutral words are generally more popular. \"Data Mining,\" \"learning,\" \"training,\" \"computational modeling\" are all among the hottest 10 keywords. \"Support Vector Machines\" as a technology-specific term seems to be an exception, which is the third hottest keyword. \"Feature Extraction,\" the second hottest keyword profiting from increased attention in computer vision and pattern recognition, is neither as neutral as DM nor as specific as SVM. Meanwhile, \"educational institutions\" may be a dark horse for the MOOC movement in full swing."}, {"heading": "4. Chronological analysis", "text": "In addition to the features discussed in Section 3, there may be some more inspiring information. While static analysis provides us with a general status of AI research or status 12, chronological analysis can tell us how it will turn out. In this section, we have broken down the data set by year of publication and reapplied some of the analyses performed in Section 3 to find out how the AI community has evolved over the last 73 years (1940-2013)."}, {"heading": "4.1. Total publish over year", "text": "Since the development of ENIAC, EDVAC and Colossus in the 1940s, artificial intelligence has been more a reality than a mere fantasy. Computers offered the chance to exploit the theoretical possibilities of intelligent machines.However, the annual publication in AI seems to be little affected by the happenings.The number of publications is increasing exponentially steadily.The annual publication can be equipped with publish = 1,156 \u0445 exp (year \u2212 1935,596) with an adjusted R-square of 0.9841."}, {"heading": "4.2.
