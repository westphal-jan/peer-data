Introduction", "text": "Al Khalil bin Ahmed Al Farahidy (died in A.D. 175) was the priority in the creation of the first Arabic lexicon. Since this great scientist was a man with a creative mathematical sense, which he used in all the specialization fields he worked on, this great wise scientist spared no effort in his attempt to create a lexicon that could be used to systematize and restrict the language. Al Farahidy used a mathematical method to collect and systematize linguistic parts, a method by which he got his hands on his goal, and no one took precedence in it. Al Farahidy noticed that the Arabic language consisted of (28) letters, all reproduced in vocal cords, with the exception of (alhamza)) \"(which is made of glottis; therefore, he determined that no words and letters would emerge from alhamza, and organized them into a fixed vocabulary. In accordance with this order (syllables), the syllables were no longer limited to the syllables between two or five letters, with no more than five syllables."}, {"heading": "1.1. The Steps of Al Farahidy System in Al-Ein Book", "text": "Al Khalil invented a new system for organizing dictionaries based on their places of articulation, the dictionary was not ordered alphabetically, but by phonetics, following the pattern of pronunciation of the Arabic alphabet from the deepest letter of the throat to the last letter pronounced by the lips. (Al Khalil gives this system a basis for his work in organizing his new lexicon, naming each letter as a book, so he begins with alhamza, since it is produced by the deepest letter and not by the vocal cords or the mouth. (Al Khalil gives this system a basis for his work in organizing his new lexicon, and names each letter as a book, so he begins with alhamza (lexicon), since it is produced by the vocal cords or the mouth. The second step was the search for all Arabic words limited between the two and five syllables, and he collected them accordingly (Al Khalil collects the target language for the third word)."}, {"heading": "1.2.

Hash Table", "text": "A hash table works by using a hash function to transform the key into a hash table, a number that is used as an index in an array to find the desired location (\"bucket\") where the values should be. Normally, the number is converted to the index by taking a module, or sometimes bitmasking is used where the array size is a strength of two. The optimal hash function for any given use of a hash table can vary widely, but depending on the nature of the key. Typical operations on a hash table include inserting, deleting, and looking up (although some hash tables are precalculated so that no insertions or deletions are made, only looking up on a live system.) These operations are all performed in amortized constant time, making maintaining and accessing a huge hash table very efficient."}, {"heading": "3. Propose Algorithm", "text": "Dictionaries are gradually gaining importance as computer technology advances, and great achievements have been made in areas such as natural language processing, speech recognition and other AI applications, most of which require the availability of a dictionary that can be maintained and retrieved in a very efficient manner. Dictionaries are also needed in traditional applications such as spell-checking and database management. Different types of Arabs are severely affected by the inability to find character-to-character matches between search terms and variant matches. In this paper, we present new ways to build an electronic Arabic lexicon that relies on building a hash table in which a word is used as a key to generate a corresponding integer index, which can be achieved by using one-to-one and a mathematical relationship."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusions", "text": "This paper represents a mathematical method to count a number of words that have proven the Al Farahidy theory. Our technique allows direct access to any word in the lexicon (by counting and matching index) instead of a sequential search for word letters, one letter at a time. This method can be applied to any dictionary with any language. By using relation 2, each word generates a unique number in which there are no collisions, meaning that any location in the hash table can be used. The proposed hash function dose does not need to take a module or bit masking to convert the number into the index. Typical operations in a hash table include insertion; deletion and lookup are done on a live system. The proposed algorithm uses arrays with integer keys or indexes, and then the time searched for (linear search) may be faster. Although words (letters) are equivalent in time, but they can be converted to average in time."}], "references": [{"title": "Introduction to Algorithms, MIT", "author": ["T. Cormen", "L.
