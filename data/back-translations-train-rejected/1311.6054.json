Multi-agent system modeling", "text": "The topic of multi-agent systems (MAS) is, if it is not new, currently a very active field of research. This discipline is the combination of several specific areas of artificial intelligence, distributed computer systems and software engineering. It is a discipline that focuses on collective behaviors caused by the interaction of several autonomous and flexible units, the so-called agents. In this section, first the concepts of agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) are presented, then a vocal modeling approach (A + E + I + O) of a multi-agent system."}, {"heading": "A. Multi-agent system", "text": "Before we deal with multi-agent systems, it is useful to remember some basics about agents; they are the subject of the next subsection."}, {"heading": "1) Agent", "text": "There are several definitions of an agent according to the privileged point of view. In this work, the definition adopted by [9] according to the work of M. Wooldridge is used: \"An agent is a computer system in an environment that acts autonomously and flexibly in order to fulfil the goals for which it was developed.\" The concepts \"situated,\" \"autonomous\" and \"flexible\" are defined as follows: - situated: the environment provides agents with sensory inputs that enable them to fulfil them. In our context, the agent environment is the image. - autonomous: the agent is able to act without the intervention of a third party (human or agent) and controls his own actions and internal status. - flexible: in this case, the agent is able to react in a timely manner: the agent must be able to perceive his environment and develop a reaction within the required time; proactive: an agent not only reacts to his environment, but is also able to produce actions by himself through goals."}, {"heading": "2) Multi-agent system (MAS)", "text": "A multi-agent system consists of a series of computer processes that run simultaneously, that is, of several actors living at the same time, sharing common resources and communicating with each other. A key point in multi-agent systems is the formalization of coordination between actors. Actors are able to perceive and act in a common environment, Fig.2. Perceptions enable actors to obtain information about changes in their environment, and their actions enable them to change them."}, {"heading": "B. MAS modeling", "text": "There are several approaches to the modeling of MAS: OMaSE, MESSAGE, PASSI, TROPOS, vowels, etc. This essay uses the vowel method due to its simplicity, which consists of the definition of four components [10]: - Agent: Definition of the internal structure and functioning of each agent; - Environment: Definition of the field of evolution and functioning of agents; - Interaction: Development of the way agents communicate; - Organization: global structure of agents. The agent was already defined."}, {"heading": "1) Environment", "text": "It is a common \"space\" for all actors in the system they perceive and interact with. It is the context in which coded rules in actors, interactions and organizations are updated; the environment can be accessible / inaccessible or deterministic / non-deterministic, episodic / non-episodic, continuous / discrete, static / dynamic, with or without rational adversary."}, {"heading": "2) Interaction", "text": "Interaction is an important concept in multi-agent systems, because one goal of defining a society of actors is to establish interaction between these actors in order to increase the capacity of the group. Interaction can be defined as a dynamic linkage of two or more actors through a series of mutual actions [11]. Interactions are based on: - Cooperation: Collaboration for a common goal. - Coordination: Organization of the solution of a problem in order to avoid harmful interactions or take advantage of useful interactions. - Negotiation: Achieving an agreement acceptable to all parties involved."}, {"heading": "3) Organization", "text": "Organisations make it possible to control and structure agents who only have a partial view of the assembly in order to avoid inconsistencies and redundancies at the system level.VI. The proposed approach To solve the problem of selecting operators and automatically adjusting their parameters, this paper proposes an MAS architecture using the Q-Learning algorithm, which is modelled on the \"vowel\" approach outlined above."}, {"heading": "A. Environment", "text": "In the face of a vision task, the environment is defined as the images to be processed, their basic truths, the actors that make up the MAS, and any a priori knowledge. The proposed model generally proceeds by trial / error, comparing the result with the basic truth stated by a domain expert."}, {"heading": "B. Agent", "text": "In the proposed architecture, we use three types of agents: a User Agent (UA), an Operator Agent (OA) and a Parameters Agent (PA). Agent UA is responsible for providing all the information required to perform the requested task. Agent OA is responsible for building all possible combinations of operators to be used. For each combination of operators, Agent OA creates a specialized Agent AP to adjust the parameters of these operators."}, {"heading": "1) Agent UA", "text": "The Agent UA provides all possible phases from which the global processing and also its sequence take place. It provides its applicable operators for each phase. Each operator has a set of parameters that must be adapted so that they can be applied; the Agent UA then suggests the ranges of possible values for each parameter. The phase sequence determines the sequence of execution of the operators. The Agent UA also provides the characteristics that are extracted from each basic truth."}, {"heading": "2) Agent OA", "text": "The Agent Open Access builds all possible combinations according to the phases proposed by the Agent UA. For each combination of operators, it generates an Agent Open Access to adjust the parameters of these operators Fig.4. The Agent Open Access generates as many agents Open Access as combinations. After processing each combination by the AP agent, assigning the best values to the parameters of its operators, this combination is returned to the Agent Open Access with its quality of processing. The combination with the highest quality is returned to the Agent Open Access by the Agent. The quality of processing is determined by a comparison with the obtained result and the truth of the ground. It is important to note that selecting an operator as the best in Mostvision tasks that require the execution of a chain of operators is not practicable."}, {"heading": "3) Agent AP", "text": "It is the agent who performs the operations. He starts from the necessity to find the best parameters for each surgeon. To this end, he constructs all possible combinations of parameters to assign to each surgeon. Thus, an evaluation is made for the maximum evaluation by the surgeon, and it represents the final values that he assigns to the surgeons."}, {"heading": "D. Organization", "text": "The three agents UA, OA and PA are organized in the proposed architecture, as shown in Fig.6.Fig.6. Global structure of the three agents. ExperienceThe proposed approach is tested using an application of image segmentation using contour approaches. The aim is not to provide a new method of segmentation, but a number of possible solutions, which is the best? The experiment uses a database of 100 different images. Each image has its basic truth, i.e. an image that is manually segmented by an expert. The approach is implemented in Matlab. How are the three types of agents defined?"}, {"heading": "A. Agent UA", "text": "It identifies three phases of image processing with the operators of each phase: pre-processing, processing and post-processing. Pre-processing: This phase is designed to improve image quality by using filters. At this stage, Agent UA proposes three operators: \"medfilt2,\" \"ordfilt2\" and \"wiener2,\" each with one parameter to be adjusted for each: the size of the filter with two possible values are: 3 or 5. Processing: At this stage, the contours contained in the image are recognized. Agent UA proposes a single operator for this phase: \"edge\" with two parameters to be adjusted. The first consists of selecting the filter (sobel, Prewitt zerocross, log) and the second concerns the threshold for elimination of high-contrast edges [0.02,..., 0.09, 0.1]. Post-processing: This phase consists of the refinement of the image by removing small objects. Agent UA proposes a single operator for these \"wait-size\" (two parameters)."}, {"heading": "B. Agent OA", "text": "The active ingredient OA forms all possible combinations of operators: COP1 = (medfilt2, edge, bwareaopen) COP2 = (wiener2, edge, bwareaopen) COP3 = (ordfilt2, edge, bwareaopen) The question is which of these COPi is best used? For each combination, an active ingredient PA is generated to find the optimal values for the parameters of its operators."}, {"heading": "C. Agent PA", "text": "The process of restructuring is driven by the Q-Learning algorithm, which requires the definition of actions, states and return functions. Measures: They are all possible combinations of parameter values. We choose another action by selecting other parameter values. An example of an action is the number of contours in the reference; is the ratio between the number of received and the number of received features in the reference; is the length of the contours and the number of contours in the reference; is the ratio between the number of received pixels and their number in the reference; is the ratio between the length of the contours and the length."}], "references": [{"title": " A", "author": ["R.
