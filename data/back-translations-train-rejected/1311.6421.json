We are therefore interested in the problem of finding optimal parsing strategies for synchronous rules, among some specific parsing frameworks.Standard parsing algorithms for SCFGs use dynamic programming techniques, and are derived from this as a generalization of the well-known Cocke-Kasami-Younger word recognition algorithms based on CFGs [You67, HU79], which essentially use a bottom-up strategy. All these algorithms are based on the representation described below.

We refer to undirected multigraphs as pairs G = (V, E), with a series of nodes V and multiplications E.A Permutation multigraph is a multigraph G = (V, A) in such a way that both PA = (V, A) and PB = (V, B) are Hamiltonian orbits, and it is the merging operation defined for multipliers.

This relationship shows that an algorithm for PMCW can also be calculated in polynomial time, and therefore PMCW is NP-hard.To prove this, we note that the problem is PMCW in NP, because a linear arrangement of a graph can be guessed in polynomial time and its maximum width can also be calculated in polynomial time.

Synchronous parsing is the problem of finding a suitable representation of the derivatives of a string pair consisting of a single string from each language in the translation. However, in the context of statistical machine translation, this problem arises when we want to analyze string pairs consisting of known parallel text in, say, English and Chinese. Our results show that it is NP-hard to find the linear synchronous parsing strategy with the lowest spatial complexity or time complexity, suggesting that learning complex translation models from parallel text is a fundamentally hard problem. a separate but closely related problem arises when we translate new Chinese sentences into English, a problem known as decoding."}], "references": [{"title": "Syntax directed translations and the pushdown assembler", "author": ["Alfred V.
