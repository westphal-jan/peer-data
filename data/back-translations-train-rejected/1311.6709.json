In many cases, one service is not enough to complete the business requirement; composition of web services is carried out. Autonomous composition of web services to achieve new functionality is generating considerable attention in semantic web domain. Development time and effort for new applications can be reduced with service composition. Various approaches to carry out automated composition of web services are discussed in literature. Web service composition using ontologies is one of the effective approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how the ontology based composition can be made faster for each customer. We propose a framework to provide precomposed web services to fulfil user requirements. We detail how ontology merging can be used for composition which expedites the whole process. We discuss how framework provides customer specific ontology merging and repository. We also elaborate on how merging of ontologies is carried out.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 Nov 2013 15:41:19 GMT  (383kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6709v1", "6 pages, 9 figures; CUBE 2013 International Conference"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 9 figures; CUBE 2013 International Conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["debajyoti mukhopadhyay", "archana chougule"], "accepted": false, "id": "1311.6709"}, "pdf": {"name": "1311.6709.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Framework for Semi-automated Web Service Composition in Semantic Web", "authors": ["Debajyoti Mukhopadhyay", "Archana Chougule"], "emails": ["debajyoti.mukhopadhyay@gmail.com", "chouguleab@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "A. Composite Web Services Framework", "text": "Figure 2 shows important modules of the Composite Web Services Framework. The following is the brief description of each module: 1) User Subscription: In order to provide custom Composite Web Services Facility, each new user must register with the system. User Registry manages accounts of all users. Each user receives a unique identification after registration. Users can access all of them under CompoServRegistry.2) CompoServRegistry: Composite Web Services provided by the framework for registered users. Composite Services are listed in order of frequency of composite services. The registry is updated each time a new composition is performed or the old service is deleted from the system.3) MergOntoBase: Since we have assumed that all services have their OWL-S descriptions, the system uses this fact."}, {"heading": "B. Maintaining merged ontology repository", "text": "Figure three shows how different modules of compound web services interact to manage MergOntoBase and CompoServRegistry. When a registered user logs into the system, the user receives a list of compound services provided by the system, i.e. CompoServRegistry. When the user selects one of the CompoServRegistry services, he is immediately asked for further input. Appropriate composition is performed and the response is immediately sent to the user. CompoServRegistry is also updated and another entry is added to CompoServRegistry.V. In this section, we provide a description of the system being implemented using the framework proposed in this paper. We have opted for the implementation of the e-learning domain and the system offers five compound services under the e-learning domain called Learning Resource LibrarySynchronous LearningTraining Scheduling Learning BoogementManagement."}, {"heading": "A. Development Environment", "text": "These ontologies are prepared with OWL-S, which allows an automated compilation of web services. It organizes a description of web services into four conceptual areas: the process model, profile, grounding and service. The system is created in Java with the Eclipse editor and runs on GlassFish Server 3.1. OWL-S descriptions of web services are created with the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ontology Editor. To complete the compositions we use service ontologies with APIs from MINDSWAP (Maryland Information and Network Dynamics Lab Semantic Web Agents Project) [15]. For Merging Ontologies we use PROMPT Plug-In of Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [14]."}, {"heading": "B. Scenario of Learning Resources Library", "text": "From the five assembled services provided by the system, we select Learning Resource Library to explain the functioning of the system. Resources such as e-books and slideshows are required by any organization that conducts e-learning courses. As part of these courses, candidates are offered various subject areas. There are a number of websites that allow downloading resources for these subjects. We consider Learning Resource Library as functions for accessing the following e-learning resources for registered users: EBooksSlide shows video simulation tools Development tools Learning Resource Library is prepared by assembling five web services, each of which provides functions for accessing resources under each resource category. We have created ServicePorfiles, ServiceModel and ServiceGrounding for each web service that is used under Composition. To complete the compilation of web services, the assignment of input parameters, output parameters and functions of their web types are required in the web service."}, {"heading": "C.
