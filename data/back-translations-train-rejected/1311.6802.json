Oftentimes, users do not volunteer this information due to privacy concerns or to the lack of initiative in filling out their profile information. In this work, we illustrate a new threat in which the system can nevertheless learn the private attribute for those users who do not voluntarily disclose them. We design an active attack that solicit ratings for strategically selected items, and could thus be used by a recommender system to pursue its hidden agenda. Our method is based on a novel usage of Bayesian matrix factorization in an active learning setting. Evaluations, on multiple datasets, illustrate that such an attack is indeed feasible and can be carried out using significantly fewer rated items than the previously proposed static inference methods. Importantly, this threat can succeed without sacrificing the quality of the regular recommendations made to the user.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 Nov 2013 20:48:59 GMT  (7261kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6802v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 23:08:54 GMT  (2817kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6802v2", "This is the extended version of a paper that appeared in ACM RecSys 2014"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CY", "authors": ["smriti bhagat", "udi weinsberg", "stratis ioannidis", "nina taft"], "accepted": false, "id": "1311.6802"}, "pdf": {"name": "1311.6802.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Recommending with an Agenda: Active Learning of Private Attributes using Matrix Factorization", "authors": ["Smriti Bhagat", "Udi Weinsberg", "Stratis Ioannidis", "Nina Taft"], "emails": ["nina.taft}@technicolor.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Problem Statement", "text": "We consider a referral system, as illustrated in Figure 1, which provides a legitimate article referral service, but at the same time maliciously attempts to derive a private user attribute; the system has access to a record provided by non-privacy-sensitive users that contains article ratings and a categorical variable that we call a user type; the type is a private attribute such as gender, age, political affiliation, etc. A new user who is privacy-sensitive (i.e., his type is unknown) interacts with the system. The referral system actively presents elements that the user can evaluate, disguising it as a way to improve recommendations in the cold start setting. In this context, our goal is twofold: 1. We would like to design a type classifier that will detect the type of the user based on his or her ratings. We are trying to apply the latent factor model that prevails in the matrix factorization to determine the type of the article, 2. We would like to successfully evaluate the reliance system of the referral system under the assessment of the article type."}, {"heading": "3.2 Data Model & Matrix Factorization", "text": "We use the following notation to describe the training data set of the receiver. The data set includes ratings for m items in set M items (1,.., m), which are given by n items in set N items (1,.., n). Each user is characterized by a categorical type that captures demographic information such as gender, profession, income category, etc. Focusing on binary types, we use ti items to denote the type of user i items. We assume that the ratings are generated from the generative standard model used in matrix items (occupation, income category, etc.), focusing on binary data types that we generate by ti items [+ 1, \u2212 1} the type of user i items. We assume that the ratings are generated from the standard generative model that is used in the matrix."}, {"heading": "4. A FACTOR-BASED CLASSIFIER", "text": "Let us now turn our attention to the following classification problem. Suppose that the recommendation system with access to the data set of ratings and types has calculated a number of item profiles V and a number of bias Z, e.g. by minimizing (3) gradient descent. A new user enters the system and gives ratings for items in a sentence A M, but does not specify his type. To circumvent the user's attempt, we need to construct a classifier in order to infer the type of that new user. 1Note that, as usual, to ensure that the profiles U, V obtained by (3) are invariant for a translation (shift) of ratings, we do not regulate category distortions (or, accordingly, do not assume Z). In this section, we present a classifier that uses item profiles and preferences (i.e. the latent factors obtained by this matrix task)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Type Posterior", "text": "For the number of points for which the user submits ratings, we introduce the following notation. We specify the matrix of profiles for evaluated objects by rA \u2261 [rj] j, and by zAt \u0445 [zjt] j, for evaluated objects by VA \u0445 [vTj] j, R | \u00b7 d. As in the previous section, we assume that the new user has an unknown profile u-Rd and a type t, so that the ratings he submits follow after (1), i.e. rj = u T vj + zjt + j, j-A, (4) where j-N (0, Z20) and a type t, so that the ratings follow after (1), i.e. rj = u T vj + zjt + j, j-A, (4) where j-N (0, Z20) follows, where j-Rd (0, ZB-2) is evenly distributed."}, {"heading": "4.2 Classification", "text": "Under the above assumptions, it is natural to classify the incoming user with a maximum of a subsequent estimate of the type. (7) In this notation, FBC can be defined as: Theorem 1 (5) and before (6), the FBC classifier is defined by each user (rA) = sgn (T AMAr) (8), where he (A + zA + zA \u2212 2), the (A + zA \u2212 2), as user (A + V T A) = sgn (T AMAr) (8), where he (A \u2212 zA \u2212 zA \u2212 2), as user (A \u2212 zA \u2212 2), as user (A \u2212 V T A \u2212 2), and as user (A), the (A \u2212 V TA), as user (V TA VA = 20).Proof. Under model (5) and before that (6), conditional on type t, the ratings are distributed by one user."}, {"heading": "5. LEARNING STRATEGIES", "text": "The second task in designing this strategy is to quickly find a type of user. (We present two strategies to address this problem: The first is a passive strategy (the second is a passive strategy); (the second is an active strategy: the recommendation selects which element to present to the user next; (the first is a passive strategy: the second strategy is evaluated in a predetermined order;) The second is an active strategy: the recommendation selects which element to present to the user next; (the second is based on the answers he has given so far.) Both strategies are comprehensively evaluated in Section 6.Algorithm 1 FBC-Selection Input: Item V, Item Z, Item 2: rA 2: rA 3: Repeat 4: for all presented strategies. (The second is the answer to all.)"}, {"heading": "5.4 Selection Through Point Estimation", "text": "An alternative method of selection can be constructed by replacing the exact estimate of the expected risk with a \"point estimate\" (see also [27]). Indeed, such a selection method can easily be combined with an arbitrary classifier based on such an estimate, which makes such an approach particularly useful when the expected risk is difficult to estimate in a closed form. We therefore outline this method, noting that several problems arise when the risk is calculated by such an estimate. We describe the method for a general classifier C, which is also summarized in Algorithm 2. Considering a number of evaluations of A, the classifier C will return a probability of PrC (for each type of T)."}, {"heading": "6. EVALUATION", "text": "In this section, we evaluate the performance of our methods using real data sets. We begin by describing the data sets and experiments, and then perform a comparative analysis of both passive and active methods."}, {"heading": "6.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "We evaluate our method using three datasets: Movielens, Flixster [12], and Politics-and-TV (PTV) [25]. The Movielens dataset includes user ratings for movies in addition to gender and age of users. For convenience, we categorize the age group of users as young adults (ages 18-35) or adults (ages 36-65). Flixster is a similar rating system for users with at least 20 ratings and elements that contain user gender information. PTV includes ratings from U.S. users on 50 different TV shows, along with the gender and political affiliation of each user (Democrat or Republican). We pre-processed Movielens and Flixster to include only users with at least 20 ratings and elements rated by at least 20 users. Since PTV includes only 50 TV shows, we pre-processed the data to ensure that each user has at least 10 ratings. Table 1 summarizes the datasets used for rating."}, {"heading": "6.2 Passive Learning", "text": "The fact is that we will be able to assert ourselves, that we will be able, that we will be able to achieve our objectives, and that we will be able to achieve our objectives."}, {"heading": "6.3 Active Learning", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "Our solution, which includes a mechanism for selecting the question to be asked of a user, as well as a classifier, is efficient in terms of both the number of questions asked and the runtime to generate each question. Going beyond binary attributes by using our classifier's relationship to the LDA is an interesting open question. Examining the attack from the user's perspective to better advise users on how to identify and potentially mitigate such attacks is also an important future direction."}, {"heading": "8.
