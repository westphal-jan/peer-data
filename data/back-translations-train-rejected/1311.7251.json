Our technique is based on a local nonlinear fusion of several image estimates, all obtained by applying a chosen reconstruction algorithm with different values of its control parameters. Usually such output images have different bias/variance trade-off. The fusion of the images is performed by feed-forward neural network trained on a set of known examples. Numerical experiments show an improvement in reconstruction quality relatively to existing direct and iterative reconstruction methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Nov 2013 09:44:45 GMT  (949kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.7251v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["joseph shtok", "michael zibulevsky", "michael elad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1311.7251"}, "pdf": {"name": "1311.7251.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Spatially-Adaptive Reconstruction in Computed Tomography using Neural Networks", "authors": ["Joseph Shtok", "Michael Zibulevsky"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "II.

Mathematical Model of CT Scan", "text": "In the process of a CT scan, the object is irradiated with X-rays. In this thesis, we consider a reconstruction in a plane of incident rays only at that plane (two-dimensional tomography). Therefore, from a mathematical point of view, the object under consideration is a function f (x) in the plane whose values are the attenuation coefficients of the compositional materials (i.e., tissues). If the measured photon numbers are perfect, the measurements refer directly to the X-ray transform of the function f (x) as a collection of all the straight lines running through the object, and the value associated with each such line is the integral image of f (x) along the image. In two dimensions and assuming a fully rotated and parallel beam scan, this corresponds to the radon shape Rf. Let's be \"a straight line from an X-ray source to a detector. The ideal photon number is measured by the detector.\""}, {"heading": "B. Reconstruction Algorithms for Computed Tomography", "text": "There are various reconstruction algorithms that aim to apply the attenuation map of the scanned object to each individual column (II.3). In this paper we will refer to and work on two such algorithms: (i) filtered rear projection (FBP) (2), which achieve better image quality than direct radon inversion, at the expense of longer processing time. (ii) An iterative reconstruction method that takes into account the statistical nature of the unknown and noise (e.g. [3]). Bayesian methods achieve better image quality than direct radon inversion, at the expense of longer processing time. We now describe these two methods somewhat more than the statistical approach.

ANN, imitated after the biological networks of neurons that encompass the nervous system, are intensively used in many areas of computer science. In this work, we focus on the multi-layered prediction of ANN without cycles, best represented by a directed, weighted graph that has a series of input nodes (data inputs), inner nodes (neurons) that implement specific (linear or non-linear) scalar functions, and another array of output nodes. The input argument of each neuron is the weighted sum of all input nodes where the weights are associated with the edges.

We also change the parameter p, which controls the steepness of the window roll-off.

Algorithm Description", "text": "The iterative PWLS algorithm (see section II-B) can be amplified by collecting intermediate versions of the image at 10 different iteration numbers; the idea is to capture the gradual transformation of the image from the initial to the final state. If the initial image is blurred, it gradually changes along the iterations toward a sharper version; the intermediate steps contain important information that can further improve the algorithm output; the method is very similar to that proposed in the previous section. In the training phase, a CT reconstruction is performed with a high-quality reference; the examples of ANN training are produced in the following way: The vector of the inputs corresponding to a location q in the image is composed by neighborhoods of q in the different versions of the image collected along the PWLS iterations. Specifically, we take a small neighborhood of pixels from each image in this order (see below); the \"Correct value of the image corresponds\" to the ANterq, where the ANteration is an ANteration of the ANQ."}, {"heading": "B.

COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF THE METHOD", "text": "We analyze the number of calculations required for the proposed method in the cases of FBP and PWLS reconstruction. First, we consider the complexity of using ANN to perform pixel-by-pixel fusion from a number of image versions created during the reconstruction phase. However, an n \u00b7 n image requires n2 activations of ANN. Typically, the dimension of the ANN input vector is in the order of 100 samples, the output dimension has up to 5 elements, and a single hidden layer of up to 40 neurons is used. Thus, the 12network contains 40 \u00b7 100 + 5 \u00b7 40 = 4200 weight4. Each neuron also implements a sigmoid function, requiring 40 sigmoid calculations to generate the ANN output values. Therefore, the cost of performing a local fusion by ANN is 4200 \u00b7 n3 operations. If the method for reconstructing the BP is used, a number of FBP reconstructions must be present in our three BP reconstructions; if the BP is sufficient in our three BP reconstructions, the number of times is sufficient."}, {"heading": "IX. SUMMARY", "text": "The concept consists of two components: firstly, the behaviour of the signal in its different versions is recorded; secondly, the ANN performs its own non-linear filtering of the signal versions in small neighbourhoods of the estimated pixel; the proposed method is very general and CT reconstruction is only one possible application for it; local fusion can be used to solve any linear, non-linear inverse problem where an algorithm exists to create a solution estimation; and the proposed method will make it possible to integrate the algorithm outputs generated with different values of a core parameter into a single improved result, eliminating the need to coordinate this parameter; and the proposed method will make it possible to integrate the algorithm outputs generated with different values of a core parameter when the local results of the FBP fusion are very good and the FBP results cannot be improved on the basis of the available resolution."}], "references": [{"title": "Penalized-likelihood sinogram restoration for computed tomography", "author": ["J.
