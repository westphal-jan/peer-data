Factorization rules are applied to reduce the size of the tree: (1) If all the children of a particular node contain the same element of a recommendation (e.g. a recommended drug treatment), this information element can be included in the node and removed from its children, (2) if a variable can take multiple values that lead to the same recommendations, the largest set of such values can be grouped as < other >."}, {"heading": "1.3 Comparing the Decision Tree with Clinical Guidelines", "text": "Finally, the decision tree is compared by experts with the CG.

In the case of type 2 diabetes, these submissions correspond to those in Table 1. Dosages have been taken into account, applying the following rule: If the proposed treatment is the same as the current treatment, the dose is understood to be modifiable: reduced if the problem identified is poorly tolerated, and increased if the problem identified is low in efficiency. In order to exclude unrealistic combinations, a few rules have been applied, e.g. if the current treatment is a diet, there can be no drug intolerance. Combinations of the values given in Table 1 generated a nearly exhaustive set of input vectors. Only in cases where the patient had more than one drug intolerance, 14G and 14G cases are recommended for treatment (7)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Building the Decision Tree", "text": "The data were initially processed in such a way that the list of valid treatments was used as a classifying variable, instead of the diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet + diet"}, {"heading": "2.3 Comparing the Decision Tree with Clinical Guidelines", "text": "We asked two doctors to compare the Decision Tree with the original CG.
