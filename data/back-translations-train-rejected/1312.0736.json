Evidence-based guidelines, decision support, evaluation, dyslipaemia, drug prescriptionIntroductionClinical guidelines (CG) offer physicians recommendations, but paper guidelines are difficult to effectively follow during medical consultations1. This difficulty has led to the development of decision support systems (DSS) based on CG2. The ASTI project aims to develop a DSS to help physicians consider the treatment recommendations expressed in CG for chronic diseases3. ASTI includes a criticism module that is automatically activated when the physician prescribes a drug and that issues a warning if the prescription does not follow the CG. The criticism module was originally designed for high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. However, unlike many DSS that focus on a single CG, ASTI is designed to be generic enough to cover the author."}, {"heading": "1. Methods", "text": "28 decision criteria (clinical conditions of the patient, laboratory results, etc.), 15 drug treatments and 17 recommendations were worked out, resulting in 73 critical rules. We evaluated the critical module for dyslipemia in the laboratory with 33 GPs; the GPs were \u00e9O users who participated voluntarily; two evaluations were performed with the ASTI Critical Module for Dyslipemia. Usability was evaluated on the basis of five simulated cases, which were derived and selected by an expert from real cases to cover the various aspects of the GG. First, GPs were briefly introduced to the application of the ASTI Critical Module; then, for each case, they were asked to code the data for the patient in the EPR and enter two prescriptions: the usual prescription that the doctor wrote and a prescription that he or she did not consider in order to satisfy the GP."}, {"heading": "2. Results", "text": "The usability assessment comprised 299 prescriptions (less than 2x5x33, as some GPs did not answer all questions, e.g. they seldom tried a second prescription when the first was already criticised), divided as shown in Figure 1. Specificity of the system was 94 \u00b1 1.4% (95% confidence interval) and sensitivity 84 \u00b1 2.1%. The 136 true positives contain both prescriptions that were criticised as expected or unexpected when the GP agreed to the criticism; of 114 (84 \u00b1 2.1%) of the true positives, the GP considered the explanations and treatment suggestions of the system to be appropriate. In 80 \u00b1 2.3% of the cases, the system triggered adequate criticism or was silent with good reason. Results of the satisfaction assessment are shown in Table 1. Physicians were interested in automatic criticism of their prescriptions and found the ASTI criticism module easy to use."}, {"heading": "3.
