By virtue of their universal definition, graphs have found widespread use for many years as tools for depicting complex relationships. Furthermore, it is often useful to represent objects as graphs to determine the degree of similarity between objects. More formally, Definition 3A designated graph G is a 3-tuple G = (V, E,) in which there are a series of graphs in which the graphs match, \u2022 E V \u00b7 V is the set of directed edges or arcs, \u2022 s is a function that assigns labels to vertices and edges; where Lurch represents a finite set of symbolic labels and entities."}, {"heading": "2.3 Kernel Functions for Labeled Graphs", "text": "In recent years, a large number of graph matching methods have been proposed based on different matching paradigms, ranging from the spectral decomposition of graph matrices to the formation of artificial neural networks, and from continuous optimization algorithms to optimal tree search methods. The basic idea of graph matching is to address a pattern recognition problem in a related vector space rather than the original space. That is, instead of defining mathematical operations in the space of the graphs, mapping all graphs into a vector space where these operations are readily available. Obviously, the difficulty is to find a mapping that maintains the structural similarity of the graphs at least to a certain degree. In other words, if two graphs are structurally similar, the two vectors that represent these graphs should be similarly objective."}, {"heading": "3 Case-Based Planning and OAKPLAN", "text": "Here we offer a detailed description of the case-based approach to planning and its implementation into the state-of-the-art CBP system OAKPLAN.A case-based planning system solves planning problems by using stored plans that have been used to solve analog problems. CBP is a type of case-based reasoning that involves the use of stored experiences (cases); in addition, there is strong evidence that people often use this type of analog reasoning [21, 47, 60]. When a CBP system solves a new planning problem, the new plan is added to its case base for potential reuse in the future. Thus, we can say that the system learns from experience and the following steps are taken when a new planning problem needs to be solved by a CBP system: 1. Plan retrieval to retrieve cases from memory that are analogous to the current (goal) problem (see Section 3.1 for a description of our approach).2. Choose the implementation by a new plan or 3."}, {"heading": "3.1 Plan Retrieval", "text": "Although the plan adaptation phase is the central component of a CBP system, the call-up phase has a critical impact on system performance. In fact, call-up time is a component of the overall adaptation period and the quality of the retrieved plan is fundamental for the performance of the subsequent adaptation phase. With OAKPLAN, a number of functions for managing the plan library and the appropriate functions for selecting the candidate plan for adaptation have been implemented. 1A plan that is suitable for adaptation has an adaptation cost that is lower than the other candidates on the case base and in terms of plan generation. The call-up phase must take into account all elements of the plan library in order to select a good one that will easily resolve the system. Therefore, it is necessary to design a similarity metric and reduce the number of cases that need to be accurately evaluated in order to improve the efficiency of the call-up phase."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Object Matching", "text": "As stated above, we use a variety of logic to reduce the search space for the matching process; in addition, we assume that the operators are ordinary STRIPS operators who use variables, i.e. we require that if there is an operator who designates the typed constants in such a way that they actually become identical when the di's are replaced by ci's.

It is performed by simulating the execution of \u03c0 and the determination of the unsupported prerequisites of its actions; in the same way, the presence of unsupported objectives is identified. Moreover, the plan evaluation function could easily be defined as the number of inconsistencies in the current planning problem. Unfortunately, this type of evaluation considers a uniform cost structure to solve the different inconsistencies and this assumption is generally too restrictive. Then, our system considers a more accurate inconsistency evaluation criterion to improve the plan evaluation. Inconsistencies related to unsupported facts are evaluated by calculating a relaxed plan starting from the corresponding state and the use of the RELAXEDPLAN algorithm in the LPG [22]. The number of measures in the relaxed plan determines the difficulty of evaluating the selected inconsistencies of the selected inconsistencies, the number of the selected inconsistencies are selected to be evaluated; the number of inconsistencies are evaluated."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Application of plan merging techniques", "text": "We have the plan that satisfies all the objectives with the lowest heuristic adjustment costs. In addition, in order to reuse as many as possible portions of previously executed plans, we must break down the solution plans into portions that allow us to fulfill each individual goal or set of related objectives. If such a plan does not exist, we apply those portions to the case base, if they do not already exist. If a new e-learning planning problem needs to be solved, we look in the case base for a plan that already solves all the objectives. If such a plan does not exist, we apply plan merger techniques that are gradually identified (partial) plans in the case base that can meet the objectives. This phase consists of reusing portions of the retrieved plans to complete a new goal. Figure 9 describes the process for merging the plans of the library to find a plan that solves the current planning problem or that represents a quasi-solution."}, {"heading": "3.3 Plan Adaptation", "text": "As stated above, the Plan Adaptation System is a fundamental component of a plan that is from scratch. However, it consists in re-using and modifying existing plans to solve a new problem and overcome the limitations of planning from scratch. Indeed, the applicability of a Plan Adaptation System is more universal; when a planner receives exactly the same planning problem, it can occur in a dynamic environment when the execution of a planned measure fails, when the new information that changes the description of the world prevents the applicability of some planned measures, or when the target state is changed by adding new goals or removing existing ones."}, {"heading": "3.4 Plan Revision & Case Base Update", "text": "In this respect, case-based planning is no exception; this capability is called plan revision and it is divided into two sub-tasks: In this first hypothesis, the presence of errors that may occur during plan execution is checked if the plan does not produce the expected result; in the second hypothesis, the system can respond by looking for a repair or abortion of the plan; in this first hypothesis, the LPG-adapted system is applied to the remaining part of the plan; in the second hypothesis, the CBP cycle is repeated so that the search for a new plan from the library and after repairing it using the LPG-adapted techniques, the solution plan can be inserted into the library or discarded; case-base maintenance is clearly important for the performance of the system; and other strategies have been suggested in the literature."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results", "text": "In this section, we present an experimental study aimed at testing the effectiveness of OAKPLAN, exploring the effectiveness of OAKPLAN in a number of standard benchmark domains. We have created nine initial configurations (with 10, 20), each comprising a real, large-format Moodle stretch of around 90 lots per configuration (plus an additional variant for problem 90), which takes into account a total of 100 planning problems (the 91 variants plus the 9 initial configurations), each variant artificially simulating the changes that may occur during route execution, which in the first variant some devices are no longer available; the second variant maintains these changes and includes restrictions on student availability; and so on for the other variants."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "In the following section, we examine the most relevant case planners taking into account their retrieval, adaptation and storage capacities. In addition, we present an empirical comparison of the performance of OAKPLAN vs. the FAR-OFF system and some comments on the advantages of OAKPLAN in relation to other case-based planners. Some CBP systems designed in the past do not take generative planning into account in their structure and find a solution only through the cases that are stored in the case base. These CBP systems are referred to as reuse-only systems. Since reuse-only systems cannot find a planning solution from the ground up, they cannot find a solution unless they find a suitable case in the case base that can be adapted by individual rules. An alternative approach for reuse-only systems is the reuse-only approach, which uses a generative planning system that is responsible for adapting the recalled systems. This feature allows a case system to solve problems that can not be solved by simply using the rules of storage and storage."}], "references": [{"title": "Case-based reasoning: foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches", "author": ["A.

take advantage of former problem-solving experiences by storing in a plan library previously generated plans that can be reused to solve similar planning problems in the future.
