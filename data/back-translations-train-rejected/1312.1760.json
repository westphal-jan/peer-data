This can be expressed as a 4-symbol alphabet, which can also be represented using a 20-symbol alphabet corresponding to the 20 amino acids. Characters are also expressed in alphabetical languages with letters (26 in English). Spoken languages are represented by phonemes (40 in English). Texts use very large-size alphabets (the vocabulary items of a language). These examples show that strings ubiquitous.One of the most important ones used to handle sequential data is distance (ED), also called Levenshtein distance."}, {"heading": "3 Genetic Algorithms-based Normalization of the Edit Distance (GANED)", "text": "ED, which we introduced in section 2, was introduced mainly to apply to spelling errors, making editing operations a major component of ED. Although NDE takes into account the length of the two strings, which in our opinion is an important change, it is based on a different principle from ED, which in our opinion means that it loses some of the main features of ED. In this thesis, we present a new modification of the editing distance, which also takes into account the length of the strings. However, our proposed distance takes a completely different approach from that of NDE. Our new distance is directly related to the editing distance. In fact, the new distance is a lower limit of the editing distance."}, {"heading": "3.1 GANED", "text": "Let n be an integer, and let) S (anf be the frequency of the n-gram na in S, and) T (an f be the frequency of the then-gram na in T, where S, T are two strings in *.ED.

However, the most important symbolic representation method of the time series is the SAX method, so SAX can only be applied to standardized time series. [14] The second step is to reduce the dimensionality of the time series by using a time series representation called Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA). [14] This PAA representation of the time series is then achieved by determining the breakpoints."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Perspectives", "text": "This new distance, GANED, is directly related to the edit distance and takes into account the length of the two strings. What's special about our new distance is that it uses an optimization algorithm; the genetic algorithms to determine the values of its parameters. We tested the new distance by comparing it to another distance applied to strings, and we showed how our new distance, GANED, performs better. In this work, the new distance was applied to symbolically displayed time series. However, we believe that other applications may be more suitable for our new distance."}], "references": [{"title": "Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming Modern Concepts and Practical Applications", "author": ["M.
