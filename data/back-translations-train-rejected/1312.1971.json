RELATED WORK", "text": "Research in the field of e-mail analysis usually focuses on two areas: the analysis of e-mail traffic and the analysis of e-mail content. Much research has been conducted to analyze e-mail traffic [10], [11] an e-mail traffic system that analyzes the traffic within e-mail. [11] Traffic in e-mail encompasses the substance and the body. [13] The analysis of e-mail content is indeed very complex."}, {"heading": "III. CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "V. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY", "text": "Our proposed methodology uses machine learning methods to detect suspicious e-mails. It evaluates the performance of four classifiers with feature selection strategies. The algorithm for the proposed methodology is in Fig. 1. The algorithm described in Fig. 1 illustrates how suspicious e-mail detection models work. In the algorithm, the variable FS consists of 10 feature selection strategies and has the values initialized for various feature selection schemes. WFS stands for Without feature selection, CFS-BFS for consistency SubSetEval and Best First Search method, CFS-GSS stands for CfsSubSetEval and Greedy Gradually Search method, CFS-RS stands for CfsSubSetEval and Rank Search method, CSE-BFS stands for consistency SubsetEval and Best First Search method, CFSS-GSS stands for classification, CFSS-GSS stands for classification CS, CFS stands for subset search method, CFS stands for subset Evaluation method, SE SE-Stuval, CS stands for SE-Stuval"}, {"heading": "A. Feature Selection", "text": "Feature selection is a way to select a subset of the original feature space. The number of features in space influences the computation time and also the accuracy of the classifier. The key idea behind the feature selection is to search for a viable subset of features by evaluating them, by some evaluators [14]. In this essay, we focus on the correct feature selection, through which we could achieve a relatively better performance of the required task even with existing algorithms. Feature F is defined as a vector of K and I and it is the original feature space: F = {K1, K2,...... Kn, I1, I2,...... In} (1) K is a vector of n key words and I is a vector of indicators. Among the indicators, some indicators make the e-mail suspicious and some make the e-mail unsuspicious: I = Is + (2) Suspicious, \"K is a function of n key words and I is a vector of Suspicious, and K is a vector of indicators."}, {"heading": "B. System Architecture", "text": "The strategy applied in the proposed system for selecting and generating features is that it is kept outside the main classification engine, which contains different classification algorithms. This means that the feature selection is applied before classification. We used the well-known open source data mining tool WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) [29] for our feature selection and classification purposes. First, a text message is given as input and then feature selection strategies are applied. The extracted features are recorded in the ARFF file format, which is the WEKA-specific form of a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. WEKA expects the input file to be available in the ARFF format. Communication between WEKA and our proposed system is carried out using the data exchange. The original feature space is displayed separately by WEKA using a Rule Engine Execuwords manually, the corresponding feature selection method is applied in the corresponding WEKA filter and the corresponding feature method."}, {"heading": "VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "Our experiments were performed using the steps that were given in the algorithm in Fig. 57 For conducting the experiments as mentioned before we used WEKA Data Mining Tool. We have developed the terror email record from various sources such as news groups. We have also used some emails that are used by the authors [1]. Some other emails are also stupid emails. The reason for developing such a data set is that to the best of our knowledge there are no benchmark email records available in the field of counter-terrorism."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we have presented suspicious e-mail detection strategies that use different classification and selection methods. We concluded that in the specific task, the decision tree algorithm (ID3) outperformed the rest of the state of the art classifiers as Na\u00efve Bayes, SVM and logistic regression. Once the appropriate selection strategy is applied, the logistic regression algorithm also achieves maximum performance in terms of accuracy. We also plan to apply the classification method for the specific task. We also plan to apply the selection method for suspicious e-mail detection task. Currently, the experiments are being conducted in relatively small datasets, but in the future, we plan to construct larger datasets from terrorist statements."}], "references": [{"title": "Suspicious email detection via decision tree: a data mining approach", "author": ["S.
