[6] In the design of network protocols, there is a need to ensure reliability against intrusion by powerful attackers who can control even a fraction of the parties on the network. Controlled parties can launch both passive (e.g. eavesdropping, non-participation) and active attacks (e.g. intelligence disruption, corruption, and counterfeiting).Intrusion detection is the process of dynamically monitoring events in a computer system or network, analyzing them for signs of possible incidents and often stopping unauthorized access."}, {"heading": "2 Challenges and Approaches", "text": "An IDS generally has to deal with issues such as large network traffic volumes, highly unequal data distribution, the difficulty of recognizing the boundaries between normal and abnormal behavior, and the need for continuous adaptation to an ever-changing environment [14]. In general, the challenge is to efficiently capture and classify artificial methods, typically dividing strategies for classifying network behavior into two categories: abuse and anomaly detection [4]. Misuse detection techniques examine both the known instances of misuse of signature matching algorithms. This technique is effective in detecting attacks that are already known. However, novel attacks that lead to false negatives are often overlooked. Alarms are generated by the IDS, but time is wasted and resources lead to system instability that leads to system instability."}, {"heading": "3 AI-based Techniques", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "4 CI-based Techniques", "text": "In this section, we will consider several algorithms based on the four core techniques of computer intelligence: genetic algorithms (Section 4.1), artificial neural networks (Section 4.2), fuzzy logic (Section 4.3), and artificial immune systems (Section 4.4)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Genetic Algorithms (GA)", "text": "A genetic algorithm starts with a set of genomes (population) and an evaluation function called a fitness function that measures the quality (quality) of each genome.

ANN have the ability to learn by example and generalize limited, noisy, and incomplete data. They have been successful in a wide range of data-intensive applications.Mukkamala et al. [11] describe approaches to detecting intruders using neural networks and Supported Vector Machines (SVM).Their goal is to discover patterns or features that describe user behavior in order to create classifiers for detecting anomalies.SVMare monitored learning machines that represent the training vector in the high-dimensional feature space and characterize each vector by its class.SVM define an upper boundary at the edge (separation) between different classes to minimize the generating error, which is the level of error in classifying unknown vectors. SVMare monitored learning machines that characterize the vector in the individual training space by their support classes using SVM, not SVM, the vector points in the high-dimensional class by their support classes."}, {"heading": "4.3 Fuzzy Logic", "text": "Fuzzy logic is a method of calculation based on degree of truth rather than the usual true or false Boolean logic on which modern computers are based. Fuzzy logic allows an object to belong to different classes at the same time using fuzzy spaces. This makes fuzzy logic a good choice for detecting intruders because the security itself is blurred and the boundary between the normal and the anomaly is not well defined. Furthermore, the problem of intrusion detection involves many numerical attributes in collected data and various derived statistical metrics. Building models directly on numerical data usually causes high detection errors. A behavior that deviates only slightly from a model cannot be detected or a small change in normal behavior can cause a false positive. With fuzzy logic it is possible to model these small deviations in order to keep the false positive / negative rates small. Each fuzzy rule has the following form, IF-Conclusion at DANN is a more clear expression of the DANN."}, {"heading": "4.4 Artificial Immune Systems (AIS)", "text": "They distinguish pathogens from self-cells and eliminate the pathogens. This provides a great source of inspiration for computer security systems, especially IDS. An artificial immune system is a computer-aided system based on the behavior of natural immune systems. They build a database that contains normal sequences of system calls applicable to the normal behavior of a program. Their model specializes in detecting intruders into local networks based on TCP / IP."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We reviewed several influential intrusion detection algorithms based on various machine learning techniques. Characteristics of ML techniques enable the development of IDS with high detection rates and low false positive rates, while the system quickly adapts to changing malicious behaviors. We divided these algorithms into two types of ML-based systems: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Intelligence (CI). Although these two categories of algorithms have much in common, several features of CI-based techniques correspond, such as adaptation, error tolerance, high computing speed, and error resistance to loud information about the need to build efficient intrusion detection systems."}], "references": [{"title": "Immunity-based intrusion detection system: A general framework", "author": ["Dipankar Dasgupta"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 22nd National Information Systems Security Conference (NISSC).
