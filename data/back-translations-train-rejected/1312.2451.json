Traditionally, stylometric features have been successfully employed in various authorship analysis tasks; we extend the traditional feature-set to include some more interesting and effective features for email authorship identification (e.g. the last punctuation mark used in an email, the tendency of an author to use capitalization at the start of an email, or the punctuation after a greeting or farewell). We also included Info Gain feature selection based content features. It is observed that the use of such features in the authorship identification process has a positive impact on the accuracy of the authorship identification task. We performed experiments to justify our arguments and compared the results with other base line models. Experimental results reveal that the proposed CCM-based email authorship identification model, along with the proposed feature set, outperforms the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM)-based models, as well as the models proposed by Iqbal et al. [1, 2]. The proposed model attains an accuracy rate of 94% for 10 authors, 89% for 25 authors, and 81% for 50 authors, respectively on Enron dataset, while 89.5% accuracy has been achieved on authors' constructed real email dataset.

The model uses a top-down approach to group e-mails into clusters, even though the clusters created are not directly assigned to each author due to similarities in the writing styles of different authors. However, using clusters, authors who share a writing style are grouped into groups. SVM classification algorithm is then applied to each cluster to further separate each author's written work, as shown in Fig. 1. In this way, authors are divided into clusters and there are fewer authors in each cluster. Therefore, the classification model works well to classify authors into clusters, and the overall accuracy of the EAI task is increased by using CCM on a slightly larger number of authors compared to the model [1, 2] on the Enron dataset."}, {"heading": "3.2 Feature Set Construction", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have shown in the past, and they will be able to play by the rules they have shown in the past."}, {"heading": "3.3 Algorithmic Details", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it is only a matter of time before a result is achieved."}, {"heading": "3.4 CEAI Architecture", "text": "The architecture of CEAI consists of input, preprocessing, vector input, and an EAI module (CCM model) as shown in Fig. 2. The input module receives raw e-mails in an SQL dump file (compressed database file), the dump file is then transformed into SQL tables. The input module then fetches e-mails from the tables and makes them available in a form that can be processed by the preprocessing module. E-mails received from the input module contain unnecessary data that is not necessary to identify the e-mail authors. It is the responsibility of the data cleanup module to remove unnecessary data and provide the required e-mail data. As an e-mail consists of two main parts, the header and the body are first cleaned by extracting the header and the body of the e-mail."}, {"heading": "3.5 Implementation Details", "text": "In this section, we will discuss the implementation details of each individual module. There are three types of implementations required for the proposed model: (a) data retrieval (input) and data cleanup performed using MySQL servers; (b) function extraction is the second type of implementation implemented using Java code and ARFF files, which are then provided to WEKA for the application of the proposed approach; (c) the third type of implementation is the application of the proposed approach using WEKA, through first clustering and subsequent classification. First, the required part of the record is extracted using MySQL queries. To extract the sender's text from the email and remove the linked text, MySQL queries are used, first removing unnecessary parts of the record and then performing classification."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results and Evaluation", "text": "This section is divided into subsections: Section 4.1 describes the experimental setup, Section 4.2 the experimental evaluation and Section 4.3 the results and a discussion."}, {"heading": "4.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "To conduct experiments, we retrieved only the \"sent\" e-mails of Enron employees from the dataset, because the true identities of authors with their names are available. First, we randomly selected 50 authors, then the \"sent\" e-mails of those 50 authors. We retrieved the e-mail bodies from the message table and along with the sender names by merging queries about the message and the Employee _ list tables from the database. We performed five types of experiments on the e-mails of 50 authors for the authoring task. The first experiment consisted of stylometric basic features and an SVM classifier. The second experiment is using stylometric basic features with advanced functions and an SVM classifier for the Author Identification Ion. In the third experiment, we used stylometric basic features for selecting the contents of Info Gain, and in the experiment, we used all stylometric characteristics for selecting authors of Gain."}, {"heading": "4.2 Evaluation Criteria", "text": "The 10-fold cross-validation is a method by which the data set is divided into ten subsets. Algorithms run over ten rounds; in each round, one subset is used for the test, while the other nine are used for training. In each round, a different subset is taken for the test. Finally, the average of the accuracy rate is calculated to find the final accuracy rate. This method of evaluation is considered more effective because each email is predicted as for its author, so each email is used exactly once in the test set and nine times in the training set for each group of experiments.The final accuracy of all runs is returned on average."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Evaluation measures", "text": "The rating yardsticks used in our study are the accuracy, which in the summary is: 100 * FNFPTNTP accuracy (11) Where TP is the number of authors correctly classified as positive classes, whereas TN is the number of authors correctly classified as negative classes, while FP is the number of authors wrongly returned as positive classes, and FN is the number of authors wrongly returned as negative classes by the model where they were actually positive. Generally, TP + TN is the number of e-mails with correctly identified authors, and TP + FN is the total number of e-mails."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we present a model for the identification of e-mail authors (EAI) and their evaluation on the publicly available e-mail dataset of Enron as well as on the constructed dataset of the authors. The contributions of the paper are twofold: (i) the evaluation of the use of additional features with stylometric basic features for the EAI task and Info Gain feature selection of based content features; and (ii) the development of a new model for the EAI task. Our experiments show that additional features have positive effects on the accuracy of author identification, and the evaluations confirm that CEAI achieves an accuracy of 94% for 10 authors, 89% for 25 authors and 81% for 50 authors and 89.5% accuracy for authors of seven authors. The promising results are achieved compared to previous models [1, 2] for benchmark Enron datasets and a slightly higher number of authors in the experiments used in the 50 authors, and the improvement in the number of authors is limited to the 20 authors observed by the task."}, {"heading": "257-270, 2004", "text": "[40] D.

Classification (CCM) technique. Traditionally, stylometric features have been successfully employed in various authorship analysis tasks; we extend the traditional feature-set to include some more interesting and effective features for email authorship identification (e.g. the last punctuation mark used in an email, the tendency of an author to use capitalization at the start of an email, or the punctuation after a greeting or farewell). We also included Info Gain feature selection based content features. It is observed that the use of such features in the authorship identification process has a positive impact on the accuracy of the authorship identification task. We performed experiments to justify our arguments and compared the results with other base line models. Experimental results reveal that the proposed CCM -based email authorship identification model, along with the proposed feature set, outperforms the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM)-based models, as well as the models proposed by Iqbal et al. [1, 2]. The proposed model attains an accuracy rate of 94% for 10 authors, 89% for 25 authors, and 81% for 50 authors, respectively on Enron dataset, while 89.5% accuracy has been achieved on authors' constructed real email dataset. The results on Enron dataset have been achieved on quite a large number of authors as compared to the models proposed by Iqbal et al. [1, 2].", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}}
