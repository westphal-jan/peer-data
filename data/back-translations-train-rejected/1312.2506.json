The theory describes default strategies that learners of a second language use in extracting meaning out of a text, based on their knowledge of the second language and their background knowledge about the world. We formalized this theory in ASP, and as a result we were able to determine opportunities for refining its natural language description, as well as directions for future theory development. We applied our model to automating the prediction of how learners of English would interpret sentences containing the passive voice. We present a system, PIas, that uses these predictions to assist language instructors in designing teaching materials.

Firstly, we have identified aspects in the text of the theory description that require refinement (i.e., the definition of the \"starting position\"; the presentation of Principle 1, the partial principles of which could be interpreted differently to facilitate a deeper understanding) and have identified possibilities for future theory development (i.e., how are resources in working memory used up during comprehension tasks? Do successful sentences in a narrative limit the interpretation of earlier sentences? How are meaningless sentences interpreted?) Secondly, we have shown how our ASP model can be used to design experiments to test this theory and fine-tune its parameters. Thirdly, we have described a system, PIas, that evaluates the quality of materials produced by language teachers, and creates valuable memories."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The author warmly thanks Michael Gelfond, Marcello Balduccini and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions."}], "references": [{"title": "Diagnostic reasoning with A-Prolog", "author": ["M.

We chose it because it is an established theory in the field of Second Language Acquisition, with important consequences on foreign language education. It is specified in English in the form of a compact set of principles. Input Processing (IP) describes the default strategies that second language learners use to get meaning out of text written or spoken in the second language, during tasks focused on comprehension, given the learners\u2019 limitations in vocabulary, working memory, or internalized knowledge of grammatical structures. As a result of applying these strategies, even learners with limited grammatical expertise can often, but not always, interpret input sentences correctly. Once grammatical information is internalized, the default strategies are overridden by the always reliable grammatical knowledge. Hence, it can be said that IP describes an example of nonmonotonic reasoning. IP predicts that beginner learners of English reading the sentence \u201cThe cat was bitten by the dog\u201d would only be able to retrieve the meanings of the words \u201ccat\u201d, \u201cbitten\u201d, and \u201cdog\u201d and end up with something like the sequence of concepts CATBITE-DOG. Although they may notice the word \u201cwas\u201d or the ending \u201c-en\u201d of the verb \u201cbitten\u201d, they would not be able to process them (i.e., connect them with the function they serve, which is to indicate passive voice) because of limitations in processing resources. In this context, the expression processing resources (or simply resources) refers to the amount of information that a learner can hold and process in his/her working memory during real time comprehension of input sentences. Additionally, IP predicts that the sentence above, now mapped into the sequence of concepts CAT-BITE-DOG, would be incorrectly interpreted by these learners as \u201cThe cat bit the dog\u201d because of a hypothesized strategy of assigning agent status to the first noun of a sentence.

The theory describes default strategies that learners of a second language use in extracting meaning out of a text, based on their knowledge of the second language and their background knowledge about the world. We formalized this theory in ASP, and as a result we were able to determine opportunities for refining its natural language description, as well as directions for future theory development. We applied our model to automating the prediction of how learners of English would interpret sentences containing the passive voice. We present a system, PIas, that uses these predictions to assist language instructors in designing teaching materials.
