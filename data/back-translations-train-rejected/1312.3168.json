These sorts are needed to include lexical considerations in a semantical analyser such as Boxer or Grail. Indeed, all proposed lexical extensions of usual Montague semantics to model restriction of selection, felicitous and infelicitous copredication require a rich and refined type system whose base types are the lexical sorts, the basis of the many-sorted logic in which semantical representations of sentences are stated. However, none of those approaches define precisely the actual base types or sorts to be used in the lexicon. In this article, we shall discuss some of the options commonly adopted by researchers in formal lexical semantics, and defend the view that classifiers in the languages which have such pronouns are an appealing solution, both linguistically and cognitively motivated.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Dec 2013 14:04:52 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3168v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["bruno mery", "christian retor\\'e"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.3168"}, "pdf": {"name": "1312.3168.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 131 2.31 68v1 [cs.CL] 1 1D ec2 013Introduction One of the most difficult aspects of automated processing of human language is the phenomenon of polysemy, the ability of words to be used for different meanings in different contexts. Relatively recent studies, such as Pustejovsky (1995), argue that polysemy is a trait that enables creativity in linguistic actions and that the meaning of words could be derived from their context by applying generative mechanisms, through processes that refine semantic composition. Instead of thinking that all words designate individual objects as the same semantic types (of units), advanced lexical semantics could classify them according to their contextual behavior, and a process of type testing could derive the correct meaning from any combination of predicate and object."}, {"heading": "1 Including Lexical Considerations into Syntactical and Semantical Parsers", "text": "There are a number of approaches that are reflected in the way they have emerged in the United States in recent years.

Instead of the individual variety e, we use many different types for entities that can distinguish between different linguistic behaviors. Formally, this framework uses a version of the type logic with n varieties, TYn, detailed inMusken (1996b).Without detailed functionalities outside the scope of this post, these n varieties are used to type the different classes of entities of the lexicon. When a type conflict is detected, the analyzer searches for available modifiers provided by the logical terms to perform the analysis, and makes a note of the lexical operations used to compile the actual meaning of the sentence."}, {"heading": "1.2 The Difference between our Proposal and related Formulations", "text": "There are several related proposals devoted to typical lexical disambiguation that have many features in common, including works by Pustejovsky, Asher, Luo, and Bekki that began in Pustejovsky & Asher (2000), elaborated in Asher & Pustejovsky (2005), extensively developed in Asher (2011), and are the subject of continued work in Xue & Luo (2012) and Bekki & Asher (2012). We are indebted to the authors of this proposal and many others, but our formulation differs significantly from the others.

See Lefeuvre et al. (2012a, b) for such a phenomenon, grammar should be a broad coverage, including a basic compositional semantics without any kind of lexical information. We have such a grammar extracted from annotated corpora: it is a broad coverage of multimodal categorical grammar, which is a lexicalized grammar with a simple interface with compositional semantics."}, {"heading": "2.1 The Granularity of the Type System", "text": "We have decided that the assertions that such an undertaking is simply impossible, that compositional semantics should adhere to the sole Mongolian e, and that all refinements should await a phase of pragmatism or interpretation left to the reader as an exercise purposely made by Fodor & Lepore (1998) and more reasonably by Blutner (2002) and refuted by Pustejovsky (1998) and Wilks (2001), are very blunt for a number of theoretical and practical applications.In these cases, however, the type system is more often accepted than not simply accepted. James Pustejosky has described how it should behave in a number of details, in publications such as the Pustejovsky Formula (2001)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Practical Issues with the Controversy", "text": "Although it is philosophically appealing to leave the question open, since the possibility of defining an actual, single metalinguistic ontology contradicts existential principles, there is a very compelling reason to pursue it further: the provision of an actual implementation of a compositional lexical semantic analysis. Partial implementations, including ours outlined in Section 2, exist, but without a comprehensive and well-defined type system, they are largely prototypical and rely on a few handwritten types. While they demonstrate the feasibility of analysis and interest in clarifying the meaning of the word, they cannot yet provide any truly useful analysis outside the scope of very specific areas. Major generic NLP applications remain out of reach. Manual or semi-automatic annotations are difficult because they must be limited to either a very specific area where it is possible to comprehensively define basic types, or a few and therefore be error-prone."}, {"heading": "3 Type Granularity and the Classifier Systems", "text": "That two words of the same syntactical category have different types should characterize a strong difference in semantic behavior. Our type system should be usable, with a mathematically appropriate number of species. It should still be complex enough to model lexical differences. In short, the types used as base types should be small in terms of lexicon; large in terms of lexical differences that are covered if not complete; linguistically and cognitively motivated; adaptable and immune to idiosyncrasies. There are many studies on some linguistic characteristics that may prove interesting candidates for such a group, including grammatical attributes (gender, noun classes...) andmeta-linguistic classes proposed by Goddard & Wierzbicka (2007)."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Case of the Classifier Systems", "text": "A large class of languages uses a specific category of syntactic elements known as classifiers. They are routinely used for quantifying operations, most commonly for counting individuals and measuring mass nouns. Classifiers are also used in sign language (multiple variations) for analog purposes. However, classifiers are interesting because they are used to designate categories of physical objects or abstract concepts and approach a linguistic classification of units. The fact that they arise spontaneously in different and extensive language families makes them good candidates for basic types. Classifiers are often present in many Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Malay, Burmese, Thai, Hmong, Bengali, Munda), in some American and West African languages, and in all sign languages. They are almost not available for Indo-European languages, but for classes."}, {"heading": "3.2 Classifiers in French Sign Language", "text": "Classifiers in sign languages (see Zwitserlood (2012)) are used in language as different pronouns, each applied to cognitively related nouns, in the sense that their form evokes their visual form or the way these entities are used or handled. There are many of them for material objects, people, animals, while ideas and abstract objects are collected in broader classes. Classifiers in sign languages are hand shapes that are used to express physical characteristics, size, position and also the way the classified object moves. Here are a few examples from the French sign language (LSF): hand shape classifier of... horizontal M-hand shape flat object, car, bus (not bicycle) vertical M-hand shape bicycle, horse, fish, Y-hand-shape plane C-hand shape small round or cylindrical object pointing finger up to personalized head 4-hand shape, which is said to form a small fictional object.

Sure, the precise classification systems depend on language, but they obey common general characteristics: it is suggested that the system is cognitive."}, {"heading": "3.5 Integrating Base Types in our Lexicon", "text": "Our system needs basic types to describe lexical species, i.e. classes of entities that differ from each other as semantic units; these types are used to categorize nouns that refer to individuals and form the basic types of our hierarchy; predicates, action nouns, adverbs, and adjectives are defined by complex or functional types that are composed of these varieties.We have seen that classifiers have many desirable properties in describing such classes, especially as they apply to individuals; the coverage provided is extensive, and the classification is linguistically motivated; some classifiers may have an archaic origin or other particular characteristics that make them highly idiosyncratic, but the strength of our system lies in accurately representing these idiosyncrasies, and we think that classifiers represent a solid entry point for the classification required in our lexicon."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "Our type theoretical model of lexical semantics is already implemented in syntax and semantics analyzers based on refinements of Montague grammar and categorical grammars, and it has proven useful for the study of several specific linguistic problems by using limited, handwritten lexicographs. An initial system being tested uses different types for regions, paths, and times, as well as a fictitious traveler, to analyze itineraries in a particular corpus of travel stories, as outlined in Section 2. Developing a complete type system for each of target languages, and thus defining a comprehensive classification of units into one kind, is a necessity for the next step: completing the lexicon and its semantics. The basic types and semantics for the translations needed for our approach can be achieved through these methods or a combination of such languages: 1. by statistical means (but this is a very difficult problem even with a very simple type system."}], "references": [{"title": "Lexical Meaning in Context: a Web of Words", "author": ["N.

As the task is to provide a semantic representation the paths traversed or described by the authors, we focused on spatial and temporal semantics. Temporal semantics is handled by operators \u00e0 la Verkuyl, that have little to do with lexical semantics, so we shall not speak about this in the present paper. But the semantics of space is modelled by the very framework described in the present paper. As expected, the sorts or base types are easier to find for a specific domain or task. For space and motion verbs we obviously have two sorts, namely paths and regions, the later one being subdivided into villages, mountains, and larger areas like mountains chains. Paths did not need to be further divided, since by the time the stories in our corpus were written people only walked on paths (that could be called trails nowadays). Nowadays for the analysing travel stories one would possibly although consider motorways, roads, trails, etc. The principal coercion we study in this setting for the analysis of itineraries is the phenomenon known as fictive motion Talmy (1999).
