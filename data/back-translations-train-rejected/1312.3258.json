However, when it comes to summarizing multiple documents, we can talk about extractive summaries: This technique involves assigning evaluations to some units (e.g. sentences, paragraphs) of the documents and extracting those with the highest scores [8].- Abstractive summary: This technique usually requires information fusion, sentence compression and reformulation."}, {"heading": "B.
