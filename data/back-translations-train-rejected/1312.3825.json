IDENTIFYING PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND ITS SYMPTOMS", "text": "In the last two decades, an increasing number of publications have emerged from fields such as computer science or AI, focusing on the importance of motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease, some of them dedicated to the recognition of individual motor symptoms [63], [66], [54], [7], [45], [39], [21], [14] and others to the recognition of multiple symptoms [57], [15], [55], [50]. These publications show a large number of techniques for automatically indicating the presence of PD motor symptoms (e.g. NNN [30], [5], [21], [16], HMM [54] and SVM [9], [50], [14])."}, {"heading": "2.1.

[56], specificity of 98% and sensitivity of 96.6% were achieved on a dataset with ten patients and ten controls, and a total of almost twenty hours of data were collected by the authors. Two tri-axial gyroscopes (i.e. one on each wrist) were used to record data while participants performed a series of scripted everyday activities; spectral analysis was used to filter out interesting regions within the specific frequency range specific to resting tremors (i.e. 3.5 Hz-7.5 Hz); in a later study [57] based on the same dataset, the data stream was divided into chunks with a length of three seconds; in addition, meta meta analysis was introduced to remove isolated segments classified as patients exhibiting tremor-like behavior."}, {"heading": "2.2.

recognizing motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD). It presents research efforts that were undertaken to inform on how well traditional machine learning algorithms can handle this task. In particular, four PD related motor symptoms are highlighted (i.e. tremor, bradykinesia, freezing of gait and dyskinesia) and their details summarized. Thus the primary objective of this research is to provide a literary foundation for development and improvement of algorithms for detecting PD related motor symptoms.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
