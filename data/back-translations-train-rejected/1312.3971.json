The idea is to install bike stations at various points in the city, from which a registered user can easily loan a bike by removing it from a specialized rack.

Services of this kind are mainly public or semi-public, often aimed at increasing the attractiveness of non-motorized means of transportation, and are usually free, or almost free, of charge for the users. Depending on their location, bike stations have specific patterns regarding when they are empty or full. For instance, in cities where most jobs are located near the city centre, the commuters cause certain peaks in the morning: the central bike stations are filled, while the stations in the outskirts are emptied. Furthermore, stations located on top of a hill are more likely to be empty, since users are less keen on cycling uphill to return the bike, and often leave their bike at a more reachable station. These issues result in substantial user dissatisfaction which may eventually cause the users to abandon the service. This is why nowadays most bike sharing system providers take measures to rebalance them. Over the last few years, balancing bike sharing systems (BBSS) has become increasingly studied in optimization. As such, generating meaningful instance to serve as a benchmark for the proposed approaches is an important task. In this technical report we describe the procedure we used to generate BBSS problem instances from data of the CitiBike NYC bike sharing system.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Dec 2013 22:10:54 GMT  (277kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3971v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tommaso urli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.3971"}, "pdf": {"name": "1312.3971.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Tommaso Urli"], "emails": ["tommaso.urli@uniud.it"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Technical Report Balancing bike sharing systems (BBSS): instance generation from CitiBike NYC data Tommaso Urli tommaso.urli @ uniud.it."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction 1", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2 Instance format 2", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3 Data collection 3", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4 Data processing 4", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5 Instance generation 5", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6 Generator and instances 6", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Bike sharing systems are a very popular means of providing citizens with bicycles in a simple and inexpensive way.

Note, however, that our scope is limited to the static variant of the problem, as such we consider only a valid subset of the instance format. The format for the static BBSS gives for each station the current number of bikes bs, \u2022 the target number of bikes bs, \u2022 the distance from the depots, d, and \u2022 the distance from the stations to each other k ds, k. Please note that this format only describes the state of the bike sharing system, i.e. in a certain sense describes an instance family. Specific instances can be generated by \u2022 the station capacities Cs, \u2022 the vehicle capacities cv, v, V, \u2022 the number of vehicles from the depot V, and \u2022 the vehicle time budget v.1For example, refer the reader to the entire format https / descriptions."}, {"heading": "3 Data collection", "text": "The first step of the instance generation is to collect a sufficient amount of usage data via a bike sharing system. Our preferred selection system is CitiBike NYC2, as it provides full access to the state of the network via a web service in JSON format at any time.3 This is an example of the output of the web service {\"ExecutionTime\": \"2013-11-04 12: 09: 01 AM,\" stationBeanList \": [\" availableDocks \": 21\" totalDocks \": 39\" Longitude \": -73.99392888\" TestStation \": false\" stAddress1 \":\" W 52 St & 11 Ave, \"stationName\": \"W 52 St & 11 Ave,\" landMark \":\", \"latitude\": 40.76727216, \"statusKey\": 1, \"availability ableBikes\": 17, \"id\": 72, \"]."}, {"heading": "4 Data processing", "text": "Weekends were not taken into account because bicycle use is much louder than on weekdays. Analysis shows that there are stations that act as sources at certain times of the day (see Figure 1) and others that act as sinks (see Figure 2). The following fields, which show the distribution of bicycles at a single station throughout the day, show this behavior. It also became clear from some of the distributions that there was an artificial rebalancing during the night between 00: 00 and 06: 00 (dimly visible in Figure 3 at 04: 00). For each station, we first calculated the 1st and 3rd quartiles for all hours of the day."}, {"heading": "5 Instance generation", "text": "Once the displacement of each station is known, it is relatively easy to generate an instance from a snapshot, but there are a few aspects to consider. Selection of the snapshot. To make the instances generated realistic, consider when the reweighting is likely to take place. A good guess is that the reweighting happens overnight, which is also supported by the reweighting step that is visible on some stations (e.g. Figure 3). For our instances, we have chosen midnight as the estimated time for the reweighting to begin, so we have used the 30 midnight snapshots from September 2013 as a starting point. Thus, for each station, the initial number of bikes bs is the actual number of bikes in the station at midnight. Selection of the depot. The information published by CitiBike NYC does not include data about the depot. Of course, this station must be excluded from the choice of the other stations to include them in the instance."}, {"heading": "6 Generator and instances", "text": "Based on the ideas described in the previous section, we have built an instance generator for BBSS, which is available under the generous MIT license at https: / / bitbucket.org / tunnuz / citibike-nyc-generator. In addition, we have created 180 cases of increasing size, which are also available under the same license at https: / / bitbucket.org / tunnuz / citibike-nyc-sept-13. Note that unlike the instances provided by the ADS and AIT websites, the instances generated by our software do not already take into account the loading / unloading times of the bicycle within the travel times. Thus, the distances are real distances, and the loading and unloading times must be added to the cost function. This allows the implementation of various policies, e.g. fixed loading / unloading times or loading times depending on the number of transferred bicycles."}], "references": [{"title": "Balancing the stations of a self service bike hire system", "author": ["Mike Benchimol", "Pascal Benchimol", "Ben\u00f4\u0131t Chappert", "Arnaud De la Taille", "Fabien Laroche", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Meunier", "Ludovic Robinet"], "venue": "RAIRO \u2013 Operations Research,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Bike sharing systems: Solving the static rebalancing problem", "author": ["Daniel Chemla", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Meunier", "Roberto Wolfler Calvo"], "venue": "To appear in Discrete Optimization,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Balancing a Dynamic Public Bike-Sharing System", "author": ["Claudio Contardo", "Catherine Morency", "Louis-Martin Rousseau"], "venue": "Technical Report CIRRELT-2012-09,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Constraint-based approaches for balancing bike sharing systems", "author": ["Luca Di Gaspero", "Andrea Rendl", "Tommaso Urli"], "venue": "The 19th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2013}, {"title": "A hybrid aco+ cp for balancing bicycle sharing systems", "author": ["Luca Di Gaspero", "Andrea Rendl", "Tommaso Urli"], "venue": "In HM\u201913 - The 8th International Workshop on Hybrid Metaheuristics,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Balancing bicycle sharing systems: A variable neighborhood search approach", "author": ["Marian Rainer-Harbach", "Petrina Papazek", "Bin Hu", "G\u00fcnther R.
