Rough sets form a theoretical basis for the problem. Matroids that have been generalized from matrices have been used in many areas, especially in greedy algorithm design, which plays an important role in reducing attributes. Therefore, it makes sense to combine matroids with coarse sets to solve optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce an existing algebraic structure called Dependence Space to investigate the reduction problem in relation to matroids. First, a matroid dependency space is constructed.
