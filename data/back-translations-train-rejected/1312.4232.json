There are many optimization issues in data mining such as attribute reductions. Geometric lattices have been widely used in many fields, especially greedy algorithm design, which plays an important role in attribute reductions. Therefore, it is meaningful to connect coverings with geometric lattices to solve these optimization problems. In this paper, we obtain geometric lattices from coverings through matroids and then apply them to attribute reductions. First, a geometric lattice structure of a covering is constructed through transversal matroids. Then its characteristics, such as atoms and coatoms, are studied and used to describe the lattice. Second, considering that a geometric lattice is the lattice of all the closed sets of a finite matroid, we propose one dependence space through matroids and study the attribute reduction issues of the space, which realizes the application of geometric lattices to attribute reductions. Furthermore, a special type of information system is taken as an example to illustrate the application. In a word, this work points out an interesting view, namely, geometric lattice, to study the attribute reduction issues of information systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Dec 2013 02:30:07 GMT  (39kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4232v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 4 Jan 2014 11:55:51 GMT  (37kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4232v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["aiping huang", "william zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.4232"}, "pdf": {"name": "1312.4232.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Geometric lattice structure of covering and its application to attribute reduction through matroids", "authors": ["Aiping Huang", "William Zhu"], "emails": ["williamfengzhu@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Reduction of coverage decision systems is an important problem in data mining, and coverage-based coarse sentences serve as an efficient technique to address the problem.

Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we review some basic concepts of rough sets, matroids, and geometric grids that represent an equivalent relationship. (Rough setsRough set theory is a new mathematical tool for inaccurate and incomplete data analysis.) It uses equivalence relationships (or partitions) to describe the knowledge we apply in this section. (In this section, we present some concepts of rough sets used in this paper. (Covering and Partition) Let U be a Universe, C a family of subsets of U. If none of the subsets in C is empty and C = U, then C is referred to as the cover of U. The element of C is referred to as the cover block. If P is a cover of U and it is a family of paired subsets of U, then P is referred to as the partition of U. It is clear that a partition is certainly a cover, so the concept of a cover is an extension of the concept of a partition (definition)."}, {"heading": "3.

(First, we construct a space of dependence through a matroid and get all the reductions of space. Secondly, we have constructed the other space of dependence on an information system.)

"abstractText": "The reduction of covering decision systems is an important problem in data mining, and covering-based rough sets serve as an efficient technique to process the problem. Geometric lattices have been widely used in many fields, especially greedy algorithm design which plays an important role in the reduction problems. Therefore, it is meaningful to combine coverings with geometric lattices to solve the optimization problems. In this paper, we obtain geometric lattices from coverings through matroids and then apply them to the issue of attribute reduction. First, a geometric lattice structure of a covering is constructed through transversal matroids. Then its atoms are studied and used to describe the lattice. Second, considering that all the closed sets of a finite matroid form a geometric lattice, we propose a dependence space through matroids and study the attribute reduction issues of the space, which realizes the application of geometric lattices to attribute reduction. Furthermore, a special type of information system is taken as an example to illustrate the application. In a word, this work points out an interesting view, namely, geometric lattice to study the attribute reduction issues of information systems.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
