Introduction", "text": "These model arrangements of different objects or technologies lead to new inventions and modifications in the existing environment for improvement in these areas. Connected Graph, as an important concept of graph theory, is used in iatrology to study the spread of epidemics in a crowd where the vertices represent the persons in the mass and the edges represent the spread of the disease. This model is important to track the spread of the disease, i.e. conducive to its control. Just because graph theory can be used to model different applications, it is widely used by computer applications, especially in data collection [5, 9], image segmentation [7, 12], clustering [3, 4], networking [6], there are many terminologies borrowed from graph theory, largely because it is a streamlining of various terms in the area."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "To facilitate the discussion, some basic concepts related to the coverage of coarse sets, graphs and matroids are reviewed in this section (2.1.). Generalizing a partition that has coverage has more applicability and universality. To begin with, the concept of covering U and the pair (U, C) is referred to as a universe of discourses and C as a family of subsets of U. If none of the subsets in C is empty and C = U, a coverage of U and the pair (U, C) is referred to as a coverage of approximation spaces. Like the two key concepts of covering coarse sets, the lower and upper approximation operators are defined. Definition 2. (Approximation Operators) Let C be referred to as a coverage of U and X U."}, {"heading": "3. The study of the connectedness of graph through covering-based rough sets", "text": "In this section, we will also propose the following approaches to converting a graph into a graph to judge whether a graph is connected or not. To this end, we need to establish a relationship between a graph and a cover. In [10], the following approach to converting a graph into a graph is proposed. Let G = (V, E) be an undirected simple graph. One can define a family F (G) of subsets of V as follows: For all u, v), V (G), V), F (E), uv, E.Definition 3 indicates that a graph can be represented by a family of subsets of V."}, {"heading": "4. An application to connected matroids", "text": "It is well known that when the matroid is induced by a graph, the matroid and the graph have the same interconnectedness. In this section, we propose an approach to induce a graph of any matroid. It is interesting that the graph and the matroid have the same interconnectedness. Therefore, the rough sentences based on the coverage are used to examine the matroid connection. First, the method to turn a matroid into a graph is presented as follows. Definition 4: LetM can be an undirected simple graph (M) = (V, E) defined as follows: (1) V = U (M)."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we discussed the question of linking undirected, simple, and non-isolated vertebrae in relation to coverage-based coarse theorems. In addition, approaches to studying the link between graphs have been applied to studying matroids. Based on the results of this paper, we intend to develop efficient algorithms to determine the link between a graph and that of a matroid, and will examine some other problems of graph theory and matroid theory using coarse theorems."}, {"heading": "6.
