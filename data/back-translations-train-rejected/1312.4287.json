However, when we include this intuition in evidential-theoretical settings, such as those developed in (Governatori et al. 2004; Prakken 2010), in which arguments are defined as trees of consequence, the exchange of arguments means logical theories (consisting of rules) that prove conclusions. Suppose that the argumentation game is based on a finite set of indisputable facts and a finite set of rules: facts first lead to rules, and this leads to the construction of evidence for letters. If R and F are common knowledge of Pr and Op, successful strategies are based on a finite set of indisputable facts and a finite set of rules."}, {"heading": "3 Related Work", "text": "Although the game-like nature of arguments and debates reflects the long-term interaction between proponents and opponents, other types of argumentation strategies have been used in AI argumentation literature and in game theory for both extensive information (one exception in this second perspective is (Glazer and Rubinstein 2001)). Most existing game theory studies of argumentation in AI, such as (Procaccia and Rosenschein 2005; Matt and Toni 2008; Riveret al. 2008; Rahwan and Larson 2009; Grossi and van der Hoek 2013) take place in Dung's abstract argumentation paradigm, while (Roth et al. 2007), although work on argumentation mantics in connection with Dung's argumentation methods is developing capabilities, develop a framework in which the logical internal structure of arguments is explicitly set out. (Matt and Toni 2008) presents an idea of argumentation strength within the class of the games of strategy. The measurement of the strength of an argument stems from the confrontation of strategy-opponent and a game of strategy-repeated strategy-strategy-strategy-over-strategy-strategy-strategy."}, {"heading": "4 Logic", "text": "In this section, we will introduce the two logic used in this essay: the first is the logic used in a dialogue game, which is the logic used to present the players \"knowledge, the structure of the arguments, and to perform reasoning; we call this logic\" argumentation logic \"and use the Defeasible Logic of (Antoniou et al. 2001); (Governatori et al. 2004) provides the relationship between this logic (and some of its variants) and abstract reasoning; and (Thakur et al. 2007) shows how to use this logic for dialogue games; and the second logic, called agent logic, is the logic in which the\" problem of restoration of sociality \"(a well-known NP-concluded problem) (Governatori and Rotolo 2008) was formulated; it is included in this essay to show how to reduce the problem of restoring sociality into the strategic problem of reasoning, thereby proving that the logic is also a later problem that can be accomplished with this great agent."}, {"heading": "4.1 Argumentation Logic", "text": "It is not possible to draw a conclusion, but it can not be used to draw any conclusion.

Although it is outside the scope of this essay how strategic dialogues can be analyzed in game theory terms, our research efforts precede this analysis, since they examine the calculation costs for the logical characterization of the problem, that any argumentation game with incomplete information potentially increases. We have shown that the problem of deciding which rules to play (\"Strategic Argumentation Problem\") is NP-complete even when the problem of restoring a given theory (incomplete) potentially raises a problem with incomplete information."}], "references": [{"title": "A family of defeasible reasoning logics and its implementation", "author": ["Antoniou"], "venue": "ECAI", "citeRegEx": "Antoniou,? \\Q2000\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Antoniou", "year": 2000}, {"title": "Representation results for defeasible logic", "author": ["Antoniou"], "venue": "ACM Transactions on Computational Logic 2(2):255\u2013287", "citeRegEx": "Antoniou,? \\Q2001\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Antoniou", "year": 2001}, {"title": "An inclusion theorem for defeasible logics", "author": ["Billington"], "venue": "ACM Trans.
