{"id": "1312.4617", "review": {"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "17-Dec-2013", "title": "A Survey of Data Mining Techniques for Social Media Analysis", "abstract": "Social Media in the last decade has gained remarkable attention. This is attributed to the affordability of accessing social network sites such as Twitter, Google+, Facebook and other social network sites through the internet and the web 2.0 technologies. Many people are becoming interested in and relying on the SM for information and opinion of other users on diverse subject matters. It is important to translate sentiment expressed by SM users to useful information using data mining techniques [39]. This underscores the importance of data mining techniques on SM. Data mining techniques are capable of handling the three dominant research issues with SM data which are size, noise and dynamism. This paper reviews data mining techniques currently in use on analysing SM and looked at other data mining techniques that can be considered in the field.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 02:53:38 GMT  (900kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4617v1", "22 pages, 8 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Apr 2014 23:20:08 GMT  (1042kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4617v2", "25 pages, 9 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL", "authors": ["mariam adedoyin-olowe", "mohamed medhat gaber", "frederic stahl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.4617"}, "pdf": {"name": "1312.4617.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Survey of Data Mining Techniques for Social Media Analysis", "authors": ["Mariam Adedoyin-Olowe", "Mohamed Medhat Gaber", "Frederic Stahl"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move."}, {"heading": "4.1 Research Issues and Challenges in Sentiment Analysis on SM", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to decide for themselves what they want to do, and they are able to decide what they want to do."}, {"heading": "6.1.1 Sentiment Lexicon", "text": "This is a dictionary of sentimental words that reviewers often use in their terms. Sentiment lexicon is a list of the most common words that improve data mining techniques in the use of sensation lexicon in documents. Various corpuses of sensation lexicon can be created for a variety of topics. Sentimental words used in sports often differ from those used in politics. Expanding the occurrence of sensation lexicon helps to focus more on the analysis of topic-specific events, but using high manpower [29]. Lexicon-based approaches require analysis to work on simple, comparative, compound, conditional sentences and questions [26]. Sentiment lexicon can be expanded by using synonyms. Nevertheless, by using synonyms, the dictionary extension has a disadvantage that the formulation may not lose its primary meaning positively after a few expressions of sensitivity may also be negatively expressed. \""}, {"heading": "6.1.2 Opinion Definition and Opinion Summarization", "text": "Extensive information poses a challenge to automatic summarization. Opinion definition and opinion summary are essential techniques for identifying opinions. Opinion definition can be found in a text, sentence, or topic in a document; it can also be found throughout the document. Opinion summary summarizes various opinions expressed during the writing process by analyzing the polarities, degree, and related events [46]. This approach is examined through intermediate sentences. Opinion extraction is critical for summarization and subsequent tracking. Texts, topics, and documents are searched to filter out the opinion-forming part. It is necessary to summarize opinion, as not all opinions expressed in a document may be relevant to consider them. Opinion summary is useful for companies and governments alike, as it helps to improve strategies and products [25], [55]. It also helps maintain excess information [76]."}, {"heading": "6.1.3 Sentiment Orientation (SO)", "text": "Widely used products are likely to attract thousands of reviews, which can make it more difficult for potential buyers to follow viable reviews that can help in decision making. On the other hand, sellers use SO for their standard of rating in other areas to protect irrelevant or misleading reviews submitted to evaluators on the 5-star scale. [82] SO was used to improve the performance of mood classification. Livejournal's blog corpus data set was used to train and evaluate the methodology used. The paper presented a modular, competent hierarchical classification technique that could be easily implemented along with SO attributes and machine learning techniques. The initial result of classification accuracy was only slightly above the baseline, as it was an initial approach. Subsequently, a flexible hierarchical mood classification approach was integrated into the mood classification, taking into account all possible mood markings still present in the blog, the latter showing that mood markers are present in spite of a number of distinct domain attributes."}, {"heading": "6.1.4 Opinion Extraction", "text": "Sentiment analysis deals with the determination and classification of the subjective information contained in a material [79]. This may not necessarily be fact-based, since people have different feelings about the same product, service, topic, event, or person. Opinion extraction is necessary to address the exact part of the document in which the real opinion is expressed. Opinion extraction is necessary because the number of people expressing their opinion on a particular topic does not count unless the individual is an authority in the field of the subject. Nevertheless, the opinion of several entities requires both opinion extraction and summary [51]. Opinion extraction is necessary because the number of people expressing their opinion on a particular topic makes it all the more important that part of it can be extracted. Sentiment / Opinion can target a particular article, while on the other hand two or more articles can be compared. Formal opinion is a regular opinion, whereas the latter is comparative [51]."}, {"heading": "6.1.5 Basic Clustering Techniques", "text": "K-Means and hierarchical agglomeration can be used to analyze small text documents. The k of the cluster is entered into the k-Means algorithm, which determines the declared k in the document and in subsequent documents.13 The coordinates in the vector space are first randomly grouped, then iteratively, with each text document entered assigned to the strongest cluster.The coordinates in the vector space are recalculated and stand at the center of all documents assigned to the cluster.However, the experiment had to be repeated until a stable result.It was decided that even if the N dimensions have only two probable values (positive and negative), the number of documents entered is always too insignificant to populate any of the 2 N potential cells in the vector space.This mark of most dimensions is not feasible for similarity calculations with it, making it difficult to identify the inadequacy."}, {"heading": "6.1.6 Using Clustering for Opinion Formation", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "6.3 Supervised Classification", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves and are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves."}], "references": [{"title": "A Methodology for Temporal Analysis of Evolving Concepts in Twitter", "author": ["M.
