Cross-country resource sharing [7] solves the problem of the same policy of origin by adding an HTTP reply header to allow open access across domain boundaries.

They are used to add commonly accepted namespace prefix declarations to syntaxes such as notation 3. Unfortunately, prefix declarations of certain or newly created vocabulary are not to be found in this seed list. However, to provide meaningful prefixes for unknown vocabularies, our service integrates the Prefix.cc25 lookup service as a fallback solution, using the service's reverse lookup function to obtain the appropriate namespace prefix. Specifically, the service first checks whether a vocabulary is already in the list of vocabularies known to RDFLib. If not, it claims that the prefix of the vocabulary URI from prefix.cc. The nice side effect of this solution is that someone who creates an oncfix can immediately reset the prefix under the prefix.DF and then register the prefix."}, {"heading": "4 Use Cases", "text": "These requirements range from technical solutions to active user support during the development and testing of Semantic Web artifacts.

The web service is intended as a comprehensive solution for translation between the most popular serialization formats currently available on the Semantic Web. Our proposal focuses not only on the technical aspects of supporting the development of popular RDF data formats with syntax transformability, but also on collaborative aspects of the development process. What makes our solution unique among the web services presented in Section 2 is the combination of features such as the bi-directional conversion capability of a number of popular RDF data formats, the possibility of syntax highlighting for all supported serialization formats, linking functionalities for better collaboration, a clean and 27 http: / / www.stalsoft.com / gromestraightforward web user interface with active user support, and adherence to innovative web technologies from Web latenables us to update the Web libraries that are frequently available to our libraries, the 11DF libraries."}], "references": [{"title": "Cool URIs don\u2019t change", "author": ["T.
