Introduction:", "text": "There are some approaches based on the most interesting techniques we have found in recent years."}, {"heading": "2. Proposed Method:", "text": "The authors [8] reported in their experimental results that from the raw words, snowball comes [13], pseudo comes and 4-grams, the trend was for 4-grams the best performance. 4-grams, the initial 4 characters of a word - best representation of a word. This strengthens our understanding that for a valid (not from a strict linguistic standpoint) and nicely approximated originate, it should start from the (i.e. words internal N-grams) we roughly exclude from the frequencies of 4-grams, 5-grams, 6-grams and so on? Seems to be a promising direction. Our idea is to take 4-grams as our initial guess to find the stem. Obviously, this excludes words with the length 3 or less. This would be a breathtaking advantage, since many of the stopwords are of length 3 or less long. Well, for a particular word we are using a specific word, what we are left with 5-gram, and 5-invisibility."}, {"heading": "3. Design of Experiments:", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to go in search of a solution that fulfils their purpose: they need to put themselves in a position to find a solution that will enable them to put themselves in a position, to put themselves in a position, to find a solution that will enable them to put themselves in a position, to find a solution that will enable them to put themselves in a position, to put themselves in a position, to put themselves in a position, to entangle themselves in a position in which they will be able to find a solution that will enable them to find a solution, that will enable them to find a solution, that will enable them to find a solution, that will enable them to find a solution, that will enable them to find a solution, that will enable them to find a solution, that will enable them to find a solution, that will allow them to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution."}, {"heading": "4. Experimental Results:", "text": "If we do the Wilcoxon test using our sample data, we get the p-value of 0.54. As p > 0.05 we cannot refute the null hypothesis H0. Thus, we have strong evidence that our N-gram stamp is not inferior to Porter's stamp."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions:", "text": "We tried to modify a statistical stem cell method and came up with one whose results are comparable to those of a known linguistic strain. 58 out of 100 stem cells generated were identical and 22 stem cells differ only by one sign. Since a language-neutral approach is always preferable to a technique that is exciting and promising, further work may lead to testing our approach with languages other than English."}, {"heading": "6.
