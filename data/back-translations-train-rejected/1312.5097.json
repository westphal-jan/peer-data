It was originally released on the Namco Pac-Man Arcade System. Since then, Pac-Man has been one of the most popular and best-known video games of all time, a true arcade classic. Ms. Pac-Man is a variant of the original game that was released in 1982 and has the same rules and goals as the original Pac-Man. The only difference between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man (with the exception of the bow) is that the ghosts in Ms. Pac-Man are not deterministic in contrast to the deterministic ghosts in Pac-Man. This is a very important distinction because a player could simply remember the path the ghosts would take, and thus beat the original game. By introducing non-determinism, Ms. Pac-Man will be much more difficult, players will have to adapt to the ghosts and be reactive."}, {"heading": "2.1.1 Rules of Ms. Pac-Man", "text": "Ms. Pac-Man is a very simple game. You (as a player) have to move the Pac-Man (yellow figure) through the maze and collect all the pills (small white dots) and power pills (big white dots) while avoiding the ghosts (red, white, blue and pink figures) at all times. Once all the pills have been collected, you would advance to the next level or maze, but if you come into contact with a ghost at any time, you lose a life. If you lose all your life, the game is over. If you consume a pill, your score increases, if a power pill is consumed, the ghosts become edible, so that you can consume them and earn extra points once a ghost is consumed, it returns to the ghost cave and becomes unedible (until another power pill is consumed)."}, {"heading": "2.1.2 Ms. Pac-Man vs Ghosts", "text": "The contest Ms. Pac-Man vs. Ghosts League [7] is a competition held at the aforementioned conferences.

This simulator is a relatively new addition to the competition, in which a close-up method was used to extract game state data. In this method, a game by Ms. Pac-Man with the competing AI controller was considered to be running its entire game state from a large screen before it could even call up the next game state."}, {"heading": "2.2 Cellular Automata", "text": "Cellular automata (CA's) are nature-inspired systems that can induce incredibly complex behavior through simple, localized interactions between cells. Cells are components of a larger system - a cell lattice (or array). Each cell contains a discrete value that can be manipulated by a set of rules, which usually take into account the neighbors of the cell. Stephen Wolfram explains that cellular automata are \"mathematical idealizations of physical systems in which space and time are discrete and physical quantities assume a finite set of discrete values.\" [9] A cell can be used to model many different systems in any number of dimensions - although normally only 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D. An update to CA means that the cells in the CA have updated their values according to a set of rules. The values that a cell can take on, and the rules associated with it, depend entirely on application or implementation. What is true, however, is that any simple global CA that can only produce complex, self-organic behavior."}, {"heading": "2.3 Previous Approaches", "text": "There have been numerous different approaches to designing Ms. Pac-Man agents, some very successful, some less so.

Average, minimum and maximum scores will be recorded along with the standard deviation for each controller. By playing this number of games, hopefully the gamble will be reduced and an accurate representation of the performance of the controller will be achieved.

A potential improvement in the static update parameter could be to introduce a dynamic one, and the number of CA updates performed at each game step could be changed to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

They are challenging and non-deterministic, this makes it very difficult to write strong AI players. An example of such a video game is Ms. Pac-Man. In this paper I will outline some of the previous techniques used to build AI controllers for Ms. Pac-Man as well as presenting a new and novel solution. My technique utilises a Cellular Automaton (CA) to build a representation of the environment at each time step of the game. The basis of the representation is a 2-D grid of cells. Each cell has a state and a set of rules which determine whether or not that cell will dominate (i.e. pass its state value onto) adjacent cells at each update. Once a certain number of update iterations have been completed, the CA represents the state of the environment in the game, the goals and the dangers. At this point, Ms. Pac-Man will decide her next move based only on her adjacent cells, that is to say, she has no knowledge of the state of the environment as a whole, she will simply follow the strongest path. This technique shows promise and allows the controller to achieve high scores in a live game, the behaviour it exhibits is interesting and complex. Moreover, this behaviour is produced by using very simple rules which are applied many times to each cell in the grid. Simple local interactions with complex global results are truly achieved.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
