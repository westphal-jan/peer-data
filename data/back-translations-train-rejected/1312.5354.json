ECG waveform segments of duration 0.5-4 s, their Fourier magnitude spectra, and lower dimensional projections of Fourier magnitude spectra were used for classification. All considered representations were of much higher dimension than in published studies. Classification accuracy improved with segment duration up to 2 s, with 4 s providing little improvement. We found that it is possible to discriminate between ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation by the present approach with much shorter runs of ECG (2 s, minimum 86% sensitivity per class) than previously imagined. Ensembles of classifiers acting on 1 s segments taken over 5 s observation windows gave best results, with sensitivities of detection for all classes exceeding 93%.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Dec 2013 22:08:07 GMT  (368kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5354v1", "9 pages, 2 tables, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 28 Jul 2014 09:44:01 GMT  (370kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5354v2", "9 pages, 2 tables, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 2 tables, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.LG", "authors": ["yaqub alwan", "zoran cvetkovic", "michael curtis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.5354"}, "pdf": {"name": "1312.5354.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Classification of Human Ventricular Arrhythmia in High Dimensional Representation Spaces", "authors": ["Yaqub Alwan", "Michael J.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS", "text": "In view of an ECG segment x = {x [n], n1 \u2264 n \u2264 n2}, it is desirable to be able to call it SR, VT or VF. For comparison, the presentation of phase space characteristics proposed in [13] is considered in this paper, as the authors conducted a thorough investigation and demonstrated their superior performance in terms of accuracy and numerical complexity compared to previously published algorithms."}, {"heading": "A. Reference prior art", "text": "The Phase Space Algorithm (PSA) [13] aims to diagnose whether a defibrillation shock should be administered, which is equivalent to classifying ECG segments as AF or not. Phase representation is formed by taking discretized values from samples of x as pairs (x1 [n], x2 [n]) in R2, selecting Ex1 [n] = x [n] x2 [n \u2212 k] while k is selected to correspond to 0.5 s1. The discretization step is chosen so that the entire range of x1 [n] and x2 [n] each reaches up to 401 unique values. The number N (x) of boxes visited in this phase space is then found, and finally the ratio (x) (x) to N (x)."}, {"heading": "B. Observation length", "text": "One of the important questions that needs to be investigated is the appropriate observation length for a reliable classification of cardiac arrhythmias. Longer windows contain more information, and this should lead to a higher classification accuracy, to the point where an increasing observation length does not provide additional discriminatory information. However, this plateau may be followed by a decrease in classification accuracy if the windows are long enough to include transitions between ECG classes. For a quick and reliable diagnosis, it is of interest to simultaneously minimize the observation length and maximize classification accuracy. However, a systematic investigation of this problem is lacking in previous studies. The phase space method in its original formulation counts the number of boxes visited over 8 s segments of ECG signals. Several other studies also form their respective feature vectors using 8 s observations [12], 6 s observations [9], or over 5 s observations."}, {"heading": "C. Dimension reduction", "text": "In order to avoid any distortion due to prejudice about which characteristics are relevant for arrhythmia classification, classification is considered as a starting point directly in the range of ECG waveforms. Furthermore, Fourier size spectra of ECG segments are taken into account as they provide time-changing representations, while most of the information contained in the original waveforms is preserved. At 100 Hz sampling, which is close to the minimum sampling frequency, which does not cause obvious distortions of ECG signals, the 4 s observation length results in a 400-dimensional feature space (or 200-dimensional space when size spectra are taken into account), which can complicate statistical conclusions. This is resolved by using data-driven dimension reduction based on PCA. We conducted PCA based on size spectra of each individual class and formed groups of base vectors by merging the top components of each main class, since each upper class requires at least 5% of energy for each upper class."}, {"heading": "III. CLASSIFICATION USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES", "text": "Faced with a set of training data (x1,.., xp) with corresponding class names (y1,. |., yp), an SVM tries to find a decision interface that collectively maximizes the distance between the two classes and minimizes the misclassification error on the training set. If the classes are linearly separable, these surfaces are linear and have the shape f (x) = \u2211 iaiyi < x, xi > + b = 0, ai R + (1), where < \u00b7, \u00b7 > is the inner product in Rn, while the lagrange multipliers ai and bias b are optimized by the training algorithm. Non-linear separators between two classes are generated using non-linear core functions K (\u00b7, \u00b7), where the radial function K (\u00b7, \u00b7) is faulty. These functions calculate inner products in 4 higher dimensional spaces without explicitly performing the mapping."}, {"heading": "A. Optimising SVM parameters", "text": "The idea is to avoid the selection of parameters that are too finely tuned to the training data, while still giving good classification performance on invisible examples (test data). For SVMs that control either the width of the Gaussian function or RBF kernels, these parameters have been chosen to increase the flexibility of the decision limit, while large values of flexibility lead to a decrease in the flexibility of the decision limit, d: polynomial parameters that increase the flexibility of the decision limit, and when small values increase the flexibility of the decision limit, while large values of flexibility lead to a decrease in flexibility, d: polynomial parameters that increase the flexibility of the decision limit, and when small, decreasing flexibility of the decision limit reduce the flexibility of the decision limit."}, {"heading": "B. Multiclass classification using SVMs", "text": "For multi-class discrimination, binary SVM classifiers can be combined using predefined error correction methods. (19), [20] To briefly summarize the procedure, N-binary classifiers are trained to distinguish between M classes by using an encoding matrix WM \u00b7 N, with elements wmn, {0, 1, \u2212 1}. The classifier n is trained only on data of classes m, for which wmn 6 = 0, with sgn (wmn) as class designation. Then the class assignment rule is set to C (x) = argmin mN, n = 1o (wmnfn (x), (9) where fn (x) is the output of the ninth classifier and represents a certain loss function."}, {"heading": "C. Classifier ensembles", "text": "Ensembles or committees of classifiers can often be combined to improve classification accuracy [18]. To this end, we looked at ensembles of decision values of binary SVM classifiers applied to ECG segments of a certain length, with values changing incrementally to each other, e.g. 2 s segments taken over 4 s intervals with 0.5 s layers to form ensembles of 5 decision values, and the mean of the decision values was then used as the corresponding value of fn (x) in the loss decoding according to (9)."}, {"heading": "IV.

CONCLUSION", "text": "A systematic study of the classification of the ECG rhythm was presented to develop methods for the precise classification between SR, VT and VF. Classification took place in the space of ECG waveforms, their size spectra and low-dimensional approximations of size spectra using projections onto their main component spaces. All display spaces are considered to be of much larger dimensions than in previous studies. We found that classification accuracy improves with an observation length of up to about 2 s, reaching a plateau that is significantly shorter than in previous studies [9], [12], [13]. Since AF can be very short-lived in some animal models, this can support translational research.Among the considered display spaces and classification methods, magnetic spectra and SVM classifiers with RBF nuclei achieved the highest accuracy. Combined, they achieved the classification accuracy of 91% and the sensitivity of at least 86% of the EG2 for each segment of use only."}], "references": [{"title": "Who \u2014 the top 10 causes of death", "author": ["W.H.

ventricular tachycardia by means of support vector machines in different representation spaces, using different observation lengths. ECG waveform segments of duration 0.5-4 s, their Fourier magnitude spectra, and lower dimensional projections of Fourier magnitude spectra were used for classification. All considered representations were of much higher dimension than in published studies. Classification accuracy improved with segment duration up to 2 s, with 4 s providing little improvement.We found that it is possible to discriminate between ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation by the present approach with much shorter runs of ECG (2 s, minimum 86% sensitivity per class) than previously imagined. Ensembles of classifiers acting on 1 s segments taken over 5 s observation windows gave best results, with sensitivities of detection for all classes exceeding 93%.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
