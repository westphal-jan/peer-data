We present a Skolemization algorithm for model counting problems that eliminates existential quantifiers from a first-order logic theory without changing its weighted model count. For certain subsets of first-order logic, lifted model counters were shown to run in time polynomial in the number of objects in the domain of discourse, where propositional model counters require exponential time. However, these guarantees apply only to Skolem normal form theories (i.e., no existential quantifiers) as the presence of existential quantifiers reduces lifted model counters to propositional ones. Since textbook Skolemization is not sound for model counting, these restrictions precluded efficient model counting for directed models, such as probabilistic logic programs, which rely on existential quantification. Our Skolemization procedure extends the applicability of first-order model counters to these representations. Moreover, it simplifies the design of lifted model counting algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 00:40:56 GMT  (35kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5378v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 13:50:15 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5378v2", "To appear in Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR), Vienna, Austria, July 2014"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["guy van den broeck", "wannes meert", "adnan darwiche"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.5378"}, "pdf": {"name": "1312.5378.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Skolemization for Weighted First-Order Model Counting", "authors": ["Guy Van den Broeck", "Wannes Meert", "Adnan Darwiche"], "emails": ["guyvdb@cs.ucla.edu", "wannes.meert@cs.kuleuven.be", "darwiche@cs.ucla.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 131 2.53 78v2 [cs.AI] 5M ar2 01"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "2 Weighted First-Order Model Counting", "text": "We start with the formal definition of the task of the first-order weighted model counting, compare it with the propositional weighted model counting and discuss existing algorithms."}, {"heading": "Background", "text": "During this work, we will work with the non-functional fragment of the finite domain of first-order logic (FOL), which we will now briefly examine.

We use y to denote a sequence of logical variables. A letter is an atom or its negation. A formula combines atoms with logical connectors and quantifiers. A logical variable x is quantified when enclosed by an x or x. A free variable is one that cannot be quantified. A sentence is a formula without free variables.

Approximate WMC algorithms use local search (Wei and Selman 2005) or random samples (Gogate and Dechter 2011). More recently, algorithms have been introduced that directly solve the WFOMC task. They take a WFOMC problem and automatically generate and evaluate the expression types shown in the previous section. Their elementary operations include exponentiation, summation and binomical coefficients. They are referred to as cancelled inference algorithms. Specifically, two cancelled algorithms for exact WFOMC have been proposed, one based on primary knowledge compilation (Van den first Datgate 2011 and Van den Datgate 2011)."}, {"heading": "Normal Forms", "text": "We distinguish the following normal forms of the first order. - A theory in the Prenex clause form consists of formulas Q1x1,..., Qnxn, \u03c6, where each Qi is either a universal or existential quantifier and \u03c6 is quantifiable-free. - A theory of the first order in the Prenex clause form is a theory in the Prenex normal form, where \u03c6 is a clause. - A theory in the Skolem normal form is a theory in the Prenex normal form, in which all Qi are universal quantifiers. - A theory of the first order in the Scolem clause form is a theory in the Prenex normal form, in which \u03c6 is a clause."}, {"heading": "3 Skolemization for WFOMC", "text": "It is known that you can take any formula and convert it into prenex clausal form.

This approach has a caveat: The elimination of x, \u03c6 (x, y) adds an additional expression to the expression \u00ac \u03c6 (x, y). If we eliminate quantifiers from left to right, \u03c6 (x, y) itself may contain quantifiers, which introduces new quantifiers in \u00ac \u03c6 (x, y) and causes an explosion due to duplication in the newly added formulas. This can be avoided by eliminating quantifiers from right to left, that is, from the innermost to the outermost margin. We can show the following sentence, the proof of which is in the Appendix.

Our treatment is based on the provision of WFOMC encodings of these representations to which our scolemization technique is then applied. 6Consider a first-order probabilistic model that induces the distribution PrD (.) for domain D. A WFOMC coding of this model is a triple coding (\u0432, w, w, w, w, w, w, w) which guarantees that for each sentence \u03c6 (usually a connection of literature) and domain D that we have PrFOD = FOMC."}, {"heading": "Markov Logic Networks", "text": "We will now introduce a WFOMC coding for Markov logic networks (MLN) (Richardson and Domingos 2006).Representation An MLN is a series of tuples (w, \u043d), where w is a real number representing a weight and vice versa is a formula of first order (Richardson and Domingos 2006).Representation An MLN is a series of tuples (w, \u043d), where w is a real number representing a weight and vice versa is a formula of first order.

In particular, we can now talk about set classes for which an algorithm is overridden in the size of D domain. We say that the algorithm for these classes is complete. We can also talk about classes of sentences for which there exists, or for which there can be no domain-upscale algorithm.

Our scolemization algorithm introduces negative weights, which may seem strange when interpreted as negative probabilities, a problem that has been discussed before. For example, Feynman (1987) writes: \"Negative probabilities allow for an abstract calculation that allows the freedom to perform mathematical calculations in any order that greatly simplifies analysis.\" However, the potential of negative probabilities has already been observed by Jha and Suciu (2012) to answer queries in probability databases and serve as inspiration for our approach. Probabilistic databases (Suciu et al. 2011) are basically a type of first-order probability models. It can be considered a special type of weighted models that count a problem (\u0430, w), with the weight function encoding the probability w (t) with which a multiple can be found in the database."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "In this thesis, we have introduced a scolemization method suitable for weighted model counting of the first order.

Imagine that the sentences have an internal quantifier number of m \u2212 1 at most. However, new sentences are added that contain the Tseitin and scolem predicates and expressions (x, y). These sentences also have an internal quantifier number of m \u2212 1. Imagine that the sentences have an internal quantifier number of mmax at most. Applying scolemization to a quantifier in each sentence reduces the maximum internal quantifier number to a maximum of mmax \u2212 1. Thus, reducing the quantifier number is a quantifier.

Probabilistic databases (Suciu et al. 2011) are fundamentally a type of first-order probabilistic model. It can be viewed as a special type of weighted model counting problem (\u2206, w), where the weight function encodes the probability w(t) with which a tuple t can be found in the database. A query on such a database is typically a union of conjunctive queries (UCQ), which corresponds to a monotone DNF sentence \u2206. A noticeable difference with most WMC solvers (and WFOMC) is that the solvers for probabilistic databases expect the theory \u2206 to be in DNF instead of CNF. Different from WFOMC is that although the query (i.e., \u2206) is firstorder, the weight function is defined on the propositional level like in WMC. Weights are thus assigned to ground literals (the tuples) whereas for WFOMC weights are assigned to predicates (the tables). This allows WFOMC to exploit more types of symmetries.

We present a Skolemization algorithm for model counting problems that eliminates existential quantifiers from a first-order logic theory without changing its weighted model count. For certain subsets of first-order logic, lifted model counters were shown to run in time polynomial in the number of objects in the domain of discourse, where propositional model counters require exponential time. However, these guarantees apply only to Skolem normal form theories (i.e., no existential quantifiers) as the presence of existential quantifiers reduces lifted model counters to propositional ones. Since textbook Skolemization is not sound for model counting, these restrictions precluded efficient model counting for directed models, such as probabilistic logic programs, which rely on existential quantification. Our Skolemization procedure extends the applicability of first-order model counters to these representations. Moreover, it simplifies the design of lifted model counting algorithms.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
