Here, too, the vector \u03b1 of discount factors is used, but here they can also be defined for overlapping sets.

CONSERVATIVE, OPTIMISTIC AND PROPORTIONAL DISCOUNTING", "text": "As a starting point for the conception of a discounting operation, a few hypotheses have been put forward: first, the information source S should excessively promote a number of solutions A, and therefore m (A) should be discounted by the factor \u03b1A, which corresponds to A. The behavior of the new discounting operation should resemble the behavior of the classical discounting, conflict mass m (\u2205) should be discounted, and new schemes should generalize the classical discounting factor. Furthermore, the determination of a non-zero discounting factor for fixed imbalances should entail the discounting of the mass attributed to the economy, while masses of sets that have no elements in common with the economy should remain unchanged. Such behavior is contrary to the contextual discounting proposed by Mercier et al. [6], which maintains the mass attributed to the economy, and other sets that we consider counterintuitively, especially in the case of many classes, but agree with the [3] suggested in the example."}, {"heading": "A. Notation", "text": "In the following sections, we will adhere to a notation similar to that in Section II. In order to distinguish the proposed discounting operations between them and avoid any confusion with existing systems, \u03b1c, \u0430 m will denote a conservative discounting of a bba m using the discounting vector \u03b1, which is defined for all elements of the discounting principle. If the group of classes for which discounting factors are defined is obvious or unimportant, the notation \u03b1c m will correspond to a discounting method. Finally, the analogous convention will be used for other types of discounting. Likewise, we will simplify notation by omitting the type of discounting (c for conservative, p for proportional, or o for optimistic) when an equation is valid for all types of discounting."}, {"heading": "B. Conservative discounting", "text": "As already mentioned, the assignment of m (A) by source S is exaggerated, and this mass should be discounted by \u03b1A. Let us now assume that some meta-knowledge additionally states that the stress on masses of supersets of A by source S depends to a large extent on class A. In view of the above statement, the mass attributed to AB should be discounted in the same way as m (A). Therefore, with conservative discounting, the empty set and all sets that have at least one element in common with source S are obtained by the same factor. In any case, a general consideration of this behavior results in: \u03b1 c m (N) = m (N) \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b2 (17) \u03b1 \u00b2 m (A) = m (A) \u00b7 maximum possible discounting (A)."}, {"heading": "C. Optimistic discounting", "text": "Optimistic discounting is based on a hypothesis that differs from the conservative discounting hypothesis. This time, the meta-information on source S states that masses of supersets of A are affected independently of class A. These masses must not be discounted by \u03b1A. On the other hand, all subsets of A will be affected in the same way as A. This kind of discounting can be expressed for any type of superset of A by: \u03b1 o m (\u2205) = m (\u2205) \u00b7 1 \u2212 (20) \u03b1 o m (A) = m (A) \u00b7 1 - (A)."}, {"heading": "D. Proportional discounting", "text": "The schemes proposed above represent two extremes of discounting strategies. Conservative means accepting the possibility that the mass of a superset (e.g. AB) fully corresponds to one of its components (e.g. A), which has otherwise been overestimated and should therefore be discounted. Conversely, if one assumes that the mass of a superset depends on a quantity that has not been overestimated (e.g. B), an optimistic discounting is used. Such behavior can be considered optimistic or bold, because any doubt as to whether a certain amount should be discounted or not implies a negative response. As the above schemes are the extreme cases, the need for an incidence between the solution seems natural. One way to do this without resorting to a mass-dependent calculation is to consider the discounting rate by some measure of dependence between a certain quantity and not implicit."}, {"heading": "IV.

The first part shows some postulates about the time discounting itself. Next, the existing contextual discounting scheme is applied to the time discounting. Finally, the application of the proposed methods is demonstrated."}, {"heading": "A. Postulates", "text": "The postulates below imply that the temporal discounting should be subject to exponential decay, similar to the process of radioactive decay described by Ernest Rutherford at the beginning of the 19th century [14].

Temporal discounting using proposed discounting schemes", "text": "In contrast to the contextual discounting, the proposed methods are meaningful enough to reflect the desired behavior of the temporal discounting. Let us use the same two cases mentioned in section VI-B6. Both methods have in common the calculation of the decay parameters \u03bb and \u0445. Furthermore, the discount rate vector values \u03b1 correspond directly to the values of \u0445 as shown: \u03b11 = [\u03c91 7 \u2192 0.0025, \u03c92 7 \u2192 0.5, \u03c93 7 \u2192 0.8312] (66) \u03b12 = [\u03c91 7 \u2192 0.5743, \u03c92 7 \u2192 0.5, \u03c93 7 \u2192 0.8312] (67) Tables II and III show 3 different discounting methods for the two cases analyzed."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES", "text": "In this article, we have proposed and defined three types of contextual discounting: conservative, proportional and optimistic. These methods allow fine-grained modelling of the reliability of the sources. In addition, the techniques introduced can be applied to the temporal discounting, which has also been described. It has been shown that the existing contextual discounting introduced by Mercier [3] is not strong enough to model temporal discounting. In addition to the applications already outlined, the authors consider the use of temporal discounting in the context of intelligent transport perception. Different object classes seen from a vehicle should not be forgotten at the same tempo. For example, information on objects identified as buildings should be kept longer than static, but possibly mobile objects. Conversely, moving static objects would persist longer than moving objects. As a practical advantage, it can be mentioned that for a given discount rate vector, factors by which masses are multiplied can be pre-stored to obtain mass discounted and later use."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This work was supported by the French Ministry of Defence DGA (Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Armement) with a doctoral scholarship to Marek Kurdej."}], "references": [{"title": "Data fusion in the Transferable Belief Model", "author": ["P.

Classical discounting is shown to be a special case of these schemes. Two motivating cases are discussed: modelling of source reliability and application to temporal discounting.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
