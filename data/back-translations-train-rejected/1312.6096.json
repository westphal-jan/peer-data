Several semantics with differing characteristics have been proposed for these extensions, rendering the big picture somewhat blurry.

We will begin in Section 3.2 with a result showing that programs without constraints have the same complexity among both FLP and PSP semantics. However, it is known that the semantics do not match for programs without constraints, and we will examine the complexity evidence to highlight the different complexity sources. These results will then be applied in Section 3.3 to identify programs with limited non-convex structures where the complexity of FLP and FLP semantics are different, and under common assumptions this also implies that programs with convex aggregates are the largest class of programs where FLP and FLPSP semantics coincide."}, {"heading": "3.1 Unison: Convex Structures", "text": "In this section, we show that for programs with convex aggregates, FLP and PSP semantics = = coincide. [9] states that many semantics (and especially FLP and PSP) \"agree on [...] programs with convex aggregates,\" because \"they can be regarded as special programs with monotonous constraints.\" However, since our language does not allow explicit negation, and especially since convex structures are not closed under negation, we next demonstrate more directly that FLP and PSP semantics coincide with positive and negated monotonous constraints on convex structures."}, {"heading": "3.2 Consonance: Complexity of Unrestricted Structures", "text": "We will confine ourselves to structures for which the truth value can be established in relation to interpretation. In addition, we will focus on cautious thinking, but similar considerations also apply to related problems such as valiant reasoning, answering the question of the existence of PSP answers. It is known that cautious reasoning about programs with arbitrary structures in the context of FLP semantics is not complete, as shown in [7]. Pelov has shown that P2 - completeness for deciding on the existence of PSP answers in [13], from which P2 - completeness for careful reasoning in PSP semantics can be derived.
