These efforts resulted in a new research area: constraint answer set programming (CASP). CASP languages and systems proved to be largely successful at providing efficient solutions to problems involving hybrid reasoning tasks, such as scheduling problems with elements of planning. Yet, the development of CASP systems is difficult, requiring non-trivial expertise in multiple areas. This suggests a need for a study identifying general development principles of hybrid systems. Once these principles and their implications are well understood, the development of hybrid languages and systems may become a well-established and well-understood routine process. As a step in this direction, in this paper we conduct a case study aimed at evaluating various integration schemas of CASP methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 20:44:58 GMT  (204kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6105v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marcello balduccini", "yulia lierler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6105"}, "pdf": {"name": "1312.6105.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Hybrid Automated Reasoning Tools: from Black-box to Clear-box Integration", "authors": ["Marcello Balduccini", "Yulia Lierler"], "emails": ["marcello.balduccini@gmail.com", "ylierler@unomaha.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country."}, {"heading": "2 Review: the CASP and SMT problems", "text": "The question we have asked ourselves is whether it is a specific case of programs with nested expressions [18].
