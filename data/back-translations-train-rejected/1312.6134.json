The main contribution of this paper is that we capture justifications into an algebra of truth values with three internal operations: an addition '+' representing alternative justifications for a formula, a commutative product '*' representing joint interaction of causes and a non-commutative product '.' acting as a concatenation or proof constructor. Using this multi-valued semantics, we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between the syntactic proof tree of a standard (non-causal) logic program and the interpretation of each true atom in a model. Furthermore, thanks to this algebraic characterization we can detect semantic properties like redundancy and relevance of the obtained justifications. We also identify a lattice-based characterization of this algebra, defining a direct consequences operator, proving its continuity and that its least fix point can be computed after a finite number of iterations. Finally, we define the concept of causal stable model by introducing an analogous transformation to Gelfond and Lifschitz's program reduct.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 21:07:19 GMT  (36kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6134v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["pedro cabalar", "jorge fandinno"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6134"}, "pdf": {"name": "1312.6134.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An Algebra of Causal Chains", "authors": ["Pedro Cabalar", "Jorge Fandinno"], "emails": ["jorge.fandino}@udc.es"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to abide by the rules of the market, both in terms of policy and in terms of policy."}, {"heading": "2 Algebra of causal values", "text": "Since we can imagine that our causal values contain only a limited number of application areas, we will have to be content with three internal operations: in addition to the three different operations that we call \"alternative operations,\" we will also define a series of alternative terms, each of which will be defined as one of the following forms of expression: t: \"The combination of these three operations via labels (events).\" Definition 1. \"Definition 1.\" Definition 1. \"Definition 1.\" Definition 1. \"Definition 1.\" Definition 1. \"Definition 1.\" Definition 1. \"Definition 1.\" Definition 1. \"Definition l.\" Definition l. \"Definition l.\" Definition l. \".\" Definition l. \"L.\" Definition. \".\" L.\" Definition.\".\" l. \".\" l Definition l.\" l. \".\" l Definition l.\".\" l Definition l. \".\" l Definition l Definition l."}, {"heading": "3 Positive programs and minimal models", "text": "Let us now describe how to use causal algebra to evaluate causal logic programs.

A causal chain is nothing more than a concatenation of regulatory labels reflecting a sequence of regulatory labels. Thus, a model indicates a value that involves a derivation of existing rules. We have provided three basic operations for the grid: an addendum that stands for alternative, independent justifications; a product that represents a common interaction of causes; and a concatenation that functions as a chain construction. We have shown that this grid is fully distributed and provides a detailed description of the traditional properties."}], "references": [{"title": "Causal logic programming", "author": ["P.
