A rule (program) is not grounded if it contains any variable; otherwise, it is a basic rule (program). when the rule is called a fact, the rule is a limitation. Well-known terms such as substitution, the Herbrand universe used, and Herbrand basic rule of a program are defined as usual. The semantics of a program is defined by basic programs."}, {"heading": "2.2 Object-Oriented Knowledge Bases", "text": "We will now examine the concept of an OOKB [6]. We note that an OOKB (11) could be regarded as a logical program with function symbols and the language of the OOKBs. It contains properties that cannot be represented in previously studied classes of function symbols such as FDNC [11], Datalog \u00b1 [5] or ASPfs [1]. Essentially, an OOKBs is a logical program consisting of the following components: \u2022 Taxonomic knowledge: This group of facts encodes the class hierarchy, the individual constants and their class affiliation. It contains ASP atoms of the following form: class (2) individual (i) (3) subclass of (c2) disjoint (c1), c2) relations of individuals (5) instance of (i, c) relations of constants and their class affiliation (6)."}, {"heading": "3 Queries in OOKBs", "text": "These queries play a central role in the educational application Inquire [17], which applies the knowledge encoded in KB Bio 101. These queries were developed by comprehensively analyzing the questions from an examination, the questions on the back of the book and the questions that are pedagogically useful (4, 18). We divide these queries into four groups. The first type of queries, which includes the first two questions on facts and relativizations, asks the second type of queries on taxonomic information. These first two types of queries are commonly referred to as the wh questions. The third type of queries revolves around the differences and similarities between individuals from different classes. This type of query has traditionally been investigated as an example of analogical reasoning [10]. The fourth type of queries, which includes the last two questions, is the query on relations between concepts and are unique to our work. \u2022 What is a eukaryotic cell cell?"}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "Standard negation is used in domain independent axioms, for example in Axiom (38) and in Axioms (53) - (54). In principle, standard negation could be used in Axioms (13) or Axiom (14), but in our practical experience in developing KB Bio 101, such use is not necessary, primarily because it typically requires classical negation. It is only to answer the question that the use of negation becomes critical. Generalizing OOKB to other domains may well be necessary to use standard negation in the domain specification Axiom (2), but we have not considered such a use of structures so far."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "We described the contents of an OOKB knowledge base and formulated ASP programs to answer four classes of practically interesting questions. In addition, we presented a practical OOKB, KB Bio 101, whose size and necessary functions make it almost impossible to calculate the answers to these questions with modern ASP solvers. Specific challenges include the development of suitable grounding strategies and dealing with potential indecisiveness when arguing with an OOKB. Given the large overlap of features supported by OOKB and DLs, KB Bio 101 also represents a unique dataset that could investigate relative conflicts of objectives in argument efficiency between these two different paradigms. As a concrete OOKB, KB Bio 101 represents a real challenge for the development of ASP solvers. This also requires the development of novel methods to answer questions with huge programs in ASP. We welcome the dialogue with both the ASP and DL research communities, so that KB Bio 101 can be used as a driver for the further development of the technology and validation in ASP."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "This work was funded by Vulcan Inc. and SRI International."}], "references": [{"title": "Disjunctive ASP with functions: Decidable queries and effective computation", "author": ["M.
