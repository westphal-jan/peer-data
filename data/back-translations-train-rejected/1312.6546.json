The computational complexity of checking whether a fair assignment exists is studied systematically for the fairness notions. We characterize the conditions under which a fair assignment is guaranteed to exist. For a number of fairness concepts, polynomial-time algorithms are presented to check whether a fair assignment exists or not. Our algorithmic results also extend to the case of variable entitlements of agents.

Fairness Concepts that Guarantee the Existence of Fair Outcomes", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "9. Conclusions", "text": "We have presented a taxonomy of fairness concepts under ordinary preferences and identified the relationships between the concepts. Compared to the refinements of the appealing set extension to define fairness concepts [12], the use of cardinal services and the SD relationship to define fairness concepts is not only more flexible (for example, by thinking about claims), but can also be convenient for designing algorithms. Another problem with the fairness concepts presented in the paper is that the amount of fair outcomes is not guaranteed to be empty. Considering this, we have highlighted in Section 8 how alternative notions of maximum and maximum fairness are useful and how the respective calculation problems relate to each other. Another possible way to circumvent the non-existence of SD ratios or weak SD ratios is to define less stringent terms by replacing the reference vector (1, n with a reference vector)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank the anonymous reviewers of the 13th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agents (AAMAS 2014) [5] and the anonymous reviewers of the journal Artificial Intelligence.

allocated to the agents in a fair manner. We use the stochastic dominance relation between fractional or randomized allocations to systematically define varying notions of proportionality and envy-freeness for discrete assignments. The computational complexity of checking whether a fair assignment exists is studied for these fairness notions. We also characterize the conditions under which a fair assignment is guaranteed to exist. For a number of fairness concepts, polynomial-time algorithms are presented to check whether a fair assignment exists. Our algorithmic results also extend to the case of unequal entitlements of agents. Our NP-hardness result, which holds for several variants of envy-freeness, answers an open question posed by Bouveret, Endriss, and Lang (ECAI 2010). We also propose fairness concepts that always suggest a non-empty set of assignments with meaningful fairness properties. Among these concepts, optimal proportionality and optimal weak proportionality appear to be desirable fairness concepts.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
