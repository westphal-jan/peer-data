In the traditional predictive modeling instances are described by observable variables, called attributes. The goal is to learn a model for predicting the target variable for unseen instances. For example, for marketing purposes a company consider profiling a new user based on her observed web browsing behavior, referral keywords or other relevant information. In many real world applications the values of some attributes are not only observable, but can be actively decided by a decision maker. Furthermore, in some of such applications the decision maker is interested not only to generate accurate predictions, but to maximize the probability of the desired outcome. For example, a direct marketing manager can choose which type of a special offer to send to a client (actionable attribute), hoping that the right choice will result in a positive response with a higher probability. We study how to learn to choose the value of an actionable attribute in order to maximize the probability of a desired outcome in predictive modeling. We emphasize that not all instances are equally sensitive to changes in actions. Accurate choice of an action is critical for those instances, which are on the borderline (e.g. users who do not have a strong opinion one way or the other). We formulate three supervised learning approaches for learning to select the value of an actionable attribute at an instance level. We also introduce a focused training procedure which puts more emphasis on the situations where varying the action is the most likely to take the effect. The proof of concept experimental validation on two real-world case studies in web analytics and e-learning domains highlights the potential of the proposed approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Dec 2013 14:37:44 GMT  (336kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6558v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["indre zliobaite", "mykola pechenizkiy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6558"}, "pdf": {"name": "1312.6558.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["indre.zliobaite@aalto.fi", "m.pechenizkiy@tue.nl"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 131 2.65 58v1 [cs.AI] 23 D"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In the last ten years, the use of machine learning and data mining for users in other countries, such as in the USA, in Europe, in the USA, in Europe, in the USA, in Europe, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA"}, {"heading": "2 Problem setting", "text": "The idea is to build a computational model that uses a historical dataset to make predictions for the operative decision for the future. Typically, a set of input attributes is given and the goal is to predict the outcome (the target label). Sometimes, however, it is possible to influence the outcome through management activities.Active attribute is an attribute whose value can be changed by actions of a decision maker prior to predicting the target label. The values of an observable attribute cannot be changed. For example, a type of treatment for a particular patient can be decided by a physician while the patient's age is only observable. Examples of implementable attributes in predictive analytics: \u2022 deciding what amount of credit to offer when the task is to assess (evaluate) credit risk (offering a smaller amount often reduces credit risk); \u2022 offering complementary products, discounting communication channels to predict the response rate of the marketing task is in the immediate response."}, {"heading": "3 Approaches for deciding upon actions", "text": "We present and analyze three heuristic approaches to finding rules of action in a supervised learning method. The first approach simply builds a classifier and then uses it to find the right action by testing each action and selecting the action that comes closest to the desired outcome; the second approach reverses the supervised learning situation by assigning the target label to the input area and treating the action as a target attribute; and the third approach constructs a new training set that treats the result as context."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Seek approach", "text": "It is naive in the sense that it explicitly does not learn the action ruleH. Rather, it learns a traditional classification between an instance and the result L: (Xa) \u2192 y, where each instance includes the actionable attribute as recorded in the historical data.In the face of an invisible instance, different values of the actionable attribute are examined and the respective model outputs observed. The action that leads to the output closest to the desired y is summarized in Algorithm 1.Algorithm. The seek approaches the actionist data (X, a, y) Output: The action rule HSeek: (Xa, a, a, y)."}, {"heading": "3.2 The Twist approach", "text": "This approach adds the target label to the attribute space and treats the actionable attribute as a label (i.e. as the target attribute to be predicted).The task is now to learn the following figure from Htwist: (X, y) \u2192 a.For an invisible instance, the label y is not known at the prediction time when we need to expand the input space. Instead, we can add the desired value to the label y \u043a.

Specifically, in this approach, the result is not part of the input attributes, but describes an implicit group of similar users. The users who responded positively (\"+\") form a context. Those who did not respond form the other context. We assign each instance to the desired context by manipulating the value of the actionable attribute. We construct a new training set for learning the Hcontext rule of action. In this training set, we define labels in a certain way. In the face of a binary actionable attribute, we make the following assumptions: Thus, we assign to all positive users (+) the labels according to the original colors of the envelopes sent to them. To the negative users (-), we assign the opposite colors as they originally received, hoping that the other color may have changed their decision."}, {"heading": "3.4 Focusing the learning process on the sensitive cases", "text": "We presented the approaches in a simplified scenario that assumes that the contribution of an activable attribute to the label is uniform for all cases. In the complex real world, the effects of an action are different for each instance. Changing the action may have several possible results on the class label, as shown in Figure 3. We analyze these possible results experimentally with an extended toy data set shown in Table 5. Now, there are two input attributes (gender and income), the same actionable attribute (envelope color) and the class label (response to the marketing letter). We use the Seek approach with the square discriminant classifier. The resulting probabilities of a positive response are presented in Figure 4.In the previous toy example."}, {"heading": "3.5 Applicability of the approaches", "text": "The proposed approaches solve the problem of maximizing the probability of the desired result P (y-X, a) for each user X by creating a model H: X \u2192 a for determining the optimal action for a new user. The model is learned and optimized to propose an action so as to maximize the probability of the desired result. The three approaches to deciding an action make different underlying assumptions, as summarized in Table 6. The proposed focused training method aims to optimize predictive performance in situations where the correct prediction of which action will ultimately affect the outcome (the user's reaction). It could be argued that the action rules obtained with the proposed approaches do not necessarily capture causal correlations, but rather are a result of correlations attributable, for example, to sampling bias. To ensure that the action rules are causal and therefore applicable, we must ensure that we use the historical data sets to determine the actions."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental evaluation", "text": "This section presents the experimental evaluation of the proposed approaches. We begin by discussing the evaluation challenges and then test the approaches using synthetic data. Finally, we analyze the performance of the proposed approaches using two real-world case studies in web analysis and e-learning."}, {"heading": "4.1 Evaluation challenges and approach", "text": "Evaluating learning with actionable attributes on real data is a challenge, since the results of alternative actions applied to the same user are not known. Therefore, it is not possible to test the what-if scenario and directly measure whether the proposed choice of action is correct. In the survey modeling, the accuracy of a ranking with profit curves is approximated [25], which is not suitable for our setting, as it requires that one action is better globally than another action and the ranking of instances produced by a classifier is evaluated, rather than a selection of alternative actions. In the alternative action, a produced action rule H: X \u2192 a is proposed to identify an optimal action for that user in order to maximize the posterior probability of the desired outcome (y). Four situations are possible as a result: 1. y = y (positive instance) and a = a (positive instance) and a = the same value of the proposed attribute as the original one."}, {"heading": "4.2 Experiments with synthetic data", "text": "The aim of these experiments is to analyse the performance of the proposed approaches and assess whether the proposed focused training contributes to improving performance."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Dataset generation", "text": "Our first data set is designed around the previously discussed marketing example and corresponds to the belief network depicted in Figure 6 (a). Suppose a marketer sends an offer in a chosen form, i.e. the color of an envelope (a binary action, a) aimed at obtaining a positive response (y \u0445 = \"accept\"). The answer depends on two numerical variables, salary, x1 and age, x2. In addition, the unobserved preference (h) of an action that influences the acceptance decision is determined by a binary variable (gender, x3) and is independent of an observed categorical variable (zip code, x4). Data I is generated with the following distributions: x1, 2, x2, u / 2, where u / 2, where u [0, 1] is a uniform random variable, x3, {\"female}, p (x3 =\" female), \u2032 (2), x4, x4} (data)."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Experimental results with synthetic data", "text": "Knowing the distribution of data, we know for the test set what the alternative action label would be. Therefore, we can assess what the relevant accuracy of the classifier that chooses the action is. Relevant accuracy is the accuracy of the prediction among the test cases for which the action changes the result y. This metric is similar to the recall for the information query in the sense that we do not care how many times we correctly selected the action when it mattered. Measuring the accuracy for all cases in this case makes no sense, since the setting assumes that all actions have the same cost and an action is performed anyway. For a user who does not respond to an action, each action is equally good, so our evaluation criterion does not respond to that part of the data. Table 8 represents relevant accuracies achieved over 100 independent runs, using the CART decision tree as the basic classifier."}, {"heading": "4.3 A case study in recommender selection", "text": "MastersPortal.eu web portal provides information on Master's degree programs in Europe. It was launched in 2007. In March 2010, the portal attracted almost 1 million monthly visits and provided information on more than 15,000 programs. The revenue model of the portal was based on the sale of premium listings, web-based advertising campaigns and banner impressions. Therefore, it was crucial to increase both the number of visitors and the number of pages viewed by each visitor. Throughout the existence of the portal, the bounce rate of visitors was in the range of 55-70%. However, visitors referred to Google (equivalent to half of visits) had a much higher bounce rate, about 90%. They were referred directly to one of the programs, and if they were not interested in this particular program, they went back to Google's results page instead of exploring the portal. This was an unfortunate situation, as the correct information was probably available on one of the related pages of the portal."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 Dataset description", "text": "The dataset contains information about 39477 human visitors visiting Google's MasterPortal.eu during two weeks of live testing (March 17 - March 30, 2010), each visitor was guided into one of the two experiment groups using a round robin assignment approach. The experiment resulted in 48.3% of visits showing satisfaction-based recommendations and 51.7% collaboration, with respective positive result rates (non-jumped) of 17.6% and 18.3%. Content-based recommendations fared slightly better, but the difference is not material and statistically significant. We use the following 14 attributes for learning: recommendation type as an actionable attribute, a = {collaborative, content}, 12 descriptive attributes x1.. x12: session count (returning visitor or not), continent (Europe, Asia,...), country, screen resolution (computer, phone or gadget), browser (quantity, not the quantity of the quantity of the Quantity we derive, Firefox or Chrome page six), (Quantity of the Quantity of the Quantity of the Quantity of the Quantity of the Quantity of the Quantity of the Quantity of the Page 6), (Quantity of the Quantity of the Quantity is not the Quantity of the Quantity of the Page 6)."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Where are the sensitive cases?", "text": "The aim of the first experiment is not to bounce the relationship between the choice of the receiver type a and the desired result y = +. Here we use the Seek approach, which makes it possible to numerically estimate the probabilities of the desired result P (+ | X, a) with alternative measures. We use the train part to form a predictive model L: X, a \u2192 y. Then we prepare two alternative data sets: one with collaborative recommenders as basis for action TestA = (Xacollaborative) and another with substantive test parts for the formation of a predictive model L: X."}, {"heading": "4.3.3 Learning focused on the sensitive cases", "text": "The goal of the second experiment is to compare the behavior of the three proposed approaches in two educational areas; focused training versus pooled training. With the real case study, we cannot verify whether the measures were correct, because the basic truths are not available to us. Nevertheless, we can show that the proposed approaches allow to distinguish between two actions for groups of similar users. In this particular case, we expect different preferences and behavior of users coming from the continents. Of course, it is very rough to assume that all people from the same continent have similar preferences. We expect different actions to be recommended for different groups; in this case, we expect different preferences and behaviors of users coming from different continents."}, {"heading": "4.4 A case study in feedback personalization", "text": "The second case study with real data refers to the effect of feedback in online evaluation of students \"knowledge and skills. Students answer multiple-choice partial exam questions, and are asked to provide an answer and also indicate how confident they are about that answer. After answering a question, a student may request exemplary or theoretical feedback, or in some cases, the system may also decide to provide such feedback automatically. Students are encouraged to take it seriously, as related questions may still occur during the same exam, so it is valuable to understand the correct answer not only out of curiosity, but also because it could help to perform better during the exam. It is expected that different students could benefit more or less from one type of feedback or another, depending on their knowledge and learning style. The goal of our experiments in this case study analysis is how we can learn to choose the type of feedback (actionable attribute) to maximize the likelihood of a correct answer (for the desired result) being present in the exam."}, {"heading": "4.4.1 Dataset description", "text": "The data was collected as part of the PhD study [35] investigating the problem of feedback tailored feedback in e-learning setting, especially during the exam.At Eindhoven University of Technology (TUE) during the spring semester of 2007-2008, there were 73 students who took the partial exams for the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course.Each student was asked to answer 11 exam questions, some of which were related to each other; i.e. if a student understands how to answer A, (s) he may also answer a related question. Designed feedback for Question A is designed to help students understand it better and thus increases the chances of correctly answering B. The automated evaluation system could decide to show the particular type of feedback directly or recommend it for the exam. The decisions of the system were based on the predefined personalization rules, which, taking into account the correctness and certainty of the students, would be based on the answer and his or her learning style or any existing student's theory that was expected to be correct in the theory or most of the theory."}, {"heading": "4.4.2 Analysis of the results", "text": "Like the previous case study, we are investigating how changing a type of feedback affects the expected likelihood of correctly answering a related question. However, the experimental protocol is identical to the previous case study. However, the TUE data set has two characteristics. Firstly, it is much smaller than the MastersPortal.eu data set, so the focused training approach can typically use less than 100 instances for training, the accuracy of which may suffer in particular from discarding training data due to the small data size. Secondly, the exemplary feedback was on average twice as effective as in theory, so that the action classifiers become biased towards recommending this type of feedback, while in the MasterPortal.eu data the effect of both measures was balanced."}, {"heading": "4.5 Implications and recommendations for practitioners", "text": "The experiments with synthetic data, in which the basic truth is known, show that the proposed approaches identify exactly the preferred measures, and that the focused training approach helps to increase the accuracy of the measures. Case studies confirm that different measures can be optimal for different cases and show the potential of the formulated measures and approaches. We recommend using the Twist approach with the focused training method as the default option. It is the most generic approach in terms of its applicability to the different settings. Let's remember that it can handle the actionable attributes of different types, unlike Seek and contextual approaches, it is more efficient in that it cannot incorporate noise into the training data. Twist has shown that it is more robust in preventing the imbalance in the global superiority of a measure."}, {"heading": "5 Related work", "text": "This year it has come to the point where it is only a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion and Future Work", "text": "This study opens up the potential for direct extensions and follow-up studies for learning with usable attributes, which we discuss in this paragraph. First, we assume that there is only one usable attribute and that it is categorical. Usable attributes can also be ordered or evaluated in real terms (e.g. a discount for the next purchase), in which case a simple list of actions and wrappers such as approaches will not be appropriate. The presence of more than one usable attribute brings more interesting challenges and opportunities. However, the problem of the receiver system itself can be formulated as learning with usable attributes. Each user is described with a set of observed characteristics that provide demographic and already usable attributes, i.e. that can be recommended for this user. The task can be formulated as the most promising measures."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "This problem has been examined from different perspectives in different areas of data mining, our study presents a new perspective motivated by the field of predictive analytics. We emphasized (1) a classification structure in which there is no globally better action, different actions may be preferable for different individuals, (2) focused learning motivated by the idea that different instances are sensitive to the value of the sensitive attribute in different ways, i.e. it is not enough to reduce this supervised learning problem to a prediction with a reject option. Experiments on synthetic data with the known basic truth have shown that the proposed approaches were able to accurately identify the preferred actions and that the focused training approach helped to increase the accuracy of the selection of the right actions based on a reject option."}], "references": [{"title": "Discovery of actionable patterns in databases: The action hierarchy approach", "author": ["G.

been proposed and used for modeling individual and group user needs, interests and preferences. In the traditional predictive modeling instances are described by observable variables, called attributes. The goal is to learn a model for predicting the target variable for unseen instances. For example, for marketing purposes a company consider profiling a new user based on her observed web browsing behavior, referral keywords or other relevant information. In many real world applications the values of some attributes are not only observable, but can be actively decided by a decision maker. Furthermore, in some of such applications the decision maker is interested not only to generate accurate predictions, but to maximize the probability of the desired outcome. For example, a direct marketing manager can choose which type of a special offer to send to a client (actionable attribute), hoping that the right choice will result in a positive response with a higher probability. We study how to learn to choose the value of an actionable attribute in order to maximize the probability of a desired outcome in predictive modeling. We emphasize that not all instances are equally sensitive to changes in actions. Accurate choice of an action is critical for those instances, which are on the borderline (e.g. users who do not have a strong opinion one way or the other). We formulate three supervised learning approaches for learning to select the value of an actionable attribute at an instance level. We also introduce a focused training procedure which puts more emphasis on the situations where varying the action is the most likely to take the effect. The proof of concept experimental validation on two real-world case studies in web analytics and e-learning domains highlights the potential of the proposed approaches.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
