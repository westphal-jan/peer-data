INTRODUCTION", "text": "There is a fundamental need for high-precision and efficient automatic coin recognition systems in our daily lives. Coin recognition systems and coin sorting machines have become a vital part of our lives. They are used in banks, supermarkets, grocery stores, vending machines, etc. Despite their daily use, coin recognition systems can also be used for the research purposes of institutes or organisations dealing with ancient coins. There are three types of coin recognition systems based on different methods that they provide on the market: Mechanical method-based systems based on electromagnetic methods Image processing systems Mechanical method-based systems use parameters such as diameter or radius, thickness, weight and magnetism of coins to distinguish between coins. However, these parameters cannot be used to distinguish between the different materials of coins. It means that we offer two coins that have the same diameter or radius, thickness, weight and magnetism to differentiate between coins."}, {"heading": "2. APPROACHES / TECHNIQUES", "text": "There are various approaches proposed by different researchers for image-based coin recognition, and we can roughly classify these approaches by the coins (ancient coins, modern coins, ancient and modern coins) to which they can be applied."}, {"heading": "2.1 Approaches for Modern Coins", "text": "Most of the suggested approaches so far can be used for the recognition of modern coins. In 1992 [1] Minoru Fukumi et al. presented a rotational invariant neural pattern recognition system for coin recognition systems. They used 500 yen coins and 500 won coins to perform the experiment. In this work, they created a multi-layered neural network and a preprocessor consisting of many plates of neurons. Results show that 25 slabs with 72 neurons in each plate give the best recognition rate. In 1993 [2] Minoru Fukumi et al. tried to achieve 100% accuracy for coins. They used 500 yen coins and 500 won coins. In this work, they used Back Propagation (BP) and Genetic algorithms for the design of a neural network for coin recognition."}, {"heading": "2.2 Approaches for Ancient Coins", "text": "The main reason for this is that ancient coins do not have symmetrical boundaries like modern coins due to wear or dirt, as ancient coins were hammered or cast during production, while modern coins are minted. Ancient coins are also in poor condition due to wear or dirt, so general approaches to coin recognition for ancient coins easily fail. Kaiping Wei et al. [14] introduced a novel approach to classifying ancient coins based on image text information in 2007. TreeStructured Wavelet Transform (TWT) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms are used to obtain text information, and the multi-resolution character of the texture is extracted by TWT, and information can be retrieved at different scales and not in low frequency. In addition, a segmentation algorithm based on ACO is implemented prior to the TWT to obtain textures that provide very precise results for the shape of the coins."}, {"heading": "2.3 Approaches for both (Modern and Ancient) Coins", "text": "There are some approaches that can be applied in both antiquity and modernity."}, {"heading": "3. CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper presents various developed and existing methods of coin recognition based on image processing. A comparison of these techniques was given in Table 1. So far, so many techniques have been proposed for modern coins, and the maximum accuracy of 99.7% was achieved for Canadian coins in 1996 using decision trees, but still very little work has been done to identify ancient coins."}, {"heading": "Modern/Ancient Coins Accuracy", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.
