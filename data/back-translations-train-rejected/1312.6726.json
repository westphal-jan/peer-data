Experiments in decision-making under uncertainty have shown that they violate these classical theories [1]. As a consequence, many alternative explanations have been proposed to explain this irrational behavior at first glance [2, 3, 4, 5]. A more recent theory of limited rationality for decision-making has been proposed, which takes into account the computational costs of finding the optimal policy. Similar ideas are becoming increasingly interesting and are being used in other areas such as control, robotics, and machine learning [6, 7, 9, 10]. The theory of limited rationality shares the same mathematical framework used in statistical physics to describe changes in thermodynamic systems [3, 11, 12]."}, {"heading": "2 Decision-making with information-processing costs", "text": "The reasoning process of a limited rational decision maker consists in the transformation of a previous probability model (\u03b2 = \u03b2 = \u03b2 = \u03b2 = = = policy p0 (x) of an action x (x) into a subordinate policy p1 (x) taking into account the supply function \u2206 U (x) and the transformation costs from the previous distribution to the subordinate distribution. This trade-off is characterized by the free energy difference (FED).

If some external parameters \u03bb of such a system vary over time (e.g. a change in magnetic potential or the position of the wall of a piston), the work is applied to the system and it will develop along a path from an initial state A to a final state B. However, if the change in parameters is carried out endlessly slowly, the whole ensemble of micro-states at a given time can be described by an equilibrium distribution and the work carried out on such a system is equivalent to the free energy difference W = 0. However, if the parameters are applied endlessly to the system, the work depends on the initial microscopic conditions and will be on average higher than the difference in free energy [15]."}, {"heading": "4 Inefficiencies due to lag in the policy", "text": "In this section, we will use the aforementioned non-equilibrium results from statistical physics to describe inefficiencies due to the non-use of an optimal policy. We will consider two simple scenarios in which the change in the supply function \u2206 U (x) is applied immediately or in N periods. In both cases, we assume that the active ingredient takes a time step to notice the change in the supply function, then selects a measure from the previous policy and finally calculates the optimal policy immediately. Due to this delay in the optimal policy, the expected benefit that the active ingredient achieves will not be the optimal one (with the free energy difference being the optimal one) and therefore has inefficiencies. We will quantify these inefficiencies in a similar way to work in non-equilibrium thermodynamics."}, {"heading": "4.1 One-step scenario", "text": "In the one-step scenario, the agent only has to try one action. At the beginning of the process, he uses an initial policy p0 (x) that is optimal for the service function U0 (x) given his resources. Then, there is an external change that changes the service function from U0 (x) to U1 (x) so that it generates a policy p0 (x) from the agent's point of view. Importantly, at the time of this increase in the service function, he is still using his previous policy p0. This process is described in the following table: Timestep t 0 1 service function U0 (x) U1 (x) policy p0 (x) p0 (x) The average expected benefit difference from t = 0 to t = 1 isUnet = x (x) This quantum is the average net benefit that the agent gains using the non-optimal policy. The average dissipated or \"wasted\" utility \"utility\" utility is utility because the optimal policy is not used (x)."}, {"heading": "4.2 N-step scenario", "text": "Now let us consider that the agent is exposed to the same increase in the benefit \u2206 U (x), but in this scenario (\u03b2) we recover (\u03b2). After each time step, the agent is able to notice the increase in the benefit function \u2206 U (x) N, but he still uses the previous policy. Next, he calculates the optimal policy for this increase in benefit. The following table describes this process: Time expenditure 0 1 2... t... N benefit function U0 (x) N \u2212 N (x)... Ut (x)... P0 (x) p1 (x)... pN \u2212 N (x) U2 (x) + tN \u2206 U (x) for t-usefulness N and the optimal policy p0 (x) p1 (x) pN (x) p1 (x) pN), with now Ut (x) + tN (x).pt t) for the optimal policy p0 (x) and the optimal policy 0 (x) for the previous policy x)."}, {"heading": "5 Simulations", "text": "In the following simulations, we will illustrate how \u03b2 the number of steps and resources influence the \u03b2 derived level of usefulness. Consider the situation in which the agent can choose between two possible measures x {a, b}, and he observes \u2206 U (x) = (\u2212 2, 5). However, it is important that this change in usefulness function is made over several periods of time, which allows him to recalculate the optimal policy at the end of each period. In particular, for this simulation, the total number of usage periods is set at N = 4. The initial policy of the agent is only p0 (x) = (0.5, 0.5).In this particular scenario, in Figure 1 (A-C), we show the different values of derived benefit, free energy difference and usage level in relation to the rationality parameter \u03b2. In the first phase, the agent uses the policy p0, which does not depend on \u03b2, so the usage level for all depends - see Figure 1C."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We have adopted concepts from non-equilibrium thermodynamics and applied them to describe inefficiencies in decision-making caused by the use of sub-optimal strategies when the decision-maker is unable to adapt perfectly to a rapidly changing environment. We have shown a corresponding interpretation of the Jarzynski equality in thermodynamics for decision-making, which allows for related variations in the potentially sub-optimal net benefit of a drug versus the optimally attainable benefit due to free energy difference.The most important contribution of this work is to quantify the inefficiencies that occur in limited rational decision-makers when the environment changes faster than the drug can react. These inefficiencies may be irrelevant in slowly changing environments, but of greater importance in rapidly changing environments, as the calculated strategies may differ greatly from the optimal strategies."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This study was supported by the DFG, Emmy Noether Fellowship BR4164 / 1-1."}], "references": [{"title": "Risk, ambiguity, and the savage axioms", "author": ["Daniel Ellsberg"], "venue": "The Quarterly journal of economics,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1961}, {"title": "Decision making with imperfect decision makers, volume 28", "author": ["Tatiana Valentine Guy", "Miroslav K\u00e1rn\u1ef3", "David H Wolpert"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Thermodynamics as a theory of decision-making with informationprocessing costs", "author": ["Pedro A.
