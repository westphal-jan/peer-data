Based on principles of autocatalysis, endogeny, and reflectivity, the work provides an architectural blueprint for constructing systems with high levels of operational autonomy in underspecified circumstances, starting from a small seed. Through value-driven dynamic priority scheduling controlling the parallel execution of a vast number of reasoning threads, the system achieves recursive self-improvement after it leaves the lab, within the boundaries imposed by its designers. A prototype system has been implemented and demonstrated to learn a complex real-world task, real-time multimodal dialogue with humans, by on-line observation. Our work presents solutions to several challenges that must be solved for achieving artificial general intelligence.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Dec 2013 06:17:55 GMT  (1569kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6764v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["e nivel", "k r th\\'orisson", "b r steunebrink", "h dindo", "g pezzulo", "m rodriguez", "c hernandez", "d ognibene", "j schmidhuber", "r sanz", "h p helgason", "a chella", "g k jonsson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6764"}, "pdf": {"name": "1312.6764.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Bounded Recursive Self-Improvement", "authors": ["E.

The \"interest\" or importance of an input depends on the global activity of the system, that is, on the number of jobs that are planned to process the input: interesting inputs are those that are processed by high-priority jobs. In our approach, attention control comes directly from its disposition mechanism, by reordering jobs according to their priorities. Attention, as implemented in AERA, is transversal and workplace-dependent: the same attention control is used uniformly for all and all types of jobs in the system. For example, attention is needed to learn new models, but also - at the same time - to plan appropriate action sequences. Attention control is not based solely on work priorities, as it also results from the selection of predictive jobs in the environment that are achieved by the manipulation of the system itself."}, {"heading": "5.2 Programs", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to survive on their own, and they will be able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "Composite state 5.2.2", "text": "As in Section 4.1, a composite state that encodes the combination of several facts, including the fact that the payloads are instances of other composite states, enabling the creation of structural hierarchies. A composite state is a program with several input patterns, one per fact. As in previous years, the composite states are triggered with a new composite state, namely a partial contiguous state in which there is a linkage of input states, by the mapping of input states (any kind of targets), which in turn produces a new composite state that is copied from the original state, with an input pattern that matches that of the input states."}, {"heading": "Prediction Monitor 5.2.3", "text": "A prediction has an input pattern, the prediction monitors it. Pairing an actual input threshold (i.e. a sensory or internal input) with the prediction monitor creates a prediction monitoring job. The priority of a prediction monitoring job is the same as the priority of its mother job (a forward-looking reliability). The purpose of a prediction monitor is threefold. First, it collects evidence or counter-evidence of the predicted fact during the predicted period in order to assess the performance of the model making the prediction by increasing or reducing its reliability. Among the accumulated evidence, the evidence holds the highest probability value dictates the verdict. If no evidence and no counter-evidence of what was predicted has been observed, then a failure of the prediction is performed.

In both experiments, two people interact for a certain period of time, allowing S1 to observe their behavior and interaction; in both experiments, the task of S1 is to learn how to conduct the interaction in exactly the same way as humans do, either in the role of the interviewer or the interviewee. The knowledge given to S1 is presented as a small set of primitive commands and categories of sensory data, along with no more than a few high-level objectives such as \"pleasing the interviewer\" (operatively defined as the interviewer saying \"thank you\" or asking a new question)."}, {"heading": "6.1 Experimental & Scenario Setup", "text": "In both experiments, S1 observes the interaction between two people in the simulated equivalent of a video conference: people are represented as avatars in a virtual environment (Figure 11) - each person sees the other as an avatar on his screen. Their head and arm movements are tracked with motion sensors, their speech is recorded with microphones. Signals from the movement are used to update the state of their avatars in real time, so that almost immediately everything a person does is translated into movements of their graphic avatar on the screen of the other. Between the avatars is a desk with objects visible to both parties.

Data acquisition for E1 was as described in Section 6.1 above, with the two people providing several minutes of interaction to enable S1 to learn how to do it. The objects around which the interaction revolves are: two blue cubes, a red cube, a red sphere, a blue sphere. The seed for S1 in E1 is described in detail in Nivel & Th\u00f3risson (2013); in short, it consists of a series of primitive commands (hand moving, letting go, dot on) and a series of entrance dimensions (object type, color, role of the actor, speech)."}, {"heading": "Results of Experiment 1 (E1) 6.2.2", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they do not want."}, {"heading": "Observation Time # Turns Observed # Errors After Observation Period", "text": "~ 2.5 min ~ 17 0RUTR-SCS13006 41 / 56In our previous results of an analysis of human-human interaction with the Gandalf agent (Jonsson & Th\u00f3risson 2010, Th\u00f3risson 1996, 1999), the patterns appeared to be on average slightly slower than in natural human-human interaction, which can probably be explained by a longer average duration between critical elements of the turnaround management system, particularly speech recognition. Compared to Gandalf, the pace / pace of S1 dialogue sessions is much closer to the speed of human-human interaction, especially in the dyadic interaction between subjects who know each other well (e.g. friends). A closer comparison between S1 and other human-human data also suggests that the turning maneuvers reach an \"intermediate level\" that develops rapidly, as is the case with the dyadic interaction between friends (Jonsson 2006). These positive results allowed us to significantly increase the complexity of the next task, including the complexity of the language."}, {"heading": "6.3 Experiment 2 (E2)", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Experimental Goals & Hypotheses 6.3.1", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will be able to erenie.n the aforementioned lcihsrteeSe rf\u00fcfe eerwtlrlrVo"}, {"heading": "Results of Experiment 2 (E2) 6.3.2", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to another world in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able to move, and in which they are able to move."}, {"heading": "6.4 Summary of Results", "text": "The results of the two experiments E1 and E2 show without a doubt that the AREAbased-S1 system correctly obtained and mastered the correct application of all communication methods used by the human interviewer and interviewee in the human-human situation in conversations about the recycling of the various materials of the objects. The complete absence of errors in the behavior of S1 after the observation periods in both conditions shows that very reliable models were acquired and that these form a hierarchy spanning at least two orders of magnitude in time. These models correctly represent the generalized relationships of a non-trivial number of units, knowledge not previously provided by the system's designers and acquired autonomously, given the Bootstrap seed originally intended to create a system that can learn in a targeted manner how to capture certain final goals through generalized, autonomously acquired models that capture real cause and effect in the phenomena observed."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion & Related work", "text": "This year, more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is not a country, but in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is not a country, but in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is not a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which it is a country, in which is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country"}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion & Future Work", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to"}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the European project HUMANOBS - Humanoids that Learn Socio- Communicative Skills By Observation (FP7 STREP - Cognitive Robotics - grant number 231453) and research grants from RANNIS, Iceland.

The ability to degrade gracefully \u2013 how it can continue striving to achieve its main goals when resources become scarce, or in light of other expected or unexpected constraining factors that impede its progress. We describe new methodological and engineering principles for addressing these shortcomings, that we have used to design a machine that becomes increasingly better at behaving in underspecified circumstances, in a goal-directed way, on the job, by modeling itself and its environment as experience accumulates. Based on principles of autocatalysis, endogeny, and reflectivity, the work provides an architectural blueprint for constructing systems with high levels of operational autonomy in underspecified circumstances, starting from only a small amount of designer-specified code \u2013 a seed. Using a valuedriven dynamic priority scheduling to control the parallel execution of a vast number of lines of reasoning, the system accumulates increasingly useful models of its experience, resulting in recursive self-improvement that can be autonomously sustained after the machine leaves the lab, within the boundaries imposed by its designers.
