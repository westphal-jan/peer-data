This problem is frequently encountered in wide range of areas including pattern recognition, wireless sensor networks, control systems, recommender systems, image/video reconstruction etc. Both in theory and practice, the most optimal way to solve the low rank matrix recovery problem is via nuclear norm minimization. In this paper, we propose a Split Bregman algorithm for nuclear norm minimization. The use of Bregman technique improves the convergence speed of our algorithm and gives a higher success rate. Also, the accuracy of reconstruction is much better even for cases where small number of linear measurements are available. Our claim is supported by empirical results obtained using our algorithm and its comparison to other existing methods for matrix recovery. The algorithms are compared on the basis of NMSE, execution time and success rate for varying ranks and sampling ratios.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 15:12:48 GMT  (430kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6872v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NA cs.LG", "authors": ["anupriya gogna", "ankita shukla", "angshul majumdar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6872"}, "pdf": {"name": "1312.6872.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Matrix Recovery using Split Bregman", "authors": ["Anupriya Gogna", "Ankita Shukla", "Angshul Majumdar"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it will be so far that it will be able to do the aforementioned for the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green"}, {"heading": "COMPLETION", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "A.

For our algorithm, the values of the regularization parameters 1 and were chosen to be 0.01. The Bregman variable was initialized to a vector that contains all of them. These values were chosen to achieve the best convergence behavior. We compared our results with those obtained with FPC and SVT. For FPC, the value of mu _ final was taken to be 0.01 and the tolerance was taken to be 1E-3.
