INTRODUCTION In this paper, we have examined the Machine Translation Confidence Assessment, in which we find the quality ratings of sentences. The main objective of the Confidence Assessment is to assess the behavior of the system output for a given input, without information about the expected output. Confidence Assessment for Machine Translation can be considered a binary classification problem in order to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" translations. The remaining section of the essay is structured as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of previous work on quality assessment. Section 3 describes the methodology of the system. Section 4 gives the experimental settings. Section 5 describes the analysis and the results. Section 6 finally gives you the conclusion."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "Blatz.et al. [1] presents a series of experiments with CE at the sentence level, based on annotations that use automatic MT evaluation metrics. Repressors and classifiers are trained on characteristics extracted for translations labeled as \"good\" according to the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) and Word Error Rate (WER). For the classification, NIST values are used as a threshold to designate the 5th or 30th percentile of examples as \"good.\" For regression, the estimated values are mapped into two classes using the same thresholds. Results did not show that they are helpful in a number of evaluation tasks. Quirk [2] uses classifiers and a predefined threshold for \"bad\" and \"good\" translations, which take into account a small set of 350 manually labeled translations in terms of quality. Specia et al. [3] use a number of \"black boxes\" (MT system independent) and \"glass system-dependent\" squartz (MT) characteristics."}, {"heading": "III. METHODOLOGY", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Naive Bayes", "text": "Na\u00efve Bayes is one of the most effective and efficient classification algorithms. In machine learning problems, a learner tries to construct a classifier from a series of training examples with class names. Suppose that F1, F2, F3.., Fn n n are attributes. An example E is represented by a vector (f1, f2,.... fK) where fi is the value of Fi. Suppose C represents the class variable that accepts values excellent, good, average and bad. We use QE to represent the value that Ctakes. A naive Bayesian classifier is defined as: P (QE | F1, F2, F3, F4,...... FN) = (,,,,."}, {"heading": "B. Working of the system", "text": "Na\u00efve Bayes is a well-known algorithm for classification problems. The list of sets of attribute values and their corresponding category is given to the classifier and these form the training set. An independent probability is determined from the training data. The probability indicates the probability of each target class, taking into account the occurrence of each value category from each input variable. When a new example is presented, a value for the target function can be predicted based on the training instances. 1 Training Steps - Using the training samples, the methods estimate the parameter of a probability distribution, provided the characteristics are conditionally independent of the class. 2 Test Steps - For each invisible test sample, the method calculates the posterior probability of this sample belonging to each class.Enter Algorithmic Steps Sets Features are extracted from these input sets. These characteristics and the associated labels are provided to the learning algorithm. The model is trained with this learning algorithm (naive classifier test sets) and raw data are then extracted from these input data and the corresponding labels."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Data Collection", "text": "For the development of the training system, we used a 3,300-sentence corpus built during the ACL 2005 workshop on the construction and use of parallel text: Data Driven Machine Translation and beyond as a training corpus. Statistics of the corpus are shown in Table I."}, {"heading": "B. Features Used", "text": "In this paper, we focus on the use of verified machine translation systems that do not come into contact with human reference translations. We seek a translation of 16 features used in this paper. - Number of tokens in the target sentence. - The number of tokens in the reference will depend on the probability of the reference. - The number of tokens in the reference is immense. - The number of tokens in the reference is immense. - The probability of the reference in the reference is immense."}, {"heading": "V. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS", "text": "For the evaluation of the system, we converted the human evaluation of the system into grades. These grades are in Table III. The results of the classifier are calculated on the basis of those grades that gave us the same grade."}, {"heading": "A. Comparison of human evaluation and Na\u00efve Bayes:", "text": "The results of the naive Bavarian classifier and the human evaluation are presented in Table 4. This indicates the number of machine translation machine evaluations in each of the four categories. Table 5 shows the results of the human evaluation for all three MT engines. These four evaluations can also be converted into a numerical evaluation to evaluate the results of the MT. Table 6 shows the comparison of the results of the human evaluation with the grades given by the classifier. If a human evaluator gave a good evaluation to a sentence and the classifier also gave a good grade to the same sentence, then it is counted. More, the human evaluator and the classifier can achieve almost similar results to most other judgments."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we have extracted 16 features from the introductory sentences and their translation and obtained a quality assessment based on Bayesian conclusions from training data. In this paper, we have shown that the Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier can predict the same level of results as the human evaluator. Furthermore, in the future, we will improve the quality of the system by adding a few more features and examining and evaluating the system by comparing the rankings of the system given by the human being. The system that receives the same ranking as the human being is considered the good system."}], "references": [{"title": "Confidence Estimation for Machine Translation", "author": ["Blatz", "John", "Erin Fitzgerald", "George Foster", "Simona Gandrabur", "Cyril Goutte", "Alex Kulesza", "Alberto  Sanchis", "Nicola Ueffing"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 20th Conference on Computational Linguistics,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Training a Sentence-Level Machine Translation Confidence Measure", "author": ["Quirk", "Chris"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 4th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Improving the confidence of Machine translation Quality Estimates", "author": ["Lucia Specia", "Craig Saunders", "Marco Turchi", "Zhuoran Wang", "John Shawe-Taylor"], "venue": "In proceeding of Machine Translation Summit XII,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Sentence level MT evaluation without reference translations: beyond language modeling", "author": ["M.
