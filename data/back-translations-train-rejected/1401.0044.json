Because the real data is sensitive, our experiments use synthetic data to determine whether transformer i has failed or not. Each transformer has a failure probability on its own, which is represented by a singleton potential succi. However, when a transformer is connected in a network, a transformer can extend its failure to nearby nodes (as in the case of viral infection), since the edges in the network form associative dependencies.

We note from experiments carried out that the limits appear to be narrow, as we have found models where the optimum is executed more than 0.5 differently than when executed with B = 0.1. When applied to attractive models, we guarantee an FPTAS without limitations. Future work will include further improving the efficiency of the network, testing how it should be selected to simplify the subsequent discrete optimization problem, and exploring applications. Interesting approaches include using it as a subroutine in a dual decomposition approach for optimization via a narrower relativization of the 2002 marginal Cypal set, and the possibility of running iBP more quickly than the other types of polyps or Yuoros)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Kui Tang for helping with programming and David Sontag, Kui Tang, Nicholas Ruozzi and Tomaz Slivnik for helpful discussions.

Here we significantly improve this algorithm and derive several results including a new approach based on analyzing first derivatives of F , which leads to performance that is typically far superior and yields a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for attractive models without any degree restriction. Further, the method applies to general (non-attractive) models, though with no polynomial time guarantee in this case, leading to the important result that approximating log of the Bethe partition function, logZB = \u2212minF , for a general model to additive \u01ebaccuracy may be reduced to a discrete MAP inference problem.
