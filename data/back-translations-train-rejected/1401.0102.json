Based on danger theory, immune response in natural systems is a result of sensing corruption as well as sensing unknown substances. In contrast, traditional self-nonself discrimination theory states that immune response is only initiated by sensing nonself (unknown) patterns. Danger theory solves many problems that could only be partially explained by the traditional model. Although the traditional model is simpler, such problems result in high false positive rates in immune-inspired intrusion detection systems. We believe using danger theory in a multi-agent environment that computationally emulates the behavior of natural immune systems is effective in reducing false positive rates. We first describe a simplified scenario of immune response in natural systems based on danger theory and then, convert it to a computational model as a network protocol. In our protocol, we define several immune signals and model cell signaling via message passing between agents that emulate cells. Most messages include application-specific patterns that must be meaningfully extracted from various system properties. We finally provide a few rules of thumb to simplify the task of pattern extraction in most distributed systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 Dec 2013 06:18:18 GMT  (893kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0102v1", "10 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Fri, 28 Feb 2014 22:07:13 GMT  (348kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0102v2", "10 pages, 3 figure"], ["v3", "Sun, 28 Dec 2014 05:14:01 GMT  (633kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0102v3", "10 pages, 3 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.AI cs.CR cs.MA", "authors": ["mahdi zamani", "mahnush movahedi", "mohammad ebadzadeh", "hossein pedram"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.0102"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.0102.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Danger-Based Approach to Intrusion Detection", "authors": ["Mahdi Zamani", "Mahnush Movahedi", "Mohammad Ebadzadeh", "Hossein Pedram", "Richard Dawkins"], "emails": ["(zamani@cs.unm.edu)"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "\"Don't just declare things irreducibly complex\"...

We also assume that the opponent is static, which means that he must select the group of bad parties at the beginning of the protocol."}, {"heading": "5 Our Protocol", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We proposed an immune-inspired protocol based on immunological risk theory for detecting intruders in distributed systems. Hazard theory is capable of solving many important problems in immunology that could only partially be explained by the traditional theory of self-discrimination, which often leads to high false positive rates in immune-inspired IDS. We believe that the use of danger theory in an environment with multiple agents simulating the natural immune system is effective in reducing false positive rates. In our protocol, we model multiple immune signals via messages that can be transmitted between agents. Most messages contain feature vectors that need to be meaningfully extracted from different system properties. Although we have described a few rules of thumb to simplify this delicate task, one should consider application-specific strategies to extract the best features. On the other hand, we believe that most distributed systems have several aspects in common and that applying our protocol to other systems can be useful in a very detailed way."}], "references": [{"title": "Maximizing Data Locality in Distributed Systems", "author": ["F.
