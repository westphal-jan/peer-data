Other areas use different techniques such as fuzzy logic, rule-based thinking, CLIPS, etc., which actually fall within the decision and planning area of ES. No matter in which business area one is engaged, ES can meet the need for higher productivity and reliability of decisions. Anyone can find an application potential in the field of ESs. Expert systems can actually help create opportunities for new areas of work. In order to be considered useful and acceptable, ESs must be able to explain their knowledge of the area and the reasoning processes they use to produce results and recommendations.

With some adjustments to the knowledge base, the Heart Failure Program makes appropriate diagnoses about 90% of the time on this training package. Among the main reasons for the inadequate diagnoses of the remaining 10% are inadequate reasoning with time relationships between cause and effect, severity relationships, and independence from acute and chronic diseases."}, {"heading": "Shu-hsien Liao :", "text": "We conclude that KM technologies tend to evolve in the direction of expert orientation, and the development of KM applications is a problem-oriented domain.

The knowledge base was created with the support of clinical experts, based on current management standards, guidelines and results of clinical trials in accordance with evidence-based medical rules. Data from new patients is added to the case database. Inference engine integrates two types of reasoning, rule-based and case-based. Computer expert system provides clear and objective answers.
