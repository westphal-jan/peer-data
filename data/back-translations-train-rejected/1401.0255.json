EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION", "text": "We collected three weeks of click logs from a major commercial search engine and used the data of the first week to calculate priorities, the data of the second week for training and the data of the third week for the test. We filter the data and keep only sessions in which at least one remote display was displayed. Our test setup is more like a real-world deployment scenario and differs somewhat from the usual practice of randomly splitting available data into a training and test set. In particular, we keep all queries in the test set, even if they were not observed in the training set. In this case, our estimate is based exclusively on priors compiled from the first data week. We put \u03b1\u03b3i + \u03b2 \u03b3 i = 10 and \u03b1 \u03b7 i + \u03b2 \u03b7 i = 10. Table 1 summarizes our training data statistics.

Finally, this is the main motivation behind the study of click models. Since other models do not distinguish between attractiveness and relevance after the click, we will only compare our algorithm with the dynamic Bayesian network model (DBN) of [4]. Details of this experiment can be found in Section 4.3.For our second set of experiments (sections 4.4 to 4.8), we will focus on checking whether our model is capable of accurately predicting the sequence of user clicks. Click models are usually evaluated by calculating the average perplexity or closely related log probability on the test theorem. Remember that the perplexity for a single user session asp = 2 \u2212 1 n \u00b2 n \u00b2 n = 1 Ci = 1 Ci log qi + (1 Ci) log + 1 (1) log qi (1) we will observe the probability of a log (1 \u2212 19) where an observation of the Qi is made."}, {"heading": "4.3 Predicting Post-Click Relevance", "text": "We have access to approximately 10,000 (query, ad) pairs from the test data set that have been classified as relevant or irrelevant by trained human editors. Note that human editors look into the landing pages to determine the labels. [4] In the following, we evaluate these (q, d) pairs using a score calculated by click relevance (attractiveness times by click relevance).The results for our model and DBN are shown in Figure 4. Our proposed model clearly exceeds DBN across all reminders. In particular, it should be noted that our model has high accuracy with low memory and is therefore capable of placing relevant documents higher on the list compared to DBN. Our model achieves an AUC of 0.8653 compared to DBN, which can only reach 0.7843."}, {"heading": "4.4 Predicting the First Clicked Ad", "text": "This is a multi-class classification problem with unbalanced class probabilities. Hence PM, which predicts that the first click takes place at position one and has an accuracy of 72.27% on our test data set. AM has an accuracy of 73.5%, while the accuracy of DBN and ICM is 72.7% and 71.7%, respectively. In our model, we predict the display with the maximum click inclination as the first click. This gives an accuracy of 79.59%, a gain of over 8.2% compared to the other models. To better understand the performance of models across different deciles, we plot the accuracy of different models in Figure 5. Note that we consistently outperform all other models across all deciles, with gains for the lower deciles, which are harder to learn, being more significant."}, {"heading": "4.5 Predicting the Entire Click Sequence", "text": "We calculate the click propensity for each click sequence with the same length as the actual click sequence. We say that our model only predicted the click sequence if we correctly predicted the entire click sequence. Table 3 summarizes the results. Our model gains 8.6% (or 25%) in predicting two-click sequences and 3.4% (or 37%) in predicting three-click sequences over DBN (or PM). Model accuracy is comparable when predicting four click sequences that make up only a very small fraction of the data. Although AM is very competitive in predicting the first click, it is unable to accurately predict longer click sequences."}, {"heading": "4.6 Ranking of the Actual Click Sequence", "text": "In the previous section, we focused on correctly predicting the entire click sequence. Here, we focus on how we classify the actual click sequences based on the log probability. To do this, we calculate the log probability for all permutations of click sequences. We then sort the click sequences based on the calculated log probability and check the rank of the actual click sequence in this list. Table 4 summarizes our results. As shown in Table 1, our model ranks the actual click sequence on average among the top 3 or 4 of all possible permutations of the click sequence. Figure 7 shows how the ranking of the actual click sequence varies across different query deciles. As shown in Table 1, longer click sequences are more common in the lower deciles, and therefore our model has more data to learn in those deciles. Consequently, the average rank of the actual click sequence, as predicted by our model for two, four and three clicks, is lower in the lower deciles."}, {"heading": "4.7 Predicting Top Clicks", "text": "Here we ignore the order and focus on understanding whether our model is capable of predicting the positions of the clicks in two- and three-click sessions. Table 5 shows that we outperform all other models in predicting the top 2 and 3-click positions."}, {"heading": "4.8 Predicting Reverse Click Sequences", "text": "In our last experiment, we focus only on those sessions in which at least one click pair was observed in reverse order (reverse-click sessions); as before, we focus only on accuracy (table 6), the rank of the actual click sequence (table 7), and the accuracy of predicting the position of the top clicks (table 8); Figure 9 shows the accuracy and rank of the actual click sequence for different deciles; and Figure 10 shows the accuracy of predicting click positions in two and three click sessions. As expected, our model prediction accuracy for reverse-click sessions is low, as reverse-click sessions account for only about 30% of multi-click sessions; although our accuracy is lower than the attractiveness model, our model ranks the actual reverse-click sequences in the top 5 of all possible permutations of the click sequence; our model performs all other models in most experiments and still achieves a better ranking order than the actual click sequence even when observed in reverse-click sequence."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We have introduced a new multiple-click model for modeling how users interact with and click on sponsored search results. Our model can handle reverse-click sequences and outperforms other models in a range of different metrics in a comprehensive empirical evaluation. Online-sponsored search results are evaluated using a generic second-price auction mechanism (GSP) based on the assumption that clicks on ads are independent of each other. We are currently working on developing price mechanisms that take clicking behavior into account in our model. Our efforts also aim to improve the accuracy of our model's reverse-click prediction by using stronger priorities.Finally, we are working on making our model robust against others.APPENDIX"}, {"heading": "A.
