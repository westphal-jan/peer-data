Objective: This paper proposes GICoordinator. It is a GIS-based assistant software agent that assists and collaborates with the human planner in strategic planning and macro tasks assignment for centralized multi-agent coordination. Method: Our approach to design GICoordinator was to: analyze the problem, design a complete data model, design an architecture of GICoordinator, specify required capabilities of human and system in coordination problem solving, specify development tools, and deploy. Result: The result was an architecture/design of GICoordinator that contains system requirements. Findings: GICoordinator efficiently integrates geoinformatics with artifice intelligent techniques in order to provide a spatial intelligent coordinator system for an IC to efficiently coordinate and control agents by making macro/strategic decisions.

Analyze the Problem", "text": "The first step is the complete analysis and description of the problem. The main dimensions of the problem are: the problem area, the structure of a team, geographical information, macro tasks, requirements, assumptions, the objective function, the strategic action plan and the macro task plan [4]."}, {"heading": "B. Design the Architecture of GICoordinator", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one is able to find a solution that enables one to find a solution that meets the needs of the individual."}, {"heading": "C. Design the Data Model", "text": "This data model is important to support the development of the GICoordinator and the implementation of the capabilities designed for this system. [4] The data model designed merely formulates the planning and scheduling problem faced by the IC, although spatially distributed agents can observe, collect and transmit many types of information from their local environment to the accident center. Uncertainties are represented by the correct attributes of the classes of this data model and they are used by related algorithms. This data model formulates and presents all USAR operations and similar crisis operations. It also formulates a team of different actors. The size of a team and the size of a disaster scenario are scalable, but it is important to model all required information in the data model."}, {"heading": "D. Development tools", "text": "There are many tools and approaches that can be used to implement and develop a system. In our methodology, Table 2 shows the tools that were used to develop the GICoordinator, explaining how each component should be implemented and developed. We used the C #.Net programming language to develop the GICoordinator. Algorithms, the structure of the system and rules were implemented in the program. All system requirements defined in Table 1 were implemented by the developer using the specified development tools. A central concern in the development of the GICoordinator is that the designed data model was used to develop his system, and there are interdependencies between the functions of the system. All functions should be carried out in an integrated system. Any change in the data model can cause the system to fail."}, {"heading": "E. Deploy", "text": "GICoordinator is used in two ways: first, to calculate a viable strategic plan & timetable that partially specifies the actions of stakeholders by collaborating between people and the system prior to execution; second, to automatically and autonomously adapt / refine macro-strategic decisions to new situations during execution and in real-time; as Figure 1 shows, the GIS and the software agent have a connection to the spatial database; and, in order to operate GICoordinator, the spatial database, whose structure is based on the designed data model, must contain essential information about the initial state of the world, which can be inserted or modified by humans via the user interface provided by GICoordinator for human-system interaction [4]."}, {"heading": "III. RESULTS", "text": "The result was an architecture / design of the GICoordinator that contains system requirements."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSION", "text": "The key findings are (1) the support of human decisions with geo-spatial intelligent software systems, (2) the provision of A.I. techniques for strategic planning, assignment of macroeconomic tasks, planning and automated adjustment of these decisions in central multi-agent coordination, (3) the involvement of humans in the cycle and the cooperation between humans and systems in decision-making. Future work will consist of addressing the defined capabilities of the GICoordinator through several essays."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "R.N. is grateful for the financial support of the GCOE-HSE of Kyoto University, which enabled him to be a visiting scholar at the Information Science Institute of the University of Southern California and the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University in December 2011 and November 2012."}], "references": [{"title": "Using GIS to Develop an Efficient Spatio-temporal Task Allocation Algorithm to Human Groups in an Entirely Dynamic Environment Case Study: Earthquake Rescue Teams.", "author": ["Vafaeinezhad", "Ali Reza", "Ali Asghar Alesheikh", "Majid Hamrah", "Reza Nourjou", "Rouzbeh Shad"], "venue": "In Computational Science and Its Applications\u2013ICCSA", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Introduction to spatially distributed intelligent assistant agents for coordination of human-agent teams\u2019 actions.", "author": ["Nourjou", "Reza", "Michinori Hatayama", "Hirokazu Tatano"], "venue": "In Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR),", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Automated adaptation of strategic guidance in multiagent coordination.", "author": ["Maheswaran", "Rajiv T", "Pedro Szekely", "Romeo Sanchez"], "venue": "In Agents in Principle, Agents in Practice,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Data Model of the Strategic Action Planning and Scheduling Problem in a Disaster Response Team.", "author": ["Nourjou", "Reza", "Pedro Szekely", "Michinori Hatayama", "Mohsen Ghafory- Ashtiany", "Stephen F.
