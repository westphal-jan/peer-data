E-Commerce", "text": "E-commerce or e-commerce can be defined as the exchange of goods and services over the Internet or other computer network infrastructures. E-commerce follows the same basic principles as traditional commerce - i.e. buyers and sellers come together to exchange goods for money. In e-commerce, buyers and sellers do business via networked computers that can be conducted across cities, countries or continents. There are two major e-commerce styles: Business-2-consumer and Business-2-business-e-commerce models. The operation of the B2C models is the one that uses the Internet to sell products or services directly to consumers or end consumers. In B2C e-commerce, the Internet, and in particular the Web, is the medium for marketing, selling and post-POS channels. The B2B e-commerce model provides for companies to do business with each other, e.g. manufacturers who sell to merchants and wholesalers who sell to retailers."}, {"heading": "B. Current E-Commerce", "text": "A search for product offerings is the starting point for most e-commerce transactions. E-commerce web applications are designed to return the most appropriate data to the user based on limited keywords provided by the user, and current applications fail to return the relevant data to the consumer. Limitations in current e-commerce are: - Interoperability in an inconsistent environment: This situation occurs when the consumer is in a state of conflict in order to choose the best option from the available websites. - Information query and search inequality: This situation occurs when the machine cannot intelligently recommend products based on existing search indices."}, {"heading": "C. Semantic Web", "text": "The semantic web is not a separate web, but an extension of the current one, in which the semantics of information and services of the web are defined, enabling the web to understand and satisfy people's needs, to use the web content [3, 4], allowing computers and people to work better together. To make the web semantic, new standard ontology languages are needed. Ontology is a key and prerequisite for a functioning semantic web. Ontologies are used to express information in a machine-interpretable form, but due to the early stages of the semantic web's development, many people are not interested in producing ontology. One way to overcome this problem is the semi-automatic creation of business ontology from existing resources such as the knowledge base model, in order to promote the rapid development of the semantic web."}, {"heading": "D. Ontology", "text": "Ontologies can be defined as \"formal and explicit specifications of a common conceptualization > > Issues\" > Ontologies are central to the implementation of the Semantic Web. They contain domain knowledge, specific data about a specific subject field, in a very structured manner, if we compare this definition with that given for the Semantic Web in [5], \"the conceptual structuring of the Web in an explicitly machine-readable manner.\" It helps to achieve interoperability and communication between software systems, improve the design and quality of software systems, and play a key role in agent communication, improving the accuracy of search and enabling the development of powerful applications that address complicated queries whose answers are not on a single web page. < Some basic ontology languages are XML / XML Schemas, RDF and RDF Schemas.www.ijors.orgXML / XML Schemas.XML Schemas."}, {"heading": "F. RDF (Resource Description Framework)", "text": "RDF is a language for expressing data models in XML syntax. XML provides an elementary syntax for structuring the data [6]. It provides the meaning of this structured data [4,5]. RDF is used to describe web resources. RDF uses XML and forms the basis of the semantic web, so that all other languages corresponding to the upper layers build on it. RDF is a formal data model for machine-comprehensible metadata used to describe web resources by default. RDF assertion consists of a threefold subject, predicate, object in which a subject possesses a property whose property value can be either a string literal or a reference to another resource. With RDF, it is possible to add predefined modeling primitives for expressing semantics of data in a document without making any assumptions about the structure of the document. RDF defines a resource that is uniquely identifiable by an URI."}, {"heading": "G. RDF Schema", "text": "< RDF Schema (RDFS) is a type system for RDF. < > RDFS is technologically advanced compared to RDF in that it provides a way to create an object model that references actual data and tells us what things really mean. In short, the RDF Schema (RDFS) allows users to define resources with classes, properties, and values. A class is a structure of similar things and inheritance is allowed [8], allowing resources to be defined as instances of classes, and subclasses of classes. <? xml version = \"2\" > < rdf: RDF xmlns: RDF xmlns: rdf: rdf = \"http: / / / www.rdf / www.rdf-srdf.\""}, {"heading": "I. Level of Semantics", "text": "Semantics is the study of the meaning of signs, terms or words. Depending on the models or methods used to add terms semantics, different degrees of semantics can be achieved. There are four www.ijorcs.org levels of semantic representations that can be used to describe terms semantically, they are controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesaurus and ontologies. These four model representations are illustrated below. - Controlled vocabulary: Controlled vocabularies are at the lowest level of the semantic spectrum. A controlled vocabulary is a list of terms. All terms in a controlled vocabulary should have an explicit, non-redundant definition and are the lowest level of classification. A controlled vocabulary is the simplest of all metadata methods of classification and it is the most common method of autism. For example, the following Vocabulary has a controlled hierarchy."}, {"heading": "A. Semantic Web Ecommerce Architecture", "text": "The following figure shows the architecture of the semantic web-based eCommerce application. The producer manufactures the products and advertises the details on the web market. The consumer is an individual or end user who purchases products or services for personal use over the Internet or via networked connections. Agents are intended to reduce the flood of work and information of the consumer [7]. In the increasing growth of eCommerce technologies, services and information on the Internet, an agent plays a very important role. Agents are active personalized software to which tasks can be delegated.In this semantic architecture, we have two types of agent, namely: 1. Search Agent 2. Ontology AgentsThe consumer communicates directly with the search agent, either through the search box; the agent is responsible for retrieving the metadata of documents based on custom keyword inputs. The producer communicates with the ontology agent who provides the knowledge of ontology in order to answer queries about the domains and their structure.The user's search should be based on the architecture that any service agent has shown or on the product."}, {"heading": "B. Ontology Design Process", "text": "There are many ways to build ontologies for e-commerce transactions on the Internet. Developing ontologies in e-commerce requires a tool to analyze business models in e-commerce.

To some extent, the model ontology framework was inspired by the various ontology projects described in the academic literature. Ontology essentially conveys a common understanding of a specific domain by defining its elements and the relationships between these elements.

[VI. CONCLUSIONIn this research, a business ontology framework called LB2CO can be developed for a typical B2C eCommerce transaction. However, the ontology framework used to develop business ontology for Semantic Auto Store can also be used to develop business ontology for most small and medium-sized businesses transactions on the Net. However, the fantastic advantage of LB2CO ontology framework is that it can be implemented on different platforms for different domains.
