After the presentation of the language, we focused on the characterization of verification operations against P-PreDeLP KBs. We presented a series of postulates inspired by those submitted for an unprioritized revision of classical beliefs, and then studied a construction based on these postulates, proving that the two characteristics are equivalent. As future work, we plan to investigate other types of operators, such as more general ones that allow modification of EM, as well as others that operate at different levels of granularity. Finally, we will examine the application of PPreDeLP to real-world problems in cybersecurity and cyberwarfare."}], "references": [{"title": "On the use of presumptions in structured defeasible reasoning", "author": ["M.V.

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic structured argumentation framework that arises from the extension of Presumptive Defeasible Logic Programming (PreDeLP) with probabilistic models, and argue that this formalism is capable of addressing the basic issues of handling contradictory and uncertain data. Then, to address the last issue, we focus on the study of non-prioritized belief revision operations over probabilistic PreDeLP programs. We propose a set of rationality postulates \u2013 based on well-known ones developed for classical knowledge bases \u2013 that characterize how such operations should behave, and study a class of operators along with theoretical relationships with the proposed postulates, including a representation theorem stating the equivalence between this class and the class of operators characterized by the postulates.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
