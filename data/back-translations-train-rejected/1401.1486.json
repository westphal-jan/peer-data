GUISL: DESIGN ISSUES", "text": "Most of the names of the ancient scriptures are based either on the names of the cities / towns (e.g. Khudabadi, Thattai, etc.) or on the names of the communities (e.g. Memonki, Luhaniki, Khojiki, Devnagri, etc.) that are committed to promoting Devnagri scripts used for Sindhi to publish the translation of the Bible and the SindhiEnglish dictionary with Devnagri scripts, a movement that has been rejected by some government workers who are only familiar with Perso Arabic scripts."}, {"heading": "3. Design & development of the GUISL", "text": "In order to design and standardize the Sindhi user interface, three main problems are analyzed: Unicode of characters, keyboard layout, and Sindhi italics. Unfortunately, there is no sequence (sort) of Sindhi Unicode characters at the Unicode level, and all characters are scattered and mixed with Arabic and Farsi character sets, as shown in Fig. 4 (Sindhi characters are displayed in circles, highlighting their positions at the plane).The lack of a sequence and a separate character encoding set leads to the development of adhoc-based systems for the process of Sindhi computation.The first step is to change the orientation of all GUI elements (toolbar, status bar, writing direction, menus, tooltips, pop-up menus, etc.) in the system from right to left, thus rendering the initial, middle, and last representation of the characters correspondingly with the correct italics for the ligature [9] to form the word."}, {"heading": "3.1 Unicode Based Sindhi Characters Coding", "text": "A static class in Java language has been established in which all Unicode-based Sindhi characters are used in GUISL, as shown in the pseudo-code specified in the algorithm.

CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "text": "This paper focuses on the question of designing and developing a GUISL. Various features and problems concerning the use of Sindhi in data processing were discussed, such as changing the alignment of the text from right to left, the arrangement / sorting of Sindhi Unicode characters and the appropriate italicity in word ligation. After successful implementation of the algorithms FIG. 6 (D). ON-SCREEN SINDHI SEQUENTIAL KEYBOARDFIG. 6 (E). ON.SCREEN SINDHI KEYBOARDdiscussed, the GUI of any application can be defined in Sindhi language. The topics and methods discussed can also be applied to other languages written in Perso-Arabic font. This work aimed at providing a general programming framework for the development of Sindhi-based applications. Based on the present work, we are now in the process of developing a text processor that supports Sindhi calculation and translation tools."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "The authors are obliged to acknowledge the valuable suggestions of anonymous reviewers who have contributed to improving the readability of this article in MEHRAN UNIVERSITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY, VOLUME 30, NO. 4, OCTOBER, 2011 [ISSN 0254-7821]."}], "references": [{"title": "An Introduction to Sindhi Literature", "author": ["G.A.
