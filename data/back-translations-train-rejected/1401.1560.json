This paper proposes a revised hybrid model built upon empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based on the feed-forward neural network (FNN) modeling framework incorporating the slope-based method (SBM), which is capable of capturing the complex dynamic of crude oil prices. Three commonly used multi-step-ahead prediction strategies proposed in the literature, including iterated strategy, direct strategy, and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) strategy, are examined and compared, and practical considerations for the selection of a prediction strategy for multi-step-ahead forecasting relating to crude oil prices are identified. The weekly data from the WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil spot price are used to compare the performance of the alternative models under the EMD-SBM-FNN modeling framework with selected counterparts. The quantitative and comprehensive assessments are performed on the basis of prediction accuracy and computational cost. The results obtained in this study indicate that the proposed EMD-SBM-FNN model using the MIMO strategy is the best in terms of prediction accuracy with accredited computational load.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jan 2014 01:59:53 GMT  (339kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1560v1", "32 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "32 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["tao xiong", "yukun bao", "zhongyi hu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.1560"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.1560.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Beyond One-Step-Ahead Forecasting: Evaluation of Alternative Multi-Step-Ahead Forecasting Models for Crude Oil Prices", "authors": ["Tao Xiong", "Yukun Bao", "Zhongyi Hu"], "emails": ["yukunbao@hust.edu.cn", "y.bao@ieee.org"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This is a print template that has been approved for publication in Energy Economics.

This paper proposes a revised hybrid model based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), based on the modeling framework of the forward-looking neural network (FNN), including the waste-based method (SBM), which is able to capture the complex dynamics of crude oil prices.

Conclusions", "text": "In this study, we evaluated the performance of multi-step crude oil price predictions made using the revised EMD-based FNN modeling framework. In addition, the three leading prediction strategies proposed in the literature are reviewed and their performance evaluated in27, which generate high-quality multi-step predictions related to the crude oil market. Results show that the proposed EMD-SBM-FNN, using the MIMO strategy, is a very promising prediction technique with high-quality predictions and accredited computational loads for multi-step crude oil price forecasting. In addition to crude oil prices, the proposed modelling framework could be used for other difficult multi-step forecasting tasks in the energy market, such as energy consumption, which requires further studies. Furthermore, the EEMD recently proposed by Wu and Huang (2009) will represent a significant improvement in energy forecasting."}, {"heading": "Caption page", "text": "Table 1: Multi-stage energy forecasting studies Table 2: Prediction accuracy measurements for hold-out samplesTable 3: SPA test for different forecast modelsTable 4: Time required for three models for each forecast horizontFig. 1: EMD with inclination-based methodFig. 2: The proposed framework for EMD-SBM-FNN modelling for multi-stage forecasting Fig. 3: Experimental method for multi-stage crude oil price prediction"}, {"heading": "Figures", "text": "\"It is not as if it were a way of dealing with it, in which it is a way of dealing with it, in which it is a way of dealing with it, in which it is a way of dealing with it.\" () \"It is not as if.\" () \"It is as if.\" () \"It is as if.\" () \"It is as if.\" () \"It is as if.\" () \"It is as if.\" () \"It is as if.\" () \"It is as if.\" () \"It is as if.\" () \"It is as if.\" () \"It is.\" () \"It is.\" () \"It is.\" () \"It is.\" (It.) \"It is.\" (It.) \"It is.\" (It. \"It is.\" (It.) \"It is.\" (It. \"It.\" It. \"()\" It. \"It.\" It. \"It.\" () \"It.\" It. \"It.\" It. \"It.\" It. \"It.\" It. \"It.\" It. \"It.\" It. \"It.\" It. \"It.\" It. \"It.\" It. \"It.\" It. \"It.\" () It. \"It.\" It. \"(It.\" It. \"It.\" It. \"() It.\" It. \"it.\" it. \"(It.\" (It. \") is.\" (it. \"it.\" (it. \")\" it. \"(it.\" it. \"it.\" (it. \") is.\" it. \"(it.\") is. \"it.\" (it. \"it.\") It. \"(it.\" it. \"(it.\" it. \"it.\" it. \"(it.\") is. \"it.

(2012) proposed a wavelet decomposed ensemble model for crude oil price analysis and forecasting. Narayan and Narayan (2007) used a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to forecast crude oil price volatility. However, an important point to note from past studies is their preoccupation with one-step-ahead forecasting rather than multi-step-ahead forecasting. In the one-step-ahead case, the predictor uses all or some of the observations to estimate a variable of interests for the time-step immediately following the latest observation. However, it provides no information as to the long-term future behavior of crude oil prices. For this reason, one may justifiably argue that the comparison of alternative one-step-ahead forecasting is of limited use. For an improved and more meaningful evaluation of the performances of prediction models, the long-term future behavior of crude oil prices should be taken into account explicitly. Our focus in this study is on multi-step-ahead forecasting of crude oil prices. A multi-step-ahead forecasting extrapolates the crude oil price series by predicting many time-steps into the future without the availability of outputs in the horizon of interest. Despite the influence of many complicated factors, oil prices appear highly nonlinear and even chaotic as Panas and Ninni (2000) noted, which makes it rather difficult to forecast future oil prices, especially in the multi-step-ahead case (Fan et al.", "startOffset": 114, "endOffset": 1485}, {"referenceID": 47, "context": "For instance, an accumulation of errors and lack of information make multi-step-ahead forecasting more difficult (Weigend and Gershenfeld, 1995).", "startOffset": 113, "endOffset": 144}, {"referenceID": 33, "context": "Studies regarding prediction strategies for multi-step-ahead forecasting have been investigated in the energy market (Kusiak et al., 2009;
