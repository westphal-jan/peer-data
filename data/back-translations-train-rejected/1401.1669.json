Theory is conceived as an abstract brain-like system that can receive \"new\" information about its senses from an \"input\" perspective, and can compress some or all information to create \"old\" information, as schematically illustrated in Figure 1. In theory, information compression is the mechanism for learning and organizing knowledge, as well as pattern recognition, reasoning, problem solving, and much more. In SP theory, all kinds of knowledge are represented with patterns: arrays of atomic symbols in one or two dimensions. A key part of the system is a concept of multiple alignment, as shown in Figure 2.1. SP theory is realized in a computer model, SP70, which can be considered the first version of the SP machine."}, {"heading": "3 Unsupervised learning", "text": "While traditional computers must be programmed by humans to perform certain tasks, cognitive systems will learn from their interaction with data and humans and be able to program themselves in some sense to perform new tasks. \"[3, p. 7] The SP program derives in part from earlier research that developed generative grammars from data, including segmental structures, classes of structures, and abstract patterns. But in the development of the SP computer model, a radical reorganization was needed to achieve the goal of simplifying and integrating concepts into artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, and human perception."}, {"heading": "4 Big data", "text": "The emergence of such a system is indeed a challenge for society as a whole, but also for society as a whole."}, {"heading": "5 Computational efficiency via information", "text": "[3, p. 9] \"The human brain is a miracle. Just 20 watts of energy are needed to power the 22 billion neurons in a brain roughly the size of a grapefruit. Running a conventional computer with comparable cognitive capacity would require gigawatts of power and a machine the size of a football field. So something needs to fundamentally change to change the computing power for scanning machines so that we can use the millions of hours of video, billions of photos, and countless sensory signals that surround us in the search.... Unless we can compress computers by many orders of magnitude more efficiently, we will not be able to make full use of them."}, {"heading": "5.1 Reducing the sizes of data to be searched and of", "text": "Search terms As described in [15, Section 6.7.2], the efficiency of the search can be increased if we want to search a corpus of information, I, for examples of a pattern such as \"Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\": \u2022 by reducing the size of I so that less needs to be searched. \u2022 The size of I can be reduced by replacing all \"Treaties on the Functioning of the European Union\" with a relatively short code such as \"Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\" and other recurring patterns as well. More generally, the size of I can be reduced by the compression processes in the SP system. \u2022 By searching with a short code such as \"TFEU\" instead of a relatively large pattern such as \"Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\" Other things that are the same, a smaller search pattern means a more efficient search. With regard to the second point, there is the potential to switch the search altogether by \"hard wiring\" of the link between the individual examples of a code (EU F1) between the pattern and the European Union (S1)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Concentrating search where good results are most", "text": "If we want to find strawberry jam, our search in a supermarket is more likely to be successful than in an antique shop or a used car showroom. This may seem too simple and obvious to comment on, but it illustrates the extraordinary knowledge that most people have about an informal \"statistic\" of the world we inhabit, and how this knowledge can help us minimize our exertion.44 See also G. K. Zipp's Human Behavior and the Principle of the least effort [16].Where does this statistical knowledge come from? In SP theory, it flows directly from the central role of information compression in our perception, learning and thinking, and from the close relationship between information compression and concepts of prediction and probability [5]. Although the SP computer model calculates probabilities for some purposes (see Section 7), it actually uses levels of information compression as a guide to the search. These levels are most likely to result with today's search methods (including escape from local \"peaks,\" which are most likely to yield 3.4 to large amounts)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Economies in the transmission of data", "text": "\"In order to control the cost, the developers of the [DOME] computer system need to figure out how to minimize the energy consumption for processing data.\" [3, p. 65] Although this quote may refer in part to data movements such as that between the CPU and the memory of a computer, it is about transferring data over greater distances such as the Internet. As mentioned in section 4, the SP system has the potential for very significant savings in transferring data [15, section 6.7.1]. Any data body, I, can be compressed by encrypting in terms such as \"grammar\" (G), provided G contains the types of structures found in I (section 7). Then, I could be sent from A to B by transmitting only the \"encryption\" (E). Since a copy of G is usually recovered, the cost of G [5] is very likely."}, {"heading": "5.4 Potential gains in computational efficiency", "text": "No attempt has yet been made to quantify potential efficiency gains from compressing information as described in sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, but they could be very significant: \u2022 Since information compression is fundamental to the functioning of the SP system, there is potential for corresponding savings in all parts and levels of the system. \u2022 The entire knowledge structure that the system creates for itself is per se statistical and has potential for corresponding savings in computing costs and associated energy consumption on many fronts. It is expected that the proposed parallel version of the SP machine (section 2) will provide a means of exploring these aspects of the system."}, {"heading": "6 Data-centric computing", "text": "\"What we need is a new computing architecture that is more inspired by the human brain. Data processing should be distributed across the entire computing system, not concentrated in one CPU. Processing and memory should be tightly integrated to reduce the back and forth of data and instructions.\" [3, p. 9] \"Scientists at IBM Research believe that to make computing sustainable in the age of large amounts of data, we will need a different type of machine - the data-centric computer.... Machines will perform calculations faster, use large amounts of data wisely, and be more energy efficient.\" [3, p. 88] The SP concepts could help integrate processing and memory, as described in the next two subsections."}, {"heading": "6.1 SP-neural", "text": "Although the main focus in the SP program was on developing an abstract framework for the representation and processing of knowledge, the theory contains suggestions - called SP-neuronal - on how these abstract concepts can be implemented with neurons. Figure 4 outlines what a conceptual structure in SP-neuronal style would look like. SP patterns are intended to be realized with pattern assemblies - groupings of neurons as shown in the figure within openwork wrappings. The overall scheme is significantly different from \"artificial neural networks,\" as they are commonly conceived in computer science. [5] It can be seen as an evolution of Donald Hebb's [2] concept of \"cell composition,\" with more precision about how structures can be divided, and other distinctions. [6] In SP-neurons, the structure of knowledge is directly reflected in the groupings of neurons and their associations, as shown in the figure. Although the details have not yet been worked out, it is understood that both patterns are inherent."}, {"heading": "6.2 Computing with light or chemicals", "text": "The SP concepts seem to be suitable for computing with light or chemicals, perhaps by passing over such things as transistors or logic gates that have played a prominent role in the development of electronic computers. [15, Section 6.10.6] At the heart of the SP system is a process of searching for good complete and partial matches between patterns. This can be done with light, with the potential advantage that beams of light can cross without interference. Another potential advantage is that with collided light there can be relatively small losses over distance - although distances should probably be minimized to save transmission times and minimize the size of computer equipment. There seems to be a potential to provide an optical or optical 5See, for example, \"Artificial Neural Networks,\" en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Artificial Neural Networks, very neural networks, retrieved 2013-12-23,6In particular, not supervised Learning System, [SP 14]."}, {"heading": "7 Errors and uncertainties in data", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "8 Other possibilities", "text": "Here we outline some other aspects of the SP system and how they can contribute to realizing the possibilities described in Smart Machines."}, {"heading": "8.1 Medical diagnosis", "text": "\"One of the next challenges for Watson is to help physicians diagnose diseases and assess the best treatments for individual patients.\" [3, p. 2] How the SP system can help with medical diagnosis is described in [9]."}, {"heading": "8.2 Processing streams of data", "text": "\"Increasingly vital insights can be gained from the analysis of information in motion.... Instead of storing the data in a database, the computer analyzes it when it comes from a variety of sources, continually refining its understanding of data as changing conditions. This is how humans process information.\" [3, pp. 49-50]. In its overall organization, the SP system is designed to process streams of \"new\" information, as schematically shown in Figure 1, and in the sense of the above quote. As indicated in Section 4, the SP system could also get to grips with the problem of data plurality mentioned in the quote."}, {"heading": "8.3 The need for radical innovations", "text": "\"Soon, incremental innovation will no longer be enough.... We need more radical innovation.\" [3, pp. 17-18] The idea that all kinds of computing and cognition can be understood as information compression through multiple alignment is indeed a radical innovation. But it is not just an eccentric impasse. Detailed studies have shown its potential in several areas that have an impact on the creation of intelligent machines."}, {"heading": "8.4 Augmenting our senses", "text": "... \"most images and audio on the web are only searchable via metadata - words that are manually entered into shapes by humans. Therefore, it is crucial to develop systems that can recognize images and sounds more like humans.\" [3, p. 69] As mentioned in Section 4, the SP system has several strengths in pattern recognition (see also [15, Section 9]; [10, Chapter 6]). How the system can be applied to vision is described in [11]. Due to the generality and versatility of the system [15, Section 4], it can probably be applied to detection of sounds and other types of sensory data."}, {"heading": "8.5 Achieving human-like flexibility and adaptability", "text": "In robots... \"until now, robots have remained firmly in the von Neumann computer paradigm. They must be programmed by humans in advance so that they can deal with almost any situation they find themselves in.\" [3, p. 72] How robots can achieve human flexibility and adaptability via the SP system is outlined in [15, Section 6.3]. For robots, in particular autonomous robots, the SP system has at least two other attractions: versatility in various aspects of intelligence and potential for computing efficiency, in particular energy efficiency (sections 5 and 6)."}, {"heading": "8.6 The need for integration", "text": "\"Today, as scientists work to develop machine technologies to expand our senses, there is a strong tendency to view each sensory field in isolation, as specialists focus only on a single sensory ability. Experts in every sense do not read journals devoted to the other senses, and they do not attend each other's conferences. Even within IBM, our specialists in various sensor technologies do not interact much. However, if machines are to help people understand the world, they must understand it and communicate about it in a way that is familiar and understandable to humans.\" [3, p. 74] This quote touches on a topic that is at the heart of the SP research program: the inappropriate simplification and integration of concepts in various areas."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "The SP system could help realize cognitive computing as described in Smart Machines. It is designed to simplify and integrate concepts between artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, and human perception and cognition. It has potential for unattended learning of structure in data, and can be helpful in the management and analysis of big data. Information compression can mean significant gains in computing efficiency, especially in the use of energy. It could help realize data-centric computing, and it could facilitate the management of errors and uncertainties in data. Creating a highly parallel open source version of the SP machine, as described in Section 2, would be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system, and create new versions of it."}], "references": [{"title": "Towards practical, high-capacity, low-maintenance information storage in synthesized DNA", "author": ["N.
