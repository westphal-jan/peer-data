Although we do not need a probability for the points we want to make in this work, it is also important for the agents to be able to think about their probalistic beliefs. Therefore, we take as a basis a proposition logic for the argument about probability. The syntax of logic is simple (and in fact is essentially the syntax already used in essays going back to Fagin and Halpern [1994]). There is a finite, not empty set N = {1,...., n} of players and a countable, not empty set of primitive suggestions.

To allow for different interpretations, we use an approach that was previously used [Halpern 2009; Grove and Halpern 1993]: formulas are interpreted relative to a player. An (epistemic probability) structure (over) has the formM = (amounj) j \"N,\" (Pj) j \"N,\" where each player defines the state space, and for each i \"N\" is a division of the state probability, \"Pi\" is a function that assigns each person a probability space to Pi. \""}, {"heading": "2.3 Prior-generated beliefs", "text": "One assumption that we do not necessarily make, but want to examine in this context, is the general-prior assumption. The general-prior assumption is an instance of a more general assumption that beliefs are generated from a previous state that we are now defining. Intuition is that players start with a prior probability; they then update the previous one in light of their information. Player i's information is captured by their partition."}, {"heading": "2.4 Capturing ambiguity", "text": "We use epistemic probability structures to give meaning to formulas. Since primitive suggestions are interpreted relative to the players, we must allow the interpretation of any formula that also depends on the players. Exactly, how we do this depends on what further assumptions we make about the interpretations of the other player. There are many assumptions that could be made. The first approach is suitable for situations where players can interpret statements differently, but it does not occur to them that there is any other way to interpret the statement. Thus, in this model, if there is a public announcement, all players think that their interpretation of the announcement is general knowledge."}, {"heading": "3 Common interpretations suffice", "text": "In this section, we show in a sense that we do not need structures with ambiguity. Specifically, we show that the same formulas are valid in common structures of interpretation as in structures that do not have a common interpretation, no matter what semantics we use, even if we have ambiguity about the information structures. To clarify this, we need some notations. Fix a non-empty, countable compilation of primitive suggestions, and let M (both) be the structures that satisfy A1-A4 and are defined by some non-empty subclauses."}, {"heading": "4 A more general language", "text": "Although we have allowed agents who were high enough to recognize that different agents could interpret things in different ways, if we look at the innermost range, our syntax did5This is the one argument that requires the assumption that the set of primitive propositions can be chosen in such a way that they can be different in different structures in M (B), and the fact that every single requirement (B) is countable. We have assumed for simplicity that the propositions pi, n) and that they can be chosen in such a way that they can be chosen in such a way that other agents interpret formulas. Here, we are looking at a language rich enough to allow this. Specifically, we have primitive propositions of the form (p, i) that can be interpreted as \"i-interpretation of p.\""}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "We defined a logic for thinking about ambiguity and then showed that we do not need structures with ambiguity in two ways: (1) the same axioms record whether we have ambiguity or not, and (2) we can use richer language to talk about ambiguity while giving all formulas an unambitious interpretation. (1) So why do we bother using structures with ambiguity? Perhaps the main reason for this is that it enables us to describe the situation from the agent's point of view. For example, when we are dealing with the most extreme extent, an agent does not realize that there are other interpretations than the one he uses. Thus, the simpler language captures the agents \"assertions more directly. Similarly, a structure with ambiguity could describe more accurately than a structure with a common interpretation. We therefore believe that structures with ambiguity will prove useful."}], "references": [{"title": "Agreeing to disagree", "author": ["R.J.
