CUSTOMIZATION DETECTION", "text": "In Figure 3.1 Customization Detector, Scoper and Instrumentor identify all customizable content in the PBP and identify those that require customization due to discrepancies with the secondary business process, and the result is recorded by the Record Writer in Event Records. Customization Detector relies on the NLP Rule Engine to draw conclusions from the OWL-BPC ontology for knowledge of business process customization, and also relies on the OnExCat categorization tool to overcome the semantic heterogeneity of different business process descriptions."}, {"heading": "2.1. Ontology Matching", "text": "The ExCat tool, which is used for ontology, compares two important elements that enable an automatic way of processing business process adaptations: the upper ontology of a business process and the upper ontology of process adaptation. Both upper ontologies must connect to the domain ontology during inference by an inference technique. An upper ontology for adapting business processes such as OWL-BPC is enabled by the presence of a machine. 1.

In the categorization of ontology instances, the terms are treated as a category search problem."}, {"heading": "3. CUSTOMIZATION ENACTOR", "text": "Figure 3.1 shows that the Customization Enactor consists of the Event Generator, the Customization Executor, and the Notification Dispatcher. The Event Generator records the event logs and generates events; the events are forwarded to the NLP Rule Engine for processing; the rules of the Customization Engine are pre-processed by a Rule Editor that is not shown in the figure above; the NLP Rule Engine passes the action command, if any rules are triggered, to the Customization Executor to execute the customization; it also forwards the events to the Notification Dispatcher, which is the owner of the PBP and the SBPs.KQML (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language) is a language and protocol for communication between software agents and knowledge-based systems; the KQML message format and protocol can be used to interact with an intelligent system, either through the other system, or through the application program."}, {"heading": "4.

CONCLUSION", "text": "Behavioral adjustment in non-trivial cases may depend on the runtime context of the business process execution. To develop a more comprehensive theoretical framework for solving this problem, the framework is only able to perform the adjustment statically before the business process is instantiated. As the OWL-BPC is to handle both static and dynamic adjustment in the course of implementing a dynamic adjustment capacity during or after the instantiation time, Figure 6.1 shows the comparison graph between the inference control machines used in the framework of business process customization. By using the Natural Language Inference, the adjustment efficiency is increased compared to the existing one. The human semantic web in terms of customizing the processes of automated business transactions by taking into account the various characteristics of individual business partners, the way in which companies nowadays operate is more dependent on electronic devices and documents in a networked manner. The use of such documents and most of such documents is supported by the effective web technology."}, {"heading": "Authors", "text": "Prof.V.Karthikeyan holds a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from PGP College of Engineering and Technology in Namakkal, India.
