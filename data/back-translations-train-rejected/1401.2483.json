Sepak takraw or kickvolleyball is a sport native to Southeast Asia that resembles volleyball except that it uses a rattan ball and only allows players to use their feet and head to touch the ball. A cross between football and volleyball, it is a popular sport in Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, the Philippines and Indonesia. Lately, the game has also become famous outside Asia, such as the United States, Canada, England, Germany, Brazil and New Zealand, where the game is played as a leisure activity and tournament.

Propositions that do not obtain the zero mass are called focal elements. However, the sum of these probability masses is one, the fundamental difference between the Dempster-Shafer theory and the traditional probability theory is that the focal elements of a Dempster-Shafer structure may overlap.

The simplest method for quantifying uncertainty in a database is to assign a probability to each member of a relationship and to use these values to determine the probability that a particular value is the correct answer to a particular query. Knowledge in the collection of basic events is uncertain and can be used directly in simple cases to draw conclusions, but in many cases the various related events."}], "references": [{"title": "Prediction of the movement patterns for human squat jumping using the inverse-inverse dynamics technique", "author": ["SD Farahani", "MD Zee", "MS Andersen", "ME Lund", "J Rasmussen"], "venue": "Proceedings of XIII International Symposium on Computer Simulation in Biomechanics,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Neural Networks for Human Arm Movement Prediction in CVEs, Proceedings of 3DPVT'08 - The Fourth International Symposium on 3D Data Processing, Visualization and Transmission, USA: Atlanta", "author": ["F Stakem", "G AlRegib"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Bayesian Pattern Ranking for Move Prediction in The Game of Go", "author": ["D Stern", "R Herbrich", "T Graepel"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 23  rd International Conference on Machine Learning, PA: Pittsburgh;", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Transpositions and Move Groups in Monte Carlo Tree Search", "author": ["BE Childs", "JH Brodeur", "L Kocsis"], "venue": "IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2008}, {"title": "A Generalization of Bayesian inference", "author": ["A.P.
