Even though there are some prediction techniques addressing this problem, the approximate accuracy in predicting the protein structure is closely 75%. An automated procedure was evolved with MACA (Multiple Attractor Cellular Automata) for predicting the structure of the protein. Most of the existing approaches are sequential which will classify the input into four major classes and these are designed for similar sequences. PSMACA is designed to identify ten classes from the sequences that share twilight zone similarity and identity with the training sequences. This method also predicts three states (helix, strand, and coil) for the structure. Our comprehensive design considers 10 feature selection methods and 4 classifiers to develop MACA (Multiple Attractor Cellular Automata) based classifiers that are build for each of the ten classes. We have tested the proposed classifier with twilight-zone and 1-high-similarity benchmark datasets with over three dozens of modern competing predictors shows that PSMACA provides the best overall accuracy that ranges between 77% and 88.7% depending on the dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 00:38:52 GMT  (209kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2688v1", "6 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1310.4342,arXiv:1310.4495"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1310.4342,arXiv:1310.4495", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.LG", "authors": ["pokkuluri kiran sree", "inamupudi ramesh babu", "sssn usha devi n"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.2688"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.2688.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "PSMACA: An Automated Protein Structure Prediction Using MACA (Multiple Attractor Cellular Automata)", "authors": ["P.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "They are macrostructured molecules responsible for a wide range of vital biochemical functions that function as oxygen, cell signalling, antibody production, nutrient transport and muscle fiber buildup. Specifically, the proteins are chains of amino acids, of which there are 20 different types, coupled to peptide bonds.2 The three-tiered structural hierarchy possessed by proteins is typically referred to as primary and tertiary structure.The protein structure prediction of amino acids lends enormous value to the biological community because the higher levels and secondary levels determine the function of proteins and hence insight into their function can be derived from it. Genome sequence sequence structure projects are increasing enormously. SWISS-PORT databases3 of primary protein structures are expanding enormously."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORKS IN STRUCTURE PREDICTION", "text": "The aim of structural prediction is to determine whether the amino acid residue of the protein is present in a helix, strand or other form. In 1960, as an initiative step of structural prediction, the probability of the respective structural element for each amino acid is calculated by considering the properties of individual amino acids. 3 6 This method of structural prediction is considered a first generation technique. Later, this work was expanded by taking into account the local environment of the amino acid, which is considered a second generation technique. In the case of certain amino acid structural predictions, which are also needed, it takes into account the local environment of the amino acid, which it provides 65% structural information. Thus, this expansion work gives 60% accuracy. The third generation of the technique involves machine learning, knowledge of proteins, set of algorithms that give 70% accuracy. Neural networks 10 11 are also useful in implementing structural prediction programs such as PHD, SAM-99 to adapt the basic algorithm of the CA to be used by the evolutionary algorithm of the CA to determine the structure of the CA."}, {"heading": "3.

DESIGN OF MACA BASED PATTERN CLASSIFIER", "text": "An n-bit MACA with k-attractor basins can be considered a natural classifier. It classifies a given set of patterns into k-number of different classes, with each class containing the set of states in the attractor basin. To increase the classification accuracy of the machine, most works use MACA as shown in Figure 2 to classify patterns into two classes (say I and II). The following example shows 212 J. Bioinf.
