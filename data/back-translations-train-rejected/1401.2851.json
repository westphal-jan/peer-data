Initially, we plan to work with a simple sentence consisting of two biological units and a verbal relationship between them. However, our system also works for any type of complex or compound sentence describing the relationship between the units. In order to find the supporting lines in different literature, our first step is to perform natural language processing so that we can extract the semantic meaning of these lines and thus be able to identify their actual role in supporting the given hypothesis. As, for example, an essay contains a line: \"Protein A interacts with protein B.\" Since two units occur simultaneously in this line, our method can easily extract the relationship and store the information in the database. If one line describes the relationship in such a way that it is not obvious that the interaction of protein A with protein B really exists, \"we will categorize the line as an opposite role to any relationship between protein A and protein B."}, {"heading": "3.3 p-value Calculation", "text": "The statistical analysis of the hypothesis to be tested will be able to provide the user with a quantitative measurement of the hypothesis = In the proposed method, the hypothesis is processed and normalized through the processing of natural language in a manner discussed in the previous subsection. Basically, our aim is to test simple hypotheses that explain a relationship between biological entities. The normalization step marks the entity names expressed in the hypothesis and also finds the synonyms or aliases associated with the types of these entities from existing databases. The semantic meaning of the relationship is taken even after the containment of the verb and the necessary processing of the hypothesis. Our method then performs a database query to find out the role of the paper in supporting the given hypothesis. If it supports the hypothesis, the respective paper is counted as observed data for the p-value hypothesis."}, {"heading": "3.4 Biological Network Generation", "text": "In this approach, we will not only evaluate hypotheses statistically, but also provide a biological network that surrounds the entities in which the researcher may be interested, and the biological network will help him or her to generate new assumptions that will further develop the prospective candidate, thus obtaining resources for further investigation. Essentially, the network centers around the entities mentioned in the test hypothesis, such as \"Protein A interact protein B.\" Our tool will confirm the hypothesis and calculate the p value by means of chi-square testing. Furthermore, it will extract all other entities that cooperate with the protein A or protein B, or that build a bridge between them through transitive relationship. Graphically, the network will be presented to the user for convenience, in order to obtain a comprehensive overview of the relationships between the entities. Furthermore, the user will be able to generate new hypotheses by selecting the antecedents and then using the antecedents in the hypotheses."}, {"heading": "4 Algorithm", "text": "This year, it is so far that it is not so far before it goes to the next round."}, {"heading": "6 User Interface", "text": "In order to make the tool available to the research community, we are developing a web-based tool HypoTest, which is shown in Fig. 1. First, the user can submit his query hypothesis in text form as in Fig. 1 (a). After submitting the query, the algorithm calculates the p-value in the background with respect to existing records and then displays the result on the following page as in Fig. 1 (b). The tool not only displays the p-value of the given hypothesis, but also generates a biological user as in Fig. 1 (c). This means that the user has two options to create the query hypothesis: he can submit the test hypothesis either in text form or in graphic format. The biological network extends the researchers \"scope of thought and he can create new hypotheses for testing and exploring."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSION", "text": "The paper describes a statistical approach to calculating the significance of the hypothesis submitted by the user, thus providing an opportunity to quantitatively measure the feasibility of the hypothesis. Furthermore, the method finds an interface for the greater convenience of the user, where he will also be able to graphically represent the query and visualize the biological network surrounding the entities of his interests. As a result, he will have scope to think further and generate new hypotheses from the network and iterate the process until he achieves satisfactory results. Our tool claims to be the first initiative in the field of significance measurement of the hypothesis. The graphical input system and biological network generation give the researcher flexibility and lead to a new way of thinking. In the future, we plan to work with complex hypotheses graphically and their significance calculation in the context of existing literature."}], "references": [{"title": "Untangling text data miningx", "author": ["Hearst", "Marti A"], "venue": "IBM Syst.
