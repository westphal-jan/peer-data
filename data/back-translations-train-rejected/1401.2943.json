The Moses-based system was optimised for the news domain and differs from other available systems in four ways: (1) News items are automatically categorised on the source side, before translation; (2) Named entity translation is optimised by recognising and extracting them on the source side and by re-inserting their translation in the target language, making use of a separate entity repository; (3) News titles are translated with a separate translation system which is optimised for the specific style of news titles; (4) The system was optimised for speed in order to cope with the large volume of daily news articles.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 18:25:10 GMT  (780kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2943v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marco turchi", "martin atkinson", "alastair wilcox", "brett crawley", "stefano bucci", "ralf steinberger", "erik van der goot"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.2943"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.2943.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "ONTS: \u201cOptima\u201d News Translation System", "authors": ["Marco Turchi", "Martin Atkinson", "Alastair Wilcox", "Brett Crawley", "Stefano Bucci", "Ralf Steinberger"], "emails": ["name.surname@jrc.ec.europa.eu", "name.surname@ext.jrc.ec.europa.eu", "brettcrawley@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 1.29 43v1 [cs.CL] 1 3Ja n"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The ability to read news from other countries and compose it in other languages enables readers to be better informed. It enables them to detect national distortions of news, thereby improving transparency and democracy.Existing online translation systems such as Google Translate and Bing Translator1 are therefore a great service, but the number of documents that can be submitted is limited (Google will even discontinue its service completely in 2012) and the submission of documents means that the interests of users and their (potentially sensitive) data will be disclosed to the service provider companies.1http: / / translate.google.com / and http: / / www.microsofttranslator.com / That is why we have developed our in-house ONTS machine translation system, whose translation results will be publicly available as part of the Europe Media Monitor translation family (Steinberger et al., 2009), which collects and processes around 100,000 news articles per day in around fifty languages."}, {"heading": "2 Europe Media Monitor", "text": "Europe Media Monitor (EMM) 2 collects an average of 100,000 news articles in about 50 languages every day from about 3,400 hand-picked web news sources, from several hundred specialist and government websites, and from about twenty commercial news providers. It visits news websites up to every five minutes at 2http: / / emm.newsbrief.eu / overview.htmlsearch for the latest articles. When news sites offer RSS feeds, it uses them, otherwise it extracts the news text from the often complex HTML pages. All news articles are converted into Unicode. They are processed in a pipeline structure in which each module adds additional information. Regardless of how files are written, the system uses UTF-8-encoded RSS formats. Within the pipeline, various algorithms are implemented to create monolingual and multilingual clusters and extract different types of information such as named units, quotes, categories, and more. ONTS uses two modules called the EMM Recognition Module: EMM and EMM Recognition."}, {"heading": "2.1 Named Entity Recognition and Variant Matching.", "text": "Entity Recognition (NER) is carried out using manually constructed language-independent rules that use language-specific lists of trigger words such as titles (president), professions or professions (tennis player, playboy), references to countries, regions, ethnic or religious groups (French, Bavarian, Berber, Muslim), age expressions (57 years old), verbal phrases (deceased), modifiers (the former), etc. These patterns can also occur in combination and patterns can be nested to capture more complex titles (Steinberger and Pouliquen, 2007). To cover many different languages, no other dictionaries and no parsers or parts-of-speech taggers are used. To determine which of the names found daily are new units and which are merely variant spellings of units already included in the database, we use a language-independent measure of name similarity to decide which variants should be merged automatically."}, {"heading": "2.2 Category Classification across Languages.", "text": "All messages are categorised into hundreds of categories. Category definitions are multilingual, man-made and cover geographical regions such as every country in the world, organisations, topics such as natural disasters or security, and more specific classes such as earthquakes, terrorism or tuberculosis. Articles fall into a specific category if they meet the category definition, which consists of Boolean operators with optional environment operators and wild cards. Alternatively, cumulative positive or negative weights and a threshold can be used. uppercase letters in the category definition correspond only to uppercase letters, while lowercase letters in the definition correspond to both uppercase and lowercase letters. Many categories are defined by user input. This method of categorising articles is relatively simple and user-friendly and is suitable for handling many languages (Steinberger et al., 2009)."}, {"heading": "3 News Translation System", "text": "In this section, we describe our statistical machine translation (SMT) service based on the opensource toolkit Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and its adaptation to the translation of messages. Which is the most suitable SMT system for our requirements? The main objective of our system is to help the user understand the content of an article, which means that a translated article is rated positively even if it is not perfect in the target language. Dealing with such a large number of source languages and articles per day, our system should take into account the translation speed and try to implement language-dependent tools such as parts of language aggers.Inside the Moses toolkit, three different statistical approaches have been implemented: Phrase-based statistical translation (PBSMT) (Koehn et al al., 2003), Hierarchical Phrase-based statistical machine translation (Chiang, 2007) and syntax-based machine translation (PBSMT)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Translation Quality", "text": "In order to evaluate the translation performance of ONTS, we conduct a series of experiments in which we translate one test sentence for each language pair with our system and Google Translate. The absence of human translated parallel titles obliges us to test only the content-based model. For German, Spanish and Czech, we use the news sentences proposed in (Callison-Burch et al., 2010), for French and Italian the news sentences presented in (Callison-Burch et al., 2008), for Arabic, Farsi and Turkish sentences of 2,000 news sentences extracted from the Arabic-English and English-Persian datasets and the SE-Times corpus. For the other languages, we use 2,000 sentences that are not messages, but a mixture of JRCAcquis, Europarl and DGT-TM data. There is no guarantee that our test sentences will not be part of the training data of Google Translatugug.Each test set of Google Translate-style translation systems will be used to evaluate the performance data of our Translate Tile System, and our Italian translator system."}, {"heading": "4 Technical Implementation", "text": "The translation service consists of two components: the connection module and the Moses server. The connection module is a servlet implemented in Java. It receives the RSS files, isolates each individual news article, identifies each source language and pre-processes it. Each message is divided into sentences, each sentence is tokenised, reduced, passed through a statistical composite word splitter (Koehn and Knight, 2003), and the named Entity Annotator module. For language modeling, we use the KenLM implementation (Heafield, 2011). Depending on the language, the correct Moses servers, titles and contents are fed in a multi-thread manner. We use the multi-thread version of Moses (Haddow, 2010). When all sentences of each article are translated, the reverse process occurs: they are detokenised, reactivated and translated / unknown words are listed. The translated title and contents of each article are uploaded to the next RSS file and the Italian one."}, {"heading": "4.1 Demo", "text": "Our translation service is currently being presented on a demo page, see Figure 1, which is available at http: / / optima.jrc.it / Translate /. News articles can be accessed by selecting one of the topics and the language. All topics are assigned to each article according to the methodology described in 2.2. These articles are displayed in the left column of the user interface. If the \"Translate\" button is pressed, the translation process begins and the translated articles appear in the right column of the page. The translation system can be customized from the user interface, which activates or deactivates the named object, the connection, the recaser, the decryptor and unknown word modules. Each translated article is enriched with the translation time in milliseconds per character and, if enabled, the list of unknown words."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "We believe that the experiments described in this paper can be very useful for the development of other similar systems. Translations produced by our system will soon be available as part of the main EMM applications. The performance of our system is encouraging, but not as good as the performance of web services such as Google Translate, mainly because we use less training data and have less computing power. On the other hand, our in-house system can be fed with a large number of articles per day and sensitive data without involving third parties in the translation process. Performance and translation time vary according to the number and complexity of sentences and language pairings. The range of news articles changes dynamically according to the most important events in the world, while existing parallel data is static and is usually associated with government domains. It is our intention to investigate how the English translation system can be adapted to the day."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank the JRC OPTIMA team for their support in developing ONTS."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2014, "abstractText": "We propose a real-time machine translation<lb>system that allows users to select a news<lb>category and to translate the related live<lb>news articles from Arabic, Czech, Danish,<lb>Farsi, French, German, Italian, Polish, Por-<lb>tuguese, Spanish and Turkish into English.<lb>The Moses-based system was optimised for<lb>the news domain and differs from other<lb>available systems in four ways: (1) News<lb>items are automatically categorised on the<lb>source side, before translation; (2) Named<lb>entity translation is optimised by recog-<lb>nising and extracting them on the source<lb>side and by re-inserting their translation in<lb>the target language, making use of a sep-<lb>arate entity repository; (3) News titles are<lb>translated with a separate translation sys-<lb>tem which is optimised for the specific style<lb>of news titles; (4) The system was opti-<lb>mised for speed in order to cope with the<lb>large volume of daily news articles.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
