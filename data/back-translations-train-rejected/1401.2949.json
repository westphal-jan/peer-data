Correct classification results in a payout of 1000, otherwise 0. For example, in the k = 4 multiplexer, the following traditional rules form an optimal [M] (errors and niche size are not shown): 1111 # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 1000 1111 # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 0: 0 Figure 2 shows the performance of the YCS using the new multiaction rule representation (k = 4) problem with P = 1000, p # = 0.6, = 0.4, v = 10, = 0.5, GA = 0.2. According to [Wilson, 1995] the performance is taken to show the mean of the fractional percentage, it is displayed with an average error of only 60.000."}, {"heading": "3.2 Less Symmetry", "text": "In order to reduce symmetry in the multiplexer in a simple way, an additional bit can be added. Here, an incorrect response becomes sensitive to the value of the additional input bit: when set, the reward is 500, otherwise it is 0. That is, with the new rule representation, it is no longer possible for only one rule to apply the same generalization across the input space to accurately predict the reward for each action in a given [M]. The following traditional rules represent an optimal [M]: 1111 # # # # # # # # # # 1 #: 1: 1: 1000 1111 # # # # # # # # # # # # # 11: 0: 500 1111 # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 10: 0: 0Figure 5 shows how YCS is unable to solve the less symmetric 20-bit multiplexer using the new rule representation with P = 1000. Figure 6 and 7 show that the performance of YS without two 000p increases is equal to 0.000p, each of which two rules are equal to 0.000p with the traditional representation."}, {"heading": "3.3 Multiple Actions", "text": "Multiplexers are binary classification problems. In order to easily create a multi-class / multi-class variant, the case in which the data bit is a \"1\" is changed so that a correct response requires an action corresponding to the value of the address bits. In this way, there are 2k possible actions / classes. Under the new format with k = 3, an optimal [M] could be represented as a one-size-fits-all rule: 111 # # # # # # # # # 1: 8: 10007: 0 6: 0 5: 0 4: 0 3: 0 2: 0 1: 0 0 0: 0Figures 10 and 11 show the performance of YCS with and without the new representation (or) with k = 3 and P = 2000. As can be seen, both representations are capable of optimum performance with the parameters used, but the new representation learns much faster (p \u2264 0.05).Figure 5: Performance of a new scheme on less symmetrical tasks."}, {"heading": "3.4 Imbalance", "text": "The frequency of visits to states is rarely nearly uniform across most reinforcement learning tasks. For example, in a spatial maze navigation task, these states at or near a destination are typically visited more frequently than those far from a destination. In data mining, real-world data typically do not include the same examples for all cases of the underlying concept - known as the class imbalance problem - and are often tackled by sub- or over-sampling. This bias in problem-space mapping can cause difficulties in generalizing precise generalizations, as their frequency of use (updating and reproduction) can dominate niches in more frequently visited states. Orriols-Puig and Bernado Mansilla [2008] introduced a heuristic specification specifically for (on) binary classification tasks that dynamically changes the learning rate (and frequency of GA activity)."}, {"heading": "4 CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK", "text": "This somewhat minor change appears to offer advantages over the traditional approach in a variety of scenarios, and future work should also take into account the new general rule structure proposed here, with more complex representations such as re-evaluated intervals (e.g., see [Stone & Bull, 2003]) or genetic programming (e.g., see [Preen & Bull, 2013]), along with delayed reward tasks. Kovacs and Tindale [2013] have recently highlighted problems with niche GA, particularly in terms of overlap issues, comparing the performance of an accuracy-based LCS with a global GA (see also [Bull, 2005]), a niche GA and a global GA using the calculated selective probabilities of rules under a niche GA, with the goal of avoiding the reduced actual selection of precise, general rules due to overlapping within a given niche."}], "references": [{"title": "Accuracy-Based Learning Classifier Systems: Models, Analysis and Applications to Classification Tasks", "author": ["E.
