Introduction", "text": "In recent years, decision theory and game theory have had a profound impact on the conception of intelligent systems. Decision theory provides a mathematical language for decision-making in terms of uncertainty, whereas game theory extends this language to the multi-agent case. On a fundamental level, both approaches provide a definition of what it means to be an intelligent agent by equating intelligence with maximizing usage. Graphical languages such as the language I used (Pearl, 1988) have attracted a lot of attention because they allow a compact and natural representation of uncertainty in many areas that lead to representation, and these formalities often result in significant savings in representation and inference time."}, {"heading": "2. NID Syntax", "text": "The building blocks of the NIDs are Bayesian networks (Pearl, 1988), and Multi-Agent Influence Diagrams (Koller & Milch, 2001).A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph in which each node represents a random variable.An edge between two nodes Bob Bob Alice means that X1 has a direct impact on the value of X2. Let Pa (Xi) represent the set of parent nodes for Xi in the network.Each node Xi contains a conditional probability distribution (CPD) over its domain for each value of its parents, pilloried P (Xi), which has an instruction on the value of X2. The topology of the network describes the conditional independence relationships that hold in the domain - each node Xi contains a conditional probability distribution (CPD) over its domain for each value of its parents, pilloried Pa (Xi), instructions and instructions on its ability to turn itself off if the topology of the network is held independently of the network, each of the relations of the Xi is held independently of its domain."}, {"heading": "2.1 Multi-agent Influence Diagrams", "text": "While Bayesian networks are used to indicate that agents are playing specific strategies, they do not capture the fact that agents are free to choose their own strategies, and they cannot be analyzed to calculate the optimal strategies for agents. Multi-agent influence diagrams (MAID) address these problems by extending Bayesian networks to strategic situations where agents must select the values of their decisions to maximize their own utilities, depending on the fact that other agents select the values of their decisions to maximize their own utilities. A MAID consists of a guided diagram with three types of nodes: Chance nodes, drawn as oval, represent decisions of nature, as in Bayesian networks. Decision nodes, drawn as rectangles, represent decisions of agents. Utility nodes, drawn as diamonds, represent the utility functions of agents. Each AID decision is associated with one MAID and one MAID decision."}, {"heading": "2.2 Networks of Influence Diagrams", "text": "Suppose there are experts who influence whether a team steals or not. There is social pressure on the managers to follow the advice of the experts, because if the managers \"decision turns out to be wrong, they can blame Bob. The experts suggest that Alice should declare a theft, and Bob should call a pitch. This advice is common knowledge among the managers. Bob may be unsure whether Alice will actually follow the experts and block them, or whether she will ignore and play a best response in terms of her beliefs about Bob. To quantify this, Bob believes that Alice will most likely follow 0.7 the experts, while Alice will most likely play 0.3 the best response beliefs about Bob symmetrical to Bob's beliefs about Alice: most likely 0.7 Alice believes Bob will follow the experts and most likely 0.3 Alice believes that Bob will play the best response strategy in terms of his beliefs about AIDs."}, {"heading": "3. NID Semantics", "text": "In this section we provide semantics for NIDs in the sense of MAIDs. We first show how an NID can be converted into a MAID. Then we define an NID equilibrium in the sense of a Nash equilibrium of the constructed MAID."}, {"heading": "3.1 Conversion to MAIDs", "text": "The following process converts each block K in the NID into a MAID fragment OK, and then connects them to form a MAID representation of \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 K. The key construct in this process is the use of a random node DK\u03b1 in the MAID to represent the beliefs of the agent \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2. The value of the D\u03b1 node N in block K depends on the block used by the alpha node, which is determined by alpha node D as it is determined by the value of the beliefs of the mod. For each block K in the NID we create a MAID OK decision. Any chance or utility N in block K, which is a descendant of a decision node in K, is replicated to OK, once for each agent. If N is not a descendant of a decision node in K, it is copied to OK and labeled."}, {"heading": "3.2 Equilibrium Conditions", "text": "In Section 2.1, we define pure and mixed strategies for decisions in MAIDs. In NIDs, we actually associate the decision strategies with the blocks in which they appear. A pure strategy for a decision D in a NID block K is a mapping from the informational parents of D to an action in the domain of D. Similarly, a mixed strategy for D is a mapping from the informational parents of D to a distribution across the domain of D. A strategy profile for an NID is a set of strategies for all decisions in the NID. Traditionally, a balance is defined for a game in terms of the best response strategies. A Nash balance is a strategy profile in which each agent can execute the best possible strategies for the strategies of the other agents. Classical game theory predicts that all agents will play a best answer. NIDs, on the other hand, allow us to describe situations in which an agent differs from his best response."}, {"heading": "4. Examples", "text": "In this section, we present a number of examples demonstrating the usefulness of NIDs for describing and displaying uncertainty about decision-making processes in a variety of areas."}, {"heading": "4.1 Irrational Agents", "text": "Since the challenge of perfect rationality is presented as the basis of Simon's (1955) economic systems, the theory of limited rationality has grown in different directions. From an economic point of view, limited rationality dictates a complete departure from the benefit-maximizing paradigm, in which concepts such as \"optimization\" and \"objective functions\" are actually replaced by \"satisfaction\" and \"heuristics.\" (Gigerenzer & Rare, 2001) These concepts have recently been formalized by Rubinstein. From a traditional AI perspective, an agent will represent limited rationality if his program is a solution to the limited optimization problem caused by architecture or computational resources. NIDs serve the complementarity of these two dominant perspectives by allowing agents to behave irrationally in relation to their models.Irrationality."}, {"heading": "4.2 Conflicting Beliefs", "text": "Traditional game theory assumes that agents \"beliefs about each other's knowledge will be slow, resulting from the conditioning of a common approach to each agent's level of information; a consequence of this assumption is that agents\" beliefs can differ only if they observe different information (Aumann & Brandenburger, 1995), resulting in a theoretical work that attempts to relax the common prior assumption. Myerson (1991) showed that a game with a contradictory belief structure that is finite can be transformed into a new game with consistent belief structures by constructing utility functions that correspond to the original game in a way that both assign the expected benefit to the agents. However, this new game will include beliefs and utility functions that are fundamentally different from the original game, which has contradictory belief structures. For a summary of the economic and philosophical assumptions of the previous conjectures (see Morris's 1995 and 1999 work)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Collusion and Alliances", "text": "In a situation where one agent models multiple agents, it might be important to know if these agents cooperate in any way. In such situations, the models of how the other agents make their decisions can be correlated due to possible collusion. Example 4.4. A voting game involves 3 agents Alice, Bob and Bob Bob, who choose one of them to be chairman of a committee. Alice is the incumbent and will be chairman if the vote ends in a tie. Each agent wants to be chairman himself, and in this case receives a benefit of 2. Alice also gets a benefit of 1 if she votes for the winner but loses the election because she wants to look good. Bob and Carol, meanwhile, dislike Alice and get benefit of -1 if Alice's strategies of agents Bob and Carol are equal, and both vote for the same person. If Bob and Carol vote the same, it is indeed in Alice's best interest to vote for the person they are voting for."}, {"heading": "4.4 Cyclic Belief Structures", "text": "Cyclic belief structures are important in game theory, where they are used to model agents that model themselves symmetrically. They are used to describe an infinite regression of \"I think that you think that I think...\" reasoning. Moreover, cyclic belief structures can be expressed in economic formalisms, such as Bob Bob Bob games, so it is crucial to allow them in NIDs so that NIDs include Bayean games. Cyclic belief structures can, of course, be captured in NIDs by including a cycle in the NID chart. Example 4.5. Let us recall Example 4.3, in which Alice and Bob had conflicting beliefs about the runner's speed. Let's assume that Bob believes that the runner is slow, and that Alice blocks with a 0.8 probability that the runner is fast, and models Bob as the rationale for Alice's beliefs, and so on... Let's model this scenario using the 9c scenario in the NID."}, {"heading": "5. Application: Opponent Modeling", "text": "In some cases, agents use rules, heuristics, patterns or tendencies in decision-making. One of the most important approaches to playing with imperfect information is the modeling of the opponent, in which agents try to learn the patterns shown by other players and react to their model of others. NIDs provide a solid, coherent basis for modeling the opponent. Example 5.1. In the game of RoShamBo (commonly referred to as Rock Paper Scissors), players simultaneously choose one of stone, paper or scissors. If they choose the same element, the result is a tie; otherwise, Rock crushes the scissors, paper covers rock, or scissors cuts paper, as in Table 10.The game has a single Nash balance, in which both players play a mixed strategy via {Rock, Paper, Scissors} with the likelihood of {13, 1, 3, 1, 3}. If both players do not deviate from their balance strategy, they are guaranteed a zero check, in fact it is becoming a strategy."}, {"heading": "5.1 A NID for Modeling Belief Hierarchies", "text": "In fact, most players who are able to block the next step in a sequence as a probability distribution of the possible movements of Bob Bob Bob are simply a MAID that represents the history of past movements for Alice and Bob. \"The only information available to the pioneer is the history of past movements for Alice and Bobo.\" Alice \"may ignore P, and play the strategy of Nash Equilibrium. Bob has several alternative models of Alice's decision that are shown in Figure 10c. Alice always follows the signal P. In Block B1, shown in Figure 10b, Bob is Alice."}, {"heading": "5.2 Empirical Evaluation", "text": "We evaluated the NID agent against the ten top candidates from the first automatic RoShamBo competition. All of these agents used an opponent's modeling approach, that is, they learned a signal of their opponent's game based on the history of previous rounds. Participants can be roughly classified into three dimensions: the type of signal used (probabilistic vs. deterministic); the type of reasoning used (pattern vs. meta-reasoners); and, their degree of exploration against the exploitation of their model. Technically, the CPDs for the nodes facing the story are also absent. However, they are observed at every decision point in the interaction, and their CPDs do not affect the usability of their opponents \"strategies."}, {"heading": "6. Relationship with Economic Models", "text": "In this section, we describe the relationship between NIDs and several existing formalities for displaying uncertainty about decision-making processes. NIDs share a close relationship with Bayesian games (Harsanyi, 1967), a game theory framework for displaying uncertainty about player payouts. Bayesian games capture the beliefs agents have about each other as well as define an equilibrium that are a best response strategy for each agent given his beliefs. Bayesian games are quite powerful in their ability to describe belief hierarchies and cyclical belief structures game structures. In a Bayesian game, each agent has a discrete type embodying its private information. Let N be a set of agents i a Bayesian game sets of possible types Ti, a conditional distribution pi and a utility function ui. Let T = \u00d7 i NTi and let C = \u00d7 i NCi."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "A model in our language is a network of interconnected models in which each mental model is itself a graphical model of a game. An agent in a mental model may believe that another agent (or possibly himself) uses a different mental model to make decisions; there may be uncertainty about which mental model is used. We presented semantics for our language in the form of multi-agent influence charts. We analyzed the relationship between our language and Bayesian games. They are just as expressive, but NIDs can be exponentially more compact. We showed how our language can be used to describe agents who play irrationally, in the sense that their actual play does not correspond to the best possible response given their views of the world and other agents. This is captured by a novel concept of equilibrium that interacts between what agents should do and what they actually do. We also showed how situations where agents have conflicting beliefs."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Many thanks for the useful comments from anonymous reviewers and editors.

Appendix A", "text": "First, let's ignore the edges added by step 5 of the construction and focus on the MAID fragment constructed from a single block K. Since the block is acyclic, we can number the nodes of the block by integers in topological order. We now number the nodes of the OK capability as follows. For a node N\u03b1 derived from a random or useful node N in K, N\u03b1 gets the same number as N. A node BR [D] K gets the same number as D. A node DK\u03b1 where alpha owns D gets the same number as D plus 1 / 3. A node DK\u03b1 where alpha do not own D gets the same number as D plus 2 / 3. By construction, if P is a nut of N in OK, P has a lower number than N.Now let's consider the entire constructed MAID O.Suppose, by the type of contradiction that it is complete."}], "references": [{"title": "The supply chain trading agent competition", "author": ["R.

NIDs are demonstrated by examples, showing how they can be used to describe conflicting and cyclic belief structures, and certain forms of bounded rationality. In an opponent modeling domain, NIDs were able to outperform other computational agents whose strategies were not known in advance. NIDs are equivalent in representation to Bayesian games but they are more compact and structured than this formalism. In particular, the equilibrium definition for NIDs makes an explicit distinction between agents\u2019 optimal strategies, and how they actually behave in reality.", "creator": null}}}
