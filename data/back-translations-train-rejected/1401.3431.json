The goal is to provide an update operator that is intuitive, in that its definition is based on a recursive decomposition of the update sentences structure, and that may be reasonably implemented. In addressing update, we first provide a definition phrased in terms of the models of a knowledge base. While this operator satisfies a core group of the benchmark Katsuno-Mendelzon update postulates, not all of the postulates are satisfied. Other Katsuno-Mendelzon postulates can be obtained by suitably restricting the syntactic form of the sentence for update, as we show. In restricting the syntactic form of the sentence for update, we also obtain a hierarchy of update operators with Winsletts standard semantics as the most basic interesting approach captured. We subsequently give an algorithm which captures this approach; in the general case the algorithm is exponential, but with some not-unreasonable assumptions we obtain an algorithm that is linear in the size of the knowledge base. Hence the resulting approach has much better complexity characteristics than other operators in some situations. We also explore other compositional belief change operators: erasure is developed as a dual operator to update; we show that a forget operator is definable in terms of update; and we give a definition of the compositional revision operator. We obtain that compositional revision, under the most natural definition, yields the Satoh revision operator.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 04:48:21 GMT  (300kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3431v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["james delgrande", "yi jin", "francis jeffry pelletier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3431"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3431.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Compositional Belief Update", "authors": ["James Delgrande", "Yi Jin", "Francis Jeffry Pelletier"], "emails": ["jim@cs.sfu.ca", "yij@cs.sfu.ca", "jeffpell@sfu.ca"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "A fundamental question is how such a change should be handled. There are various terms that effect a change in an evolving knowledge base, and these different rationality principles have been seen as a call for differences at the level of the background of postulates. For example, one may think that some changes have occurred in the world, with the result that we should update the representation of the world in an appropriate way. Or we may think that our earlier sources of information were fallible or incomplete, and that we now have better, more accurate information about the world."}, {"heading": "2. Background", "text": "As described, our goal is to introduce a compositional method for making changes in faith. However, since it is also part of our overall goal to examine the location of a compositional faith change operation in all the different areas in which it can take place, we first outline some details for each of these different concepts that motivate changes in faith, along with some motivational considerations and some areas in which the different types of faith partially change. These operators have been introduced implicitly, through a series of postulates that each legitimate such operator has had to obey. However, in all of these areas there has been some controversy about the correctness of the different postulates, and we mention some of them during our proceeding, since our own approach to updates does not obey all standard postulates for updates. We begin with the historically earlier case of revision before moving on to our central concern of updating."}, {"heading": "2.1 Formal Preliminaries", "text": "We consider a punctuation language to be L, above a finite set of atoms, i.e., punctuation letters, P = \u00b2, b, c, c,..) and truth-functional connectives, \"\" and. \"Where implicit,\" and \"are used, phrases are also used and are considered introduced by the definition.

(...) The representation of the two figures (...) is usually so simple that it applies to the case where one has a repository of information about \"an immutable, static world.\" (...) But a different picture was presented by Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992), in which there was a \"changing, dynamic world.\" In such an idea, the new information gathered by the agent reflects the notion that the world is different from what it was when the previously constructed knowledge base required by this type of new information is considered to be different when it is assumed that changes to the knowledge base will only gradually make its contents more accurate.

So, instead of being a function that represents a belief and sets a sentence on a belief, it is instead a function that represents a number of beliefs that sets a number of beliefs."}, {"heading": "3. The Approach", "text": "This section discusses our approach. Following the intuition and motivation of the formal approach, we introduce compositional updates and subsequent erasures. We also consider the concept of compositional faith revision, but come to the conclusion that, at least in relation to our specific approach, there is no separate, unambiguous concept of compositional revision."}, {"heading": "3.1 Intuitions", "text": "Our goal is to define the update operators in a compositional way, so that the actualization by formula \u00b5 defines the actualization of the syntactical components of \u00b5. The general idea behind the actualization is that each model of the economy is replaced by the \"nearest\" model (s) in \u00b5 (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1992). In our approach, the term \"proximity\" for each model of the economy (s) is partially determined by the syntactic structure of \u00b5. That is, \u00b5 is recursively decomposed; the resulting (base case) literals are used to determine the models of the actualization by sets of words; and the results are combined depending on the connective (s) in micro. Let's consider how this model can be performed. We get a knowledge base and a sentence \u00b5, and we want to determine a new knowledge base in which \u00b5 is believed. For a base case, \u00b5 = l is a literal basis we want to actualize and we want to know."}, {"heading": "3.2 A Compositional Update Operator", "text": "Based on previous intuitions, we define an update operator. We start with some preliminary definitions (first). In the following, UL is a function derived from an interpretation of a formula for updating. The value of UL is the set of interpretations closest to the formula. To simplify notation, we sometimes write a series of formulas resulting from the partial definition of a formula for updating. UL's value is the set of interpretations closest to the formula. To simplify notation, we sometimes write UL (finite, \u00b5) for UL (finite). Definition 6 For the interpretation of UL, we define UL (finite) as follows: 1. When we simplify notation, we sometimes write UL (finite formula) = {finite properties)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Erasure", "text": "In Definition 8, we define a dual update that is called deletion, directly in terms of UL. We may as well define a function analogous to UL (EL) to define a deletion operator directly from the first principles. We are now doing this in the direction of such a definition of deletion. In short, our motivation is: If we want to delete as a result of deletion, then we can semantically add interpretations to the models of deletion. If \u00b5 corresponds to a single letter, then for each model of deletion we would want to add an interpretation in which l was replaced by l. If \u00b5 corresponds to a conjunction, then \u00b5 can be deleted by deleting one of the two conjunctions; if \u00b5 corresponds to a disjunction, then both disjunctions must be deleted. Continuing in this way, we obtain the following definition: Definition 9 For the interpretation of L, we define EL and finite."}, {"heading": "3.4 Revision", "text": "In this section, we look at the extension of the compositional approach to revision of these models. To begin with, it could be pointed out that there is nothing about the underlying motivation that constitutes an update operator, and this point suggests that \"c\" could also be considered a revision operator, albeit with weak properties. However, regardless of intuitions, the recursive definition implicit in definition 6 is that an operator with update-like properties (in a certain sense) is the closest to an operator in which one can effectively deal with the models of the disc in dnf (\u00b5). For revision, on the other hand, the intuition is that one deals with models of \"\u00b5\" that are (in a certain sense) closest to those of the knowledge base. Therefore, the operator is not really appropriate as a revision operator. This suggests a possibly feasible approach to defining compositional models: to define a revision, first use the revision to find the operator and then find a candidate for certain models."}, {"heading": "4. Analysis of Compositional Update and Erasure", "text": "To begin with, let us consider which of the Katsuno-Mendelzon updates satisfies our operators. (We do not consider the number of corresponding compositional erasure approaches, since the results are comparable to those of the updated postulates and are therefore of limited additional interest. (After considering the updated postulates, let us continue to consider the updates and erasure operators, including the properties resulting from the limitation of the syntactic form of the formula for the update, and a comparison with related approaches. (Theorem 11) satisfies U1, U3, U7, U8.For a counter-example to U2, let us consider the first example given above, which illustrates the approaches of Winslett, where we have an explanation for the underlying approaches. (b) b)"}, {"heading": "5. Algorithms and Complexity", "text": "In this section, we will present a syntactical characterization and an algorithm for calculating compositional updates. We will also analyze the complexity of this algorithm under a variety of assumptions. In particular, we will analyze the complexity of the algorithm when applying it to all propositions in general, to all propositions in disjunctive normal form, and to all propositions whose size is limited by a certain constant. We will start with some background concepts. Let us remember that \"P / q\" is the formula in which all occurrences of the atom p are replaced by \"q.\" We will write \"P\" to denote the formula \"P.\" If \"P\" = {p1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 pn} is a set of atoms, then called \"P\" stands for \"P.\""}, {"heading": "5.1 Syntactic Characterization and Algorithms", "text": "We are now ready to make a syntactical characterization of the compositional actualization, the idea being very similar to that of (Doherty et al., 1998). However, our approach first converts the actualization formula into a disjunctive normal form and then deals with each disjunction. Lemma 2 Suppose t is a term (a combination of letters) and P = atom (t). The following results establish the agreement between the semantic definition and syntactic characterization of the compositional actualization. Lemma 2 Suppose is a term (a combination of letters) and P = atom (t). ThenMod (P.1) and P (w)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Complexity", "text": "That is, we are interested in how large the updated knowledge base could be. Unfortunately, if we apply it to any formula, the update algorithm may cause exponential spatial inflation, since the disjunctive normal form of a formula could be exponentially large. However, we are able to show that such exponential spatial inflation is inevitable for any algorithm of compositional updating. To achieve this goal, we need to introduce a so-called counseling engine (TM) and a non-uniform complexity class, see Johnson, 1990. A counseling TM is a counseling oracle that can be considered a function of a positive integer to the strings."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "The intention is to provide operators with transparent definitions based on the structure of the formula for the change of faith. As a result, we lose some of the standard postulates for updating, even though we satisfy a core group of the standard postulate. We achieve complete irrelevance of the syntax when the sentence for updating is replaced by the disjunction of its main implicits.The approach is interesting because, firstly, it is based on different intuitions than other operators, since it is based on a decomposition of the formula rather than on the models of the formula, and, secondly, it enables simple and (under reasonable assumptions) efficient implementation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "An early precursor of this paper was presented at FLAIRS 2007 (Delgrande, Pelletier, & Suderman, 2007) and we are grateful to this audience for their comments, and we have also benefited from the perceptive comments of three JAIR arbitrators.

Note that UL is associative and commutative with respect to the uppermost conjunctions and uppermost disjunctions, which means that a similar observation can be made for the uppermost conjunctions and disjunctions. Example: We use such basic facts without comment in the sequence. In particular, the above terms mean that we need to recognize UL's orderly independence with respect to its second reasoning only when we consider the general case of UL (uppermost definition), when we consider the general case of UL (uppermost definition), when we consider the general case of UL (uppermost definition), when we consider the case of UL (uppermost definition)."}], "references": [{"title": "On the logic of theory change: Partial meet functions for contraction and revision", "author": ["C.

The goal is to provide an update operator that is intuitive, in that its definition is based on a recursive decomposition of the update sentence\u2019s structure, and that may be reasonably implemented. In addressing update, we first provide a definition phrased in terms of the models of a knowledge base. While this operator satisfies a core group of the benchmark Katsuno-Mendelzon update postulates, not all of the postulates are satisfied. Other Katsuno-Mendelzon postulates can be obtained by suitably restricting the syntactic form of the sentence for update, as we show. In restricting the syntactic form of the sentence for update, we also obtain a hierarchy of update operators with Winslett\u2019s standard semantics as the most basic interesting approach captured. We subsequently give an algorithm which captures this approach; in the general case the algorithm is exponential, but with some not-unreasonable assumptions we obtain an algorithm that is linear in the size of the knowledge base. Hence the resulting approach has much better complexity characteristics than other operators in some situations. We also explore other compositional belief change operators: erasure is developed as a dual operator to update; we show that a forget operator is definable in terms of update; and we give a definition of the compositional revision operator. We obtain that compositional revision, under the most natural definition, yields the Satoh revision operator.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.96 Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software"}}}
