Introduction", "text": "In a probabilistic approach, inaccuracies are embedded in the stochastic nature of the model, that is, in the conditional probability density that represents the measurement process. It is critical that all kinds of inaccuracies that affect the measurements are embedded in the probabilistic sensor model. Inaccuracies result from sensor limitations, noise, and the fact that most complex environments can only be represented and perceived in a limited way. However, the dynamic nature of the environment in particular is an important source of inaccuracies. This dynamic nature results from the presence of unmodeled and possibly moving objects and people. This paper proposes a probabilistic range of sensor models for dynamic environments.

Discussion", "text": "This work proposed and experimentally validated the RBBM, a strictly Bayesian network model of a range finder adapted to dynamic environments. All modeling assumptions are strictly explained, and all model parameters have a physical interpretation. This approach resulted in a transparent and intuitive model. Rigorous modeling revealed all the underlying assumptions and parameters. In this way, a clear physical interpretation of all parameters is achieved, which provides intuition for the parameter selection. In contrast to the model by Thrun et al. (2005), the assumption underlying the non-physical discontinuity in the RBBM is discovered. Furthermore, the paper suggests a different functional form for the probability of measurements caused by unmodeled objects Poccl (z | x, m) (equivalent.

The probability of measuring a feature of the map, and therefore the integral under the scaled Gaussian (1\u2212p)Phit (z | x,m) (45), decreases with the expected range. This is easily explained since the probability that the map is not occluded decreases when the feature is located further away. Finally, the discontinuity of the RBBM (Fig. 8) was shown to be caused by the only approximation made (Section 3.5). Since the state of the art range sensors are very accurate, neglecting the measurement noise on the measurement of an occluding object is an acceptable approximation.
