They apply when one does not know the action model(the way actions affect the world) of a domain and must learn it from partial observations over time. Such scenarios are common in real world applications. They are challenging for AI tasks because traditional domain structures that underly tractability (e.g., conditional independence) fail there (e.g., world features become correlated). Our work departs from traditional assumptions about partial observations and action models. In particular, it focuses on problems in which actions are deterministic of simple logical structure and observation models have all features observed with some frequency. We yield tractable algorithms for the modified problem for such domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 04:52:56 GMT  (469kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3437v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["eyal amir", "allen chang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3437"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3437.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning Partially Observable Deterministic Action Models", "authors": ["Eyal Amir", "Allen Chang"], "emails": ["EYAL@ILLINOIS.EDU", "ALLENC256@YAHOO.COM"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Our algorithms output all or one of these models (depending on our choice) and are accurate in that no model is misclassified based on the observations. By contrast, our algorithms take polynomial time in the number of time steps and state characteristics of some of the traditional action classes studied in the AI planning literature, such as STRIPS actions. By contrast, traditional approaches to HMMs and Reinforcement Learning are inaccurate and exponentially intractable in such areas. Our experiments verify the theoretical traceability guarantees and show that we accurately identify action models. Multiple applications in planning, autonomous exploration and adventure games are already taking advantage of these results, promising for probable settings, partially observable reinforcement learning and diagnosis."}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "There are many examples of such situations available in all areas of life, such as the physical worlds (we do not observe the position of things in other spaces), the Internet (we do not observe more than a few websites at once), and interpersonal communication (we do not observe the state of mind of our partners). When agents explore a new domain (for example, you go into a building or meet a new person), they have limited knowledge of their action models and effects. These action models do not change with time, but they can depend on state characteristics. Such agents can act intelligently if they learn how their actions affect the world and use that knowledge to respond to their objections.c All rights are reserved."}, {"heading": "2. Simultaneous Learning and Filtering (SLAF)", "text": "Simultaneous Learning and Filtering (SLAF) is the problem of tracking a dynamic system from a sequence of time steps and partial observations when we do not have the complete dynamics of the system. A solution for SLAF is a representation of all combinations of action models that may have led to the observations in the input, and a representation of all the corresponding states in which the system can now be (according to the sequence of time steps given in the input). Computing (the solution for) SLAF can be carried out recursively through the dynamic programming in which we determine SLAF for the time step t + 1 from our solution of SLAF for the time t. In this section we formally define SLAF in such a recursive mode. Ignoring stochastic information or assumptions, SLAF involves determining the possible ways in which actions can change the world."}, {"heading": "In its possession are three different keys, and suppose the agent cannot tell from observation only which key opens the door.

In the case of an action success, the filtration can be performed by first removing worlds that do not fulfill the precondition of the action (so that the action is executable in all remaining worlds), and then filtering the remaining worlds by means of the algorithm AS-STRIPS-SLAF.

Also, note that if every fluid sequence is observed in most k steps, each fluid-factored subformula i, j the belief formula is contained in k-CNF, according to an Amir theorem (2005).
