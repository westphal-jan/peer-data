In such cases, the evaluation scale for decisions should be considered bipolar, that is, negative and positive values should be explicitly distinguished. That is what is done, for example, in Cumulative Prospect Theory. However, contraryto the latter framework that presupposes genuine numerical assessments, human agents often decide on the basis of an ordinal ranking of the pros and the cons, and by focusing on the most salient arguments. In other terms, the decision process is qualitative as well as bipolar. In this article, based on a bipolar extension of possibility theory, we define and axiomatically characterize several decision rules tailored for the joint handling of positive and negative arguments in an ordinal setting. The simplest rules can be viewed as extensions of the maximin and maximax criteria to the bipolar case, and consequently suffer from poor decisive power. More decisive rules that refine the former are also proposed. These refinements agree both with principles of efficiency and with the spirit of order-of-magnitude reasoning, that prevails in qualitative decision theory. The most refined decision rule uses leximin rankings of the pros and the cons, and the ideas of counting arguments of equal strength and cancelling pros by cons. It is shown to come down to a special case of Cumulative Prospect Theory, and to subsume the Take the Best heuristic studied by cognitive psychologists.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 04:55:20 GMT  (391kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3444v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["didier dubois", "h\\'el\\`ene fargier", "jean-fran\\c{c}ois bonnefon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3444"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3444.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the Qualitative Comparison of Decisions Having Positive and Negative Features", "authors": ["Didier Dubois", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fargier", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bonnefon"], "emails": ["dubois@irit.fr", "fargier@irit.fr", "bonnefon@univ-tlse2.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Applying the principles of qualitative bipolar reasoning described by the previous axioms can also lead to many different but more or less intuitive qualifying rules, such as the Pareto rule (see Dubois and Fargier (2006) for a complete characterization of this rule. But if we are looking for a simple complete rule of decision, these axioms offer a complete characterization of the biposs preference relationship.

In particular, BiPoss suffers from a drowning effect, as is common in the standard theory of possibility.

This problem is rooted in the fact that CLO implies indifference, even in some cases where we would like to invoke the so-called \"efficiency principle\" to make the decision. Just like the monotony principle, this axiom on positive sets is well known.

Decisions are then ranked according to the merit of their worst evaluation, following a pessimistic attitude. But this kind of approach is not bipolar, as it only handles negative arguments: the absolute landmark expresses unacceptability, not neutrality. Neutrality is only present by omission, when no constraint is violated, and no decision exists that could be better than neutral.

In such cases, the evaluation scale for decisions should be considered bipolar, that is, negative and positive values should be explicitly distinguished. That is what is done, for example, in Cumulative Prospect Theory. However, contrary to the latter framework that presupposes genuine numerical assessments, human agents often decide on the basis of an ordinal ranking of the pros and the cons, and by focusing on the most salient arguments. In other terms, the decision process is qualitative as well as bipolar. In this article, based on a bipolar extension of possibility theory, we define and axiomatically characterize several decision rules tailored for the joint handling of positive and negative arguments in an ordinal setting. The simplest rules can be viewed as extensions of the maximin and maximax criteria to the bipolar case, and consequently suffer from poor decisive power. More decisive rules that refine the former are also proposed. These refinements agree both with principles of efficiency and with the spirit of order-of-magnitude reasoning, that prevails in qualitative decision theory. The most refined decision rule uses leximin rankings of the pros and the cons, and the ideas of counting arguments of equal strength and cancelling pros by cons. It is shown to come down to a special case of Cumulative Prospect Theory, and to subsume the \u201cTake the Best\u201d heuristic studied by cognitive psychologists.", "creator": null}}}
