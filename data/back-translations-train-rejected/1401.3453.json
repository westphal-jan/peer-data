Concluding Remarks", "text": "We have shown that dominance and consistency testing in CP networks are both PSPACE-complete. Also, several related problems related to dominance and optimality in CP networks are PSPACE-complete, too.The repeated use of reductions from planning problems confirms the importance of structural similarity between STRIPS planning and reasoning with CP networks. This suggests that the well-developed field of planning algorithms for STRIPS representations, especially for unbound operators (Brafman & Domshlak, 2003), is useful for implementing algorithms for dominance and consistency in CP networks. Our theories extend to CP networks with non-binary domains, and to extensions and variations of CP networks, such as TCP networks."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang's new address is: LAMSADE, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Dauphine, 75775 Paris Cedex 16, France.
