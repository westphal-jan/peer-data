Typically, these robots have bounded resources, such as limited battery or limited amounts of time to obtain measurements. Thus, careful coordination of their paths is required in order to maximize the amount of information collected, while respecting the resource constraints. In this paper, we present an efficient approach for near-optimally solving the NP-hard optimization problem of planning such informative paths. In particular, we first develop eSIP (efficient Single-robot Informative Path planning), an approximation algorithm for optimizing the path of a single robot. Hereby, we use a Gaussian Process to model the underlying phenomenon, and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to quantify the amount of information collected. We prove that the mutual information collected using paths obtained by using eSIP is close to the information obtained by an optimal solution. We then provide a general technique, sequential allocation, which can be used to extend any single robot planning algorithm, such as eSIP, for the multi-robot problem. This procedure approximately generalizes any guarantees for the single-robot problem to the multi-robot case. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several experiments performed in-field for two important environmental sensing applications, lake and river monitoring, and simulation experiments performed using several real world sensor network data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:21:51 GMT  (2377kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3462v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["amarjeet singh", "reas krause", "carlos guestrin", "william j kaiser"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3462"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3462.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Efficient Informative Sensing using Multiple Robots", "authors": ["Amarjeet Singh", "Andreas Krause", "Carlos Guestrin", "William J.

In order to model spatial phenomena, a common approach in spatial statistics is to use a rich class of probability models called Gaussian processes (GPs, c.f., Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). Such models associate a random variable Xv with any location v \u0418V. The common distribution P (XV) can then be used to quantify the uncertainty in the criterion of prediction P (XV\\ A | XA = xA) of phenomena at unobserved locations XV\\ A after observations XA = xA have been made at a small subset A of sites. To quantify this uncertainty, we use, for example, the criterion of mutual information (MI) (such as Caselton and Zidek, 1984)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Submodularity:", "text": "Even if we do not take into account the constraints regarding the length of the paths of the robots, the problem of selecting locations that maximize the mutual information is NP-hard (Krause et al., 2008). Therefore, in general, we can probably not expect to efficiently find the optimal locations. Instead, our goal will be to efficiently find nearly optimal solutions where the sampling quality (e.g. mutual information) comes demonstrably closest to the optimal sampling quality. The key observation that will enable us to obtain such strong approximation guarantees is that mutual information B B will satisfy the following decreasing yield characteristics B (Krause et al., 2008): The more locations we have already touched B, the less information we will gain by scanning a new location. This intuition is formalized by the concept of submodularity B B: A function f is submodular (Nemhauser et al., 1978) B = B B B = B B B = B B B = B B, if: \"B and B B B = B = B = B B = B = B = B = B B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B = B ="}, {"heading": "2.3 Online vs Offline Path Planning:", "text": "Many applications of robotic route planning, such as search and rescue operations, involve uncertain environments with complex dynamics that can only be partially observed. Informative route planning - selecting the best places that can be observed under certain perceptual constraints in such uncertain environments requires a trade-off between exploration (collecting information about the environment) and exploitation (making the most effective use of current beliefs about the state of the environment). We distinguish between two different classes of algorithms: non-adaptive (offline) algorithms that plan and define paths before making observations, and adaptive (online) algorithms that update and reschedule when new information is collected. Both the online and offline settings are NP-hard optimization problems. In this paper, we discuss only the approach algorithms for offline setting that incorporate the known belief about the environment for efficient route planning, and we will expand our approach to exploration and modeling."}, {"heading": "3.

Thus, the problem of finding a path can be divided into two smaller sub-problems to find smaller sub-paths (s \u2212 vm and vm \u2212 t) and then link these small sub-paths with each other. While they have the same number of locations, the sub-paths on both sides can have different costs, i.e. the budget for the entire path must be divided into two smaller sub-paths: recursive-greedy (RG) 1 Input: s, B, R, iter Output: A path for the whole path must be split, i.e."}, {"heading": "5.1 Structure of the Search Problem", "text": "It is instructive to look at the recursive structure generated by the recursive-greedy algorithm. Fig. 4 illustrates an example of such a structure when recursive-greedy for our sea sensor application with the given start (s) and end (t) location and an upper limit on the path cost (B). Searching with recursive-greedy can be graphically represented as a sum-greedy tree. At the root is a maximum node representing the goal of finding an s \u2212 t path with the highest possible reward, while the cost of the path is limited by the budget B. For each such maximum node, the children in the search tree represent sum nodes corresponding to the sum of the rewards collected on both sides of the middle location. Therefore, at the end of the first iteration, the graphical representation will represent a maximum node as root with multiple sum nodes as children, for each feasible middle location and any budget."}, {"heading": "5.2 Running Time", "text": "By looking at the recursive structure, the runtime of the recursive-greedy algorithm can be regarded as quasi-polynomial. Specifically, the runtime of the algorithm is isO (((MB) O (log2 M)), with B being the budget constraint and M = | V | the total number of possible observation sites. Thus, even with a small problem with M = 64 locations, the exponent will be 6, which results in a very large computing time, making the algorithm impractical for observing multiple physical processes in the real world. The large computational effort required by recursive-greedy can be attributed to two problems: 1) the large branching factor at each of the Themax nodes of the recursion tree (sum nodes for each possible medium node and any budget allocation over that medium node) and 2) unnecessary recursion during the sub-trees in the problem space, which cannot provide us with an improved reward compared to the current solution."}, {"heading": "6.

As can be seen from the diagrams, our approach offers a significant improvement in runtime (by several orders of magnitude at higher budget values) at (almost) the same reward collected.

The acquisition I 2M of all subsets P-Mi-I can be defined so that P-Mi- \u2264 1 (i.e., each sequence corresponds to a feasible sequence for each robot i P)."}, {"heading": "9.2 Robotic Applications", "text": "There is considerable work in the robotics community to plan routes for multiple applications, including Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Search and Exploration. For each of these applications, various approaches have been explored, including auction-based algorithms, data adaptive approaches, and information gathering algorithms."}, {"heading": "9.2.1 SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING:", "text": "The aim of Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) is to create maps of an environment by conducting an exploration of the environment with the aim of estimating the position of the robot and the characteristics of the world at the same time. Several approaches to optimize different objective functions have been proposed to perform route planning for SLAM. Bourgault et al. (2002) proposed an exploration framework using an occupancy grid (OG) to maximize the spatial decomposition of the observed environment, with the aim of maximizing mutual information about the OG map. Stachniss et al. (2005) developed a greedy algorithm for the selection of the next location to be visited in order to maximize the gains of information about the map.In contrast to such approaches, Sim and Roy (2005) attempted to optimize the entire trajectory, not only the next step, but their algorithm introduces some approaches without theoretical limitations to SLAM that are not quantifiable to SLAM (2000), which result in multiple explorations."}, {"heading": "9.2.2 SEARCH AND EXPLORATION:", "text": "The search and reconnaissance application includes the path planning for a robot with the goal of finding a moving target (s) in a given environment, e.g. target monitoring in security applications and patient tracking in healthcare. Performing path planning using stochastic inference offers advantages of the robustness of capture and motion uncertainty, but with an additional complexity of computerized intractability. Roy and Earnest (2006) proposed an approach for effectively calculating the paths for target tracking based on maximizing mutual information (evaluated using the Changein variance of probability distribution), using a particle filtering approach, clustering over the particles, followed by path planning over these clusters. Lau et al. (2006) formulated indoor target tracking as generalizing anNP-complete optimal search path (OSP) problem (Trummel & Weisinger, 1986) while trying to optimize the probability of a target within a given time frame."}, {"heading": "9.2.3 PLANNING SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS:", "text": "Certain applications in robotic route planning used plan diagrams (Blum & Furst, 1997) to calculate an estimate of the resources and time of states encountered during the search process to achieve the objectives. In the case of the problem of oversubscription planning - where only a subset of objectives can be achieved within the limited time or resources available to the planning system - Smith (2004) used orientation euristics to provide a set of objectives to be considered by the planner. Briel et al. (2004) proposed several heuristics to efficiently solve the problem of oversubscription planning. However, in each of the previously proposed heuristics the considered reward function is modular (additive). eMIP can be used to efficiently solve the problem of oversubscription planning in a submodular environment with strong approximation guarantees."}, {"heading": "9.3 Sensor Networks", "text": "The modeling of phenomena to determine the optimal placement of a range of static sensors has been well researched in sensor networks and geostatistical communities, and Gaussian process models for spatial phenomena have been extensively studied (Cressie, 1991). Guestrin et al. (2005) demonstrated that the selection of sensor placement based on mutual information is nearly optimal in the case of phenomena regulated by Gaussian process models. Krause et al. (2006) expanded this work to include the communication costs between sensors while optimizing sensor placement. In a communication-constrained environment, similar to the problem of path planning considered in this paper, the greedy algorithm works poorly and more involved algorithms need to be developed. Batalin et al. (2004) showed that the combination of static and mobile sensors can significantly improve sensor performance even in a simple scenario."}, {"heading": "9.3.1 DATA COLLECTION FROM A SENSOR NETWORK:", "text": "Another scenario in which a mobile robot can be combined with a network of static sensors is to improve the life span of the sensor network by carrying out the tours to collect the data collected by the static network. Somasundara et al. (2007) showed that the problem of collecting data when the environment has both spatial and temporal dynamics is NP-complete and provides an integral linear programming formulation for the same thing. They compared the performance of multiple heuristics in the simulation for both single and multi-robot scenarios. Meliou et al. (2007) proposed a non-short-sighted approach to the application of data acquisition tours, using an algorithm for submodular orientation runs (SOP) as a black box. They offered strong approximation guarantees and comprehensive empirical assessments showing the applicability of their approach to such applications. In this setting, eMIP can be used as an orientation algorithm to provide a better running time guarantee in addition to improved orientation algorithms."}, {"heading": "9.3.2 ADAPTIVE SAMPLING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATIONS:", "text": "Recent advances in robotics have opened up possibilities for highly accurate monitoring of dynamic environmental sensors. Rahimi et al. (2004) examined several strategies for adaptive environmental sampling. Singh et al. (2006) proposed a multi-scale adaptive sampling approach, in which the environment is sampled uniformly in the first phase, followed by sampling in places to minimize the mean square error most. They also expanded their approach for multiple robots without setting theoretical limits. Using several field trials and simulations with real sampling data, we show here that several such environmental phenomena can be sampled effectively with the help of eMIP."}, {"heading": "10. Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this thesis, we introduced eSIP, an approximation algorithm for the efficient planning of informative paths. Our eSIP algorithm builds on the recursive-greedy algorithm of Chekuri and Pal (2005). eSIP preserves the approximation guarantees recursively-greedily, while overcoming its computational intractability through spatial decomposition and several bifurcated and bound approaches. We also presented a general approach, the sequential mapping, which extends each individual robot algorithm, such as eSIP, to the hiring of multiple robots, while providing a demonstrably strong approximation warranty.We also provide extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for real-world applications. We conducted several field experiments to perform two important environmental sensor conservation applications - maritime surveillance (on a small lake on the UIMC campus).We also research the reactive application of our system in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this world."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Maxim Batalin for the helpful discussion, Bin Zhang for providing the seed sets, and Michael Stealey, Henry Pai, and Victor Chen for helping during the river and lake deployment.

Typically, these robots have bounded resources, such as limited battery or limited amounts of time to obtain measurements. Thus, careful coordination of their paths is required in order to maximize the amount of information collected, while respecting the resource constraints. In this paper, we present an efficient approach for near-optimally solving the NP-hard optimization problem of planning such informative paths. In particular, we first develop eSIP (efficient Single-robot Informative Path planning), an approximation algorithm for optimizing the path of a single robot. Hereby, we use a Gaussian Process to model the underlying phenomenon, and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to quantify the amount of information collected. We prove that the mutual information collected using paths obtained by using eSIP is close to the information obtained by an optimal solution. We then provide a general technique, sequential allocation, which can be used to extend any single robot planning algorithm, such as eSIP, for the multi-robot problem. This procedure approximately generalizes any guarantees for the single-robot problem to the multi-robot case. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several experiments performed in-field for two important environmental sensing applications, lake and river monitoring, and simulation experiments performed using several real world sensor network data sets.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
