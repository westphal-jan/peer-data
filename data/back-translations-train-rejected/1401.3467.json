Introduction", "text": "There is an ongoing effort in the planning community to determine the complexity of the various classes of planning problems, a problem that simplifies the process. Known tractable classes are usually characterized by a simple causal graph structure accompanied by additional constraints on variables and operators. However, the boundary between tractable and intractable planning problems is not yet clearly defined; the present paper contributes a novel complexity problem for a class of planning problems with simple causal graphics from the literature, in an effort to reduce these complexity problems, but is not of purely theoretical interest. For example, complex planning problems can be projected onto tractable fragments of planning problems to be used during the search (Katz & Domshlak, 2008b). Also, the causal variable heuristic (Helmert, 2006) uses the hierarchical structure of a planning problem by transforming it into a multiform."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "The complexity of planning problems has been extensively studied over the past twenty years (Bylander, 1994; Chapman, 1987; Erol, Nau, & Subrahmanian, 1995), and many detectable classes of planning problems exploit the notion of a causal graph in one way or another. Knoblock (1994) is usually credited with introducing the causal graph into his work on hierarchical planning. Williams and Nayak (1997) required planning problems to have an acyclic causal graph in an effort to ensure traceability. Jonsson and Ba \ufffd ckstro \ufffd m (1998) defined class 3S of planning problems, also with acyclic causal graphs, and showed that the plan existence is verifiable for that class. Domshlak and Dinitz (2001) introduced class Cn of the planning problems examined in this paper, as well as several related classes that all show a specific graphical structure."}, {"heading": "3.

What can be said about the incidents, namely Ck n for k \u00b2 3, 4}? Below, we outline some arguments for and against the tractability of these cases. Although the discussion is largely based on intuition gained by studying these classes, it could prove helpful for someone trying to determine their complexity. On the one hand, it seems likely that the plan existence for C4n is also hard. Our reduction for C5n uses only one type of state variable whose domain is greater than 4, namely v2ij."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partly funded by APIDIS and MEC."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2009, "abstractText": "Recently, considerable focus has been given to the problem of determining the boundary between tractable and intractable planning problems.
