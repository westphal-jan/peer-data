The problem has been approached as a path-finding problem in belief space where good belief representations and heuristics are critical for scaling up. In this work, a different formulation is introduced for conformant problems with deterministic actions where they are automatically converted into classical ones and solved by an off-the-shelf classical planner. The translation maps literals L and sets of assumptions t about the initial situation, into new literals KL/t that represent that L must be true if t is initially true. We lay out a general translation scheme that is sound and establish the conditions under which the translation is also complete. We show that the complexity of the complete translation is exponential in a parameter of the problem called the conformant width, which for most benchmarks is bounded. The planner based on this translation exhibits good performance in comparison with existing planners, and is the basis for T0, the best performing planner in the Conformant Track of the 2006 International Planning Competition.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:27:00 GMT  (365kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3468v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hector palacios", "hector geffner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3468"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3468.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Compiling Uncertainty Away in Conformant Planning Problems with Bounded Width", "authors": ["Hector Palacios", "Hector Geffner"], "emails": ["hlp@ldc.usb.ve", "hector.geffner@upf.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Each action a has a precondition pre (a) given by a set of flowing literals, and a set of conditional effects C \u2192 L, where C is a set of flowing literals and L is a flowing dictionary letter. All actions are assumed to be deterministic and therefore all uncertainty lies in the initial situation. Therefore, the language for the conforming problem P without the uncertainty in the initial situation is extended with conditional effects and negations with conditional effects. Furthermore, if there is no uncertainty in the initial situation, as if all flows in unitary clauses \u2192 occur in the initial situation, we interpret them as L in classical associations, we sometimes refer to them as a.

An action sequence \u03c0 = {a0, a1,... a} is a classic plan for P / s if the action sequence is executable in state s and leads to a target state sG; i.e., if for i = 0, n, the preconditions of the action sequence ai in si, si + 1 are true, the state resulting from the action sequence is."}, {"heading": "3.

Complete Translations that May be Compact Too", "text": "In order to have complete translations that are polynomial, certain assumptions must be made about the formulas in the initial situation. Otherwise, a mere verification of whether a target in I is true would be insoluble in itself, and therefore a polynomial but complete translation would be impossible (unless P = NP). We therefore assume that I am implicit (PI) in the form of the prime number (Marquis, 2000), which means that I include only the minimal clauses contained therein, but no tautologies. It is known that the verification of whether a clause logically follows from a formula I in PI form is reduced to verifying whether the clause is a clause in I or a tautology, and is therefore a polynomial operation. Initial situations I in most benchmarks are in PI form or can easily be cast into PI form, since they are usually defined by a series of non-overlapping clauses (X1, Xtology-X1) that are expressed in any X1."}, {"heading": "6.1 Conformant Relevance", "text": "The translation KS0 (P) is complete, but introduces a series of words KL / t that are exponential at worst: one for each possible initial state s0. This raises the question: Is it possible to have complete translations that are not exhaustive in this sense? The answer is yes, and in this section we set a simple condition that ensures that a translation KT, M (P) is complete. It uses the term of relevance: 3 definition 10 (relevance). The conform relevance of the relevance of the relevance of the relevance L \u2212 \u2192 L \u2032 in P, read L is relevant for L \u2032, is defined inductively as1, L \u2212 \u2192 L \u00b2 in relation to the first Relevant Relevant Relevance, L \u00b2 in relation to the first Relevant Relevant Relevance of the Relevant Relevant Relevant Relevant Relevant."}, {"heading": "6.2 Covering Translations", "text": "It may seem as if a translation of KT, M would be complete if the combination m for precondition and target literal L, understood as DNF formulas, contained so much information, and thus corresponds to the formula CI (L) that captures the fragment of the starting situation I that is relevant to L. (L) This intuition is partially correct, but misses an important point, namely that not every DNF formula that corresponds to the formula CI (L) will do a merge m: the DNF representation that must be captured by the mergers must be \"alive\" enough. For example, if CI (L) is the only clause x (L), completeness requires a day for x, a day for x (L), and a letter letter letter representation for L, even if clause x (L) is a tautology and thus equivalent to the DNF formula. For the definition of the types, the letters and the letters are then required for the tautology."}, {"heading": "6.4 Conformant Width", "text": "We are now addressing the conditions under which a compact problem covering the translation can be constructed in polynomial time. (To this end, we define a structural parameter that we call the conformity width of a problem P, which, by analogy to the concept of width used in graphic models (Dechter, 2003), is actually empty. (To this end, we define an upper limit for the temporal and spatial complexity we need to generate a translation.) More precisely, the complexity of this construction will be exponential in the conform width of the problem P, which cannot exceed the number of flowing elements in P, but much more commendable.In principle, we want to define the width w (P) as the maximum tag size required in a translation KT, M) in order to be a covering translation.

The translation Ki (P) is derived from the general scheme KT, M (P), where M is set to contain a merge m = c (C) for each prerequisite and target letter L in P, if there is a sentence C of at most i clauses in C, so that m is the translation L.

Tags and Initial States", "text": "A deeper understanding of the above results can be achieved by looking at possible starting states. By looking at this relationship more closely, one will first be able to answer the question of how a polynomial number of contexts (tags) plays the role of an exponential number of possible starting states in problems of limited breadth. Therefore, we should first remember the notation presented in Section 2.2, where for a state s, \"I wrote (s), to refer to the set of atoms that encode s\" (i.e, p) initial properties in s \"and P / s refer to the classical planning problem P / s = s.

One instance is polynomial, but not necessarily complete; the other is complete, but not necessarily polynomial. For the incomplete translation, T0 uses the translation K1, which is complete for problems with width no greater than 1, and as argued above, can result in solvable instances for problems of greater widths. For the complete translation, the K1 translation is used instead with a simple optimization: If the K1 translation produces a single merge m covering L, then this merge m is used for L instead of the potentially more complex instances. This is a mere optimization as the resulting translation remains complete. The other combinations in the models resulting from the series of clauses CI (L), which are implemented in accordance with the SAT."}, {"heading": "9.

Summary", "text": "While few practical problems are purely compliant, the ability to find compliant plans is required in random environments where compliant situations are a special case. In this paper, we have introduced a new approach to compliant planning, in which compliant problems P are converted into classic planning problems KT, M (P), which are then solved by a classical planner. We have also examined the conditions under which this general translation is solid and complete. Translation depends on two parameters: a set of tags that refer to local contexts in the initial situation, and a set of merges that stand for valid disjunctions of tags. We have seen how different translations, such as KS0 and Kmodels, can be derived from appropriate choices of tags and merges, and have introduced a level of complexity in compliant planning called compliant width, and a set of merges that stand for valid disjunctions of tags."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Alex Albore for helping with the syntax of MBP and KACMBP and Pierre Marquis for kindly answering a question about the complexity of a deductive task.

Consistency", "text": "In this section we explain why it is necessary and prove that KT, M (P) is a consistent problem when P is similarly consistent when P (see definition 4). We begin by assuming that the states are not truth assignments, but sentences of letters across the vocabulary of the language. A state is complete when for each letter L, L, or L is explicit, and consistent when for any letter both L and \u00ac L are in s. Complete and consistent states represent truth assignments about states F and the consistency of P, and the translation KT, M (P) ensures that all applicable actions are complete states and consistent states in s."}], "references": [{"title": "A translation-based approach to contingent planning", "author": ["A.

The problem has been approached as a path-finding problem in belief space where good belief representations and heuristics are critical for scaling up. In this work, a different formulation is introduced for conformant problems with deterministic actions where they are automatically converted into classical ones and solved by an off-the-shelf classical planner. The translation maps literals L and sets of assumptions t about the initial situation, into new literals KL/t that represent that L must be true if t is initially true. We lay out a general translation scheme that is sound and establish the conditions under which the translation is also complete. We show that the complexity of the complete translation is exponential in a parameter of the problem called the conformant width, which for most benchmarks is bounded. The planner based on this translation exhibits good performance in comparison with existing planners, and is the basis for T0, the best performing planner in the Conformant Track of the 2006 International Planning Competition.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
