Here we focus on permutations of the variables consisting of one single cycle. We propose a procedure that takes advantage of these symmetries by interacting with a continuous constraint solver without interfering with it. A key concept in this procedure are the classes of symmetric boxes formed by bisecting a n-dimensional cube at the same point in all dimensions at the same time. We analyze these classes and quantify them as a function of the cube dimensionality. Moreover, we propose a simple algorithm to generate the representatives of all these classes for any number of variables at very high rates. A problem example from the chemical and#64257;eld and the cyclic n-roots problem are used to show the performance of the approach in practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:27:27 GMT  (388kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3469v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vicente ruiz de angulo", "carme torras"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3469"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3469.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Exploiting Single-Cycle Symmetries in Continuous Constraint Problems", "authors": ["Vicente Ruiz de Angulo", "Carme Torras"], "emails": ["ruiz@iri.upc.edu", "torras@iri.upc.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "Since CSPs are usually solved using AI search algorithms, approaches that deal with symmetries fall into two groups: those that involve reformulating the problem or adding constraints before searching (Flener, Frisch, Hnich, Kiziltan, & Miguel, 2002; Puget, 2005), and those that break symmetries along the search (Meseguer & Torras, 2001; Gent, 2002). Variable permutations and the interchangeability of values are usually addressed by symmetries, for which a repertoire of techniques has been developed, most of which rely on compatible group theories. On the contrary, symmetries are largely ignored, despite the important growth in both theory and application."}, {"heading": "2.

Conclusions", "text": "We are approaching the problem of exploitation of symmetries in continuous constraints Satisfaction problems with continuous constraints solvers. Our approach is general and can use any box-oriented CCS as a black box method. The individual symmetries we have tackled are single-cylinder permutations of problem variables. The proposed strategy is to divide the domain, the n-cube initial box, simultaneously in all dimensions at the same point. This forms a series of boxes that can be grouped into box symmetry classes. A representative of each class is selected to be processed by the CCS, and all symmetries of the representatives are applied to the resulting solutions. In this way, the solutions are found within the entire initial domain while they have processed only a fraction of it - the amount of representatives of the respective class - with the CCS. The time savings achieved by processing a representative unit are achieved."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This is an extended version of the work presented at CP 2007 (Ruiz de Angulo & Torras, 2007), where the authors acknowledge the support of the Generalitat de Catalunya within the Consolidated Robotics Group, the Spanish Ministry of Science and Education within the DPI200760858 project and the \"Comunitat de Treball dels Pirineus\" within the 2006ITT-10004 project."}], "references": [{"title": "Universally quantified interval constraints", "author": ["F.

A key concept in this procedure are the classes of symmetric boxes formed by bisecting a n-dimensional cube at the same point in all dimensions at the same time. We analyze these classes and quantify them as a function of the cube dimensionality. Moreover, we propose a simple algorithm to generate the representatives of all these classes for any number of variables at very high rates. A problem example from the chemical field and the cyclic n-roots problem are used to show the performance of the approach in practice.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
