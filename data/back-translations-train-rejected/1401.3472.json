We use variable forgetting as a basic operation for one agent to reason about its own or other agents\\ knowledge. In our framework, two notions namely agents\\ observable variables and the weakest sufficient condition play important roles in knowledge reasoning. Given a background knowledge base and a set of observable variables for each agent, we show that the notion of an agent knowing a formula can be defined as a weakest sufficient condition of the formula under background knowledge base. Moreover, we show how to capture the notion of common knowledge by using a generalized notion of weakest sufficient condition. Also, we show that public announcement operator can be conveniently dealt with via our notion of knowledge structure. Further, we explore the computational complexity of the problem whether an epistemic formula is realized in a knowledge structure. In the general case, this problem is PSPACE-hard; however, for some interesting subcases, it can be reduced to co-NP. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our framework in some interesting domains such as the automated analysis of the well-known muddy children puzzle and the verification of the revised Needham-Schroeder protocol. We believe that there are many scenarios where the natural presentation of the available information about knowledge is under the form of a knowledge structure. What makes it valuable compared with the corresponding multi-agent S5 Kripke structure is that it can be much more succinct.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:29:17 GMT  (319kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3472v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["kaile su", "abdul sattar", "guanfeng lv", "yan zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3472"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3472.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Variable Forgetting in Reasoning about Knowledge", "authors": ["Kaile Su", "Abdul Sattar", "Guanfeng Lv", "Yan Zhang"], "emails": ["sukl@pku.edu.cn", "a.sattar@griffith.edu.au", "lvgf@yahoo.com", "yan@cit.uws.edu.au"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

They typically consist of a sequence of message exchange programs whose format is pre-defined and needs to be adapted to. Normally, a principal can participate in a protocol that is executed in different ways, as an initiator or responder; we often call the principal different roles. Very often, a principal can participate in multiple protocols simultaneously with different routines.Authentication protocol developers need to be aware that the message can be intercepted and someone with malicious intent can impersonate an honest principal. One of the key problems with authentication is ensuring confidentiality, that is to prevent private information from being passed on to unauthorized entities. Another problem is encryption, which protects the intruder from the identity of other principals."}, {"heading": "8.2 The Dolev-Yao Intruder Model", "text": "The standard model of the adversary for the analysis of security protocols was introduced by Dolev and Yao in 1983 and is commonly known as the Dolev-Yao model (Dolev & Yao, 1983), according to which a number of conservative assumptions are made as follows: 1. Messages are considered as indivisible abstract values and not as bit sequences; 2. All messages of one principle to all other principles must pass through the adversary and the adversary acts in communication as a general router; 3. The adversary can read, modify and redirect any message; 4. The adversary can only decrypt a message if he has the right keys and only compose new messages from keys and messages he already has; 5. The adversary cannot carry out statistical or other cryptanalytic attacks; although this model has the disadvantage of finding implementation-dependent attacks, it simplifies protocol analysis; it has proven to be the most powerful modeling of the adversary (Cervesato, 2001) because it can simulate other possible attackers."}, {"heading": "8.3 The Revised Needham-Schroeder Protocol", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "8.4 Discussion", "text": "The BAN logic (Burrows, Abadi, & Needham, 1990) is one of the most successful logical tools for thinking about security protocols, but the semantics of the BAN are always debatable, and it is not clear under what assumption the rules of BAN logic are solid and complete, which motivated the search for more appropriate frameworks (models).The advantage of our approach is that we use knowledge structures as semantic models to verify the veracity of epistemic objectives for security protocols.An important problem is that in the face of a security protocol, where and how the corresponding knowledge structure comes from, which corresponds to a security protocol, we have developed a semantic model of the corresponding security protocol and the corresponding underlying structure of the security protocol."}, {"heading": "9.

Conclusion", "text": "The main contribution of this paper is as follows: First, we have examined knowledge thinking within a simple framework called the knowledge structure, which consists of a global knowledge base and a set of observable variables for each agent. Therefore, the concept of knowledge structure can be used as a semantic model for a multi-agent logic of knowledge and general knowledge. In this model, the calculation of knowledge and general knowledge can be reduced to the functioning of variable forgetfulness; furthermore, an objective formula known by agents in states when one of their weakest sufficient conditions is held on Oi. Second, in order to grasp the notion of common knowledge within our framework, we have generalized and preserved the notion of the weakest sufficient conditions for a set of propositional variables having the notion of the weakest V-sufficient conditions. In view of a set of agents and a family V, we expect that we will have variable sets of these agents, we have demonstrated that an objective ability is the formula of a common knowledge, the formula of an objective knowledge in relation to a general knowledge structure."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank Ron van der Meyden, Fangzheng Lin and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on an earlier version of this paper, which was partially supported by the Australian Research Council DP0452628 grant, the National Basic Research 973 Program scholarships (Nos.2010CB328103, 2009CB320701 and 2005CB321902) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China scholarships (Nos.60725207 and 60763004)."}], "references": [{"title": "A semantics for a logic of authentication", "author": ["M.

Thirdly, the notions and methods in this work can be extended to investigate the extension of the variable forgetting operator to multi-agent logics of beliefs. Finally, recent research has shown that knowledge update has many important applications in reasoning about actions and plans and dynamic modeling of multi-agent systems (Zhang, 2003). A first step in this direction (in mono-agent S5) can be found in the work of Herzig, Lang and Marquis (2003).

We use variable forgetting as a basic operation for one agent to reason about its own or other agents\u2019 knowledge. In our framework, two notions namely agents\u2019 observable variables and the weakest sufficient condition play important roles in knowledge reasoning. Given a background knowledge base \u0393 and a set of observable variables Oi for each agent i, we show that the notion of agent i knowing a formula \u03c6 can be defined as a weakest sufficient condition of \u03c6 over Oi under \u0393. Moreover, we show how to capture the notion of common knowledge by using a generalized notion of weakest sufficient condition. Also, we show that public announcement operator can be conveniently dealt with via our notion of knowledge structure. Further, we explore the computational complexity of the problem whether an epistemic formula is realized in a knowledge structure. In the general case, this problem is PSPACE-hard; however, for some interesting subcases, it can be reduced to co-NP. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our framework in some interesting domains such as the automated analysis of the well-known muddy children puzzle and the verification of the revised Needham-Schroeder protocol. We believe that there are many scenarios where the natural presentation of the available information about knowledge is under the form of a knowledge structure. What makes it valuable compared with the corresponding multi-agent S5 Kripke structure is that it can be much more succinct.", "creator": " TeX output 2009.08.13:2309"}}}
