Since many applications would benefit from the availability of such features, several families of nonmonotonic DLs have been developed that are mostly based on default logic and autoepistemic logic. In this paper, we consider circumscription as an interesting alternative approach to nonmonotonic DLs that, in particular, supports defeasible inheritance in a natural way. We study DLs extended with circumscription under different language restrictions and under different constraints on the sets of minimized, fixed, and varying predicates, and pinpoint the exact computational complexity of reasoning for DLs ranging from ALC to ALCIO and ALCQO. When the minimized and fixed predicates include only concept names but no role names, then reasoning is complete for NExpTime^NP. It becomes complete for NP^NExpTime when the number of minimized and fixed predicates is bounded by a constant. If roles can be minimized or fixed, then complexity ranges from NExpTime^NP to undecidability.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:32:08 GMT  (447kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3476v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["piero a bonatti", "carsten lutz", "frank wolter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3476"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3476.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Complexity of Circumscription in Description Logic", "authors": ["Piero A.

Conclusions and Perspectives", "text": "We have shown that paraphrasing provides an elegant approach to defining non-monotonous DLs, that the resulting formalities have appealing expressiveness and are capable of decision-making when appropriate constraints are introduced, and the most important such constraint, which results in rather robust DL definition results, is that only concept names are minimized and fixed, while all role names vary. Empty TBoxes maintain decision-making ability when roles may be minimized, but not when they are fixed. The decipherability and complexity of the problems obtained in this paper are listed in more detail in Table 2. The results of Section 3 categorize all boundaries with TBox 6 =, which are categorized both generally and acyclic TBoxes. We view this paper as a promising step toward establishing circumscribed DLs as a large family of non-monotonous DLs used in practical applications. To achieve this goal, some additional research topics need to be addressed by two of them."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The first author was partially supported by the Excellence Network REWERSE, IST-2004506779, the third author partially supported by the British EPSRC grant GR / S63182 / 01."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.

The second application is the use of DLs as security policy languages (Uszok, Bradshaw, Johnson, Jeffers, Tate, Dalton, & Aitken, 2004; Kagal, Finin, & Joshi, 2003; Tonti, Bradshaw, Jeffers, Montanari, Suri, & Uszok, 2003). In formalizing access control policies, one must deal with the situation where a given request is neither explicitly allowed nor explicitly denied. Then, a default decision has to be taken such as in open and closed policies, where authorizations are respectively granted or denied by default (Bonatti & Samarati, 2003). Moreover, policies are often formulated incrementally, i.e., start with general authorizations for large classes of subjects, objects, and actions, and then progressively refine them by introducing exceptions for specific subclasses. This approach is clearly an incarnation of defeasible inheritance. While the above applications illustrate that integrating nonmonotonic features into DLs is worthwhile, the actual engineering of a computationally well-behaved nonmonotonic DL that provides sufficient expressive power turns out to be a non-trivial task. In particular, combinations of DLs and nonmonotonic logics typically involve subtle interactions between the two component logics and this easily leads to undecidability. It appears that there is no one optimal way to circumnavigate these difficulties, and thus many different combinations of DLs and nonmonotonic logics have been proposed in the literature, each with individual strengths and limitations (we provide a survey in Section 7). However, there is a striking gap: almost all existing approaches are based on default logic and autoepistemic logic, while circumscription has received very little attention in connection with DLs, and the computational properties of DLs with circumscription have been almost completely unknown. This is all the more surprising since circumscription is known to be one of the weakest forms of nonmonotonic reasoning\u2014see the work by Janhunen (1999) for one of the most recent surveys, and the paper by Bonatti and Eiter (1996) for an expressiveness analysis in terms of queries.", "startOffset": 142, "endOffset": 2174}, {"referenceID": 12, "context": "This is all the more surprising since circumscription is known to be one of the weakest forms of nonmonotonic reasoning\u2014see the work by Janhunen (1999) for one of the most recent surveys, and the paper by Bonatti and Eiter (1996) for an expressiveness analysis in terms of queries.", "startOffset": 205, "endOffset": 230}, {"referenceID": 12, "context": "This is all the more surprising since circumscription is known to be one of the weakest forms of nonmonotonic reasoning\u2014see the work by Janhunen (1999) for one of the most recent surveys, and the paper by Bonatti and Eiter (1996) for an expressiveness analysis in terms of queries. Therefore, it is a natural idea to use circumscription for defining a computationally well-behaved, yet expressive DL with nonmonotonic features. In this paper, we study circumscription (McCarthy, 1980) as an alternative approach to defining nonmonotonic DLs. In particular, we define a family of DLs with circumscription that enable a natural modelling of defeasible inheritance. Our general approach is to generalize standard DL knowledge bases to circumscribed knowledge bases (cKBs) which, additionally to a TBox for representing terminological knowledge and an ABox for representing knowledge about individuals, are equipped with a circumscription pattern. This pattern lists predicates (i.e., concept and role names) to be minimized in the sense that, in all admitted models of the cKB, the extension of the listed predicates has to be minimal w.r.t. set inclusion.

The use of a unique domain resolves several issues related to quantification in modal logics (such as whether the Barcan formula should hold, and whether different worlds of the same Kripke structure should be allowed to have different domains). It also avoids the asymmetry of the approaches based on default logic because, by definition, all individuals have a name. The other side of the coin is that domains with finite or varying cardinality and knowledge bases that do not satisfy the unique name assumption can only be dealt with using rather technical encodings (such as an explicit axiomatization of the finite domain represented by a concept name D). In the first paper mentioned above (Donini et al., 1998), decidability results apply only to monotonic knowledge bases4 as the autoepistemic operator can be used in a nonmonotonic fashion only in queries. This restriction has been lifted in the subsequent publications. They make use of the logic of minimal knowledge and negation as failure (MKNF), which is equipped with two (auto)epistemic operators \u201cK\u201d and \u201cA\u201d (Donini et al., 1997, 2002). In the former paper (Donini et al., 1997), the underlying monotonic fragment can be any description logic with a decidable instance checking problem. The price payed for this generality is that decidability results apply only to so-called simple knowledge bases, where quantifying-in (that is, quantification across modal operators, as in \u2200R.KC) is not allowed.

We study DLs extended with circumscription under different language restrictions and under different constraints on the sets of minimized, fixed, and varying predicates, and pinpoint the exact computational complexity of reasoning for DLs ranging from ALC to ALCIO and ALCQO. When the minimized and fixed predicates include only concept names but no role names, then reasoning is complete for NExp.
