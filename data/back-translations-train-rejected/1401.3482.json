The temporal layer was first performed for English, then evaluated and compared with: a) a general purpose QA system (F-measure 65.47% for QA plus English temporal layer vs. 38.01% for the general QA system), and b) a well-known QA system. Much better results were obtained for temporal questions with the multilayered system. This system was therefore extended to Spanish and very good results were again obtained in the evaluation (F-measure 40.36% for QA plus Spanish temporal layer vs. 22.94% for the general QA system).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:35:49 GMT  (436kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3482v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["estela saquete", "jose luis vicedo", "patricio mart\\'inez-barco", "rafael mu\\~noz", "hector llorens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3482"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3482.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Enhancing QA Systems with Complex Temporal Question Processing Capabilities", "authors": ["Estela Saquete", "Jose L.

Introduction", "text": "This situation continually promotes research into the development of information systems that make it possible to analyze, locate, manage, access and process all the available documentation related to the search topic automatically. Often, these systems are referred to as \"search engines.\" A search engine is particularly useful to obtain a specific piece of information without the need to manually go through all the available documentation related to the search topic. Search engines are currently evolving towards a new generation of machines that are able to access this type of machines. All rights are reserved, all rights that the user needs to better understand what lies behind each query. \"The new generation of search engines will be able to offer not only ordered information, but also portions of information scattered across different areas or contexts."}, {"heading": "2.

Temporal Questions Taxonomy", "text": "Before explaining how temporal questions are to be answered, they must be divided into different categories, since the way in which they are solved without prior processing of the question. \"In addition, George Bush will vary depending on the nature of the question. The temporality of a question depends on two levels of complexity: a) the number of events in the question: questions that are formed by a single event and whose answers can be found in a document (simple questions), and b) the temporal information that appears in the question, such as implicit or explicit temporal expressions that need to be recognized and normalized. The combination of these two characteristics leads to four different types of temporal questions. Simple temporal questions: Type 1: Single event temporal questions without temporal expression (TE). These are questions that require a temporal expression as an answer and do not contain a temporal expression in their formulation. These questions are formed by a single event."}, {"heading": "4. Architecture of a Multilayered QA System", "text": "In order to process specific types of questions that go beyond the scope of current QA systems, this work proposes a multi-layered architecture that increases the functionality of these QA systems and allows them to solve any type of complex questions. In this work, the temporal level has been implemented. In addition, this architecture allows to add different layers to cope with questions that require other types of complex processing and are not time-oriented, such as script questions (\"How do I assemble a bicycle?\") or template-based questions (\"What are Nelson Mandela's most important biographical data?\"). Complex questions have in common the need for additional processing of the question in order to solve them adequately. The architecture presented in this essay allows to deal with different types of complex questions by superimposing additional processing layers, one for each type, on top of an existing general QA system, QA questions, as shown in Figure 1. These layers: \u2022 generate the simple questions into questions, in order to answer simple questions."}, {"heading": "5. Temporal Layer", "text": "The temporal layer proposed here consists of two units, the Question Decomposition Unit in Oxford and the Answer Decomposition Unit in Q Bill Q Bill in Q Bill, which are superimposed over a universal QA system, as shown in Figure 2.These components all work together to obtain a definitive answer as follows: \u2022 Question Decomposition Unit is a pre-processing unit that performs three main tasks. Firstly, time expressions are identified and normalized in the question. Secondly, following the taxonomy in Section 3, there are different types of questions and each type must be treated in a different way. Therefore, the type must be identified. Thereafter, complex questions (types 3 and 4) are divided into simple temporal questions using the time signal reference. Secondly, the first subquestion is defined as a question focus (Q focus) and specifies the type of information the user needs to find the general system."}, {"heading": "5.1 Question Decomposition Unit", "text": "The main task of this unit, which is divided into three main modules, is the temporal reasoning of the temporal information of the question and the decomposition of the question (only required in questions of types 3 and 4).The Identification and Normalization of the temporal expression module recognizes and solves the temporal expressions in the question. The Type Identification module classifies the question according to the taxonomy proposed in section 3. Finally, the Question Splitter module divides the complex question into simple points. Thus, the output of the question decomposition unit consists of: \u2022 two partial questions (Q focus and Q constraint) which are processed by a QA system to obtain an answer for each of them \u2022 time tags containing concrete data returned by the TERSEO system (Saquete et al., 2006), these tags are part of the input of the answer recomposition unit, and they are used by this unit as time constraints to filter the individual answers, and the response to the time unit is the complete Q signal."}, {"heading": "5.1.1 Temporal Expression Identification and Normalization", "text": "This module uses the TERSEO system (Saquete et al., 2006) to identify, annotate and normalize the temporal expressions in the question. With this system, implicit and explicit temporal expressions can therefore be commented on. Expressions such as \"12 / 06 / 1975\" are explicit, while expressions such as \"two days before\" are implicit and must understand the location of another complete temporal expression (TE). In this thesis, TERSEO does not use full text as input, but only a question. The temporal tags (TE attribute with a value attribute) receive the questions as the output of this module and they are used in the standard format for specific dates or periods."}, {"heading": "5.1.2 Type Identification", "text": "The type identification module divides the question into one of the four types in the taxonomy proposed above. This identification is necessary because each type of question in the system generates a different behavior (scenario). Type 1 and type 2 questions are classified as simple, and the answer can be obtained without splitting the original question. On the other hand, questions of type 3 and type 4 must be divided into a series of simple questions. These types of questions are always type 1, type 2 or a non-time question, which are considered simple questions.The question type is classified as type 4 according to the rules in Figure 4. There are four possibilities: (a) if there is no time expression and no time signal, the question is classified as type 1; (b) if there is no time expression, but a time signal, the question is classified as type 4; (c) if there is a time expression, but no time signal, the question is classified as type 2; (d) if there is a time expression and a time signal, the question is classified as type 3."}, {"heading": "5.1.3 Question Splitter", "text": "This task is only necessary if, according to the type identification module, it is a type 3 or type 4 question. These questions are considered complex questions and must be divided into simple questions (type 1, type 2 or non-time questions).The decomposition of a complex question is based on the identification of time signals that link simple events to complex questions (see Table 1).As explained above, the two related events are converted into two simple questions using the time signal as the speaker: question focus (Q focus) and question restriction (Q restriction).The Q focus is a question that specifies the information the user is looking for. This question is very easy to obtain as no syntactical changes are required to construct it, only the question mark has to be added. If the Q focus is processed by a QS system, the system returns a list of possible answers.The Q restriction is created using the complex part of the question, the 3."}, {"heading": "NO NOYES YES", "text": "When the Q restriction is processed by a QA system, only an appropriate response is expected. In addition, time signals denote a sequence between the events that are linked to each other. Suppose F1 is the date associated with the responses to the Q focus and F2, the date associated with the response to the Q restriction4, the signal establishes a specific sequence between the responses referred to as the order key.An example of some order keys is in Table 1. Based on the list of responses to the Q focus, the response to the Q restriction and the time signal, the Answer Recomposition Unit determines the time compatibility 4. F2: Q restriction concrete date / [F2i-F2f]: Q restriction period between the answers and summarizes the final answer to the original complex question. This process is fully explained in the following subsection."}, {"heading": "5.2 Answer Recomposition Unit", "text": "The main task of the Answer Recomposition Unit is to obtain the final answer to the complex question using all available inputs from the decomposition unit and the answers from the QA system. The Recomposition Unit is divided into two modules: the Individual Answer Filtering module filters the possible answers to the Q focus, avoiding the non-time compatible ones, and the Answer Comparison and Composition module, which composes the answer to the original question using the order key specified by the time signal. After the complex questions have been divided by the Decomposition Unit into the Q focus and Q restriction, and the answers to these questions have been obtained by a QA system, the Recomposition Unit determines from the list of all potential answers to the Q focus, which are compatible with all time constraints obtained during the process: time expressions, time signal, and answer to the Q restriction. The answers to the Q focus, the first constraints, fulfill the first question."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Individual Answer Filtering", "text": "The list of possible responses to the Q-Focus and the response to the Q-Restriction given by the QA system is the input of the Individual Answer Filtering module. In the case of a Q-Focus or Q-Restriction with a temporal expression, it selects only those responses that meet the temporal limitations of the TE Identification and Normalization Unit. The date of the response should be temporally compatible with the temporal day, i.e. the date of the response must be within the date values of the tag. If not, it will be rejected. Only those responses that meet the limitations go to the Response Comparison and Comparison module."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 Answer Comparison and Composition", "text": "After the answers have been filtered using the signals and the order key, the results for the Q focus are then compared with the answer to the Q constraint to determine whether they are time compatible. Time signals indicate the order relationship between the date of the answer to the Q focus and the date of the answer to the Q constraint. Only the answers that meet the compatibility determined by the time signal can be possible answers to the original question. The answer selected in this module is considered to be an answer to the complex question. Therefore, the system is capable of solving complex time questions."}, {"heading": "6. Evaluation Experiments", "text": "The evaluation experiments carried out in this paper were initially conducted for English, and after porting the system to Spanish, the same evaluation procedure was carried out for this new language. This evaluation has a twofold objective: on the one hand to determine whether the Decomposition Unit is capable of correctly processing any kind of question in order to obtain adequate simple questions that can be answered by any general QA system, and on the other hand to show to what extent the QA system could be improved for general purposes if these techniques are applied."}, {"heading": "6.1 Test Environment", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to be in a position to be in what they are in."}, {"heading": "6.2 Evaluation Results", "text": "This section presents the results of the decomposition unit and an analysis of its impact on QA systems for English."}, {"heading": "6.2.1 Evaluating the Decomposition Unit for English", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "6.2.2 Evaluating the influence of the temporal processing in QA systems for English", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules that they play by the rules, and they will have to play by the rules that they play by the rules."}, {"heading": "6.2.3 Comparison with other QA systems", "text": "In order to compare our results with those of another QA system, we performed the above test with the well-known START QA system (Katz, 1990, 1997), which is available on the Internet10. Results obtained with the START system, which have been improved with the temporal layer by our 10th http: / / start.csail.edu / QA system, are presented and compared in Table 9. Both are general QA systems that use the Internet as a corpus.The START QA system was only able to answer questions of types 1 and 2. Although the precision achieved by this system with these types of questions is high, memory is lower, especially for type 2 questions (6.00%)."}, {"heading": "6.3 Portability to Other Languages: The Spanish Approach", "text": "As already mentioned, the system was originally developed for English, but also extended to Spanish. As the task of the layer that handles complex questions is language-dependent, some adjustment of the system was required: (1) TERSEO was used for Spanish, (2) all time signals stored in the system were translated into Spanish, (3) the Question Splitter module was adapted to create grammatically correct Spanish \"cua \u0301 ndo\" (\"when\") questions."}, {"heading": "6.3.1 Decomposition Unit Evaluation for Spanish", "text": "The results of the evaluation are presented in Table 10.In short, in the evaluation for Spanish, 174 out of a total of 200 questions were properly processed and dissected in all aspects (TE identification, type identification, temporal signal detection and, where applicable, splitting), meaning an F measure of 89.2% for the entire decomposition process. The best results were achieved by the Signal Detection Module (F measure almost 100%), but the results for Question Splitting and Type Identification (F measure around 93-94%) and TE identification and normalization were also quite good (F measure around 86%). The main errors were very similar to the English. However, some new problems emerged in Spanish (see Annex B for details), which are essentially those of: \u2022 Grammatical errors in the transformation of the second question and normalization (F measure around 86%)."}, {"heading": "6.3.2 Evaluating the influence of the temporal processing in QA systems for Spanish", "text": "For this evaluation, the described QA system (Moreda et al., 2008a) was not adapted to the Spanish language. As in English, we used the NE-based response extraction module. We divided the Spanish evaluation into two experiments, as in the English evaluation: 1. Basic QA system evaluation: First, the customized QA system is evaluated without using the time.2. Multi-layer QA system evaluation: Then the customized QA system is evaluated when it performs with the time.The main objective of this evaluation is to analyze whether the timeframe can be successfully extended to other languages and to deal with other linguistic QA systems, such as the Spanish-customized QA system in this case. The 200 timeframes created for the English test were translated manually into Spanish and used in both experiments."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusions and Further Work", "text": "This study represents a multi-layered temporary architecture that is carried out on a multilingual level, in this case in English and Spanish. This system handles complex temporal questions by dividing them into simple questions that can be answered by different types of general QA systems. In addition, the system weighs the questions over time with time information. It proposes to create a new level that goes beyond an up-to-date QA system that has two main characteristics: the complex question that is broken down into simple questions (sub-questions) by using the time signal that relates the events (Q focus), the type of information the user needs to find them. The answer to the question is broken down into simple questions that are broken down into simple questions (sub-questions) by setting the time signal that relates the ages."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This paper was partially supported by the Spanish government, the project TIN-200615265-C06-01, and the project QALL-ME, which is a 6th Framework Programme of the European Union (EU) under contract number FP6-IST-033860."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.
