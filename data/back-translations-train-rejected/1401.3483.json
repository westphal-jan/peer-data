It was shown that SP estimates marginals over covers that represent clusters of solutions. The SP-y algorithm generalizes SP to work on the maximum satisfiability (Max-SAT) problem, but the cover interpretation of SP does not generalize to SP-y. In this paper, we formulate the relaxed survey propagation (RSP) algorithm, which extends the SP algorithm to apply to the weighted Max-SAT problem. We show that RSP has an interpretation of estimating marginals over covers violating a set of clauses with minimal weight. This naturally generalizes the cover interpretation of SP. Empirically, we show that RSP outperforms SP-y and other state-of-the-art Max-SAT solvers on random Max-SAT instances. RSP also outperforms state-of-the-art weighted Max-SAT solvers on random weighted Max-SAT instances.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:36:10 GMT  (809kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3483v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hai leong chieu", "wee sun sun lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3483"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3483.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Relaxed Survey Propagation for The Weighted Maximum Satisfiability Problem", "authors": ["Hai Leong Chieu", "Wee Sun Lee"], "emails": ["chaileon@dso.org.sg", "leews@comp.nus.edu.sg"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

We perform RSP on increasing values of y: foreach y, RSP fixes a number of spins, and we stop increasing y when the number of specified spins decreases above the previous value of y. For UBCSAT, we perform 1000 iterations for each of the 20 solvers. The results are shown in Table 2. Out of the seven instances, RSP fails to fix all spins at first, but performs UBCSAT on the rest. Lardeux et al. (2005) did not show the best performances in their paper, but their average results were higher than the results in Table 2. Figure 12 shows that the search for a good SP benchmark is Y."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusion", "text": "While recent work on Max-SAT or weighted Max-SAT tends to focus more on complete solvers, these solvers are not able to handle large instances. In the 2007 Max-SAT competition (Argelich, Li, Manya, & Planes, 2007), the largest Max-3-SAT instances used have only 70 variables. For large instances, complete solvers are still not practicable, and local search methods were the only viable alternative. SP-y, the generalization of SP, has proven to be able to solve large Max-3-SAT instances during phase transition, but the theoretical explanations that have emerged from recent work on SP are lacking. For 3-SAT, there is a simple-difficult-easy transition as the ratio of clause to variable increases. However, for Max-3-SAT it has been empirically demonstrated that beyond the phase transition of satisfaction algorithms, all instances beyond 2001 as RG algorithms are difficult to solve."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work is partially supported by the NUS ARF grant R-252-000-240-112."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.
