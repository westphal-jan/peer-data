Unnecessary nondeterminism and the construction of large models are two primary sources of inefficiency in the tableau-based reasoning calculi used in state-of-the-art reasoners. In order to reduce nondeterminism, we base our calculus on hypertableau and hyperresolution calculi, which we extend with a blocking condition to ensure termination. In order to reduce the size of the constructed models, we introduce anywhere pairwise blocking. We also present an improved nominal introduction rule that ensures termination in the presence of nominals, inverse roles, and number restrictions---a combination of DL constructs that has proven notoriously difficult to handle. Our implementation shows significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art reasoners on several well-known ontologies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:37:06 GMT  (519kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3485v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["boris motik", "rob shearer", "ian horrocks"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3485"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3485.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Hypertableau Reasoning for Description Logics", "authors": ["Boris Motik", "Rob Shearer", "Ian Horrocks"], "emails": ["boris.motik@comlab.ox.ac.uk", "rob.shearer@comlab.ox.ac.uk", "ian.horrocks@comlab.ox.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Therefore, we must avoid cyclic blocks: If s is allowed, t and t can block, then it is guaranteed that neither s nor t have constructed all of their successors, which would render the calculation incomplete. Therefore, we parameterise our algorithm with a strict sequence of blocks on individuals that contain the ancestral relationship. We only allow blocking s if we have t in addition to the conditions mentioned in Section 3.1.2. This version of blocking is formalized in Definition 7 on page 193.

The second source of complexity in tableau calculi is known as and-branching : the expansion of a model due to existential quantifiers can generate very large models. Apart from memory consumption problems, and-branching can increase or-branching by increasing the number of individuals to which GCIs are applied. In this paper, we present a reasoning calculus that addresses both sources of complexity. We focus on the DL SHOIQ, which is obtained by extending SHOIQ with local reflexivity and disjoint, reflexive, irreflexive, symmetric, and asymmetric roles. SROIQ further extends SHOIQ with generalized role inclusions of the form R1 \u25e6 . . . \u25e6Rn v R.

Let us assume that the algorithm chooses to process the assertions on ai before those on bj . Hence, by applying the derivation rules to all ai, a tableau algorithm derives the assertions shown in line (iii) of Figure 1; after that, by applying the derivation rules to all bi, the algorithm derives the assertions shown in line (iv) of Figure 1. The ABox now contains both A(an) and \u00acA(an), which is a contradiction. Thus, the algorithm needs to backtrack its most recent choice, so it flips its guess on bn\u22121 to A(bn\u22121). This generates a contradiction on bn\u22121, so the algorithm backtracks from all guesses for bi, changes the guess on an to A(an), and repeats the work for all bi. This also leads to a contradiction, so the algorithm must revise its guess for an\u22121; but then, two guesses are again possible for an. In general, after revising a guess for ai, all possibilities for aj , i < j \u2264 n, must be reexamined, which results in exponential behavior. None of the standard backtracking optimizations (Horrocks, 2007) are helpful: the problem arises because the order in which the individuals are processed makes the guesses on ai independent from the guesses on aj for i 6= j. The GCI \u2203R.A v A, however, is not inherently nondeterministic: it is equivalent to the Horn clause \u2200x, y : [R(x, y) \u2227A(y)\u2192 A(x)], which can be applied bottom-up to derive the assertions A(bn), A(an\u22121), . . . , A(a0) and eventually reveal a contradiction on a0.

On K11, this means that the GCI (44) is applied to each individual s before introducing its successors. Thus, before the existentials on s are expanded, the assertion (\u2200L.\u00acA t \u2200R.\u00acA tA)(s) is introduced and one disjunct is chosen nondeterministically. The choices (\u2200L.\u00acA)(s) and (\u2200R.\u00acA)(s) will lead to a clash, so the algorithm eventually derives A(s), before it expands the existentials on s and introduces s.1 and s.2. Thus, while generating at most exponential models, this algorithm incurs a massive amount of nondeterminism. Nondeterministic exponential behavior can be guaranteed in the hypertableau algorithm by nondeterministically fixing the label of each individual before applying the \u2264-rule to it.

In order to reduce the size of the constructed models, we introduce anywhere pairwise blocking.
