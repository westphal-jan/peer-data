The main aim of this article is to carry out a thorough and systematic investigation of inference in extensions of the original DL-Lite logics along five axes: by (i) adding the Boolean connectives and (ii) number restrictions to concept constructs, (iii) allowing role hierarchies, (iv) allowing role disjointness, symmetry, asymmetry, reflexivity, irreflexivity and transitivity constraints, and (v) adopting or dropping the unique same assumption. We analyze the combined complexity of satisfiability for the resulting logics, as well as the data complexity of instance checking and answering positive existential queries. Our approach is based on embedding DL-Lite logics in suitable fragments of the one-variable first-order logic, which provides useful insights into their properties and, in particular, computational behavior.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:37:57 GMT  (893kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3487v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["alessandro artale", "diego calvanese", "roman kontchakov", "michael zakharyaschev"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3487"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3487.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The DL-Lite Family and Relations", "authors": ["Alessandro Artale", "Diego Calvanese", "Roman Kontchakov", "Michael Zakharyaschev"], "emails": ["artale@inf.unibz.it", "calvanese@inf.unibz.it", "roman@dcs.bbk.ac.uk", "michael@dcs.bbk.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

The KB satisfaction problem is to check whether there is a model of K. Clearly, satisfaction is the minimum requirement for any ontology.

These observations motivated the introduction by Calvanese et al. (2005) of the first DL-Lite logic, which in our new nomenclature corresponds to DL-Litecore. Their main results were a polynomial-time upper bound for the combined complexity of KB satisfiability and a LogSpace upper bound for the data complexity of conjunctive query answering (under the UNA). These results were extended by Calvanese et al. (2006) to two larger languages: DL-Litehorn and DL-Lite H horn, which were originally called DL-Liteu,F and DL-Liteu,R, respectively. Calvanese et al. (2007b) introduced another member of the DL-Lite family (named DL-LiteR), which extended DL-Lite H core with role disjointness axioms of the form Dis(R1, R2). The computational behavior of the new logic turned out to be the same as that of DL-Litecore. It may be worth mentioning that DL-Litecore covers the DL fragment of RDFS (Klyne & Carroll, 2004; Hayes, 2004). Note also that Calvanese et al. (2006) considered the variants of both DL-Liteu,F and DL-Liteu,R with arbitrary n-ary relations (not only the usual binary roles) and showed that query answering in them is still in LogSpace for data complexity. We conjecture that similar results can be obtained for the other DL-Lite logics introduced in this paper. Artale et al. (2007b) demonstrated how n-ary relations can be represented in DL-Litecore by means of reification. A further variant of DL-Lite, called DL-LiteA (\u2018A\u2019 for attributes), was introduced by Poggi et al. (2008a) with the aim of capturing as many features of conceptual modeling formalisms as possible, while still maintaining the computational properties of the basic variants of DL-Lite.", "startOffset": 50, "endOffset": 1612}, {"referenceID": 14, "context": "7, we prove that satisfiability of DL-LiteHF core KBs is ExpTime-hard for combined complexity, while instance checking is data-hard for P (NLogSpace-hardness was shown by Calvanese et al., 2006).

We analyze the combined complexity of satisfiability for the resulting logics, as well as the data complexity of instance checking and answering positive existential queries.
