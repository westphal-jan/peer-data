The best plans are then not the ones with least cost but the ones with maximum utility, where the utility of a plan is the sum of the utilities of the soft goals achieved minus the plan cost. Finding plans with high utility appears to involve two linked problems: choosing a subset of soft goals to achieve and finding a low-cost plan to achieve them. New search algorithms and heuristics have been developed for planning with soft goals, and a new track has been introduced in the International Planning Competition (IPC) to test their performance. In this note, we show however that these extensions are not needed: soft goals do not increase the expressive power of the basic model of planning with action costs, as they can easily be compiled away. We apply this compilation to the problems of the net-benefit track of the most recent IPC, and show that optimal and satisficing cost-based planners do better on the compiled problems than optimal and satisficing net-benefit planners on the original problems with explicit soft goals. Furthermore, we show that penalties, or negative preferences expressing conditions to avoid, can also be compiled away using a similar idea.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:39:49 GMT  (188kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3491v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["emil keyder", "hector geffner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3491"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3491.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Soft Goals Can Be Compiled Away", "authors": ["Emil Keyder", "Hector Geffner"], "emails": ["emil.keyder@upf.edu", "hector.geffner@upf.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Extensions", "text": "We have shown that it is possible to collect positive aid programmes linked to individual aid programmes. We now show that this compilation can be expanded to deal with positive aid programmes defined on formulas above liquid funds and negative aid programmes defined on both individual aid programmes and formulas. Negative aid programmes stand for conditions that are to be avoided rather than sought after; for example, an aid programme punishing a plan that leads to a state in which both p and q are defined at an additional cost of 10. The compilation of soft targets defined on formulas is based on the standard set of target and precondition formulas in classical planning (Gazen & Knoblock, 1997; Fog, 1999). A positive aid programme based on a logical formula A can be put together by introducing a new flowing aid programme that can be achieved at zero cost by any final state in which A, and the allocation of aid programme to A."}, {"heading": "5. Summary", "text": "We have shown that soft targets do not add meaningfulness and can be easily compiled away, which means that no new search algorithms or heuristics are required to handle them. On a practical level, experiments suggest that modern sequence planners outperform more modern net benefit planners in assembled versions of the benchmarks used in recent planning competitions. Furthermore, similar transformations can be used to summarize positive and negative tools on logical formulas in DNF or CNF."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Malte Helmert for his help in creating and implementing many IPC6 planners, Patrik Haslum for his help in all aspects of different versions of HSP and J.
