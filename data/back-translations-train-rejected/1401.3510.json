The main reasons for the poor performance of CLIR are the mismatch of query terms, lexical ambiguity and untranslated query terms. The existing problems of CLIR must be addressed in order to improve the performance of the CLIR system. In this paper, we seek to solve the problem by proposing an algorithm to improve the performance of the Anglo-Hindi CLIR system.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "We are building the broad network architecture for transmitting information across national barriers, but there is still a long way to go before linguistic boundaries can be as effective as geographical [1]. Today, people are more interested in global things such as education, business, business, marketing, research, etc., because people are interested in collecting information and data from other regions of the world, the only medium for this is the Internet. But we also know that users are more likely to access information in a language where a user is more comfortable, or we can say that the user wants information in his / her mother tongue in order to understand the language of the documents more easily. Access to information in a host language is clearly important for many users. In India, about 70% of people know Hindi as their primary language, while we are based on the Human Development Study in 2012; there are only 10.35% people in India who are English-speaking. India is the third country that has the largest number of Internet users, but when we talk about penetration, it means 166% of the total population in India."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "The different approaches to retrieving information from the CLIR system have some advantages and disadvantages. Lisa, et al. [3] proposed in 1998 a method for solving ambiguities in query translation and phrasal translation by using statistical parallel event analysis from unlinked corpus and combining this technique with other techniques for solving ambiguities. KyungSoon al. [4] in 2002 proposed a method for implicitly solving ambiguities in the Korean-English CLIR database, and the author also compared their method with machine translation and parallel corpus techniques and proved that good performance of query can be achieved without the use of complex resources."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY", "text": "The system that records user queries in one language and retrieves relevant documents in another is known as the \"cross language information retrieval system.\" Studies say that the performance of CLIR is still low compared to the terms of CLIR such as query expansion, co-occurrence statistics, clustering, etc., but still the performance of English-Hindi CLIR is not as good as that of monolingual IR performance. The most common reasons behind the poor performance of CLIR are: \u2022 Lack of availability of resources such as bilingual dictionary, mismatching of out of vocabulary (OOV) terms, stemmer, part of speech (POS) tagger, etc. \u2022 Multiple representations of query words (Lexical Ambiguity)."}, {"heading": "3.1. Query Translation", "text": "Translating queries from one language to another is known as query translation. Query translation is a crucial step in the CLIR system because all problems arise from this step, such as query terms, ambiguities, poor query performance, etc. There are various approaches to translating user queries such as bilingual dictionary, parallel corpus, online translators, etc. In this essay, we have used \"Shabdanjali\" Multi-lingual Readable Dictionary as a lexicon resource for translating English to Hindi Query. The dictionary was developed in IIT Hyderabad. This dictionary is available in ISCII conversion, so a conversion from ISCII to UTF8 encoding code is required."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "The experiment is conducted on the basis of FIRE (Forum of Information Retrieval Evaluation) 2010 datasets. FIRE 2010 datasets consist of a set of user queries relating to the \"Title\" field, the \"Description\" field and the \"Narrative\" field, a set of documents and Qrel files containing a list of relevant documents for a query. The experiment was conducted for English-Hindi CLIR to retrieve Hindi documents using English queries. In this paper, we used only the \"Title\" field of the queries. The test data collection is described in Table 2 as follows: We obtain results from two approaches, the first EHT approach English-Hindi CLIR using the Query field title and the second EHRT approach means English-Hindi CLIR using our approach. The results of both approaches are presented in terms of interpolation recall precision average in Table 3."}, {"heading": "4.1. Performance graph", "text": "Table 2 shows that our English-Hindi CLIR performs better than the original English-Hindi CLIR title field queries in terms of MAP (average accuracy)."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The obstacle in CLIR is poor performance compared to monolingual IR performance due to the query term inmatching, untranslated query words, multiple representations of query terms, etc. Considerable work is already being done in English-Hindi CLIR. Different approaches to retrieving information from the CLIR system are discussed in the related work part. These earlier suggested approaches have some advantages and disadvantages. In order to make these approaches more efficient and effective, the limitations of these approaches need to be further explored in order to improve the performance of the English-Hindi CLIR system. In this paper, we used transliteration of each query term to enable all possible combinations of Hindi queries without substituting the query position in order to improve the English-Hindi CLIR approach. \"The average precision of the EHT and EHR strategies and EHRT responses are relevant to the English transformation.37 to the proposed CLIR approach,"}], "references": [{"title": "Profound Survey on Cross Language Information Retrieval Methods\", Published in Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies", "author": ["B.
