Introduction", "text": "The LCS formalism was introduced by John Holland [1976] and was based on his better known invention - the Genetic Algorithm (GA) [Holland, 1975]; a few years later, in collaboration with Judith Reitman, he presented the first implementation of an LCS in \"Cognitive System Level 1\" (CS-1) [Holland & Reitman, 1978]; Holland then revised the framework to define what would become the standard system for many years to come [Holland, 1980] but the full system of LCS was somewhat more complex and practical experience made it difficult to realize the intended behavior / performance of systems despite numerous modifications (e.g. Wilson S rule of 1989)."}, {"heading": "2. The Evolution of Accuracy-based LCS", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "2.3 GOFER", "text": "The second LCS will therefore only receive a reward if it correctly exploits such categories in relation to the current task."}, {"heading": "2.7 Wilson\u2019s XCS", "text": "The main difference between XCS (Figure 5) and all other LCS prior to their presentation is that the suitability of the rule for the DG is not based on the level of the rules received, but purely on the accuracy of the predictions (p) of the reward. The intention in XCS is to build a complete and accurate representation of the problem area (rather than simply focusing on the higher payout levels in the environment) by efficient generalizations: XCS learns a value function across the entire government action space. A system prediction is then made for each action in [M] based on a weighted average of the predictions of the rules in all respects. The system action is then either deselected or randomly (usually 0.5 probability per attempt). If [M] is empty, the gain is used in XCS, which consists of three parameters, p and F for each corresponding rule."}, {"heading": "3. Conclusion", "text": "The use of accuracy began with CS-1, although it was focused on the highest reward per niche. In addition, the generalization pressure of XCS has features that are consistent with that of CS-1, as it is also based on accuracy and usage rate. In CS-1, predicted rewards are only updated if they are accurate or below the current estimate, with measures and GA selection based on this parameter: more accurate rules are more likely to be reproduced. Rule periods are reset after use, and deletion is based on age: more frequently used rules are less likely to be replaced. Thus, CS-1 propagates more precise, more general (frequently applied) rules. XCS combines both accuracy in its pure form and frequency of use in GA selection processes."}], "references": [{"title": "Accuracy-Based Learning Classifier Systems: Models, Analysis and Applications to Classification Tasks.
