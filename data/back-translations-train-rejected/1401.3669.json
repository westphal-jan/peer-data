Introduction", "text": "An important tool in denotation analysis is the concept of hreb, which is defined in [10] as a discontinuous text unit that can be presented in a fixed form or a list form if the order is important. A hreb contains all units that denote the same real unit or refer to another. Thus, this basic concept is baptized in honor of L. Hebek ([3]), who introduced measurement in the domain of denotation analysis, as it is known in quantitative linguistics.

The kernel concentration is defined as the size of the kernel divided by the total number of hrebs in the text: KC = | Kernel | n 5. The text concentration is calculated on the list hrebs.

Conclusions and Further work", "text": "Encyclopaedic chains and correlation chains (CCs) are intensively studied, but few indicators are standard for them. Hrebs-inspired indicators need to be studied and adopted for CCs. These indicators could become tools for assessing and improving these applications in the context of some applications that use CCs. For example, there is a great debate about how CCs can be selected to produce the summaries of a text: the selection of long or short CCs is one of the questions. Only the use of kernel CCs or kernel CCs with high topicality and / or high diffusion could be a solution.Generally, quantitative linguistics and computational linguistics are seen as two distinct areas with their own journals, techniques and specialists. It is important to identify those parts that they have in common and to try to take advantage of this commonality."}], "references": [{"title": "Attention, Intentions and the Structure of Discourse", "author": ["B.
