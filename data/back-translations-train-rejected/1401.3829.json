Price Prediction", "text": "In this section, we describe how RoxyBot-06 builds its stochastic models of airfare, hotel and event prices. Each model is a discrete probability distribution represented by a series of \"scenarios,\" each of which is a vector of \"future\" prices - prices at which goods can be bought and sold after the current phase. On flights, the price prediction model is not stochastical: the future purchase price is simply RoxyBot-06 \"s prediction of the expected minimum price during the current phase. On hotels, future purchase prices are predicted by Monte Carlo simulations of simultaneous ascending auctions to approximate competitive equilibrium prices. There are no current purchase prices for hotels. For entertainment, RoxyBot-06 predicts future purchase and sale prices based on historical data. Details of these price prediction methods are at the center of this section."}, {"heading": "4.1 Flights", "text": "Efforts to think about purchasing air travel begin with understanding the TAC model of flight price development."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 TAC Flight Prices\u2019 Stochastic Process", "text": "At the beginning of each TAC game, a specific z-value is selected for each flight, depending on the hidden parameter z and the current time t as follows: given constants c, d, R and T > 0, each (intermediate) price increase is a sequence of random fares. \u2212 Every ten seconds, TACAir disrupts the price of each flight by a random value depending on the hidden parameter z and the current time t as follows: given constants c, d, R and T > 0, each (intermediate) price increase is linked to the perturation value. \u2212 Every ten seconds, TACAir disrupts the price of each flight by a random value, the given constants c, d, R and T > 0, each (intermediate) conditional price increase is a linear function of t: x (t, z) = c + tT (z)."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 RoxyBot-06\u2019s Flight Prices Prediction Method", "text": "Although the value of the hidden parameter z is never disclosed to the agents, we remember that the agents observe the sample prices, say: y1 = = 1,., yt, which depend on this value. This information can be used to model the probability distribution, Pt [z] \u2261 P [z | y1,.., yt]. However, such a probability distribution can be estimated based on the next expected price increase, before RoxyBot06, Agents Walverine (Cheng et al., 2005) and Mertacor (Toulis et al., 2006). Walverine uses Bayesian updates to calculate the next expected price disruption and then compares this value to a threshold that deferred its flight purchases if not expected to exceed that threshold. Mertacor uses Bayesian updates to estimate the time when air prices reach their minimum value. RoxyBot uses Bayesian updates to compare and then calculate the expected price increase."}, {"heading": "4.2 Hotels", "text": "In a competitive market where the impact of each on prices is negligible, equilibrium prices are prices where supply meets demand, provided all producers maximize their profits and all consumers maximize their benefits. RoxyBot-06 forecasts hotel prices by simulating simultaneous ascending auctions (SimAA) (Cramton, 2006) in an attempt to approximate prices of competitive equilibrium (CE). This approach is inspired by Walverines (Cheng et al., 2005), where the ta-tonnement method (Walras, 1874) is applied for the same purpose."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Simultaneous Ascending Auctions", "text": "If ~ y (~ p) denotes the cumulative supply of all generators, and if ~ x (~ p) denotes the cumulative demand of all consumers, then ~ z (~ p) = ~ x (~ p) \u2212 ~ y (~ p) denotes the excessive demand in the market. The ta tonnement process adjusts the price vector for iteration n + 1 because the price vector for iteration n and an adjustment rate \u03b1n is: ~ pn + 1 = ~ pn ~ z (~ pn). SimAA adjusts the price vector as follows: ~ pn + 1 = ~ pn + \u03b1max {~ z (~ pn), 0}, for a fixed value of \u03b1. Both processes continue until the excess demand is not positive: i.e. the supply exceeds the load. Although competitive equilibrium prices are not guaranteed to be approximate in the TAC markets."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Prediction Quality", "text": "Each TAC agent knows the preferences of his own customers, but has to estimate the demand of others. Walverine calculates a single hotel price forecast (a point estimate) by taking into account the demands of his own customers along with those of 56 \"expected\" customers. In short, the benefit of an expected customer is an average of travel dates and hotel types, supplemented by fixed entertainment forecasts that favor longer trips (see the paper by Cheng et al., 2005, for details). In contrast, RoxyBot-06 builds a stochastic model of hotel prices, consisting of S scenarios taking into account the demands of its own customers along with S random samples of 56 customers. (Random or expected) Customer demand is simply the quantity of each good in its optimal package, given current prices. Cumulative demand is the sum of all the individual predictions of the customer. In Figure 1, we present two sketches that represent the different quality of the hotel at two prices."}, {"heading": "4.2.3 Prediction Quality over Time: Interim Price Prediction", "text": "The charts shown in Figure 1 refer to hotel price forecasts made at the beginning of the game when all hotel auctions were open. In these CE calculations, prices are initialized to 0. When hotel auctions close, RoxyBot-06 updates the predicted prices of hotel auctions. [5] We experimented with two methods to generate preliminary price forecasts: The first is to initialize and lower prices in the hotel markets when they close (for closed auctions), or to charge current prices (for open auctions) while calculating competitive equilibrium prices. [6] The second differs in the treatment of closed auctions: We simulate a process of distributing the goods in closed auctions to the customers they want most, and then exclude the closed markets."}, {"heading": "4.2.4 Run Time", "text": "Table 2 shows the maturity of the CE prediction methods on the 2002 (60 games) and 2006 (165 games) TACs final samples fixed at minute 0, as well as their maturity extending over 6. However, if a hotel closes at an artificially low price, and if this price may not be increased, then the predicted prices of the hotels completing the hotel in question would be artificially high.

(In our simulations, airfares are set to their expected minimums and maintenance prices to 80.) In principle, competitive equilibrium (CE) prices could serve as predictions in all TAC markets. However, CE prices are unlikely to be good predictions of airfares as airfares are determined exotically. In terms of maintenance prices, CE prices have strong predictive power; the inclusion of maintenance prices in the ta-tonne and SimAA calculations would have been expensive. (In our simulations according to Wellman et al., 2004, customer services are simply expanded to include fixed maintenance premiums that favor longer journeys.) Nevertheless, it may be interesting in future work to evaluate the success of these or related methods in predicting CDA clearing prices."}, {"heading": "4.3 Entertainment", "text": "During each offer interval, RoxyBot-06 forecasts current and future purchase and sale prices for tickets to all entertainment events. Specifically, each current price forecast is the best predicted price during the current offer interval. RoxyBot-06's estimates of entertainment prices are based on historical data from the last 40 games. To generate a scenario, a sample game is randomly drawn from this collection, and sequences of entertainment, bitcoin and transaction prices are extracted. Given such a history, the trading prices for each auction denote the price at which the last trade was made prior to the transaction; this value is initialized to 200 for purchase and 0 for sale. Furthermore, bidai will indicate the offer price at a later date i and askai the bit price at a later date."}, {"heading": "4.4 Summary", "text": "In this section, we have described the price forecasting methods of RoxyBot-06. Key ideas that could be transferable, at least to other TAC agents, if not beyond the TAC, are as follows: 1. RoxyBot makes stochastic price forecasts by creating a series of so-called \"scenarios\" in which each scenario is a vector of future prices.2. For each flight, RoxyBot uses Bayesian updates to predict its expected minimum price. 3. For hotels, RoxyBot uses a method inspired by Walverine: it approaches competitive equilibrium prices by simulating simultaneous ascending auctions instead of the usual ta-tonnement process."}, {"heading": "5. Optimization", "text": "Next, we describe the optimization routine of RoxyBot-06. It is (i) stochastic, (ii) global, and (iii) dynamic, taking stochastic price forecasts as input, looking at its flight, hotel, and entertainment decisions in line, and at the same time justifying which bids should be made in both the current and future phases of the game."}, {"heading": "5.1 Abstract Auction Model", "text": "Remember that our treatment of bidding is decision theory, not game theory. In particular, we focus on the problem of optimizing a single agent's own bidding behavior, provided that the strategies of the other agents are set. In accordance with our basic agent architecture, we also assume that the environment can be modeled based on the agent's predictions of market prices. We introduce the term pseudo-auction to refer to a market mechanism defined by these two assumptions - fixed behavior of other agents and market information encapsulated by prices. The optimization problem that RoxyBot solves is one of bidding in pseudo-auctions, not (true) auctions. In this section, we will formalize this abstract auction model and refer it to TAC auctions; in the next, we will define and propose heuristics to solve various pseudo-auction problems."}, {"heading": "5.1.1 Basic Formalism", "text": "In this section, we formalise the basic concepts needed to accurately formulate the supply in the TAC market."}, {"heading": "5.1.2 Pseudo-Auction Rules", "text": "In the second half of the year, the price of the auction in the USA will be many times higher than in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, the price of the auction will be many times higher than in the first half of the year. In the third half of the year, the price of the auction will be many times lower. In the third half of the year, the price will be many times higher than in the first half of the year. In the third half of the year, the prices will be many times higher."}, {"heading": "5.2 Bidding Problems", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move to another world, in which they will be able to move to another world, in which they will be able to move to another world, in which they will be able to move, in which they will move, in which they will move, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which they will live, in which will live, in which they will live, in"}, {"heading": "5.3 Bidding Heuristics", "text": "This section discusses two heuristic solutions to the bidding problem: the Expectation Value Method (EVM), an approach that breaks down stochastic information, and Sample Average Approximation (SAA), an approach that exploits stochastic information and characterizes RoxyBot-06."}, {"heading": "5.3.1 Expected Value Method", "text": "The Expectation Value Method (Birge & Louveaux, 1997) is a standard method for approximating the solution to a stochastic optimization problem. First, the given distribution is summarized in a point estimate (e.g. the mean); then, a solution to the corresponding deterministic optimization problem is presented as an approximate solution to the original stochastic optimization problem. Applying this idea to the problem of bidding under uncertainty results in: Definition 5.7 [Expected Value Method] Given a probability distribution for buyers and sellers pricelines, the expected values P-2 and P-2 or BID-EVM (P-2, EVM-2) = max Q1, R1-Zn, \u03b21 = < ~ b, ~ a >, Q2, R2-Znv (((((((Q1-Q2) and P-2)) do not exceed the expected values P-2 (R1, R2)."}, {"heading": "5.3.2 Sample Average Approximation", "text": "The idea is simple: (i) generate a set of sample scenarios and (ii) solve an approximation of the problem that covers only the sample scenarios.

SAA never offers more than the total probability (sampling) of their highest sample price (sample price), because as far as they know, the price is sufficient to win in all scenarios. However, there is a certain probability that the highest sample price will fall below the top sample price (sample price). Let us calculate this probability in the case of an individual auction, let f detect the corresponding density function, and let G detect the cumulative distribution function via the clearing prices. Using this notation, the term 1 \u2212 G (x) is the probability that the clearing price is greater than x."}, {"heading": "5.4 Summary", "text": "In this section, we have developed a series of bidding problems and heuristic solutions to these problems, which capture the essence of the bids in the one-time and continuous billing auctions that characterize the TACs. Most of our presentation was deliberately abstract to point out that our problems and their solutions are applicable well beyond the scope of the TACs: for example, to bids for interdependent goods in separate eBay auctions. Nevertheless, it remains to confirm our approach in other areas of application."}, {"heading": "6. Experiments", "text": "We conclude this work with two experimental results, the first in a controlled test environment and the second with the results of the final round of the 2006 TAC Travel Competition.

Collective Behavior", "text": "The forecasting techniques for hotel prices described in Section 4.2 are used to calculate (or at least approximate) competitive equilibrium prices without the full knowledge of the client Pop-11. A broker suffers travel penalties to the extent that he assigns packages to his clients that deviate from his wishes. In this section we base this knowledge and consider the results of the ta-ton and SimAA calculations not as predictions but as basic truths. We compare the actual prices in the last games with this basic truth in the respective years since 2002 to determine whether the TAC market prices resemble CE prices. What we find is in Figure 5. Due to the nature of our methods, these calculations relate exclusively to hotel prices. The results correlate to a large extent to both indicators (euclidean distance and EVPP). We note that the accuracy of the CE price calculations has varied from year to year. 2003 was the year in which TAC Supply Management introduced the SCM, not the year of 2004."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusion", "text": "Contributions to the design of commercial agents include the invention of trading strategies, along with models and algorithms for realizing their calculations and methods of measuring and evaluating the performance of commercial agents that are characterized by these strategies. Researchers are looking for both specific solutions to specific trade problems and general principles to guide the development of commercial agents across market scenarios. This paper claims to contribute to this research agenda. We described the design and implementation of RoxyBot-06, a capable commercial agent, as demonstrated by its performance in TAC-06. Although automated trading in electronic markets has not yet fully established itself, the trend is well advanced. TAC demonstrates the potential of autonomous bidders to make key trade decisions in the most effective way. Such agents have the potential to accelerate the automation of trade in a broader sense and thus shape the future of trade."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This paper extends the work of Lee et al.

In spite of its effectiveness in the TAC-00 tournament, a weakness of the 2000 design was that RoxyBot could not explicitly reason about variance within prices. In the years since 2000, we recast the key challenges faced by TAC agents as several different stochastic bidding problems (see, for example, the paper by Greenwald & Boyan, 2004), whose solutions exploit price predictions in the form of distributions. In spite of our perseverance, RoxyBot fared unimpressively in tournament conditions year after year, until 2006. Half a decade in the laboratory spent searching for bidding heuristics that can exploit stochastic information at reasonable computational expense finally bore fruit, as RoxyBot emerged victorious in TAC-06. In a nutshell, the secret of RoxyBot-06\u2019s success is: (hotel) price prediction by simulating simultaneous ascending auctions, and optimization based on the sample average approximation method. Details of our approach are the subject of the present article. Overview This paper is organized as follows. Starting in Section 2, we summarize the TAC market game. Next, in Section 3, we present a high-level view of RoxyBot\u2019s 2006 architecture. In Section 4, we describe RoxyBot\u2019s price prediction techniques for flights, hotels, and entertainment, in turn. Perhaps of greatest interest is our hotel price prediction method.
