In many cases, valid configurations can be described implicitly by specifying constraints on product properties.

An additive cost function is the formc (x1,.., xn) = n \u2211 i = 1ci (xi), with each variable xi and each value in its range assigned a cost ci (ai) \u0192R. Additive functions are one of the most important and commonly used modeling constructs. A number of important combinatorial problems are modeled as holistic linear programs, in which often both the limitations and the objective function are linear, i.e. special cases of additive cost functions. In the theory of multi-attribute utilities, user preferences are aggregated into a single additive function under certain assumptions by weighted summing up the benefits of individual attributes. In a product configuration context, many properties are additive, such as the storage capacity of a computer or the overall weight, which can be weighted by our experience of using the component components."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 The Labeling Approach", "text": "Assuming that we get an MDD representation of the solution space (u) or are repeatable, our approach to answering wCVD requests will be based on three steps: 1) restricting MDD wr. the latest user mapping, 2) labeling remaining nodes by executing shortest path algorithms, and 3) filtering expensive values by using node labels. We initialize MDD pruning by removing any edges e (u) that do not match the newest mapping, i.e. where var (u) = i and a 6 = ai.

There must be at least C (Sol) edges in the last layer, one for each feasible layer. Thus, if the bandwidth of the cost C (Sol) is exponential, so is the size of Mc. Moreover, even if an increase in the Mc edges could occur due to the resolution of nodal isomorphisms in previous layers, the size of Mc (SDD encoding) is not comparable."}, {"heading": "3.4.3 Semiring Costs and Probabilistic Queries", "text": "Note that our approach can be further generalized to reflect the more general aggregation of costs as discussed by Wilson (2005).

The calculated MDD property is p: r 1 e p c (e). The operator aggregates the marginal costs, while the operator aggregates the travel costs. In a semicircle, the global calculation can be efficiently performed by local node-based aggregations, much like a shortest path is calculated. Our framework is based on considerations of minimum cost paths that correspond to the use of A = (R +, 0, 1, min, +), but different mappings could be used.

Experimental Evaluation", "text": "We implemented our compilation scheme and algorithms for wCVD and 2-wCVD queries. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the applicability of our approach and confirm various hypotheses made during the essay. We used two sets of instances whose properties are shown in Table 1. The first set corresponds to real-world configuration problems available in the CLib2 configuration benchmark library. These are CSP models with configuration constraints. They correspond to highly structured configuration problems with a variety of similar solutions. The second set of instances represents product catalog datasets used by Nicholson, Bridge and Wilson (2006). These catalogs are explicitly defined as solution tables. They represent a much smaller and more economical set of solutions.2. http: / / www.itu.dk / research / exclterna / exclib"}, {"heading": "6.1 MDD Size", "text": "In the first experiments, we created a protocol-coded BDD B for each instance using CLab (Jensen, 2007), then extracted a corresponding MDD M from B. Finally, we extended long edges into M and fused isomorphic nodes to create a fused MDD M. We compare the sizes of B, M and M in Table 2. For each structure, we provide the number of V and edge E. In addition, we provide the size of BDD B. We conclude from the table that both BDDs and MDDs are exponentially smaller than the size of the solution space for configuration instances, while they are not so significantly smaller for more diverse product configuration catalogs. Furthermore, we can see that the number of edges in fused MDDs M \u00b2 is not significantly larger than the number of extracted MDDs M \u00b2 compared to the number of extracted MDDs M. Therefore, due to simpler algorithms online, it appears suitable to calculate the MDDs online."}, {"heading": "6.1.1 Encoding Cost Explicitly", "text": "In fact, we are able to go in search of a solution that enables us to find a solution that enables us to find a solution that enables us to find a solution and that enables us to find a solution that enables us to find a solution that enables us to find a solution, that enables us to find a solution that enables us to find a solution and that enables us to find a solution that enables us to find a solution that enables us to find a solution that enables us to find a solution that enables us to find a solution that enables us to find a solution that enables us to find a solution."}, {"heading": "7.

Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We guarantee polynomial time cost configuration when the cost function is additive and workable solutions are represented by multi-value decision diagrams. We process cost constraints via an MDD extracted from an underlying BDD. Therefore, we extend the BDD-based configuration by Hadzic et al. (2004) to support cost constraint of additive cost functions without causing exponential increases in complexity. Our implementation delivers runtimes that easily meet the interactive response time requirements. In addition, our approach can be extended to support for non-additive and semiring-based costs. We extend our approach by considering cost constraints. Multiple costs. We have proven that this is a NP-hard problem in the input of MDD quantities, even if we only process two linear inequalities with positive coefficients and Boolean variables."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their detailed comments that have helped us improve the work.

Weighted and Multi-Valued Knowledge Compilation Structures. Most of the compiled representations for propositional theories have valued counterparts. Many of them can be seen as special cases of valued NNFs (VNNF) (Fargier & Marquis, 2007). Roughly, every valued counterpart is obtained by changing the semantics of nodes, from logical operators (such as \u2227, \u2228) to general operators \u2297 (that could be arithmetic, such as + and \u2217). Values of functions represented by these structures are no longer in {0, 1} but in R. Furthermore, functions need not be defined over Boolean domains, but could take finite-domain values. In general, subsets of VNNF that satisfy decomposability and operator distributivity support efficient optimization (Fargier & Marquis, 2007) and could, in principle, be used to support cost configuration.

In such scenarios, offline compilation of feasible solutions into a tractable representation is an important approach to delivering efficient backtrack-free user interaction online. In particular, binary decision diagrams (BDDs) have been successfully used as a compilation target for product and service configuration. In this paper we discuss how to extend BDD-based configuration to scenarios involving cost functions which express user preferences. We first show that an efficient, robust and easy to implement extension is possible if the cost function is additive, and feasible solutions are represented using multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs). We also discuss the effect on MDD size if the cost function is non-additive or if it is encoded explicitly into MDD. We then discuss interactive configuration in the presence of multiple cost functions. We prove that even in its simplest form, multiple-cost configuration is NP-hard in the input MDD. However, for solving two-cost configuration we develop a pseudo-polynomial scheme and a fully polynomial approximation scheme. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated through experiments over real-world configuration models and product-catalogue datasets.
