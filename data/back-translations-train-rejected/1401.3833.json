Its power lies in its ability to use any available scheme that bounds the probability of evidence or posterior marginals and enhance its performance in an anytime manner. The scheme uses the cutset conditioning principle to tighten existing bounding schemes and to facilitate anytime behavior, utilizing a fixed number of cutset tuples. The accuracy of the bounds improves as the number of used cutset tuples increases and so does the computation time. We demonstrate empirically the value of our scheme for bounding posterior marginals and probability of evidence using a variant of the bound propagation algorithm as a plug-in scheme.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:50:19 GMT  (417kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3833v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["bozhena bidyuk", "rina dechter", "emma rollon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3833"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3833.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Active Tuples-based Scheme for Bounding Posterior Beliefs", "authors": ["Bozhena Bidyuk", "Rina Dechter", "Emma Rollon"], "emails": ["bbidyuk@google.com", "dechter@ics.uci.edu", "erollon@lsi.upc.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "This paper addresses the problem of limiting the probability of evidence and posterior marginals in Bayesian nets with discrete variables. Deriving boundaries at the back level with a given accuracy is clearly a NP-hard problem (Abdelbar & Hedetniemi, 1998; Dagum & Luby, 1993; Roth, 1996) and indeed most available approximation algorithms offer little or no guarantee of the quality of their approximations. Nevertheless, some approaches for limiting posterior marginals have been presented in recent years (Horvitz, Suermondt, & Cooper, 1989; Poole, 1996; Mannino & Mookerjee, 2002; Mooij & Kappen, 2008) and for limiting the probability of evidence (Dechter & Rish, 2003; Larkin, 2003; Leisink & Kappen, 2003).In this paper we are developing a framework that can accept any boundary scheme and improve its limitations in any way (Pearl, 1988)."}, {"heading": "2.

Similar to ATB, Pool's schema is based on a partial exploration of a search tree. However, its search tree corresponds to the state space across all variables of the entire network and the total number of variables it uses, it is exponential in the total number of variables.
