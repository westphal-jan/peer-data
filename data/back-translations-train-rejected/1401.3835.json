Moreover, like any other logical theory, action theories may also evolve, and thus knowledge engineers need revision methods to help in accommodating new incoming information about the behavior of actions in an adequate manner. The present work is about changing action domain descriptions in multimodal logic. Its contribution is threefold: first we revisit the semantics of action theory contraction proposed in previous work, giving more robust operators that express minimal change based on a notion of distance between Kripke-models. Second we give algorithms for syntactical action theory contraction and establish their correctness with respect to our semantics for those action theories that satisfy a principle of modularity investigated in previous work. Since modularity can be ensured for every action theory and, as we show here, needs to be computed at most once during the evolution of a domain description, it does not represent a limitation at all to the method here studied. Finally we state AGM-like postulates for action theory contraction and assess the behavior of our operators with respect to them. Moreover, we also address the revision counterpart of action theory change, showing that it benefits from our semantics for contraction.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:51:08 GMT  (588kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3835v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ivan jos\\'e varzinczak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3835"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3835.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On Action Theory Change", "authors": ["Ivan Jos\u00e9 Varzinczak"], "emails": ["ivan.varzinczak@meraka.org.za"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

This amounts to selecting from the models of euro those that come closest to models of euro and allowing them as models of the result. In contrast, for each model M, actualization methods select those models of euro that come closest to M from T.

Contrary to us, however, the minimality condition on the outcome of the update is in terms of inclusion of sets of laws, which means that the approach is more syntax oriented to some extent. In their setting, during an update an action theory T is seen as composed of two pieces, Tu and Tm, where Tu stands for the part of T that is not supposed to change and Tm contains the laws which may be modified. In our terms, when contracting a static law we would have Tm = S \u222a Xa; when contracting an executability law Tm = Xa; and when contracting effects laws Tm = E\u2212 a . The difference here is that in our approach it is always clear what laws should not change in a given type of contraction, and therefore Tu and Tm do not need to be explicitly specified prior to the update. Their approach and ours can both be described as constraint-based update, in that the theory change is carried out relative to some constraints (a set of laws that we want to hold in the result). In our framework, for example, all changes in the action laws are relative to the set of static laws S (and that is why we concentrate on models of T having val(S ) as worlds).

Its contribution is threefold: first we revisit the semantics of action theory contraction proposed in previous work, giving more robust operators that express minimal change based on a notion of distance between Kripke-models. Second we give algorithms for syntactical action theory contraction and establish their correctness with respect to our semantics for those action theories that satisfy a principle of modularity investigated in previous work. Since modularity can be ensured for every action theory and, as we show here, needs to be computed at most once during the evolution of a domain description, it does not represent a limitation at all to the method here studied.
