We focus on a particular change: the addition of a new argument which interacts with previous arguments. We study the impact of such an addition on the outcome of the argumentation system, more particularly on the set of its extensions. Several properties for this change operation are defined by comparing the new set of extensions to the initial one, these properties are called structural when the comparisons are based on set-cardinality or set-inclusion relations. Several other properties are proposed where comparisons are based on the status of some particular arguments: the accepted arguments; these properties refer to the evolution of this status during the change, e.g., Monotony and Priority to Recency. All these properties may be more or less desirable according to specific applications. They are studied under two particular semantics: the grounded and preferred semantics.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:52:08 GMT  (326kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3838v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["claudette cayrol", "florence dupin de saint-cyr", "marie-christine lagasquie-schiex"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3838"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3838.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Change in Abstract Argumentation Frameworks: Adding an Argument", "authors": ["Claudette Cayrol", "Florence Dupin de Saint-Cyr", "Marie-Christine Lagasquie-Schiex"], "emails": ["ccayrol@irit.fr", "bannay@irit.fr", "lagasq@irit.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Change in Argumentation", "text": "We introduce a formal definition of the change in the reasoning, which makes it possible to distinguish between four types of changes. Then, we define properties for a change in the reasoning. First, we consider the effects of a change on the structure of a series of extensions and examine how this structure is modified. This point of view leads to the definition of structural properties. Then, we consider the effects of a change on the set of arguments that are accepted. Finally, the connections between the two classes of properties are studied. Note that the definition for most of the properties we present is general in the sense that it can be applied to any kind of change. In Section 4 (where we specify conditions for satisfying these properties), we will focus on the specific case of adding an argument and its interactions."}, {"heading": "3.1 Definition", "text": "In this section we will give a definition of the change in reasoning. < A > The change may affect the set of arguments and / or the set of attacks between them. < A > The addition of only one interaction i0 between two existing arguments of A (X, Y) with X (A) and Y (A) is a modification operation defined by: < A, R > i0 = < A, R > i0 = < A, R \"i0\" > Removing only one existing interaction i0 from < A, R > Extension of: < R > Extension of arguments."}, {"heading": "3.2 Structural Properties", "text": "The structural properties presented in this section are based on the effects of the change on the structure of the set of extensions. Note that the definition for each property is general in the sense that the nature of the modification is not specified: it may consist of adding an interaction, removing an interaction, adding an argument and a series of interactions related to that argument, or removing an argument. However, for clarity reasons, each property in this section is presented with examples of the modification process. The reader will see some examples of the other modification operations in Appendix B.Let < A, R > is a reasoning framework and E is the set of extensions of < A > (under a given semantics s).

Obviously, it only affects the modification operation, and this results in a property called \"priority over novelty,\" which only makes sense for one type of change."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Monotony", "text": "Inspired by what has been done in the field of non-monotonous reasoning, we define a property of monotony if these arguments are accepted before changes are accepted. Since our goal is to define general properties, we do not make assumptions about the number of extensions, and we have to consider various cases for the acceptance of an argument (gullible or skeptical accepted). A monotony definition is simple under a semantic that only provides for an extension (such as grounded semantics). Following definition 6, an argument A is accepted (gullible or skeptical accepted) in < A, R > iff it belongs to the (unique) extension of G. In this particular case, monotony means that the extension of G is included. If there are multiple extensions, monotony can take different forms. A gullible form corresponds to the case in which each argument is creatively accepted by G."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Priority to Recency", "text": "Inspired by what has been done in the area of faith revision (see Alchourro \u0301 n, Ga \ufffd rdenfors, & Makinson, 1985), and the postulate regarding the priority of the new information, we define a property to indicate that the new argument will be accepted after a change. This property, called priority over novelty 8, is only useful for the HAI change process. 6. Credulous monotony is related to the known decision problem of credulous acceptance in the argumentation (see definition 6). 7. In Appendix B, the reader finds some examples illustrating the property of monotony for the other change processes. 8. This property is not a characteristic postulate in the sense of the AGM; it was inspired precisely by the \"success\" postulate proposed by Alchourro \u00c9n et al.

Characterizing Argument Addition under Grounded or Preferred", "text": "Semantics In this section, we focus on the change, that is, the addition of exactly one argument Z that interacts with at least one argument that belongs to A. In fact, the addition of an argument that can interact with existing semantics is a very common type of change in real situations. Moreover, this type of change is sufficiently complex to provide a comprehensive analysis of properties and outcomes. In addition, we consider the change that is related to existing semantics and preferred semantics. We chose these two semantics because they are the most well-known traditional semantics for which the existence of extensions is guaranteed. Our goal is to determine conditions under which a given property will be satisfied for a change operation. These conditions concern the additional argument and associated interactions, and may depend on semantics. Probably, some properties seem more desirable than others, depending on the context. For example, a decided change operation will reduce ignorance, since each one of the changes allows, and each one is interesting to determine before the change."}, {"heading": "4.1 Argument Addition under the Grounded Semantics", "text": "The following results exist, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, if the grounded semantics, the changed semantics, the changed semantics, the changed seanalogues, the changed semantics, the changed seanalogues, the changed seanalogs, the changed seanalogs, the changed seanalogs, the seanalogs, the changed seanalogs, the seanalogs, the grounded seanalogs, the grounded seanalogues, the grounded seanalogs, the grounded seanalogs, the grounded seanalogs, the grounded seanalogs, the grounded seanalogs, the grounded seanalogs, the grounded seanalogs, the grounded seanalogs, the grounded seanalogs, the grounded seanalogs, the grounded seantics, the grounded seanalogs,"}, {"heading": "4.2 Argument Addition under the Preferred Semantics", "text": "In preferred semantics, there is always at least one extension.

Argumentation is basically concerned with the exchange of interacting arguments. This set of arguments may come either from a dialogue between several agents but also from the available (and possibly contradictory) pieces of information at the disposal of one unique agent. Usually, the interaction between arguments takes the form of a conflict, called attack. For example, a logical argument can be a pair \u3008set of assumptions, conclusion\u3009, where the set of assumptions entails the conclusion according to some logical inference schema. A conflict occurs, for instance, when the conclusion of an argument contradicts an assumption of another argument. The main issue for any argumentation system is the selection of acceptable sets of arguments, called \u201cextensions\u201d, based on the way arguments interact (intuitively, an acceptable set of arguments must be in some sense coherent and strong enough, e.g., able to defend itself against all attacking arguments). So, the outcome of an argumentation system is often defined by the set of its extensions but, depending on the applications, it may be also defined as the set of arguments that belongs to every extension.
