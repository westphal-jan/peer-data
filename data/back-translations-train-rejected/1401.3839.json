Its core feature is the use of a pseudo-heuristic derived from landmarks, propositional formulas that must be true in every solution of a planning task. LAMA builds on the Fast Downward planning system, using finite-domain rather than binary state variables and multi-heuristic search. The latter is employed to combine the landmark heuristic with a variant of the well-known FF heuristic. Both heuristics are cost-sensitive, focusing on high-quality solutions in the case where actions have non-uniform cost. A weighted A* search is used with iteratively decreasing weights, so that the planner continues to search for plans of better quality until the search is terminated. LAMA showed best performance among all planners in the sequential satisficing track of the International Planning Competition 2008. In this paper we present the system in detail and investigate which features of LAMA are crucial for its performance. We present individual results for some of the domains used at the competition, demonstrating good and bad cases for the techniques implemented in LAMA. Overall, we find that using landmarks improves performance, whereas the incorporation of action costs into the heuristic estimators proves not to be beneficial. We show that in some domains a search that ignores cost solves far more problems, raising the question of how to deal with action costs more effectively in the future. The iterated weighted A* search greatly improves results, and shows synergy effects with the use of landmarks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:52:55 GMT  (341kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3839v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["silvia richter", "matthias westphal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3839"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3839.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "The LAMA Planner: Guiding Cost-Based Anytime Planning with Landmarks", "authors": ["Silvia Richter", "Matthias Westphal"], "emails": ["silvia.richter@nicta.com.au", "westpham@informatik.uni-freiburg.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The use of pseudo-heuristics derived from boundary stones, propositional formulas that must apply to any solution to a planning task.

Introduction", "text": "In the last decade, the LAMA Planning System has been the youngest member in this series. It is the dominant approach to domain-independent satisfaction planning 3rd downhill system. Starting with the additive heuristic system of Bonet and Geffner (2001), implemented in the HSP Planning System, much research has been conducted in search of heuristic estimators that are efficient to guide the search towards a target state. The FF Planning System of heuristic measures of Hoffmann and Nebel (2001), based on a heuristic estimator, based on relaxed planning graphics, has shown the best performance among all fully automated systems at the International Planning Competition in 2000, and continues to be state of the art today. Ever, heuristic-search approaches have played a prominent role in classical or sequential satisfaction of traces of the biennial competition (Helmert, 2006), winning 2004 and SGPlan International (Chen 2006, which is the most recent member in this LAMA, Wsu, 2006)."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "It is based on the SAS + planning model (Ba \ufffd ckstro \ufffd m & Nebel, 1995), but expands it with conditional effects. While LAMA also treats axioms in the same way as Fast Down (Helmert, 2006), we are unable to formalize axioms here because they are not important for our purposes. Definition 1. Planning tasks in finite domain representation (FDR tasks) A planning task in finite domain representation (FDR task) is given by a 5-tuple < V, s0, C > with the following components: \u2022 V is a finite set of state variables, each with a related finite DomainDv. A fact is a pair < v > (also written v > d), where V and DD are partially variable."}, {"heading": "3. System Architecture", "text": "LAMA builds on the Fast Downward system (Helmert, 2006) and takes over the overall structure and large parts of the functionality from this planner. LAMA, like Fast Downward, accepts input in the PDDL2.2 Level 1 format (Fox & Long, 2003; Edelkamp & Hoffmann, 2004), including ADL conditions and effects and derivative predicates (Axioms). LAMA has also been expanded to cover the action costs introduced for IPC 2008 (Helmert, Do, & Refanidis, 2008). Like Fast Downward, LAMA consists of three separate components: \u2022 the Translation module \u2022 the Knowledge Compilation module \u2022 the Search module These components are implemented as separate programs that are called one after the other. Below, we give a brief description of the translation and knowledge compilation modules. The most important changes in LAMA compared to Fast Downward are implemented in the search module, which we discuss in detail."}, {"heading": "3.1 Translation", "text": "The main components of the translator are an efficient grounding algorithm for instantiating schematic operators and axioms, and an invariant synthesis algorithm for determining mutually exclusive facts. Consequently, groups of facts are replaced by a single state variable, fulfilling the fact (if any) of the group in a given world state. Details of this component can be found in a recent article by Helmert (2009). The groups of mutually exclusive facts (mutexes) found during translation are later used to determine orders between landmarks. Therefore, LAMA does not use the end domain-like representations offered at IPC 2008 (object flows), but performs its own translation from binary to end domain-like variables."}, {"heading": "3.2 Knowledge Compilation", "text": "Using the finite domain representation generated by the translator, the Knowledge Compilation module is responsible for building a set of data structures that play a central role in the subsequent generation and search of milestones. First, domain transformation graphs (see Definition 2) are created that encode the way each state variable can change its value through operator applications and axioms. In addition, data structures are constructed to efficiently determine the number of applicable operators in a state and to evaluate the values of derived state variables."}, {"heading": "3.3 Search", "text": "This year's search module is responsible for actual planning. Two heuristic search algorithms are implemented in LAMA: (a) a greedy best-first search aimed at finding a solution as quickly as possible, and (b) a weighted queue that allows a balance between speed and solution quality. However, both algorithms are variations of standard textbook methods that use open and closed lists. Greedy best-first search always extends a state with minimal heuristic value h among all open states and never extends a state more than once. To promote cost-effective plans, it breaks ties between equally promising states by favoring those states that are reached by cheaper operators. e, taking into account the last operator on the path to the state under consideration in the search space. (The cost of the entire path could only be used at the expense of increased time or space requirements, so we do not consider this.) Weighted Search (Minimal search, a state associated with a state and a cost 1970 minimum)."}, {"heading": "4. Landmarks", "text": "They were first introduced by Porteous, Sebastia and Hoffmann (2001) and later studied in more detail by the same authors (Hoffmann, Porteous, & Sebastia, 2004).The use of milestones for orientation in the search for a solution in planning is an intuitive approach that humans could take. Consider the well-known benchmark domain of logistics, where the goal is to deliver objects (e.g. boxes) between different locations with a fleet of vehicles. Cities consist of places where trucks can transport boxes within the city, while planes must be deployed between cities. An example of logistics task is shown in Figure 2. Probably, the first mental step a human would perform when trying to solve the task in Figure 2 is to recognize that the box must be transported between the two cities, from the left city (Locations A-D) to the right city (Location E), and that the box must be transported in the plane."}, {"heading": "4.1 Definitions", "text": "However, it should be noted that LAMA currently only supports the actual landmarks and distributions of facts (for more details, see Section 4.2). Hoffmann et al. show that it is PSPACE-hard to determine whether a given fact is a landmark, and whether a given fact holds between two landmarks. Their complexity leads to a more direct case of propositional formulas, so we do not repeat the propositional formulas. Landmarks Let it 3: Landmarks Let it is a landmark, so we do not repeat the propositional formulas. Landmark Let it = < V = < V, s0 s, C > be a planning task in finite-domain."}, {"heading": "4.2 Extracting Landmarks and Orderings", "text": "As mentioned above, deciding whether a given formula is a milestone and a decision between the boundaries is a method we use to solve detailed problems; practical methods for finding boundaries are incomplete (they cannot locate a particular boundary or order) or unsound (they can incorrectly declare a formula as a boundary or specify an incorrect order); several polynomial methods have been proposed to locate the actual boundary or disjunctive boundaries, such as feedback from the objectives of the task based on criteria that apply a relaxed planning graph (2001; Hoffmann et al., 2004; Porteous & Cresswell, 2002); and forward-looking propagation in the planning graph (Zhu & Givan, 2003).The algorithm used in LAMA to search for boundary or boundary stones to match the domains already mentioned above is partially based on the domains."}, {"heading": "4.3 Related Work", "text": "The proposed method for finding boundary stones, which was subsequently expanded by Porteous and Cresswell (2002), is very closely related to ours. A method for finding and using boundary stones on which the three boundaries are based is a generalization of target stones that have often been used in planning and searching in the past. In particular, the approach of Irani and Cheng (Irani & Cheng, 1987; Cheng & Irani, 1989) is a pre-processing method like ours that analyzes the planning task to extract necessary orders between targets, which are then imposed on the search algorithm. An objective A is placed before a goal B in this approach, if in any plan A is necessarily introduced before B. Koehler and Hoffmann (2000) to introduce reasonable orders for target stations, and al. (2004), in an article detailing previous work by Porteous et al. (2001), we present the idea of boundary stones, reasonable and necessary ones."}, {"heading": "5. The Landmark Heuristic", "text": "The LAMA Planning System uses landmarks to calculate heuristic estimates. Since we know that all landmarks must be achieved in order to achieve a goal, we can approach the target distance of a state that is reached by a path (i.e., a sequence of landmarks). < b > Landmarks that have yet to be achieved in order to achieve a goal, we will include all landmarks (i.e., a sequence of landmarks that still have to be reached before the landmarks have to be reached). These landmarks are given by the landmarks, and the landmarks that are not yet reached are accepted by the landmarks, and the landmarks that are not accepted by the landmarks that are accepted again, with the following definitions based on a particular landmark chart (L, O): Accepted are all landmarks that are accepted."}, {"heading": "7.

(Iterative search reduces the gap, but does not completely close it.) The domain models the vulnerabilities of computer networks against insider attacks (Boddy, Gohde, Haigh, & Harp, 2005). The task is to gain access to sensitive information through the use of various malware programs or physical access to computers in offices. Action costs model the likelihood of the attack failing, i.e. the risk of being exposed. Many actions in the attacker's office, such as using the computer, do not incur any cost, while entering other offices is prohibitively expensive and direct instruction from people to install certain software has very high associated costs. In particular, action costs are used to model the desire for different methods of attack for the same configuration."}, {"heading": "7.5 Openstacks", "text": "The problem is to order the products so that the maximum number of stacks is always open. While it is easy to find a solution to this problem (every product order is a solution where n stacks require the number of orders), the search for an optimal solution is the optimal order of magnitude of the costs. (Fink & Voss, 1999; Gerevini, Haslum, Long, Saetti, & Dimopoulos, 2009) While the task is to minimize the required storage space in a production plant, the manufacturer receives a series of orders, each comprising a number of products. Only one product can be produced simultaneously, and the manufacturer will always produce the entire required quantity of a product (across all orders) before starting production of another product. The problem is to order the products so that the maximum number of stacks is always open. While it is easy to find a solution to this problem (every product order is a solution that requires n stacks)."}, {"heading": "7.6 Domains from Previous Competitions", "text": "The results of the study show that the aforementioned configurations are real covers that can be found in both the current and future versions. In particular, it is about real covers that essentially result from the competitive situation. In particular, it is about real covers that essentially result from the competitive situation.

However, the joint use of the FF heuristic and the landmark heuristic in a multi-heuristic search improved the performance of a planning system, compared with only using the FF heuristic. This is thus the path LAMA follows. The FF heuristic is based on a relaxation of the planning task that ignores delete effects, which in FDR tasks translates to allowing state variables to hold several values simultaneously. The FF heuristic for a state s is computed in two phases: the first phase, or forward phase, calculates an estimate for each fact in the planning task of how costly it is to achieve the fact from s in a relaxed task. Concurrently, it selects an operator called best support for each fact F, which is a greedy approximation of a cheapest achiever (an achiever a of F where the costs of making a applicable and applying it are minimal among all achievers of F, when starting in s). In the second phase, a plan for the relaxed task is constructed based on the best supports for each fact. This is done by chaining backwards from the goals, selecting the best supports of the goals, and then recursively selecting the best supports for the preconditions of already selected operators. The union of these best supports then constitutes the relaxed plan (i. e., for each fact its best support is only added to the relaxed plan once, even if the fact is needed several times as a precondition). The length of the resulting relaxed plan is the heuristic estimate reported for s. The forward phase can be viewed as propagating cost information for operators and facts in a relaxed planning graph (Hoffmann & Nebel, 2001). However, this graph does not need to be explicitly constructed to compute the heuristic. Instead, a form of generalised Dijkstra cheapestpath algorithm as described by Liu, Koenig and Furcy (2002) is used in LAMA, which propagates costs from preconditions to applicable operators and from operators to effects.", "startOffset": 49, "endOffset": 2022}, {"referenceID": 27, "context": "Independently of us, Keyder and Geffner (2008) implemented the FF/add heuristic which they call ha in their planner FF(ha) at IPC 2008.", "startOffset": 21, "endOffset": 47}, {"referenceID": 39, "context": "The effect of landmarks in classical planning tasks without actions costs has been studied in previous work (Richter et al., 2008), but we provide summarising results for this case, using the domains of IPCs 1998\u20132006, in Section 7.", "startOffset": 108, "endOffset": 130}, {"referenceID": 31, "context": "and Geffner (2008) and the C3 planner by Lipovetzky and Geffner (2009).

The latter is employed to combine the landmark heuristic with a variant of the well-known FF heuristic. Both heuristics are cost-sensitive, focusing on high-quality solutions in the case where actions have non-uniform cost.

We present individual results for some of the domains used at the competition, demonstrating good and bad cases for the techniques implemented in LAMA. Overall, we find that using landmarks improves performance, whereas the incorporation of action costs into the heuristic estimators proves not to be beneficial. We show that in some domains a search that ignores cost solves far more problems, raising the question of how to deal with action costs more effectively in the future.
