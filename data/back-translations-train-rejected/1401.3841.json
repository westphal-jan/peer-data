Consequently, computational systems that can reason about narrative can be more effective communicators, entertainers, educators, and trainers. One of the central challenges in computational narrative reasoning is narrative generation, the automated creation of meaningful event sequences. There are many factors -- logical and aesthetic -- that contribute to the success of a narrative artifact. Central to this success is its understandability. We argue that the following two attributes of narratives are universal: (a) the logical causal progression of plot, and (b) character believability. Character believability is the perception by the audience that the actions performed by characters do not negatively impact the audiences suspension of disbelief. Specifically, characters must be perceived by the audience to be intentional agents. In this article, we explore the use of refinement search as a technique for solving the narrative generation problem -- to find a sound and believable sequence of character actions that transforms an initial world state into a world state in which goal propositions hold. We describe a novel refinement search planning algorithm -- the Intent-based Partial Order Causal Link (IPOCL) planner -- that, in addition to creating causally sound plot progression, reasons about character intentionality by identifying possible character goals that explain their actions and creating plan structures that explain why those characters commit to their goals. We present the results of an empirical evaluation that demonstrates that narrative plans generated by the IPOCL algorithm support audience comprehension of character intentions better than plans generated by conventional partial-order planners.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:54:07 GMT  (647kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3841v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mark owen riedl", "robert michael young"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3841"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3841.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Narrative Planning: Balancing Plot and Character", "authors": ["Mark O.

In particular, a narrative is a sequence of events that describes how the world changes over time. In a Fabula, a change is triggered by the intentional actions of the characters, although the world of history can also be changed by unintentional actions such as accidents and forces of nature. Likewise, a Plan is a series of ordered operators that transform a world from one state to another state. If the operators of a Plan are events, a Plan can be a model for a Fabula. Partially ordered Plans allow to remain indefinite when their relative execution order does not matter. Indeed, the semantics of the Plan and the capabilities of the Plan Execution Engine can perform operations in a Fabula."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 Challenges of Planning as a Computational Model of Narrative Generation", "text": "This year, only once in history will there be such an event."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Intentionality in Character Believability", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own, without being able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "3.

From the character's perspective, all actions should be (or happen) intentional; that is, for each character's goal, part of the action is described in the complete Fabulaplan to achieve the character's goal. We formulate this as follows: Definition 3 (Frame of Comment): A framework of engagement is a tuple, < S \u2032 S \u2032, sf >, just as the actions describe the action is, so S \u2032 S \u2032 is an appropriate subset of\" steps. \""}, {"heading": "4.3 Integrating Intentionality into Least-Commitment Planning", "text": "The framework of engagement is the product of a process in which the planner reviews the intentionality of character actions and, if necessary, revises the plan. IPOCL uses as a refinement search process an iterative, least binding process to identify errors in a plan and to revise the plan to repair the errors. This creates a tree-like search space in which we define three additional types of errors: Definition 7 (Open Motivation Error) or incomplete plans that cannot be repaired. Internal nodes are incomplete plans that have one or more errors. In addition to the open conditions and causal threat deficiencies that we have adopted from POCL, we define three additional types of errors: Definition 7 (Open Motivation Error): An open motivation error in Plan P is a tuple, < c, p > so that c is a framework of engagement in P and p is the sentence intended (a) so that it intends the character (a)."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 Causal Planning in IPOCL", "text": "The causal planning part of the IPOCL algorithm implements the conventional POCL algorithm with the addition of a framework of the obligation discovery phase. < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < \";\"; \"; < <\"; < \";\"; < < \";\"; \"; < < < <\"; < < \"; <\"; < < \"; < < < < < <\"; < < \";\"; < < < \"; < < <\"; < < < \"; < < <\"; < \";\"; \"; < <\"; < \"; < < <\"; < \"; <\";"}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Motivation Planning in IPOCL", "text": "The part of the motivation planning of the IPOCL algorithm is responsible for motivating characters in the story world. A motivational step is a plan step in which one of its effects causes a character to commit to a goal. Repairing an open motivation error is not to find a plan step with effect deterministically that intends (a, ga) - either by selecting an existing plan or by instantiating an action plan and explicitly arranging that step before the planning steps that are part of the commitment framework. Motivation planning is similar to causal planning, except that it does not establish a causal link between two planning steps, but a motivational link between a motivational step and a framework of commitment. Furthermore, the motivational step for a framework of commitment is explicitly arranged before all other steps within the scope of intentionality. In the work presented here, a character agent cannot begin pursuing a character goal before he has committed to the goal and includes the motivation phase."}, {"heading": "4.3.3 Intent Planning in IPOCL", "text": "Dre rf\u00fc ide eeisrVnlrteeeeeeteeteeteerrrrrr rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide eeisrsrteeeeoiiiiiiiiiueetnlrsrrrrrrrrrrrrgteeeoiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuirrrrteeoioioioioioioioioioirrrrrrrrrteeteeteeteeteeteeteeteerteeteeteerrrrrrrrrrrteeoioioioioillllllrlrlrrlrrrlrlrrrlrrlrteeteeteeteeteeteeteeteerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrllrlrrlrlrlrlrrlrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"}, {"heading": "4.4 An Example", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to a different world in which they are able to escape than to another world in which they are able to escape."}, {"heading": "4.5 Complexity of the IPOCL Algorithm", "text": "The reason for this is that most of them are not able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

QUEST knowledge structures can be visually represented as directed graphs with nodes referring either to story events (typically character actions) or character goals. Correct links capture the relationship between event nodes in relation to causality and the relationship between event nodes and character goals in relation to intentionality. The cognitive representation of a reader's story is queried when the reader answers questions about the story.

ProtoPropp encodes examples of Russian folktales from Propp (1968) and functions based on regularities about folktales identified by Propp into an ontology from which new folktales are created by retrieving, adapting, and reusing parts of old folktales.

Consequently, computational systems that can reason about narrative can be more effective communicators, entertainers, educators, and trainers. One of the central challenges in computational narrative reasoning is narrative generation, the automated creation of meaningful event sequences. There are many factors \u2013 logical and aesthetic \u2013 that contribute to the success of a narrative artifact. Central to this success is its understandability. We argue that the following two attributes of narratives are universal: (a) the logical causal progression of plot, and (b) character believability. Character believability is the perception by the audience that the actions performed by characters do not negatively impact the audience\u2019s suspension of disbelief. Specifically, characters must be perceived by the audience to be intentional agents. In this article, we explore the use of refinement search as a technique for solving the narrative generation problem \u2013 to find a sound and believable sequence of character actions that transforms an initial world state into a world state in which goal propositions hold. We describe a novel refinement search planning algorithm \u2013 the Intent-based Partial Order Causal Link (IPOCL) planner \u2013 that, in addition to creating causally sound plot progression, reasons about character intentionality by identifying possible character goals that explain their actions and creating plan structures that explain why those characters commit to their goals. We present the results of an empirical evaluation that demonstrates that narrative plans generated by the IPOCL algorithm support audience comprehension of character intentions better than plans generated by conventional partial-order planners.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
