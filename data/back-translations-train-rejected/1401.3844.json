Experimental Design", "text": "The main idea behind GAI auctions is to improve efficiency over auctions where additivity is assumed when preferences are not additive. However, the theoretical efficiency guarantee of GAI auctions depends (when set \") on e, the connectivity parameter of the GAI tree. This suggests a trade-off: complex models represent the true benefit more accurately, but can increase approximation errors due to higher connectivity. An obvious question is whether more accurate preference modeling is actually more efficient, and in particular whether GAI auctions are more efficient than addictive auctions, since the preferences are not addictive. To answer the question experimentally, we assume that the buyer's preferences have a certain GAI structure and compare the performance of GAI auctions that model this structure with the performance of auctions that are limited to addictive representation.

We are not aware of a better strategy, but do not rule out the possibility that an existence exists. A natural approach to generating a linear approximation is to provide an arbitrary function ub (\u00b7) to use linear regression. We define an indicator that is variable, which provides the possibility of considering a value of an assignment as a data point.

We tested the number of rounds required by GAI and AP auctions under completely random and FOPI preferences, varying three of the parameters: the size of the largest GAI element), e (connectivity) and \u03b4.The complexity in terms of the number of rounds is shown in Figure 4a (in relation to Figure 4b) and Figure 4b (in relation to the number of elements).We observe that under FOPI the GAI auction takes much longer, compared to the case of random preferences.

Therefore, another experimental question is whether this mechanism significantly reduces the total amount of information disclosed by the purchaser. PK investigates information that both the purchaser and the seller disclose under an additivity assumption. If the utility function is additive, the amount of information disclosed can be measured in relation to the limitations of linear weight distribution. Sellers can infer the weight proportions of the purchaser, and the amount of information hidden from them is represented by the fraction of the simplicity that meets these limitations. This simple analysis is not possible for GAI companies. We propose an alternative that is geared to the type of information disclosed by the GAI auctions."}, {"heading": "9. Conclusions", "text": "We propose a novel exploitation of the preference structure of GAI auctions, where GAI representation can be constructed from relatively simple statements about willingness to pay, and develop an iterative auction mechanism based directly on decomposition. Our auction mechanism generalizes the preference modeling used by Parkes and Kalagnanam (2005), while essentially retaining their information explanatory properties. It allows for a number of trade-offs between the accuracy of the preference representation and the computational complexity of the auction, as well as the trade-off between purchaser information disclosure and the number of rounds required for convergence. We conducted a simulation study of our proposed multi-attribute auctions, compared to a mechanism that presupposes additive preferences. The study validated the usefulness of GAI auctions when preferences are not additive, but GAI significant, and we allowed the overall efficiency classes for the efficiency."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partially supported by NSF grants IIS-0205435 and IIS-0414710 and the STIET program under NSF-IGERT grant 0114368.
