Conjunctive queries, the standard query language in databases, have recently gained significant attention as an expressive formalism for querying Description Logic knowledge bases. Several different techniques for deciding conjunctive query entailment are available for a wide range of DLs. Nevertheless, the combination of nominals, inverse roles, and number restrictions in OWL 1 and OWL 2 DL causes unsolvable problems for the techniques hitherto available. We tackle this problem and present a decidability result for entailment of unions of conjunctive queries in the DL ALCHOIQb that contains all three problematic constructors simultaneously. Provided that queries contain only simple roles, our result also shows decidability of entailment of (unions of) conjunctive queries in the logic that underpins OWL 1 DL and we believe that the presented results will pave the way for further progress towards conjunctive query entailment decision procedures for the Description Logics underlying the OWL standards.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:58:22 GMT  (461kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3849v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["sebastian rudolph", "birte glimm"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3849"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3849.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Nominals, Inverses, Counting, and Conjunctive Queries or: Why Infinity is your Friend!", "authors": ["Sebastian Rudolph", "Birte Glimm"], "emails": ["rudolph@kit.edu", "birte.glimm@comlab.ox.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Conjunctive query is already present in the relatively weak DL ALCI (Lutz, 2008), which was initially attributed to inverse roles."}, {"heading": "1.2 Contributions and Overview", "text": "In view of all these results, which show a great interest in the problem of the cyclical survey."}, {"heading": "2. The Big Picture", "text": "Before going into the technical details, we will describe our general line of reasoning that defines the decideability of conjunctural query results in ALCHOIQb."}, {"heading": "2.1 Decidability via Finitely Representable Countermodels", "text": "Let K be an ALCHOIQb knowledge base and let q be the subjunctive query in question, i.e. we aim to determine whether K | = q.Sure, since ALCHOIQb is a fragment of first-order predicate logic with equality, K can be translated into a FOL sentence FOL (K). Likewise, we find that a FOL sentence FOL (q) forq is only an existentially quantified formula. Therefore, the consequences of a finite FOL theory can be recursively enumerated, which provides us with a procedure that ends when K | = q. Therefore, we can establish decisiveness by providing another algorithm that terminates the equalization above - i.e., if there is a word called so that we can build a counter-model for any word."}, {"heading": "2.2 Finite Representability by Bounding Nominals and Blocking", "text": "We will now outline how we will show that there is always an infinitely representable counter-model, if there is one at all. We do this by taking any counter-model and carefully transforming it into an infinitely representable counter-model. Cautiously, this means that we must ensure that the transformation preserves the two properties that 1) are a model of the underlying knowledge base K and 2) are not the eligible query q. The result of the total transformation will be a regular model, i.e. a structure in which substructures are periodically repeated in a certain sense. In DL theory, it is common practice to construct this type of model from arbitrary by blocking techniques, recognizing certain element configurations that occur twice in the original model and generating the new model by endlessly stringing together the same sub-structure that is limited by these two configurations. In the case we are looking at, this technique cannot be applied directly to the original counter-model."}, {"heading": "2.3 Bounding Nominals by Transformations of Forest Quasi-Models", "text": "Returning to this concession, they have a real forest structure that is easier to handle and manipulate. We use two techniques to turn \"real\" models into quasi-models and vice versa: A model can be unraveled and yields a quasi-forest model. A quasi-forest model can be broken down to obtain a \"real\" model. Both techniques retain certain structural characteristics. Our strategy to construct a counter-model with an endless number of nominals consists of the following three steps: \u2022 Take an arbitrary counter-model and unravel it. \u2022 Transform the obtained quasi-model by replacing critical parts with well-preserved ones \u2022 Collapse the obtained structure into a (proper) model. The mentioned \"critical parts\" are those that lead to new denominations. They must - at least to a large extent - be avoided."}, {"heading": "3.

(However, this is only possible if the knowledge base is replaced by ALCOIFb knowledge bases.) Nevertheless, we also consider our results to be SHOIFb knowledge and queries with only simple roles in the query and ALCHOIQb knowledge bases, i.e. if the knowledge base contains secure Boolean role expressions, but no transitivity. Restricting to ALCOIFb knowledge is without loss of generality, as we show now.Provided the query contains only simple roles, we can use the elimination techniques for transitivity (Kazakov & Motik, 2008) to reduce a SHOIQ knowledge base to anALCHOIQ knowledge with extended signature."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Connected and Constant-free Queries", "text": "We assume that questions are connected.

Subscripts and superscripts may be appended. Unless otherwise specified, we use q (possibly with subscriptions) for a connected Boolean subjunctive query, K for a simplified ALCOIFb knowledge base, I for an interpretation (\u0445 I, \u00b7 I), and \u03c0, \u00b5 for ratings."}, {"heading": "4. Model Construction", "text": "However, the main idea of a forest is very weak, as we also allow arbitrary relationships between tree elements and roots. Without such relationships, we call the result a strict forest form. We do not exploit the beautiful characteristics of trees and forests in the following sections, when we replace parts in interpretations that lead to an infinite number of new denominations. Since even models of an ALCOIFb knowledge base that have a kind of forest shape are not really forests, we also present \"approximations\" of models in which nominations are no longer interpreted as singleton sets. We call these structures quasi-interpretations or such interpretations may take the form of real forests. Furthermore, we offer a way of \"unraveling\" an arbitrary model into a forest that is a quasi-model for the knowledge base and a kind of \"collapse\" of such forest models back into real models of the knowledge base."}, {"heading": "5. Quasi-Entailment in Quasi-Models", "text": "In this section, we will make a characterization of the forests, which means a certain selection for the corresponding \"proper models.\" In our further argument, we will talk about the initial part of a tree, that is, the part that remains when the branches are reduced to a specified length. The following problem ensures that in the case of purified models, we only find endless inextricable trees of depth that \"look different.\" Let K be a consistent knowledge base. Then, there is a purified interpretation, which I interpret to mean that I and, for each n, there are only infinite non-isomorphic trees of depth."}, {"heading": "6. Limits and Forest Transformations", "text": "Before challenging the following constructions, we will attempt to provide some high-level explanations to convey the intuition behind the steps that follow. As already mentioned, one of the main obstacles to a conjunctive query decision process is that it can be identified by linking it to a \"correct nominal system.\" However, we will show that for any model of a knowledge base that does not satisfy a conjunctive query (i.e., for each countermodel there is a \"nice\" countermodel with only an infinite number of new denominations (in the following section, we will argue that this ensures the existence of a process that does not question the query through the knowledge base)."}, {"heading": "7. Finite Representations of Models", "text": "In this section, we will show how to construct a finite representation of a forest model into an expanded knowledge base that only has a finite number of roots. We will then show that these finite representations can be used to verify the effects of cultivation. To do this, we will use a technique that is very similar to the blocking techniques used in our forest models (see, for example, Horrocks & Sattler, 2007).A tableau algorithm builds a so-called completion graph that represents a finite representation of a model. A completion diagram has essentially the same structure as our forest quasimodels. It contains root nodes for the nominal use of the knowledge employed plus additional root nodes for new denominations that begin BCPs. Each (new and old) nominal is the root of a tree, and relationships occur only between direct neighbors within a tree, between elements within a tree and a root, or between roots."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions", "text": "We have shown that the problem can be resolved by providing a decision-making process and demonstrating its correctness. As the approach is purely a decision-making process, the arithmetic complexity of the problem remains open. Our finding also shows that the decision-making ability of conjunctive query mergers in SHOIQ and SROIQ (underlying OWL DL and OWL 2), if we do not reject simple roles as binary queries, has reached a first important milestone towards addressing the problem of conjunctive queries for OWL 1 DL and OWL 2."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "During his stay in Oxford, where our collaboration began, Sebastian Rudolph was supported by a scholarship of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

Conjunctive query entailment in EL is, however, not tractable as the complexity increases to coNP-complete (Rosati, 2007b). Moreover for EL++ (Baader et al., 2005), a still tractable extension of EL, query entailment is even undecidable (Kr\u00f6tzsch, Rudolph, & Hitzler, 2007). This is mainly because in EL++, one can use unrestricted role compositions. This allows for encoding context-free languages, and conjunctive queries can then be used to check the intersection of such languages, which is known to be an undecidable problem. Since the logics used in databases with incomplete information are considerable less expressive than ALCHOIQb, the techniques developed in that area do not transfer to our setting. Given that query entailment is a (computationally) harder task than, for example, knowledge base satisfiability, it is not very surprising that decidability of the latter task does not necessarily transfer to the problem of CQ entailment. Most of the undecidability results can be transferred from FOL since many DLs can directly be translated into an equivalent FOL theory. For example, it is known that conjunctive query entailment is undecidable in the two variable fragment of First-Order Logic L2 (Rosati, 2007a), and Rosati identifies a relatively small set of constructors that cause the undecidability (most notably role negation axioms, i.e., axioms of the form \u2200x, y (\u00acR(x, y)\u2192 P (x, y)) for R,P binary predicates).

Conjunctive queries, the standard query language in databases, have recently gained significant attention as an expressive formalism for querying Description Logic knowledge bases. Several different techniques for deciding conjunctive query entailment are available for a wide range of DLs. Nevertheless, the combination of nominals, inverse roles, and number restrictions in OWL 1 and OWL 2 DL causes unsolvable problems for the techniques hitherto available. We tackle this problem and present a decidability result for entailment of unions of conjunctive queries in the DL ALCHOIQb that contains all three problematic constructors simultaneously. Provided that queries contain only simple roles, our result also shows decidability of entailment of (unions of) conjunctive queries in the logic that underpins OWL 1 DL and we believe that the presented results will pave the way for further progress towards conjunctive query entailment decision procedures for the Description Logics underlying the OWL standards.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
