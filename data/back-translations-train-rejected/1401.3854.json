The research reported in this paper is a contribution to building a general purpose DR system as an extension to a SOAR-like problem solving architecture. The work is in a framework in which DR is modeled as a process where subtasks are solved, as appropriate, either by inference from symbolic representations or by interaction with a diagram, i.e., perceiving specified information from a diagram or modifying/creating objects in a diagram in specified ways according to problem solving needs. The perceptions and actions in most DR systems built so far are hand-coded for the specific application, even when the rest of the system is built using the general architecture. The absence of a general framework for executing perceptions/actions poses as a major hindrance to using them opportunistically -- the essence of open-ended search in problem solving. Our goal is to develop a framework for executing a wide variety of specified perceptions and actions across tasks/domains without human intervention. We observe that the domain/task-specific visual perceptions/actions can be transformed into domain/task-independent spatial problems. We specify a spatial problem as a quantified constraint satisfaction problem in the real domain using an open-ended vocabulary of properties, relations and actions involving three kinds of diagrammatic objects -- points, curves, regions. Solving a spatial problem from this specification requires computing the equivalent simplified quantifier-free expression, the complexity of which is inherently doubly exponential. We represent objects as configuration of simple elements to facilitate decomposition of complex problems into simpler and similar subproblems. We show that, if the symbolic solution to a subproblem can be expressed concisely, quantifiers can be eliminated from spatial problems in low-order polynomial time using similar previously solved subproblems. This requires determining the similarity of two problems, the existence of a mapping between them computable in polynomial time, and designing a memory for storing previously solved problems so as to facilitate search. The efficacy of the idea is shown by time complexity analysis. We demonstrate the proposed approach by executing perceptions and actions involved in DR tasks in two army applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:00:46 GMT  (3717kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3854v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["bonny banerjee", "b chandrasekaran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3854"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3854.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Constraint Satisfaction Framework for Executing Perceptions and Actions in Diagrammatic Reasoning", "authors": ["Bonny Banerjee", "B.

Introduction", "text": "The research presented in this paper contributes to the development of problem-solving agents in artificial intelligence (AI) that use diagrams much like humans do, but most AI do not, as the focus in AI is almost exclusively on linguistic or predicate symbolic representations. Diagramatic thinking (DR) is an emerging field of research in a number of areas to which all rights are reserved, including AI (Glasgow, Narayanan, & Chandrasekaran, 1995; Chandrasekaran, Kurup, & Banerjee, 2005), logic (Barwise & Etchemendy, 1998; Allwein & Barwise, 1999), and psychology (Tversky, 2000; Tricket & Trafton, 2006)."}, {"heading": "1.1 Diagrammatic Reasoning as a Problem Solving Activity", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "1.3 Perceptions and Actions in Diagrammatic Reasoning", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to defect to the US in order to defect to the US."}, {"heading": "1.4 The Problem", "text": "How are perceptions and actions solved in a DR system? Typically, the person developing a DR system identifies a priori the problem-solving steps, including a set of perceptions and actions, and encodes efficient algorithms for solving them. If the problem-solving steps need to be changed in the future and, as a result, a new perception arises, the developer must write a different algorithm to get his solution. Therefore, algorithms for each perception / action must be coded by hand. Clearly, this is inconvenient and time-consuming in developing a DR system and does not allow for quick and easy experimentation with different problem-solving strategies for the same problem. These disadvantages are magnified when the goal is to build a universal DR system that allows a very wide variety of perceptions and actions that are not a priori to be determined and algorithms to be developed and stored."}, {"heading": "1.5 Contributions", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this is a problem, which is a problem, which is a problem which must be solved first and foremost in the way in which it is to be solved."}, {"heading": "2. Specification Language", "text": "In this section we will discuss a high-level language that is finite, expandable, humanly usable and expressive enough to describe a variety of 2D spatial problems relevant to DRs. Problems specified in this language are accepted as input by the PLC and solved without human intervention. The specification language is independent of the PLC, i.e. the problem specification remains unchanged, even if the underlying representation and argumentation strategy of the PLC changes."}, {"heading": "2.1 Diagrammatic Objects", "text": "This year, the number of refugees registered in Germany rose by 2.2 percent in the first three months of last year, while the number of refugees registered in Germany rose by 2.2 percent."}, {"heading": "2.2 Vocabulary", "text": "A new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new"}, {"heading": "2.3 The Language", "text": "This is the language in which the problem solver (human or artificial) specifies a spatial problem to solve the problem.

We use first order predicate logic as the specification language previously described by Banerjee and Chandrasekaran (2007). (...)

(Let's determine the quantifying free expressions in practice.)"}, {"heading": "3.4 Memory Organization", "text": "The memory in the PLC is organized hierarchically and stores problems in disjointed classes, which are gradually based on the characteristics of a problem in \u03d1. After a problem has been divided into sub-problems and their \u03d1 has been calculated, the PLC checks whether the sub-problems have the same value for \u03d1 or not, whether their parse trees are isomorphic and there is a mapping between their variables. As the memory hierarchy has a constant height, the insertion of a problem or the search for a potential class of similar problems can be carried out in constant time. Furthermore, the characteristics that classify the problems are discriminatory enough to generate a large number of classes (leaf nodes), with each class containing only a few problems, which reduces the search to a few problems belonging to a class."}, {"heading": "4. Computational Complexity", "text": "We will now analyze the temporal complexity of the algorithms used in our framework. In our implementation, a problem is a data structure consisting of two fields - ParseTree and Solution. The ParseTree stores the number of problems that occur in the matrix matrix of the matrix, while the solution requires the symbolic solution in a precise form. A ParseTree can be created in the time O (t), in which the number of basic predictors and Boolean operators in the matrix of the matrix requires. Boolean operators occupy the non-leaf notes in the parse tree, while the base predictors occupy the leaf notes. Lexicographically sort the contents of the children of the individual non-leaf notes in the tree. Let the number of Boolean operators and t \"i\" be the number of children of the Boolean operators."}, {"heading": "5. Applications", "text": "In this section we will illustrate how the PLC can be used in conjunction with a problem solver, human or artificial (such as, suspended state), to solve spatial problems without human intervention, as for DR. two applications are considered - entity re-identification and ambush analysis - which are considered very important in the military field. The partial problems into which the PLC separates each spatial problem autonomously are pointed out. Problems in the military field include a variety of objects with arbitrary properties and relationships and thus help to illustrate the meaningfulness of the specification language and the efficiency and universality of the PLC. For the implementation we have used Bisoar, based on Kurup and Chandrasekaran (2007), a bimodal version of the hover reference (Laird et al., 1987), where the problem solver uses two types of operators - predicate-symbolic operators, which are applied to predicate-symbolic form and perception-similar operators, a strategy of enriching the state, which represents a problem of the specific state."}, {"heading": "5.1 Entity Re-identification", "text": "The task is to decide whether the new sighting is the same as any of the entities in their database of previous sightings, or a completely new entity: If it is true, O should have been observed, but since it is not the case in which H and O are hypotheses and observations (Josephson & Josephson, 1996; Chandrasekaran et al., 2004) we will consider a simple version of the problem to illustrate how the task is solved."}, {"heading": "5.2 Ambush Analysis", "text": "There are two main factors - range of firepower and sight - that determine the area covered by a military unit. Presence of terrain features, such as mountains, limit these factors and allow units to hide from adversaries, and these hidden units not only have the advantage of hiding their resources and intentions from adversaries, but can also attack adversaries who unconsciously catch them while traveling along a path that is within the visual and firepower range of the hidden units. We had already described in Section 1.1 how a problem solver (e.g. an army commander) uses diagrams to chart the safest way to transport his troops from one base camp to another at a given time period. In this section, one curve or region is presented as hiding place and firepower, and parts of the path to another are presented in another."}, {"heading": "6. Discussion", "text": "The need to access, communicate and manipulate spatial information (similar to engineers and scientists) using high-level language (like ordinary people use it) has been one of the frontiers in AI. It is well known that such skills are offered by first-order predicate logic and that first-order logic is generally unsustainable, except for limited domains. Under the umbrella of qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR), researchers have studied a plethora of spatial computation whose most prominent exponents are mereotopological computations (Clarke, 1981; Bennett, 1997), cardinal direction computation (Frank, 1991, 1992; Skiadopoulos & Koubarakis, 2004), double cross-calculation (Freksa, 1992), 4- and 9-overlap computations."}, {"heading": "7.

The research reported in this paper is a contribution to building a general purpose DR system as an extension to a soar-like problem solving architecture. The work is in a framework in which DR is modeled as a process where subtasks are solved, as appropriate, either by inference from symbolic representations or by interaction with a diagram, i.e., perceiving specified information from a diagram or modifying/creating objects in a diagram in specified ways according to problem solving needs. The perceptions and actions in most DR systems built so far are hand-coded for the specific application, even when the rest of the system is built using the general architecture. The absence of a general framework for executing perceptions/actions poses as a major hindrance to using them opportunistically \u2013 the essence of open-ended search in problem solving. Our goal is to develop a framework for executing a wide variety of specified perceptions and actions across tasks/domains without human intervention. We observe that the domain/task-specific visual perceptions/actions can be transformed into domain/taskindependent spatial problems. We specify a spatial problem as a quantified constraint satisfaction problem in the real domain using an open-ended vocabulary of properties, relations and actions involving three kinds of diagrammatic objects \u2013 points, curves, regions. Solving a spatial problem from this specification requires computing the equivalent simplified quantifier-free expression, the complexity of which is inherently doubly exponential. We represent objects as configuration of simple elements to facilitate decomposition of complex problems into simpler and similar subproblems. We show that, if the symbolic solution to a subproblem can be expressed concisely, quantifiers can be eliminated from spatial problems in low-order polynomial time using similar previously solved subproblems. This requires determining the similarity of two problems, the existence of a mapping between them computable in polynomial time, and designing a memory for storing previously solved problems so as to facilitate search. The efficacy of the idea is shown by time complexity analysis. We demonstrate the proposed approach by executing perceptions and actions involved in DR tasks in two army applications.", "creator": " TeX output 2010.10.01:2345"}}}
