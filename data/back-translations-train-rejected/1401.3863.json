It is among the first problems used for studying intrinsic properties, including phase transitions, of combinatorial problems. While thorough theoretical and experimental analyses have been made on the HCP in undirected graphs, a limited amount of work has been done for the HCP in directed graphs (DHCP). The main contribution of this work is an effective algorithm for the DHCP. Our algorithm explores and exploits the close relationship between the DHCP and the Assignment Problem (AP) and utilizes a technique based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT). By combining effective algorithms for the AP and SAT, our algorithm significantly outperforms previous exact DHCP algorithms, including an algorithm based on the award-winning Concorde TSP algorithm. The second result of the current study is an experimental analysis of phase transitions of the DHCP, verifying and refining a known phase transition of the DHCP.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:04:57 GMT  (265kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3863v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gerold j\\\"ager", "weixiong zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3863"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3863.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An Effective Algorithm for and Phase Transitions of the Directed Hamiltonian Cycle Problem", "authors": ["Gerold J\u00e4ger", "Weixiong Zhang"], "emails": ["gej@informatik.uni-kiel.de", "weixiong.zhang@wustl.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "An undirected graph G = (V, E) is Hamiltonian if it contains a Hamiltonian problem (HC 1979), a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. In the face of a graph, the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem (HCP) is a problem to find or prove that no HC exists in the diagram. HCP's decision-making version was one of the first problems to be proven to be complete (Karp, 1972). HCP is a well-known problem with many applications in different fields, such as the Hamiltonian Cycle Game in game theory (Stojakovic, 2005), the problem of finding a knight's tour in artificial intelligence (Henderson & Apodaca, 2008), and DNA Physical Mapping in Biology (Grebinski & Kucherov, 1996). Much research has been done on HCP in unregulated graphics."}, {"heading": "2. The Algorithm", "text": "Consider a directed, unweighted graph G = (V, E) with nodes V and edges E. For our purposes of solving DHCP, we consider the problem of determining whether or not there is a collection of cycles that may not necessarily be complete cycles, visiting each vertex exactly once. We call this problem a direct assignment problem, or DAP for short. Our algorithm investigates and uses the intrinsic relationship between the DHCP and the DAP. Specifically, the AP-SAT algorithm searches for a HC in the space of DAP solutions. It first solves the DAP. If the DAP solution forms a HC or no DAP solution exists, the algorithm ends. If the DAP solver returns a solution that is not HC, the algorithm then tries to patch the subcycles in the solution into a HC using the well-known Karp Steele patch method (Karp & Steele, 1985)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Solving the Assignment Problem", "text": "Considering n vertices and a matrix C = (cij) 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n \u0432 Rn, n the cost between vertices, the assignment problem (AP) is to find a vertex permutation \u03c0 \u0445, so that an AP solution can be considered a collection of cycles that accurately locate each vertex. Many algorithms were developed for the AP (Bertsekas, 1981; Goldberg & Kennedy, 1995; Jonker & Volgenant, 1987). (For an experimental comparison of AP algorithms, see Dell'Amico & Toth, 2000.) The most efficient is the Hungarian algorithm i, which is based on Koenig-Egervary's theorem and has a complexity of O."}, {"heading": "2.2 Karp-Steele Patching", "text": "If the DAP solution does not provide a definitive answer to the problem, i.e. if the cost of the AP solution is 0 and the AP solution contains more than one cycle, we continue to search for a HC in G. We first patch the subcycles in an attempt to form a HC, using Karp-Steele patches (KSP) that represent an effective ATSP heuristics (Glover, Gutin, Yeo & Zverovich, 2001; Goldengorin, Ja \ufffd ger & Molitor, 2006; Karp & Steele, 1985).The process of patching two cycles C1 and C2 in an AP solution is defined as follows: Two fixed arcs (v1, w1) are deleted first, and two arcs (v1, w2) are deleted first, and two arcs (v2, w1) are added to the costs (v2, w1) c."}, {"heading": "2.3 Solving Variant APs", "text": "The key is to avoid finding the same DAP solution again. In other words, we add a \"disturbance\" component to create multiple variant AP instances to increase the overall chance of finding a HC instance. In the worst case, if the DHCP instance does not contain HC, this procedure will not be productive. In other words, we add a \"disturbance\" component to create multiple variant AP instances to increase the overall chance of finding an HC instance. Note that in the worst case, if the DHCP instance does not contain HC, this procedure will be productive. The main idea to create a variant AP instance is the probability that the sub-cycles will be chosen in the current AP solution."}, {"heading": "2.4 Implicitly Enumerating all DAP Solutions Using SAT", "text": "We are now able to discuss all DAP solutions that represent a solution to the problem of the DAP solution discovered so far in the search. To this end, we will first formulate all DAP solutions as SAT solutions that can also be applied to a general SAT problem (e.g. Jin, Han & Somenzi, 2005).This elementary technique of adding new limitations for the purpose of enumerating all SAT solutions can also be applied to a general SAT problem. Notice that this cannot be done simply under the AP framework because such limitations cannot be properly added to the AP framework. In addition, we can benefit from the research efforts related to SAT, in particular, we can apply an effective SAT solution."}, {"heading": "2.5 Some General Remarks", "text": "The AP-SAT algorithm consists of three main components, namely the AP step, the KSP step and the SAT step. It might be interesting to know which of these components is the most important schema. To do this, we have to distinguish between completeness and effectiveness of the algorithm. The only necessary step for completeness is the SAT step of Section 2.4. This step without all previous steps also leads to a correct DHCP algorithm. On the other hand, the AP-SAT algorithm is more effective if the steps of the KSP are frequently mentioned and the SAT step is mentioned only a few times. For example, if no DAP solution exists or an existing HC solution exists through the previous steps, the SAT part is not called at all."}, {"heading": "3. Experimental Results", "text": "We implemented the AP-SAT algorithm using the 2-point reduction method (Jonker 1983 & Volgenant 1983), the DHCP algorithms based on the absolute SAT encoding (Hoos 1999), and the relative SAT encoding (Prestwich 2003) in C + +, and compared them with an algorithm based on the award-winning Concorde TSP program (Applegate et al., 2005, 2006).For the Martello al method, we implemented a version that terminates when a HC exists, and compared it to an algorithm based on the award-winning TSP program (Applegate et al, 2005, 2006).For the SAT method of Jonker and Volgenant (1987, 2004) and the MiniSAT solver of Ee-n and Sun rensson (2003, 2010).To apply Concorde, a DHCP instance was first converted into a 2.2-point symmetric instance then into a TSP-1."}, {"heading": "3.1 Comparison of DHCP Algorithms", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "3.2 Analysis of AP-SAT", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far as it has this year."}, {"heading": "3.3 Phase Transitions of the DHCP", "text": "For random undirected graphs Gn, m, where m arcs are randomly selected from all possible n (n \u2212 1) / 2 arcs over n corners in the graph, Komlo \u0301 s and Szemere \u0301 di (1983) proved a phase transition of c \u00b7 dn \u00b7 (log n + log n) / 2c with c = 1 for the HCP. Vandegriend and Culberson (1998) have experimentally confirmed the theoretical result, where the constant c is between 1.08 and 1.10. For DHCP, where m arcs are randomly selected from all possible n (n \u2212 1) arcs, McDiarmid proved to be a phase transition of m = c \u00b7 dn \u00b7 (log n + log n) c with c = 1 (1980). Our experiments aimed to verify this result and determine the multiplicative constant c c. As a directed graph, twice as many arcs can contain the undirected counterpart."}, {"heading": "3.4 Asymptotic Behavior of AP-SAT", "text": "An interesting characteristic of an algorithm is its asymptotic behavior. In order to quantify this behavior for the AP-SAT algorithm, we looked again at the experiments of Section 3.3, i.e. the experiments that verified the phase transitions of the DHCP. As described above, we looked at random problem cases with n = 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 vertices and selected 1000 independently generated random diagrams for each n and for each c. To measure the asymptotic behavior of AP-SAT in the worst case, we measured only the CPU times of the algorithm on the most difficult instances, i.e. the instances with the degree parameter c = 0.9 (see Section 3.3). The results can be found in Figure 6, where the x-axis is the problem size and the y-axis the average time needed. Since both the x and y-axis AP are considered as the whole axis of the S3 curve, the curve is considered as an asymptotic part of the curve and the 3.3 cannot be considered as the S3."}, {"heading": "4. Summary", "text": "The Hamilton Cycle Problem (HCP) is an important, canonical combinatorial problem. Surprisingly, no effective exact algorithm was developed for the HCP in directed graphs that we called directed HCP or DHCP. Our main result of this work is a novel and effective exact algorithm for DHCP. Our algorithm uses an existing algorithm for the assignment problem and an existing method for Boolean Satisfaction (SAT). Our work includes a new SAT formulation of the HCP and the AP that can potentially be extended to other problems such as the TSP. Our experimental results on random and real problem cases showed that our new algorithm is superior to four known algorithms, including an algorithm that utilizes the award-winning Concorde TSP algorithm. Furthermore, the transition result of the first phase was extended to verifiable problems and we later extended to the CDHP based on this work."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank David S.

Phase transitions in the HCP have also been studied under other different control parameters, for example, the so called general constrainedness parameter (Frank, Gent & Walsh, 1998). The phase transition result of the HCP has motivated a substantial amount of research on phase transitions of other combinatorial problems, particularly the TSP (Zhang & Korf, 1996) and Boolean satisfiability (Monasson, Zecchina, Kirkpatrick & Selman, 1999). In this study we consider the HCP in directed graphs, which we call directed HCP, or DHCP for short. In addition to the known applications of the HCP mentioned above, an interesting application of the DHCP is that DHCP heuristics can be used to solve the Bottleneck TSP (Kabadi & Punnen, 2002). In contrast to the extensive amount of work on the HCP for undirected graphs, the research on the DHCP is rather limited (Angluin & Valiant, 1979; Bang-Jensen & Gutin, 2008; Kelly, 2007).

The main contribution of this work is an effective algorithm for the DHCP. Our algorithm explores and exploits the close relationship between the DHCP and the Assignment Problem (AP) and utilizes a technique based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT).
