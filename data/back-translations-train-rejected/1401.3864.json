In contrast with classical entailment, that a formula P partially entails another formula Q with respect to a background formula set \\Gamma intuitively means that under the circumstance of \\Gamma, if P is true then some \"part\" of Q will also be true. We distinguish three different kinds of partial entailments and formalize them by using an extended notion of prime implicant. We study their semantic properties, which show that, surprisingly, partial entailments fail for many simple inference rules. Then, we study the related computational properties, which indicate that partial entailments are relatively difficult to be computed.

Definition 10 A formula P is relevant to a formula Q in relation to a formula set, provided that there is a prime implicit \u03c0 of P w.r.t. and a prime implicit \u03c0 of Q w.r.t. The definition 10 is very similar to the definition of weak partial entanglement (see definition 4). The main difference between these two definitions is that weak partial entanglement is defined by a \"style,\" while relevance is defined by a \"style.\" More specifically, in the former definition, we demand that \"for all\" prime implicators of P w.r.t. a \"normal\" implication of P w.r.t. in relation to the same \"formula,\" an implicit version of Q does not exist. \""}, {"heading": "4.4 Novelty and Novelty-Based Independence", "text": "The concept of novelty (Marquis, 1991) is defined between two formulas in relation to a formula that is also defined as new.

Definition 12 (Lang et al., 2002) Two formulas P and Q are (novelty-based) independent iff P is not new negative in relation to Q w.r.t. > Intuitively P means that P is new in relation to Q w.r.t. means that the addition of new information P has an effect on the theory."}, {"heading": "4.5 Probabilistic Positive Relevance", "text": "Another approach to formalizing a certain kind of usefulness is probabilistic positive relevance (Zhou & Chen, 2006), which is based on probability distributions; the basic idea of positive relevance is that a formula P is positively relevant to a different formula Q in terms of a background formula that is defined for all probability distributions Pr, Pr (Q), Pr (Q), Pr (Q), and Pr (P). Although positive relevance is similar to partial consequences and the probability distribution is strongly related to the prime number (Lang et al., 2002), the underlying intuition and semantic properties of positive relevance and partial consequences differ significantly from each other. Thus, for example, according to the definition of positive relevance by Zhou and Chen (2006), x-y is positively relevant to x. However, x-y is not (weak, strong) partially connected to x."}, {"heading": "4.6 Partial Satisfaction of a CNF", "text": "The term \"partial satisfaction\" is also used for the satisfaction of a subset of a set of clauses (Lieberherr & Specker, 1981; Ka \ufffd ppeli & Scheder, 2007).A CNF formula (i.e. a combination of clauses) is referred to as k-satisfactory if each subformula containing at most k-clauses is satisfactory.Although the term \"partial satisfaction\" is used for both k-satisfaction and subsequences, it represents different intuitive meanings.For the former, \"part\" means a subformula (i.e. the set of clauses), while for the latter it means a subset of a prime number of a formula. Therefore, partial consequences and k-satisfaction are essentially irrelevant. Furthermore, k-satisfaction refers only to a certain formula (CNF), while subconditions refer to the relationship between two formulas (w.r.t. a background theory)."}, {"heading": "5. Partial Goal Satisfaction", "text": "If this is not successful, the agents would decide to wait and do nothing.

Under the situation, it is sometimes useful for the agents to do something\" toward \"their goals, instead of just waiting for these actions to be\" partly \"the agent's goal as rational candidates.

Concluding Remarks", "text": "We distinguished three different types of sub-sequences (see Table 1) based on the concept of implicit prime number. Results show that the properties of sub-sequences are difficult to grasp because many simple sequences do not apply. We also examined the computational complexity of sub-sequences (see Tables 4 and 5). The results of the complexity are surprising and interesting. For example, the verification of strong sub-sequences is complete even when the background theory is empty. This indicates that the definitions of sub-sequences appear simple, but it is not easy to calculate them. We showed that the terms of sub-sequences can serve as formulae of sub-sequences for the satisfaction of sub-sequences, even if the background theory is empty. This indicates that the definitions of sub-sequences appear simple, but it is not easy to calculate them."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Some preliminary findings of this paper have been published (Zhou & Chen, 2004; Zhou et al., 2008).

For LAPR(\u0393, P, l), the membership can be shown by the following algorithm, which determines whether l is not in all prime implicants of P w.r.t. \u0393: 1. guess a literal set \u03c0; 2. check if \u03c0 is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393; 3. if yes, check if l is not in \u03c0. According to the above result for prime implicant checking, this problem is in \u03a32 . Thus, the original problem is in \u03a02 . For harness, we can prove it in a similar way to the above proof for the \u03a32 hardness of LEPR(\u0393, P, l). Indeed, one can prove that \u2203X\u2200Y P iff x is in one of the elements of PI(\u0393, F ), where \u0393 = {\u00ac(x \u2227 z \u2227 P \u2227 (y1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 yk))}, F = x \u2227 z \u2227 P \u2227 \u00ac(y1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 yk) \u2228 \u00acx \u2227 \u00acz \u2227 (\u00acy1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 \u00acyk), where x and z are two new atoms. Moreover, x is in one of the elements of PI(\u0393, F ) iff \u00acx is not in all of the elements in PI(\u0393, F ) since every element in PI(\u0393, F ) contains either x or \u00acx. This shows that determining whether a literal is not in all prime implicants of a formula w.r.t. a formula set is \u03a32 hard. It follows that LAPR(\u0393, P, l) is \u03a0 P 2 hard. For WPE(\u0393, P, Q), the \u03a02 hardness follows directly from Proposition 12. The \u03a3 P 2 hardness can be implied from the hardness proof of the \u03a32 hardness of LEPR(\u0393, P, l) by noticing that the only prime implicant of x w.r.t. \u0393 is {x} itself. For the membership, let us first consider the following algorithm, which determines whether P does not weakly partially entail Q w.r.t. \u0393: 1. compute all the literals which occur at least in one of the prime implicants of Q w.r.t. \u0393; 2. check whether there is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393, which does not contain any of the literals computed in step 1. According to above result for the \u03a32 hardness of LEPR(\u0393, P, l), step 1 requires linear calls to a \u03a32 oracle. In addition, step 2 requires only one recall to a \u03a32 oracle based on the results obtained in step 1. To do this, we just need to guess a consistent literal set, and to check if it is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393 and contains no literals computed from step 1. This algorithm can be converted to a \u03a32 -tree, in which the root is corresponding to the \u03a32 call for step 2, and its children are corresponding to the linear \u03a32 calls in step 1 for computing those literals. Thus, according the \u03a3 P 2 -tree techniques introduced by Gottlob (1995), WPE(\u0393, P, Q) is in \u22063 [O(log n)].", "startOffset": 125, "endOffset": 2433}], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "We introduce a novel logical notion\u2013partial entailment\u2013to propositional logic.

We distinguish three different kinds of partial entailments and formalize them by using an extended notion of prime implicant. We study their semantic properties, which show that, surprisingly, partial entailments fail for many simple inference rules. Then, we study the related computational properties, which indicate that partial entailments are relatively difficult to be computed. Finally, we consider a potential application of partial entailments in reasoning about rational agents.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
