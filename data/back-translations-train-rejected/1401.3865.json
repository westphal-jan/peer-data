(2007).A bC; the operation can lead to a disjunction of relationships, for example when A bB and B d C can then establish a generalized relationship to basic temporal relations, each seen as a set of fundamental relationships, and the composition of relationships defines an algebra on R (the algebra of subsets of all relationships)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Time Point Algebra and Convex Relations", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to move in a direction in which they are able, in which they want to move, and in which they are able, in which they want to move, and in which they are able to move."}, {"heading": "2.3 Strict and Relaxed Recall and Precision", "text": "In general, both humans and systems can assign disjunctions of atomic relationships between two events (i.e. A bB, A mB), directly or indirectly (after saturation), which is a way to reduce uncertainty, even if the exact relationship between two events is not known. The presence of disjunctions raises the question of how to evaluate relationships that are only partially correct, such as A bB, A mB and vice versa. In response to this problem, various variations of common precision and callback measures are proposed. A strict measure counts only exact match as a success and will, for example, 0 points for the latter example. However, it can be argued that a rating measure should better take into account \"close matches.\" For example, we assume that the gold standard relationship between A and B is A bB A bB. If the system chooses disjunction A bB, SB and SB, it must be rewarded less than A B or nothing at all."}, {"heading": "2.4 Relative Importance of Relations", "text": "As shown above, a temporal closure is necessary in order to be able to correctly compare two temporal diagrams, but in a temporal diagram relationships do not have the same meaning. Applying basic memory and precision results (either strict or relaxed) to closed temporal diagrams is not enough. Consider the very simple diagram examples of Figure 6, in which the first graph K is the gold standard. S1 contains only two relationships, versus six in K. But it seems unfair to consider a memory value of 26, since adding only one relationship (B bC) would be sufficient to deduce all the others. An intuitive reminder would be about 23. What matters here is how many relationships are missing to restore the entire annotation graph \u2212 But even if we assume that we have a way to clearly distinguish \"significant\" relationships (solid lines in K) from \"minor\" (ductible) relationships (dashed lines in S2), then it is not enough to distinguish other relationships, because S2 is not enough to find them in SD."}, {"heading": "2.5 \u201cMinimal\u201d Graphs", "text": "As I said, a good but insufficient way to deal with the relative importance of graph relationships would be to work on what we call \"significant\" relationships or \"minimal graphs.\" We consider a temporal graph to be a \"minimal graph\" of a graph G, if: 4. However, the MUC metrics contain other problems that were later addressed by the metrics B3 and CEAF, but which have no relevance to the evaluation of a temporal graph. The main problem is the tendency to favor the prediction of a co-reference link for each pair of mentions; this has no counterpart in the temporal case, since event pairs can be linked to other relationships and are associated with other inferential properties, as opposed to just one equivalence relationship. Its temporal closure leads to the same temporal information as G.2. No relationship can be removed from this graph without breaking the first property."}, {"heading": "2.6 Behavior of Existing Metrics", "text": "As stated in the work of Tannier and Muller (2008), a recall is expected to decrease in a linear manner as the amount of information decreases. Otherwise, evaluation yardsticks might not exhibit gradual changes that make comparisons of models difficult. Furthermore, we expect the amount of information to grow roughly proportional to the number of events in the text. This behavior can be evaluated by comparing a given comment with the same remark that excludes some of the time information. Figure 7 shows how recalls develop when relationships are removed from a time chart until no relationships exist. It shows the different values of a strict recall according to the ratio of the relationships held in the chart, as well as the ideal y = x line. This can be viewed as an illustration of the consequences of an annotator \"forgetting\" some relationships in order to comment on some relationships, in relation to an ideal reference point."}, {"heading": "3. Proposed New Metric", "text": "Many measures of similarity exist between two graphs once a many-to-many agreement has been found between the nodes of both graphs (Sorlin, 2006). Node matching, which is a major problem in graph comparisons in general, is not difficult in our case, since we take into account that both graphs comment on the same events or expressions. A traditional similarity function between two graphs is the following (Sorlin, 2006): sim (K, G) = f (K to G) \u2212 g (splits (m)) f (K-G), where KumG is the set of relationships that both graphs share according to the node matching function m, K-G the union between node and G relations, and splits (m) the number of node splits imposed by the coincidence to obtain one graph with the other (see examples later). Functions f and g depend on the types of the graph, and we have different symmetry and application metrics, but these two are not suitable metrics below the two."}, {"heading": "3.1 Transitive Reduction of Endpoint Graph", "text": "To solve the problem of finding minimal graphs and taking into account the relative importance of relationships, we take inspiration from the work of Dubois and Schwer (2000) in two main ideas. Firstly, graphs are saturated (i.e. the temporal closure is applied) and are converted into endpoint graphs. < secondly, two nodes connected by an equality relationship are fused together (this will help to guarantee the uniqueness of the graph, see below), a useful process to point-based graphs (van Beek, 1992). Figure 8 represents the graph of Figure 3 after this transformation, i.e. the resulting point graph is saturated by defining the composition of the event relationships in Allen's algebra graph, the graph we are looking at is constructed from \"convex\" annotations, i.e. there can be no \"< or\" relationship between two points \"> because we can maintain relationships without losing and stranstranstranstranstranstranged information."}, {"heading": "3.2 Temporal Recall and Precision", "text": "As we have shown in Section 2.4, minor relationships should still be rewarded if they are not redundant in the evaluated diagram. However, they must have a lower weight. Minor relationships should only be taken into account in the time call and not in the precision. The reason for this is that the call evaluates the proportion of reference relationships found by the system and this system can find some minor relationships without the larger relationships they have produced in the reference being redundant by definition (see B b D in Example S4, Figure 6). On the contrary, precision evaluates the proportion of system relationships located in the reference diagram and minor (i.e. derivable) relationships found by the system are redundant by definition. Our callable measure is then a combination of two values. Since K is the reference diagram and G the evaluated diagram: \u2022 The large time call is the rate of the reference relationships of major relationships being found in the time call."}, {"heading": "3.3 Notations", "text": "Note: \u2022 G and K the event graphs, K the reference (key); \u2022 Gpt and Kpt the associated endpoint graphs, in which equivalent points are merged. \u2022 (N, R) the set of nodes and relationships of the graph G and mutatis mutandis for the others. \u2022 In the examples, only non-trivial relationships are listed. Trivial relationships are those that concern two points of the same interval. For example, A1 < A2 in Figure 8 is trivial and therefore not taken into account. In all the figures, trivial relationships are dashed grey lines. Non-trivial relationships and the node list are sufficient to find the complete graph. \u2022 The temporal closure of G is determined as G. \u2022 The temporary reduction of G is now noted as Gmaj."}, {"heading": "3.4 Temporal Recall and Precision", "text": "Our new measures of temporal memory and precision are based on the terms defined above.

On the other hand, a callback value must be taken into account measures (reference relations missed by the graph) and columns. For the sake of simplicity, it should be noted that K = KptK is the point-based reference, and G = Gpt is the graph to be evaluated. Kmaj and Gmaj are the transitive reductions of these.

Calculate values of time retrieval and precision. 7. http: / / www.irit.fr / ~ Philippe.Muller / resources.htmlThe most expensive operation here is the first and is common in the standard evaluation method; its time is in O (| N | 3) at worst, with the algorithm 1 page 379, N being the event set of the largest diagram between G and K. The other is directly linear in the number of relationships of the diagram (conversion to endpoints, merging of equities in the closed diagram), or even worse, in O | 2, the total diagram for both the composition and the composition of the relationship (i.e., the first composition and the composition) is the difference of the diagram, not the first step."}, {"heading": "3.4.4 BOUNDARIES", "text": "Time precision.

In terms of accuracy, an attentive reader would receive for each of these diagrams Si, TP (Si) = 1.A system that provides only minor relationships, A < C, A < D and B < C, that is, half of all derivable relationships, a retrieval of only 0.33, which might seem unfair. However, even if three relationships are present, three more are still missing (the same number of missing relationships as if the graph had no connection at all). Furthermore, the fact that all minor relationships do not receive a better value than a larger relationship is the condition for not exceeding the limits. Finally, this case is rare and does not affect the general behavior of the metric."}, {"heading": "4. First Simple Case: Non-Disjunctive Allen Relations", "text": "Consider the example graph K1 of Allen's non-disjunctive relationships (see also the graph in Figure 12): K1 = A B C D E FA s bi b s bB bi m s mC b bD f eE fiThe conversion into relationships between endpoints results in the following graph in which an event A is split into A1 and A2. Edges are not labeled because only the relationship \"<\" is considered at this point.Note that merging identical nodes is not equivalent to labeling arcs with \"=,\" since in the latter case the minimal graph would no longer be unique. For example, the necessary choice between A1 < A2, B1 < A2 < A2 < A2 and E1 < A2 would result in three equal but different graphs. Consider that the reference K1 with the following graph G1 (Figure 13; edges are false relationships, are thin relationships, false relationships)."}, {"heading": "5. Disjunctive Convex Relations", "text": "We now apply the metric to sets of convex relationships. Convex relationships are a series of relationships that are conceptual neighbors, i.e. they encode relationships that may be vague, but at which intervals endpoints can only be in convex subsets of the timeline (see Section 2.2). The structure of the minimum diagram follows the same procedure as described above (transitive reduction).The measurements do not differ at all when we choose a strict point system (see Section 2.3).But in a relaxed scheme with disjunctions, it is necessary to use a weighting method; an answer is no longer assigned to a binary value (0 or 1), but to one of the values in Table 3, for example, in a manner similar to TempEval (Verhagen et al., 2007).As shown in this table, the relaxed measure has an effect on false values and on vltltltc (a relationship can be half a point), but also on conversion and split values (where half points are also possible)."}, {"heading": "6. Experiments", "text": "We are pushing for a change in the measurement scales of the temporal annotations graph was motivated at the beginning of the paper by a few examples in which we show some undesirable side effects of the Common Evaluation Procedures. We will now present a more thorough methodology aimed at evaluating the evaluation process itself. We have used two types of data for this purpose. Obviously, we can test and compare actions against the freely available temporal annotations provided in the TimeBank corpus. We are also introducing a set of artificially constructed temporal graphs on which we can control a few relevant parameters. TimeBank annotations are more heterogeneous because human annotators make mistakes or introduce inconsistencies, creating appropriate noise. We also wanted to test other aspects of temporal annotations that are easier to create from scratch."}, {"heading": "6.1 Artificial Graphs", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it is only a matter of time before there is a result, until there is a result."}, {"heading": "6.2 TimeBank Corpus", "text": "Before presenting the results of our evaluations of the real annotated data of the TimeBank corpus, we show some features of the time charts induced by the annotations.

Conclusion", "text": "It remains unclear whether this could be an acceptable way of presenting temporal information to humans, or how the resulting minimal graphs could be meaningfully translated into interval relationships. We are arguing here for benchmarks that are free from some of the biases inherent in the commonly used Allen-based time graphs closures comparisons and are unique in the cases considered. We have shown empirically that the behavior of this type of measurement is appropriate to the goals we had in mind. We are not arguing that ordering interval endpoints should be considered as the human-provided annotation, only that the translation is possible and useful. It remains unclear whether this could also be an acceptable way of presenting temporal information to humans, or how the resulting minimal graphs could be meaningfully translated into interval relationships."}, {"heading": "8.

Their algorithm first finds core relations, relations that are in every minimal graph, by intersecting all derivations, and then computes all possible remaining combinations in order to find those composing a minimal graph. For example, for the relation RA,B between A and B, derivations are RA,C \u25e6RC,B , RA,D \u25e6RD,B , RA,E \u25e6RE,B , etc. If the intersection of all these derived relations equals RA,B , it means that RA,B is not a core relation, since it can be obtained by composing some other relations. Otherwise, the relation is a core relation, since removing it always leads to a loss of information. The way this \u201ckernel\u201d is obtained ensures its uniqueness. However, the second part of the procedure (compute remaining combinations) is computationally impractical, even for medium-sized graphs, since every subset of relations must be considered to determine a minimal graph on top of core relations.

Moreover, it does not lead to a unique graph that could be compared to a reference.
