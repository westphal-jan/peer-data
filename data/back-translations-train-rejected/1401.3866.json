The key question in this area, which has important applications in social choice theory and decision making under uncertainty, is how to extend an agents preferences over a number of objects to a preference relation over nonempty sets of such objects. Certain combinations of seemingly natural principles for this kind of preference extension can result in logical inconsistencies, which has led to a number of important impossibility theorems. We first prove a general result that shows that for a wide range of such principles, characterised by their syntactic form when expressed in a many-sorted first-order logic, any impossibility exhibited at a fixed (small) domain size will necessarily extend to the general case. We then show how to formulate candidates for impossibility theorems at a fixed domain size in propositional logic, which in turn enables us to automatically search for (general) impossibility theorems using a SAT solver. When applied to a space of 20 principles for preference extension familiar from the literature, this method yields a total of 84 impossibility theorems, including both known and nontrivial new results.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:06:28 GMT  (316kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3866v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO cs.MA", "authors": ["christian geist", "ulle endriss"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3866"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3866.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Automated Search for Impossibility Theorems in Social Choice Theory: Ranking Sets of Objects", "authors": ["Christian Geist", "Ulle Endriss"], "emails": ["cgeist@gmx.net", "ulle.endriss@uva.nl"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Ranking Sets of Objects", "text": "The evaluation of objects deals with the question of how an agent should classify object sets, since it has preferences over individual objects. Answers to this question will depend on the specific interpretation assigned to the sets (Barbera et al., 2004): \u2022 Complete uncertainty. According to this interpretation, sets are considered mutually exclusive alternatives from which the end result is selected at a later date, but the agent has no influence on the selection process. \u2022 Opportunity sets. Here, too, sets contain mutually exclusive alternatives, but this time the agent can select an end result from the sets itself. \u2022 Sets as end results. In this constellation, sets contain compatible objects that are assumed to occur simultaneously (i.e., the agent receives them all together). Suppose that an agent prefers object x over object y. Then, under the first interpretation, it is reasonable to assume that it takes the sets of x and the sets of receiving (x) with certainty."}, {"heading": "2.1 Formal Framework", "text": "Let X be a (usually finite) set of alternatives (or objects) on which a (preferential) order is defined; the order is assumed to be linear, i.e., it is a reflective, complete, transitive, and antisymmetric binary relationship; we designate the strict component of \u0438 by > \u0442, i.e., x > female and male binary relationship if x female and male binary relationships exist; the interpretation of the relationship will be such that x \u2265, if and only if x is considered at least as good as y by the decision-maker; likewise, we have a binary relationship on the set of non-empty subsets of X (designated by X: = 2X\\ {\u2205}), which is initially assumed to be a weak order (reflective, complete, transitive); but later, our method of proof will allow us to examine weaker assumptions also with respect to the strict component of X."}, {"heading": "2.2 The Kannai-Peleg Theorem", "text": "Kannai and Peleg (1984) were probably the first to treat the specific problem of extending the preferences of elements to subsets as a problem in itself and in an axiomatic way.

Specifically, our aim in this section is to prove that this approach can be elevated to a general proofing technique: to prove a general theory of impossibility, it is sufficient to establish impossibilities for a small area. Specifically, we will prove what we call the Preservation Theorem, which states that certain axioms are preserved in specific substructures. A logical consequence of this theorem is then a universal reduction step, which states that the non-existence of a satisfactory relationship in a small area shows that no major satisfying relationship can exist. 2We will work within the framework of mathematical logic to gain access to the syntactic as well as sectarian mannigma."}, {"heading": "3.1 Many-Sorted Logic for Set Preferences", "text": "A natural and well understood language plays a similar role as the inductive Lemmas of Tang and in 2009."}, {"heading": "3.2 Preservation Theorem and Universal Reduction Step", "text": "The famous Los Tarski theory of classical model theory (1997) offers a weak version of the result we want to prove.

The trick they used was to introduce \"situations\" as names for preference profiles that transform the second-order axioms into first-order statements that can then (due to the finiteness of the principle) be translated into propositional logic.

Certain combinations of seemingly natural principles for this kind of preference extension can result in logical inconsistencies, which has led to a number of important impossibility theorems. We first prove a general result that shows that for a wide range of such principles, characterised by their syntactic form when expressed in a many-sorted first-order logic, any impossibility exhibited at a fixed (small) domain size will necessarily extend to the general case. We then show how to formulate candidates for impossibility theorems at a fixed domain size in propositional logic, which in turn enables us to automatically search for (general) impossibility theorems using a SAT solver.
