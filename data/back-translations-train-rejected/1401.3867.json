In this paper, we use a transition system approach to reason about the evolution of an agents beliefs as actions are executed. Some actions cause an agent to perform belief revision while others cause an agent to perform belief update, but the interaction between revision and update can be non-elementary. We present a set of rationality properties describing the interaction between revision and update, and we introduce a new class of belief change operators for reasoning about alternating sequences of revisions and updates. Our belief change operators can be characterized in terms of a natural shifting operation on total pre-orderings over interpretations. We compare our approach with related work on iterated belief change due to action, and we conclude with some directions for future research.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:06:49 GMT  (321kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3867v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["aaron hunter", "james p delgrande"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3867"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3867.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Iterated Belief Change Due to Actions and Observations", "authors": ["Aaron Hunter", "James P.

Introduction", "text": "We are interested in modelling the change of faith caused by performing an alternate sequence of actions and observations. Broadly speaking, agents perform faith actualizations by actions, and agents perform faith actualizations by observations. However, to date there has been little explicit consideration of the repeated change of faith that occurs when an observation follows a sequence of actions. In this paper, we deal with faith actualizations in the context of sequences of the following form. (InitialBeliefs) \u00b7 \u00b7 (Observation) \u00b7 (Observation) \u00b7 (Observation) (1) We assume that the effects of actions are fully specified and infallible. We illustrate that the faith actualizations caused by this type of alternating sequence cannot simply be determined by a simple iteration of updates and revisions. The main problem is that there are plausible examples in which an observation should cause an agent to revise the original state of faith rather than the present state."}, {"heading": "1.1 Contributions to Existing Research", "text": "This is an extension of our previous work (J\u00e4ger & Delgrande, 2005), which focuses on action domains that involve a single agent who can perform actions and make observations.

All rights are reserved and it is assumed that the belief in the execution of a hidden exogenous action is given. In this context, there are two possible explanations for an erroneous belief. First, a erroneous belief can arise from a false initial belief. Second, an erroneous belief can be attributed to the execution of a hidden exogenous action. We focus primarily on the first case, since we are explicitly concerned with a single action scenario. We briefly describe the contributions we make in the area of faith changes caused by action changes. One contribution is that we explicitly state precise characteristics that should always be adhered to when an action is followed by an observation."}, {"heading": "2.

In this problem, there is a beaker that contains either acid or a base, and there is a remedy that holds a piece of white litmus paper that can be dipped into the beaker to determine the contents; the litmus paper turns red when put into an acid, and turns blue when put into a base; the problem is to provide a formal model for the change of faith that occurs when a remedy uses the litmus paper to test the contents of the beaker. Intuitively, the litmus paper problem seems to require an agent to revise the original assumptions in response to an observation at a later date. Suppose that the remedy submerges the paper and then sees the paper turning red. This observation does not only cause the agent to believe that the acid contains the remedy, but also causes the agent to believe that the acid contains the acid."}, {"heading": "2.2 Basic Notation and Terminology", "text": "We assume a sentence signature consisting of a finite series of sentence symbols.

Much of this discussion focuses on the distinction between faith actualization and faith actualization, which we introduce in the next section.

The basic idea behind our approach is to define the evolution of faith in relation to any external notion of the reliability of an observation.

For our purposes, recidence provides a concrete order of reliability on observations that facilitates the presentation of examples and comparison with related formalisms. As such, we use throughout the remainder of this paper to designate the operator of faith evolution defined in relation to this function. We emphasize that this preference for newer information is only a convention that we accept because it simplifies exposure, and we note that this convention is the subject of criticism (Delgrande, Dubois, & Lang, 2006).

We will present the case with a single act, as it simplifies the representation by allowing us to avoid the introduction of sequences of non-observations interspersed with actions. We point out that our result does not directly extend to the case involving multiple observations, since we do not introduce an axiomatic representation of the reliability of an observation.

Comparison with Related Work", "text": "Many formalisms of action define formalisms of action as Markovian structures, as is the case, for example, in action languages such as A (Gelfond & Lifschitz, 1998).When action formalisms of this kind are supplemented by scanning effects, there is a natural tendency to calculate epistemic changes by calculating the effects of ontic actions and perceiving actions successively.This is the implicit approach to iterated faith changes caused by actions in the epistemic extensions of A. (Lobo et al., 2001; Son & Baral, 2001) We have seen that this strategy is not suitable for litmus-like problems, but this does not mean that such formalisms cannot be used to argue about iterated faith changes due to actions. It merely means that some care must be taken in defining iterated change."}, {"heading": "6.1 The Situation Calculus", "text": "In this section, we compare our work to an extended version of SitCalc that explicitly represents the beliefs of the actors.

Terms in a SitCalc action theory cover a range that includes situations and actions. A fluid term is a predicate that takes a situation as the last argument. A situation represents the state of the world, along with a complete history of actions that have been performed. There is an excellent constant S0 that represents the initial situation, and an excellent function symbol that represents the execution of an action.

Some actions cause an agent to perform belief revision while others cause an agent to perform belief update, but the interaction between revision and update can be nonelementary. We present a set of rationality properties describing the interaction between revision and update, and we introduce a new class of belief change operators for reasoning about alternating sequences of revisions and updates. Our belief change operators can be characterized in terms of a natural shifting operation on total pre-orderings over interpretations. We compare our approach with related work on iterated belief change due to action, and we conclude with some directions for future research.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.98 Copyright 2009 Radical Eye Software"}}}
