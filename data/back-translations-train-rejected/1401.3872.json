We build a full picture of the relationships existing between four basic second-order consistencies, namely path consistency (PC), 3-consistency (3C), dual consistency (DC) and 2-singleton arc consistency (2SAC), as well as their conservative and strong variants. Interestingly, dual consistency is an original property that can be established by using the outcome of the enforcement of generalized arc consistency (GAC), which makes it rather easy to obtain since constraint solvers typically maintain GAC during search. On binary constraint networks, DC is equivalent to PC, but its restriction to existing constraints, called conservative dual consistency (CDC), is strictly stronger than traditional conservative consistencies derived from path consistency, namely partial path consistency (PPC) and conservative path consistency (CPC). After introducing a general algorithm to enforce strong (C)DC, we present the results of an experimentation over a wide range of benchmarks that demonstrate the interest of (conservative) dual consistency. In particular, we show that enforcing (C)DC before search clearly improves the performance of MAC (the algorithm that maintains GAC during search) on several binary and non-binary structured problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:09:30 GMT  (920kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3872v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["christophe lecoutre", "stephane cardon", "julien vion"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3872"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3872.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Second-Order Consistencies", "authors": ["Christophe Lecoutre", "St\u00e9phane Cardon", "Julien Vion"], "emails": ["lecoutre@cril.fr", "cardon@cril.fr", "julien.vion@univ-valenciennes.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "We provide a complete picture of the relationships between four basic second-order consistencies, namely path consistency (PC), 3-consistency (3C), dual consistency (DC) and 2-singleton arc consistency (2SAC), as well as their conservative and strong variants.

If a consistency of that consistency leads to a CN-P, we say that P is more consistent than the CN consistency. If a consistency of that consistency is not consistent, then a consistency of that consistency is nogood-identifying iff, the reason why a CN consistency is not consistent is that some consistency that is not consistent in P is identified as globally inconsistent. Such consistency corresponds to (newly identified) nogoods and is referred to as consistent (on P). A kth consistency is a nogood-identifying consistency that allows the identification of nogoods of size k, where k-1 is an integer. kth-order consistency should not be confused with k-consistency (Freuder, 1978, 1982)."}, {"heading": "3.

Relationships between Second-Order Consistencies", "text": "This section examines the qualitative relationships between the second-order consistencies that we have presented, namely path consistency, 3-consistency, dual consistency, 2-singleton arc consistency and their conservative and strong variants. This section consists of three parts (subsections). We start with relationships between second-order fundamental consistencies (PC, 3C, DC, 2SAC) and then focus on relationships, including conservative constraints (PPC, CPC, C3C, CDC, C2SAC). Finally, we conclude with strong second-order consistencies (sPC, s3C, sDC, s2SAC, sPPC, sCPC, sC3C, sCDC, sC2SAC). In our previous work (Lecoutre et al., 2007a, 2007b), our study was limited to binary CNs. In this essay, we generalize our results to CNs of any consistency, although some results are specific to CNs (if no CNs are specified)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Results on Basic Second-Order Consistencies", "text": "We start with the strongest (basic) second order consistency of this paper, namely 2SAC = DC (DC = DC).Proposition 6. 2SAC is strictly stronger than DC and strictly stronger than 3C.Proof. Let P be a CN and I = {(x, a), (y, b)} be a local consistent consistency on P | tre, if I am DC inconsistent, then either (y, b) or (x, a) GAC (P | y = b), which necessarily implies a GAC consistency on P (P = a, y = b). Consequently, I am 2SAC inconsistent, and it follows that 2SAC is stronger than DC. On the other hand, if I am 3CAC consistent then we are GAC (P)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results on Conservative Second-Order Consistencies", "text": "A first immediate result is that conservative consistencies are strictly made weaker than their unrestricted forms. However, it is worth noting that (strong) PPC is correspondingly stronger than (strong) PC on binary convex CNs with triangulated constraints (Bliek & Sam-Haroud, 1999). Proposition 10. 2SAC, DC, 3C and PC are each strictly stronger than C2SAC, CDC, C3C and PPC + CPC.Proof. By definition, conservative consistencies are weaker. Strict consistency is demonstrated by Figure 8, which shows a binary CN that is C2SAC consistent (and CDC consistent, C3C consistent, PPC consistent) but not PC consistent (and not 3C consistent, not 2SAC consistent).Proposition 11. PC, DC and 3C are not comparable to C2C."}, {"heading": "4.3 Results on Strong Second-Order Consistencies", "text": "Before examining the existing relationships between strong variants of second-order consistency, we note that, in the binary case, asserting AC on a path-consistent CN is sufficient to obtain a strong path-consistent CN. This well-known fact is also generally true for DC, CDC, 2SAC, and C2SAC. We define any local-consistent instantiation as consistent (P). We consider any local-consistent instantiation to be consistent (P)."}, {"heading": "5. An Algorithm to Enforce s(C)DC", "text": "These algorithms apply to both binary and non-binary CNs.

Conclusion", "text": "To this end, we have studied the theoretical relationships that exist between four basic second-order consistencies (and their variants), and we have shown that some of them can be reasonably enforced prior to the search. However, since in the next generation of constraint solvers, several theoretical outcomes correlate global consistency with second-order consistency (e.g. strong 3-consistency), this should increase the importance of second-order consistency. In practice, there are some advantages of using (conservative) dual consistency. Algorithms to enforce strong (C) DC are relatively easy to implement and efficient, as highly optimized underlying GAC algorithms increase consistency. In practice, there are some advantages of using (conservative) dual consistency. Algorithms to enforce strong (C) DC consistencies are relatively easy to implement and efficient because they are used in pre-processing."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This essay is an extended revised version of previous work (Lecoutre et al., 2007a, 2007b).

Another possible reason for the low practical interest for path consistency, in the discrete constraint satisfaction field, is that path consistency enforcement modifies constraint relations, and more importantly, modifies the structure of the constraint graph. When a pair of values (a, b) for the variables (x, y) is found to be path-inconsistent, this information is recorded within the constraint network; if there is no constraint binding x with y, a new one is inserted, thus changing the constraint graph. For example, the instance scen-11 of the radio link frequency assignment problem (Cabon, de Givry, Lobjois, Schiex, & Warners, 1999) involves 680 variables and 4,103 constraints. Enforcing a second-order consistency on this network could at worst create (680 2 ) \u2212 4,103 = 226,757 new constraints, which would be really counter-productive both in time and in space. The main apparent drawback of path consistency can be avoided by adopting a conservative approach, in which the search for inconsistent pairs of values is restricted to existing constraints. This is called conservative path consistency (CPC, Debruyne, 1999) when restricted to paths of length 2 in the constraint graph, and partial path consistency (PPC, Bliek & Sam-Haroud, 1999) when restricted to paths of arbitrary length in the constraint graph; CPC and PPC are equivalent when the constraint graph is triangulated. In this paper, we study path consistency as well as three other basic second-order consistencies that are 3-consistency (3C, Freuder, 1978), dual consistency (DC, Lecoutre, Cardon, & Vion, 2007a) and 2-singleton arc consistency (2SAC, Bessiere, Coletta, & Petit, 2005).

A consistency is well-behaved when for any CN P \u2208P, the set {P \u2032 \u2208P | P \u2032 is \u03c6-consistent and P \u2032 P} admits a greatest element, denoted by \u03c6(P ), that is equivalent to P and called the \u03c6-closure of P . Enforcing \u03c6 on a CN P means computing \u03c6(P ), and an algorithm that enforces \u03c6 is called a \u03c6-algorithm. The property of stability is useful for proving that a nogood-identifying consistency is well-behaved.
