For example, one may wish to maximise or minimise the number of distinct values in a solution. To formulate problems of this type, we can use soft variants of the well known AllDifferent and AllEqual constraints. We present a taxonomy of six soft global constraints, generated by combining the two latter ones and the two standard cost functions, which are either maximised or minimised. We characterise the complexity of achieving arc and bounds consistency on these constraints, resolving those cases for which NP-hardness was neither proven nor disproven. In particular, we explore in depth the constraint ensuring that at least k pairs of variables have a common value. We show that achieving arc consistency is NP-hard, however achieving bounds consistency can be done in polynomial time through dynamic programming. Moreover, we show that the maximum number of pairs of equal variables can be approximated by a factor 1/2 with a linear time greedy algorithm. Finally, we provide a fixed parameter tractable algorithm with respect to the number of values appearing in more than two distinct domains. Interestingly, this taxonomy shows that enforcing equality is harder than enforcing difference.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:11:58 GMT  (656kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3879v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["emmanuel hebrard", "d\\'aniel marx", "barry o'sullivan", "igor razgon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3879"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3879.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Soft Constraints of Difference and Equality", "authors": ["Emmanuel Hebrard", "Barry O\u2019Sullivan", "Igor Razgon"], "emails": ["hebrard@laas.fr", "dmarx@cs.bme.hu", "b.osullivan@cs.ucc.ie", "ir45@mcs.le.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

The resulting parameterized problem < A, k > is tractable with fixed parameters with respect to k if it can be solved in time f (k) \u0445 nO (1), where f (k) is a function that depends only on k.

Taxonomy", "text": "In this section, we present a taxonomy of soft constraints based on AllDifferent and AllEqual, even though it is sufficient for the cost. We consider the eight algorithmic problems related to the constraints of difference and equality defined by combining these two constraints to be two costs (graph-based and variable-based) and two goals (minimizing and maximizing). In fact, because the graph-based costs of AllDifferent and AllEqual have two extremely different problems, only six different solutions are defined. Note that we only consider costs defined by inequalities, rather than qualities. There are several reasons that we can produce two extremely different problems over the lower limit or upper limit of cost variables, and hence different algorithmic solutions. Thus, for example, we will see that in some cases the problem is transferable in one direction and NP-hard in the other direction."}, {"heading": "7.

Conversely, similarity is important for problems with a periodic aspect. For example, a timetable or schedule needs to be created on a weekly basis, but the constraints may vary slightly from week to week. In these types of problems, the similarity of solutions, that is, the similarity between each week of solutions, is a very valuable property (Groe r, Golden, & Wasil, 2009)."}, {"heading": "10.1 Hamming Distance:", "text": "The hamming distance between the instances of two variables X and Y is defined as follows: \u2206 h (X, Y) = {1 iff X 6 = Y 0 otherwise While the hamming distance between two solutions si and sj (defined by the variable sets {Xi1,..., Xin} or {X j 1,.., X j n} respectively, the hamming distance between two solutions si and sj (defined by the variable sets {Xi1,..., Xin} as follows: \u2206 h (si, sj) = \u2211 h (si, sj) \u2264 1 \u2264 '\u2264 n \u0445 h (Xi, X j') In the face of a problem P with n variables {X1,..., Xn} we duplicate P times with identical constraints if we seek a series of different solutions for P, or modified constraints to model the expected scenarios when we seek a series of similar solutions for some of the variables of substrate < see < then < the < the < then the <"}, {"heading": "10.2 Constraint Formulation:", "text": "The first approaches to this problem were based on heuristic methods (Hebrard et al., 2005; Hentenryck, Coffrin, & Gutkovich, 2009).It was also shown that, if problem P permits, knowledge compilation methods could efficiently solve this problem (Hadzic, Holland, & O'Sullivan, 2009).Here we show that an objective consistency can be achieved for maximizing this objective function (Equation 4), whereby the consistency of SoftEqualmaxG or SoftEqualmaxG constraints can be achieved for optimizing or solution similarity or diversity.Then we will see that achieving ac (or bc) on this decomposition is equivalent to achieving ac (or bc) on the global constraint."}, {"heading": "11. Conclusion", "text": "To formulate such problems, we can use soft variants of the well-known AllDifferent and AllEqual constraints. In this paper, we looked at the global constraints AllDifferent and AllEqual and their optimization variants SoftAllDiff and SoftAllEqual, respectively. In addition, we looked at two cost functions that are based either on the hamming distance to a satisfactory assignment or on the number of violations of the decomposition graph. We showed that the constraint that ensures an upper limit on the hamming distance can be efficiently propagated with a solution that meets the AllEqual constraint, both for the equality of arc and boundaries, and for consistency. Then, we showed that on the one hand, the decision on the existence of an assignment ensures the existence of a constraint on the number of violations at the hamming distance with a solution that propagates the AllEqual constraint on consistency for both the equality of arc and boundaries."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Hebrard, O'Sullivan and Razgon are supported by the Science Foundation Ireland (grant number 05 / IN / I886), Marx is partially supported by the ERC Advanced Grant DMMCA, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and the Hungarian National Research Fund (grant number OTKA 67651)."}], "references": [{"title": "Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, 4th International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning", "author": ["D.W.

Finally, finding similar solutions to a set of variants of a problem can be useful to find solutions that are robust to uncertainty. Suppose, for example, that we are to solve a Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), however, the costs associated with a set of k \u2212 1 links between pairs of cities are uncertain or variable over time. We would like to find an optimal, or near-optimal, route such that when the cost of traversing a link changes, a limited amount of re-routing is sufficient to obtain another near-optimal solution. For that purpose, one can build a similar structure as that pictured in Figure 6 by duplicating the TSP once per uncertain link, the last being the original formulation. In each duplicate, the cost of the corresponding link is then set to some expected upper bound. If we minimise the distance between solutions, we obtain a solution with good properties of robustness: if the cost associated with the ith link increases, the solution of the ith duplicate is a valid alternative avoiding this link (if it degrades the solution quality too much) whilst requiring a small amount of re-routing. We therefore want to find a set of k solutions \u2014 either pairwise similar or different \u2014 to a set of k problems, distinct or not. A heuristic method was introduced to solve the problem of finding k solutions of a constraint network, such that the minimum (resp. maximum) distance between all pairs of solutions is maximum (resp. minimum) by Hebrard, Hnich, O\u2019Sullivan, and Walsh (2005). Since reasoning on the maximum minimum distance is NPhard (Frances & Litman, 1997), it was proposed to use the sum of the Hamming distances instead.", "startOffset": 117, "endOffset": 2211}, {"referenceID": 11, "context": "The first approaches to this problem relied on heuristic methods (Hebrard et al., 2005; Hentenryck, Coffrin, & Gutkovich, 2009), It was also shown that when the problem P allows it, knowledge compilation methods could efficiently solve this problem (Hadzic, Holland, & O\u2019Sullivan, 2009).", "startOffset": 65, "endOffset": 127}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "Second, notice that the constraint networks depicted in Figure 7 are such that no two constraints share more than one variable, and there is no Berge-cycle (Berge, 1970) in the constraint hypergraph, that is, a sequence C1, X1, C2, .", "startOffset": 156, "endOffset": 169}, {"referenceID": 16, "context": "The constraint hypergraph is therefore Berge-acyclic, and in such constraint networks it was shown that propagating ac is sufficient to filter all globally inconsistent values (Janssen & Vilarem, 1988; J\u00e9gou, 1991).", "startOffset": 176, "endOffset": 214}, {"referenceID": 7, "context": "This work complements nicely some earlier results of Cohen et al.

For example, one may wish to maximise or minimise the number of distinct values in a solution. To formulate problems of this type we can use soft variants of the well known AllDifferent and AllEqual constraints. We present a taxonomy of six soft global constraints, generated by combining the two latter ones and the two standard cost functions, which are either maximised or minimised. We characterise the complexity of achieving arc and bounds consistency on these constraints, resolving those cases for which NP-hardness was neither proven nor disproven. In particular, we explore in depth the constraint ensuring that at least k pairs of variables have a common value. We show that achieving arc consistency is NP-hard, however bounds consistency can be achieved in polynomial time through dynamic programming. Moreover, we show that the maximum number of pairs of equal variables can be approximated by a factor of 12 with a linear time greedy algorithm. Finally, we provide a fixed parameter tractable algorithm with respect to the number of values appearing in more than two distinct domains. Interestingly, this taxonomy shows that enforcing equality is harder than enforcing difference.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
