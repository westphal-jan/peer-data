It is typically embedded within a search procedure (\"branch and prune\") and used at every node of the search tree to narrow down the search space, so it is critical that it be fast. The procedure invokes constraint propagators until a common fixpoint is reached, but the known algorithms for this have a pseudo-polynomial worst-case time complexity: they are fast indeed when the variables have a small numerical range, but they have the well-known problem of being prohibitively slow when these ranges are large. An important question is therefore whether strongly-polynomial algorithms exist that compute the common bound consistent fixpoint of a set of constraints. This paper answers this question. In particular we show that this fixpoint computation is in fact NP-complete, even when restricted to binary linear constraints.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:15:30 GMT  (211kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3887v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["lucas bordeaux", "george katsirelos", "nina narodytska", "moshe y vardi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3887"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3887.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Complexity of Integer Bound Propagation", "authors": ["Lucas Bordeaux", "George Katsirelos", "Nina Narodytska", "Moshe Y.

Introduction and Overview of the Main Results", "text": "Propagation is an iterative process that propagates any limitation of the problem with each iteration to narrow down the domains of its variables, and the iteration stops if no constraint changes the domains of its variables. In this case, propagation has reached a common fixed point for all constraints; this iterative algorithm guarantees that the fixed point is calculated in polynomial time when the propagation of each constraint takes polynomial time and the domains of the variables are defined as value lists. However, very often it is inconvenient or impossible to explicitly list all values: instead, the domains are defined by lower and upper limits. We focus on this representation and on variables that take integer values. In this setting, the calculation of a fixed point by the iterative algorithm requires exponential time."}, {"heading": "1.1 Bound Propagation and Slow Convergence", "text": "We illustrate the behavior of the iterative fixed point algorithm using a system of two constraints: x + y = 7, x + 1 \u2265 2y, with initial limits: x [0, 5], y [0, 10] A possible trace of the fixed point calculation is the following: The lower limit of Y is initially 0, but from the constraint x + y = 7 we deduce that y cannot take values 0 or 1, then the sum < 7, even if we fix x to its highest permitted value. Therefore, the intervals can be reduced to x [0, 5], y. \"Similarly: of x + y = 7, we deduct: x [0, 5], y [2, 7], y [2, 7] of x + 1, [2, 2] we deduct: x [3, 5]."}, {"heading": "1.2 Prior Complexity Results on Propagation", "text": "Standard propagation algorithms are iterative processes that employ \"propagators,\" i.e., narrow down the functions associated with each restriction until they reach a fixed point. Therefore, their complexity is determined by two complementary questions: Q1: How difficult is it to calculate each propagator? Q2: How difficult is it to find a common fixed point of propagators? The complexity of the propagation of constraints has been studied extremely well in a certain sense, but all the results we know for bound propagation deal only with question 1. These earlier hardness results showed that for some complex constraints we cannot have polynomial time propagators that achieve a certain degree of consistency. Two such results are: \u2022 Given a linear equality, it has been observed that the propagation of Yuanlin & Yap, 2000; Choi, Harvey, Lee, & Stuckey, 2006) is that any propagator that achieves consistency or Z bound."}, {"heading": "1.3 Our Main Results", "text": "In this paper, we look at very simple common propagators and address question 2. We show that even surprisingly simple propagators in general can lead to a fixed point calculation problem that is NP-hard. This not only explains why all standard, iterative fixed point calculation algorithms in practice have an exponential worst case, but also shows that there is unlikely to be a better worst case algorithm. In particular, an important class of simple propagators whose fixed point calculation is NP-hard is the bound (R) consistency propagator for linear constraints (Proposition 1). These are ubiquitous constraints and very weak and widespread propagators for these constraints. Many problems that use numerical calculations and large domains tend to include at least linear constraints, so there are few cases where slow convergence is avoidable."}, {"heading": "1.4 Outline", "text": "In Section 2 we summarize the required material on Constraint Satisfaction Problems and bound propagation.

Thus, we are talking about the current domain of a variable xi, as the result of it being narrowed by the application of one or more propagators. We denote from x \u2212 i the current lower limit of xi and i its current upper limited. x \u2212 i and x + i are initially limited to the initial limits of li, ui and then remain limited by li \u2212 i \u2264 x \u2212 i \u2264 x."}, {"heading": "2.3 Fixpoints", "text": "Propagators are monotonous, narrowing operators, so we can consider the problem of identifying the largest common fixed point of a set of propagators F.

There are two arithmetic problems related to fixed points: \u2022 Functional problem: Effectively calculate gfp (F); \u2022 Decision problem: Decide whether gfp (F) 6 = \u2205 F, i.e. whether there is a (non-empty) fixed point.

Let p = | F | be the number of propagators. (Note that we generally have one or more propagators per constraint, i.e. p \u2265 m.) We enter the while loop a maximum of two times, because with each new iteration we have to decrease at least one unit bound by one unit, and each time the foreach loop is entered a maximum of p p p p. Thus, overall, after a number of propagator applications, the algorithm ends with: O (npd). In other words, it is exponential in the number of bits of the encryption: This complexity can be written O (np \u00b7 2b), where b is the number of bits of the bound encryption, despite the fact that each propagator is polynomial in the size of the encryption nomial.

Therefore, the problem of the spread of inequalities is reduced to the problem of the spread of equality, and the result of NPCompletness still applies to problems whose linear constraints are all equals (or for any mixture of inequalities / inequalities). A second observation is the following: since we focus on the bound (R) consistency, the propagation obtained for an equality between 1... n aixi = c is the same as that obtained by two of these constraints / inequalities that prove to be comfortable and even."}, {"heading": "3.4 Tractable Classes of Linear Constraints", "text": "In this subsection, we identify a significant class of linear constraints that can be propagated in strongly polynomial time, based on a constraint on the coefficients of constraints. Our first observation is that one source of the complexity of propagators Li, k of equivalent 5 is that they use rounding: when we update the boundaries of a variable, we get a real value from the other variables that is rounded up for lower boundaries and up for upper boundaries. The effects of rounding have been noted by previous authors and used for optimization. 4 Also, in the case of inequalities, the propagators for bound (Z) consistency are the same as for bound (R) consistency. Since we want propagators to be polynomial-temporal predictable, this is the case we want to avoid."}, {"heading": "3.4.1 Linear Propagators without Rounding", "text": "We are looking at operators similar to those of Eq. 5, but without rounding, in other words, we are now associating the linear constraints with the following operators: Si, k: if ai, k > 0 then x \u2212 i: = max (x \u2212 i, qi, k ai, k) if ai, k < 0 then x + i: = min (x + i, qi, k, k) (9) Even if the initial boundaries are integral, as assumed in this paper, these operators will generally reduce these boundaries to real values. Note, however, that such propagators can be used effectively to deal with variables with a real range, in fact they will be used both in the Constraint Programming Community (Behamou & Granvilliers, 2006) and in the Operations Research Community, where a different terminology is used (Feasibility-Based Bounds Tightening, see e.g. Belotti, Cafieri, Lee & Liberti, 2010).The decision we are focusing on is, now, the problem of whether there is a fix."}, {"heading": "3.4.2 Linear Constraints with Unit Coefficients", "text": "A linear unit condition is of the usual form \u2211 i... n ai, kxi \u2265 ck, but with the additional restriction that each coefficient ai, k is chosen in {\u2212 1, 0, + 1}. Therefore, our introductory example of slow convergence (Eq. 1) was a (particularly simple) example of linear unit constraints, and slow convergence could be avoided in this particular case. Note: We are looking at linear unit constraints of any number of variables. A special case of unit constraints that has been widely studied is the class of unit TVPI constraints (i.e., both unit and TVPI). This is perhaps the most important class of linear constraints whose holistic feasibility can be resolved in highly polynomic time. See, for example, the work of Jaffar et al. (1994).Proposition 2 If all constraints have unit coefficients, we can solve the problem of Linear Programs. The efficiency given by LIP is, of course."}, {"heading": "3.4.3 Are There Other Tractable Cases?", "text": "Nevertheless, there are reasons to be pessimistic about the limitations of the constraint diagram: We note that the feasibility of monotonous TVPI integer programming remains complete under strict constraints of the constraint diagram NP, as demonstrated in the work of Hochbaum and Naor (1994). This suggests that such constraints are unlikely to result in interesting, tractable classes of fixed point calculation. Regarding the constraints of the coefficients, we note that the NP completeness of the (monotonous) TVPI constraints generally assumes that the coefficients ak, bk, ck are arbitrary, whereas the constraint of the unit reveals the strongest constraint on the coefficients: that their absolute value is \u2264 1. If we impose a more general constraint on these absolute values \u03b2 values, then one may wonder whether the problem of the fixed parameter traceability of future work indicates this question."}, {"heading": "4. Generalizations and Non-Linear Constraints", "text": "With Sentence 1, the fixed point calculation is insoluble for such basic and everyday numerical constraints as linear constraints. Nevertheless, several cases of nonlinear constraints are of interest. First, we show that if we add the simplest possible type of polynomial (a single square operation) to linear constraints, our overall hardness result can be strengthened. Second, it is interesting to note that when we add simple minimum or maximum constraints to linear constraints, the fixed point calculation corresponds to a puzzling open problem recently discussed in the theoretical literature.

We have also shown that even if the propagators themselves are very simple, the fixed point calculation used in these algorithms can be complex, it is actually NP-complete, even for a very limited constraint class - linear monotonous inequalities with two variables per inequality. We have also looked at some special classes of constraints, such as square constraints and maximum constraints of Bosie."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Preliminary results from Bordeaux, Hamadi and Vardi (2007) showed the NP completeness of diffusion in the case where square constraints are considered (Prop. 3).This 5.
