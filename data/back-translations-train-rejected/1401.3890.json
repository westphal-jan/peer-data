In earlier work, it was observed that the optimal relaxation heuristic h+ has amazing qualities in many classical planning benchmarks, in particular pertaining to the complete absence of local minima. The proofs of this are hand-made, raising the question whether such proofs can be lead automatically by domain analysis techniques. In contrast to earlier disappointing results -- the analysis method has exponential runtime and succeeds only in two extremely simple benchmark domains -- we herein answer this question in the affirmative. We establish connections between causal graph structure and h+ topology. This results in low-order polynomial time analysis methods, implemented in a tool we call TorchLight. Of the 12 domains where the absence of local minima has been proved, TorchLight gives strong success guarantees in 8 domains. Empirically, its analysis exhibits strong performance in a further 2 of these domains, plus in 4 more domains where local minima may exist but are rare. In this way, TorchLight can distinguish easy domains from hard ones. By summarizing structural reasons for analysis failure, TorchLight also provides diagnostic output indicating domain aspects that may cause local minima.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:16:17 GMT  (578kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3890v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["joerg hoffmann"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3890"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3890.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Analyzing Search Topology Without Running Any Search: On the Connection Between Causal Graphs and h+", "authors": ["J\u00f6rg Hoffmann"], "emails": ["joerg.hoffmann@inria.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

An Illustrative Example", "text": "The basic connection between causal graphs and h + topology - more precisely, between support graphs, domain transition graphs = and h + topology - is relatively relaxed. It is instructive to understand this first before delving into the full results. Figure 2 shows fragments of domain transition graphs (DTGs) of three variables x0, x1 and x2. All DTG transitions are assumed to be invertable here and have no side effects. The imaginary reader is invited to think of x0 as a car whose battery is currently empty and which therefore requires the help of two people, x1 and x2, to push it. People can also solve different parts of the task for other purposes, but here we are only looking at the partial problem of achieving the target x0 = g0. We want the x0 transition t0, which has the two conditions c1 and c2. These conditions are not currently met."}, {"heading": "4.

In (A), section 5, we identify the circumstances in which we can deduce from an optimal, relaxed plan that a monotonous exit path exists. In (B), section 6, we develop a sufficient criterion that implies that an analysis (A) will always be successful. Technique (B) is subject to TorchLight's conservation analysis methods, i.e., guaranteed global analysis (I) and guaranteed local analysis (II), as described at the end of section 2. By feeding techniques (A) with the usual relaxed plans as calculated, and by the heuristic function of FF, we obtain TorchLight's closer local analysis (III). This analysis does not guarantee (and just because) FF's loose plans are not guaranteed, we give an optimal reading."}, {"heading": "5.

Overall, our test set contains 1160 instances.

To assess this more accurately, we look at Table 2, which shows the timing of the various stages of TorchLight, and the other planners / tools. The translator runtime sometimes takes considerable, with a peak of 690.59 seconds in the most expensive instance of the scanalyzer domain. However, this is quite exceptional, which translates the timing of the different stages of TorchLight, and the other planners / tools. The translator runtime sometimes takes considerable, with a peak of 690.59 seconds in the most expensive instance of the scanalyzer domain. This is quite extraordinary, but the most expensive domain is block nowadays, with a peak of 138.33 seconds in the first instance of the most expensive domain."}, {"heading": "8.5 Analyzing Domains", "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "8.6 Predicting Planner Performance", "text": "As a direct measure of the \"predictive quality\" of success rates, we have conducted preliminary experiments = 69 years old = 69 years old for the behavior of primitive classifiers and runtime distributions for large and small success rates. We look first at the classifiers. They say that a planning task to determine whether EHC / FF / LAMA will be successful in solving the task is within the Given17. Note that we cannot use the \"valley rate\" instead in a cheap domain analysis, since determining whether it lies on a valley means finding a plan for solving the task as a side effect. The classifiers answer \"yes\" iff the success rate is more than a threshold T in 0, 10, 100. Obviously, to do this, we need R > 1. We look at what follows only R = 10 and R = 100 because, as shown above, R = 1000 can be costly.

It seems as if sufficient criteria for the absence of localminima, such a diagnosis is not guaranteed to identify domain features that cause their presence. Nevertheless, at least for analysis with Theorem 2, the diagnosis can be fairly accurate, however. The current diagnostic device is merely a first implementation based on the notification of all pairs (operator o0, variable x) that an oDG + has caused for o0 in order to be unsuccessful. That is, we report on the pair (o0, x) when o0 has an effect on x, and a constellation taken by o0 is contained in R + 1 C0, and is not recoverable by a sub-sequence of P + > 0 (s). In short, we record (o0, x) when o0 has a harmful effect on x."}, {"heading": "9. Related Work", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "10.

A special thanks goes to Carlos Areces and Luciana Benotti for inspiring this work in the first place. I abandoned this problem long ago.

In earlier work, it was observed that the optimal relaxation heuristic h has amazing qualities in many classical planning benchmarks, in particular pertaining to the complete absence of local minima. The proofs of this are hand-made, raising the question whether such proofs can be lead automatically by domain analysis techniques. In contrast to earlier disappointing results \u2013 the analysis method has exponential runtime and succeeds only in two extremely simple benchmark domains \u2013 we herein answer this question in the affirmative. We establish connections between causal graph structure and h topology. This results in low-order polynomial time analysis methods, implemented in a tool we call TorchLight. Of the 12 domains where the absence of local minima has been proved, TorchLight gives strong success guarantees in 8 domains. Empirically, its analysis exhibits strong performance in a further 2 of these domains, plus in 4 more domains where local minima may exist but are rare. In this way, TorchLight can distinguish \u201ceasy\u201d domains from \u201chard\u201d ones. By summarizing structural reasons for analysis failure, TorchLight also provides diagnostic output indicating domain aspects that may cause local minima.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
