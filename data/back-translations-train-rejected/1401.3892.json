To propose measurement points, previous work employs a heuristic based on reducing the entropy over a computed set of diagnoses. This approach generally has good performance in terms of diagnostic cost, but can fail to diagnose large systems when the set of diagnoses is too large. Focusing on a smaller set of probable diagnoses scales the approach but generally leads to increased average diagnostic costs. In this paper, we propose a new diagnostic framework employing four new techniques, which scales to much larger systems with good performance in terms of diagnostic cost. First, we propose a new heuristic for measurement point selection that can be computed efficiently, without requiring the set of diagnoses, once the system is modeled as a Bayesian network and compiled into a logical form known as d-DNNF. Second, we extend hierarchical diagnosis, a technique based on system abstraction from our previous work, to handle probabilities so that it can be applied to sequential diagnosis to allow larger systems to be diagnosed. Third, for the largest systems where even hierarchical diagnosis fails, we propose a novel method that converts the system into one that has a smaller abstraction and whose diagnoses form a superset of those of the original system; the new system can then be diagnosed and the result mapped back to the original system. Finally, we propose a novel cost estimation function which can be used to choose an abstraction of the system that is more likely to provide optimal average cost. Experiments with ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits indicate that our approach scales to all circuits in the suite except one that has a flat structure not susceptible to useful abstraction.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:16:38 GMT  (805kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3892v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sajjad ahmed siddiqi", "jinbo huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3892"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3892.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Sequential Diagnosis by Abstraction", "authors": ["Sajjad Siddiqi", "Jinbo Huang"], "emails": ["sajjad.ahmed@seecs.edu.pk", "jinbo.huang@nicta.com.au"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

In addition, for each component, we must specify how its output relates to its input and health mode. A conditional probability table (CPT) for each component does this job. For example, the CPT shown at the bottom (right) of Figure 2 defines the behavior of Tor J: Each entry indicates the probability that its output (J) is a certain value giving the value of its input (P) and the value of its health variable (okJ). In the case of okJ = 1, the probabilities are always 0 or 1 as the behavior of a healthy gate is deterministic. The case of okJ = 0 defines the error model of the gate, which is also part of the input to the diagnostic task.

Consider the partial circuit in the dotted box as an example that can be modeled as the following formula: okJ \u2192 (J), okA (J), D), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (D), D (D), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S), D (S)."}, {"heading": "4. Hierarchical Sequential Diagnosis", "text": "An optimal solution for sequential diagnosis would be a policy, i.e. a plan of action based on previous measurements, with each path of the plan leading to a system diagnosis (Heckerman et al., 1995). Since the calculation of optimal guidelines is generally insoluble, we follow the heuristic selection of measurement points approach as in previous work. Let's start with a definition of Shannon's entropy, defined in terms of a probability distribution of a discrete random variable X extending over values x1, x2,... Formally, it is maximum if all probabilities Pr (X = xi) are equal and minimal, if one of the probabilities is 1, which corresponds to our intuitive notion of the degree of uncertainty."}, {"heading": "4.1 Baseline Approach", "text": "In order to be able to calculate probabilities efficiently and accurately after successful d-DNNF compilation, we now propose a new two-part heuristics that circumvents this scalability limitation.

While the uncertainty about the value of the variables is captured, we can also interpret it as the expected amount of information gain provided by the measurement of the variables. Therefore, our first idea is to select a variable with maximum entropy for the measurement at each step."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Improving Heuristic Accuracy", "text": "However, this idea alone did not work very well in our initial experiments, and as subsequent experiments would confirm, this is largely due to the fact that the (implicit) space of all diagnoses is generally very large and can include a large number of unlikely diagnoses, which tends to jeopardize the accuracy of the information gained from entropy. Experiments to confirm this explanation are also as follows. If the d-DNNF composition is made, and before it is used to calculate probabilities, we prune the d-DNNF graph so that models (satisfactory variable allocations) that correspond to diagnoses with more than k broken components.1 We place the initial k on the number of actual errors in the experiments and observe that a significant reduction in diagnostic costs resulted in almost all cases. This improved performance is apparently due to the fact that the intersection of all probabilities has been updated, eliminating many probable variables."}, {"heading": "4.1.3 The Algorithm", "text": "We begin with the coding of the system as a logical formula, as discussed in Section 3, where a subset of variables is associated with numbers representing the previous error probabilities and probabilities in the error models of the components, which are then described in d-DNNF \u2206.The entire sequential diagnostic procedure that we propose is summarized in Algorithm 1. the inputs are a System C, the d-DNNF composition of which is described in Section 4.1.2, and is not required for diagnosis using our hierarchical approach), a set of known values y of variables, and a holistic k, which specifies the error cardinality (this is for the operation of the model pruning experiments described in Section 4.1.2, and is not required for diagnosis using our final1.

An example of a cone is shown in Figure 1. The goal is to use a single health variable and failure probability for the entire cone, which significantly reduces the size of the coding and the difficulty of assembling it. Once a cone is identified as faulty in the top-level diagnosis, it can be compiled and diagnosed in a recursive way.We will now give a formal definition of the abstraction from our previous work:"}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Abstraction of System", "text": "The abstraction is based on the structural dominators (Kirkland & Mercer, 1987) of a system. A component X dominates a component Y or X is called a dominator of Y, if any path from Y to any output of system X. A cone corresponds exactly to the set of components dominated by a component. A cone can contain additional cones that lead to a hierarchy of cones. A system can be abstracted by treating all the maximum cones in it as black boxes (a maximum cone is one that is either not contained in any other cone or contained in exactly one other cone that represents the entire system). In our example, cone A can be treated as a virtual gate with two inputs {P, D} and output A. The abstraction of a system can be formally defined as: definition 1 (abstraction of the system)."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Propositional Encoding", "text": "We begin with a discussion of the hierarchical coding for probabilistic thinking, similar to the hierarchical coding presented in our previous work (Siddiqi & Huang, 2007). Specifically, in diagnosing the abstraction AC of the given system C, health variables are associated only with the components AC / IC representing the gates {A, B, D, K, V} in our example (IC stands for the quantity of inputs of system C). Thus, gate J in Figure 1 is not associated with a health variable, since J is a wire rooted on the cone. Consequently, only the nodes representing the components AC / IC will have health nodes associated with them in the corresponding Bayesian network. Therefore, the node okJ is removed from the Bayesian network in Figure 2, because J is an internal wire to the cone rooted in A."}, {"heading": "4.2.3 Prior Failure Probabilities for Cones", "text": "If a cone is treated as a single component, its previous failure probability as a whole can be calculated taking into account the previous probabilities of components and cones within the cone. We do this by making two copies \u2206 h and \u2206 f of the cone, where \u2206 h only models the healthy behavior of the cone (without health variables) and \u0394f also includes the erroneous behavior (i.e. the complete encoding described in Section 3.2). The results of both values are summarized in an XOR-gate X (if the output of XOR-gate X is equal to 1, both inputs must be different in value), and then we calculate the probability Pr (X = 1) indicating the probability that the results of \u0445h and \u0445f are different."}, {"heading": "4.2.4 Measurement Point Selection and Stopping Criteria", "text": "In principle, the heuristic variables for the measurement and the stop criteria are the same as in the base line approach. < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < &lt"}, {"heading": "4.2.5 The Algorithm", "text": "The inputs are a system C, a set of known values uC of variables at the inputs IC and outputs OC of the system, and again the optional integer k, which indicates the error cardinality bound for the purpose of experimenting with the effect of the model selection.

Abstract diagnosis B is then used to obtain a concrete diagnosis D in a loop (lines 4-14).

The abstract system model concludes that the value 1 at A is abnormal given the values of P and D. Thus, the algorithm concludes that there is an error at A. Note that Q = 1 and D = 1 suggest the presence of another error beside A, which triggers the measurement of gate B, which is also faulty. The abstract diagnosis {A, B} fulfils the stop criteria in relation to the abstract circuit. We then enter the diagnosis of cone A by a recursive call with observation uA = {P = 1, B = 1, A = 1, A = 1}. The diagnosis of cone A immediately indicates that the cone E is faulty."}, {"heading": "5. Component Cloning", "text": "In the previous section, we proposed an abstraction-based approach to sequential diagnosis that reduces the complexity of composition and diagnosis by reducing the number of system components to be diagnosed. We now go a step further and aim to manage systems that are so large that they remain insoluble even after abstraction, as is the case for the largest circuits in the ISCAS 85 benchmark suit.Our solution is a novel method that systematically modifies the structure of a system to reduce the size of its abstraction. In particular, we choose a component G with parents P (a component X is a parent of a component Y, and Y is a child of X, if the output of Y is an input of X) that is not part of a connection and therefore cannot be strayed away."}, {"heading": "5.1 Choices in Component Cloning", "text": "There are two possibilities when cloning components: What components do we clone, and how many clones do we create, and how do the parents share them? Since the goal of cloning is to reduce the abstraction size, it is clear that we only want to clone those components that are in the abstraction (i.e., not within cones), among which cloning the root of a cone cannot reduce the abstraction size, since it destroys the existing cone by reintroducing some of the components within the cone into the abstraction. For example, cloning D according to Figure 4 will produce a circuit in which D and its clone are gone, but B will no longer be dominated by D, and thus the last candidates for cloning will be reintroduced into the abstraction."}, {"heading": "5.2 Diagnosis with Component Cloning", "text": "The new system is functionally equivalent to the original and has a smaller abstraction, but is not equivalent to the original for diagnostic reasons. As the new model allows a component and its clones to fail independently, it is a loosening of the original model, since the diagnoses of the new system constitute a superset of diagnoses of the original. Specifically, any diagnosis of the new system that assigns a component the same state of health, and its clones for all components correspond to a diagnosis of the original system; other diagnoses are inauthentic and must be ignored. The core diagnostic process specified in Algorithm 2 is still applicable to the new system, requiring only two minor modifications. First, the incorrect diagnoses are (implicitly) filtered out, assuming that the same state of health is useless for all clones (including the original) of a component once the state of health of one of these components is known."}, {"heading": "6.

Since the version of gde available to us is unable to handle these circuits to provide a systematic reference point for comparison, we have implemented a random strategy in which a random sequence of measurement points is generated for each circuit and used for all test cases. This strategy also uses the d-DNNF to verify whether the stop criteria were metric. Table 2 shows the comparison between the random strategy and sda using the baseline approach with two different heuristics, with one based on entropy of wires alone (ew) and the other also based on error probabilities (fp).

Again, all errors occurred during the creation phase. Note that some observations do not result in sufficient simplification of the theory for it to be successfully compiled even after abstraction.

The classical gde framework, on receiving an abnormal observation Xo = xo, considers the Shannon\u2019s entropy of the probability distribution over a set of computed diagnoses, which is either the set of minimum-cardinality diagnoses or a set of probable/leading diagnoses. It proposes to measure a variable X whose value will reduce that entropy the most, on average. The idea is that the probability distribution over the diagnoses reflects the uncertainty over the actual faults, and the entropy captures the amount of this uncertainty. After a measurement is taken the entropy is updated by updating the posterior probabilities of the diagnoses, potentially reducing some of them to 0. The results reported by de Kleer et al.

To propose measurement points, previous work employs a heuristic based on reducing the entropy over a computed set of diagnoses. This approach generally has good performance in terms of diagnostic cost, but can fail to diagnose large systems when the set of diagnoses is too large. Focusing on a smaller set of probable diagnoses scales the approach but generally leads to increased average diagnostic costs. In this paper, we propose a new diagnostic framework employing four new techniques, which scales to much larger systems with good performance in terms of diagnostic cost. First, we propose a new heuristic for measurement point selection that can be computed efficiently, without requiring the set of diagnoses, once the system is modeled as a Bayesian network and compiled into a logical form known as d-DNNF. Second, we extend hierarchical diagnosis, a technique based on system abstraction from our previous work, to handle probabilities so that it can be applied to sequential diagnosis to allow larger systems to be diagnosed. Third, for the largest systems where even hierarchical diagnosis fails, we propose a novel method that converts the system into one that has a smaller abstraction and whose diagnoses form a superset of those of the original system; the new system can then be diagnosed and the result mapped back to the original system. Finally, we propose a novel cost estimation function which can be used to choose an abstraction of the system that is more likely to provide optimal average cost. Experiments with ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits indicate that our approach scales to all circuits in the suite except one that has a flat structure not susceptible to useful abstraction.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
