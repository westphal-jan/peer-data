We are now introducing translations that loosen this semantic property (i.e., we switch to exact translations. As a first example, we consider a translation for stg \u21d2 sem that is both applicable and embedding, but not exact. This is in contrast to the translation Tr2, which is more accurate for a concrete application, but not embedded. As we will see in Section 5, it is impossible to provide a translation that is both embedded and exact for stg \u21d2 sem, so one has to decide which property is more important for a concrete application. The translation Tr5 (F) is defined as Tr5 (F) as Tr5 (A), R), whereas A (A), A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A (A), A, A, A, A, A, A, A (A) (A) (A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A (A) (A, A, A, A, A) (A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A () (A, A) (A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A (), A (A, A, A, A, A, A (A), A, A (A), A, A (A), A (A, A, A, A, A, A (A), A, A, A, A (A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A (), A, A, A, A (), A (A, A, A, A, A (), A (A, A, A (A), A, A, A (), A (A, A, A, A, A (), A, A, A, A, A (), A, (and (A (A)."}, {"heading": "5.

Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we examine interpretations between different semantics for abstract reasoning, focusing on translations that are efficiently predictable and faithful (with some relaxation due to certain differences implicit in semantics).An overview of our results is given in Table 2.3. However, the entry in the \u03c3 series and in the \u03c3 \"column reads as follows:\" We have found an efficient (weak) exact translation for the exact reasoning for the distribution of arguments. \"An entry divided into two parts, e.g.\" Tr8 / - means that we have found an efficient (weak) faithful translation, but there is no exact translation. \"We mention an obvious one obvious problem."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) within the framework of the funding programme ICT08-028.
