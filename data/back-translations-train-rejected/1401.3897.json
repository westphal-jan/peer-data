These results also yield a form of interpolation for ground logic programs under the answer sets semantics. For disjunctive logic programs we also study the property of uniform interpolation that is closely related to the concept of variable forgetting. The first-order version of equilibrium logic has analogous Interpolation properties whenever the collection of equilibrium models is (first-order) definable.

Furthermore, HT is one of exactly seven superintuitionist propositional logic that possesses the interpolation property (Maksimova, 1977; Gabbay & Maksimova, 2005). For languages without functional symbols, Ono showed that interpolation in the logic maintains QHT's quantified here and there with constant domains (Ono, 1983).

Interpolation in Propositional Equilibrium Logic", "text": "In this section we will deal with the interpolation in equilibrium logic.

Interpolation in Quantified Equilibrium Logic", "text": "We now turn to the logic of the first order and therefore cannot define it in QHTs. In the usual way, we say that a collection of models of the first order is a collection of models of the first order. [...] A key element in the proofs of Propositions 7 and 8 is the existence of a formula of the first order that defines the collection of equilibrium models. [...] In other words, EML (...) (...) we do not need to be definable in the first order for the arbitrary order. This fact is not difficult to show. [...] Like Ferraris et al. (2007), we have pointed out that the general form of the answer must be programmed where first order formulas are allowed, and a quantified equilibrium logic is expressive, the property of the transitive closure. [...] This property is not definable in the classical logic of the first order, and therefore it cannot be defined in QHTs either."}, {"heading": "5. An Illustration: Interpolation for Safe Formulas", "text": "How restrictive is the definition assumption? Is it often fulfilled in practice? In fact, non-definable classes of answer sentences do not play an essential role in mainstream answer set programming, whose language equilibrium logic covers and extends all or part of a program (see next section). The reason for this is that in answering questions existing solvers rely on grounding models that define all or part of a program before calculating the intended models or solutions. The grounding process essentially eliminates variables and reduces the original program to expressive form. In such practical cases, the collection of stable or equilibrium models will then be definable. In general, for this computational approach to work, syntactical limitations must be imposed on permissible programs or theories. The most common form of limitation is called safety. For standard types of logical programs based on rules, a rule is considered safe if every variable that appears in the rule is also free in its body."}, {"heading": "5.1 General Concept of Safety", "text": "For the rest of this section, we assume that all languages are function-free."}, {"heading": "5.2 Interpolation", "text": "Based on sentence 12, we could already establish interpolation theorems for safe formulas in Prenex form by essentially replacing these formulas with their grounded versions and working in propositional logic.

An Application of Interpolation", "text": "Interpolation property has been applied in various areas of computer science, particularly in software specification (Bicarregui et al., 2001) and in the construction of formal ontologies (Lutz & Wolter, 2010), both of which are relevant to modularity issues. However, when two theories produce the same answers for a given query language, we can call them inseparable; this term is used in mathematical logic as well as in the study of formal ontologies (Lutz & Wolter, 2010)."}, {"heading": "8. Uniform Interpolation and Forgetting", "text": "A stronger form of interpolation, known as uniform interpolation, is also important for certain applications in computer science (Konev et al., 2009). As usual, we are interested in uniform interpolation if (9) there is a uniform interpolation that contains only predicate and constant symbols belonging to both sides. Now, the difference is that uniform interpolation is a uniform interpolation, but it fails in the first order of classical logic and in many non-classical logic. A logic that is supposed to have uniform interpolation properties if such uniform interpolants exist for all, \u03b2.In classical propositional logic, uniform interpolation holds, but it fails in the first order of classical logic. It can hold if certain limitations are placed on the theoretical language in which it is formulated and on the query language that \u03b2. For example, it has been shown that it is held for some descriptions."}, {"heading": "8.1 Extending the Query Language", "text": "If we establish a uniform interpolation in ASP by applying the method of forgetting as defined by Eiter and Wang (2008), it seems clear that we cannot trivially extend the meaningfulness of the query language L. Since the method of forgetting a of E (once a has been removed) cancels non-minimal quantities, an atom b could be true in any equilibrium model of the query language, but not in any equilibrium model of forgetting. Therefore, we could have a disjunction, say a disjunction, derivable from E (as soon as a), but not from forgetting. Likewise, we cannot generally extend programs with variables in a first order setting to existential queries. On the other hand, the property of a uniform interpolation certainly applies to any L (V), even without the condition that V (b) is equally important."}, {"heading": "9. Literature and Related Work", "text": "The interpolation theorem for classical logic is based on Craig (1957); however, it was extended by Schu \ufffd tte (1962) to intutionist logic. Maksimova (1977) characterized the superintuitionist propositional logic that interpolation possesses. A noteworthy exception is an article (Amir, 2002) that specifies some interpolation properties for paraphrasing and standard logic. By the well-known relationship between the response theorems of disjunctive programs and the extensions of corresponding standard theories, he also derives a form of interpolation for the ASP. In terms of response semantics, Amir's approach differs significantly from ours. Because it is based on an analysis of standard logic, he uses classical logic as the basis for interpolation."}, {"heading": "10. Conclusions", "text": "We discussed two types of interpolation properties for non-monotonous inference relations and showed that these properties in turn apply to the two different inference relations that we can associate with propositional equilibrium logic. In any case, we take advantage of the fact that the collection of equilibrium models in HT logic can be defined from here and there, and that this logic has the usual form of interpolation. In many cases, one of the forms of inference investigated seems to be a suitable concept to link it to the programming of response sets, although ASP systems are generally not tailored to answering or deduction of queries. On the basis of the results of Eiter and Wang (2008) on variable forgetting in ASP, we were also able to show how the property of uniform interpolation applies to disjunctive programs and a restricted query language. We also discussed the interpolation properties for first-order equilibriums, the results of a quantified version of HT and the results of a quantified HT are certainly not considered in this case."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "David Pearce is partially supported by the MEC projects TIN2009-14562-C05-02 and CSD200700022.

Similarly, the interpretation of queries containing quantifiers in answer set semantics should also conform to that of equilibrium logic, taking account of any specific restrictions, such as Herbrand models, that might be imposed. We can therefore transfer interpolation properties from equilibrium logic to answer set semantics and ASP. It remains to consider whether |\u223cAS is best identified with the closed world version of inference, |\u223ccw, or the more open world version, |\u223cow. Again, since ASP solvers do not generally implement inference engines, the difference is largely a theoretical one. In traditional logic programming, however, a query that does not belong to the language of the program is usually answered false. It also seems quite natural in an ASP context that, given a program \u03a0 and a query Q, one should consider the stable models of \u03a0 in the language L(\u03a0)\u222aL(Q) even if this is a proper extension of the language of \u03a0.10 So in general |\u223ccw seems a natural choice for answer set inference. On the other hand, there are contexts where answer set semantics is used in a more open world setting, for example in the setting of hybrid knowledge bases (Rosati, 2005) where non-monotonic rules are combined with ontologies formalised in description logics. For such systems a semantics in terms of equilibrium logic was provided by de Bruijn, Pearce, Polleres and Valverde (2007).
