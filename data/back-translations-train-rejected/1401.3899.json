We provide algorithms that use this dominance relationship to identify the set of preferred collections. We show that under certain conditions, the algorithms are guaranteed to return only (solid), all (complete) or at least one (weakly complete) of the preferred collections.

In contrast, we develop a formalism that can solve the practicality of the collection as a whole based on the attributes of the objects that make up the collection and algorithms for identifying the preferred collection (s) among those that meet the requirement. We also show how the problems can be solved by solving the formalism based on Binshtok et al. also in our formalism (see Section 7.3.2).

However, the problem of comparing compositions (as opposed to comparing components) in terms of attribute preferences is complicated by the fact that the evaluation of a composition is a function of the evaluation of its components. Our approach to developing preference formalism is the following. First, in view of a composition and the evaluation of its components in terms of attributes, we obtain the aggregated evaluation of the composition in terms of each attribute. Finally, we build a preference relationship in terms of all qualities on which all compositions are preferred."}, {"heading": "3.1 Aggregating Attribute Valuations across Components", "text": "In order to think about the evaluations of the components themselves, it is necessary to obtain the evaluation of a composition in relation to each attribute Xi in relation to its components.

In other words, if C = W1 is the evaluation of the components W2. Then VC is a function of only {VW1, VW2,. VWn}.

DesJardins et al. (2005) have considered the problem of finding subsets that are optimal in terms of user-specific quantitative preferences by presenting a set of attributes in terms of desired depth, property weight and diversity for each attribute. In contrast, our framework focuses on qualitative preferences. In our setting, preferences, depth preferences that can be assigned to qualitative preferences, can be assigned to relative preferences."}, {"heading": "7.3.3 Database Preference Queries", "text": "Several authors (Bo \ufffd rzso \ufffd nyi et al., 2001; Chomicki, 2003; Kiessling & Kostler, 2002; Kiessling, 2002) have explored techniques to integrate user-specific preferences about the results of queries of relationship-related database queries. For example, Chomicki's Frame (2003) includes user preferences about each attribute of a relationship that can be expressed as the first order of logical formulas. Suppose Sq is the set of tuples that correspond to a query q. For each attribute of Xi's of SQi, a subset of tuples that have the most preferred value (s) for Xi, it is determined, and the result of the query q is then given by Sqi. A similar framework for expressing and combining user preferences is presented by Kiessling (2002) and Kiessling and Kostler (2002)."}, {"heading": "7.3.4 Planning with Preferences", "text": "The classic planning problem is to find a sequence of measures that lead a system from an initial state to one of the states that fulfil the goal set by the user. Preferential planning refers to the problem of finding plans that are most favored in terms of a set of user preferences over the plans. Such preferences are usually expressed concise in terms of preferences over the properties satisfied by the plans in the target or intermediate state or over actions or action sequences (i.e. temporal characteristics of the plans). We refer the interested reader to surveys by Baier et al. (2008b) and Bienvenu et al. (2011) for an overview of qualitative and quantitative preference languages used in the preference planning, and various algorithms for calculating the most preferred characteristics of plans. Preferential planning can be considered a problem, the preferred composition in a composite system in which the compositions correspond to the implementable measures and feasible compositions."}, {"heading": "8.

The preferences over objects are in turn used to reason about preferences over collections of those objects. This scenario can be simulated by our framework, by introducing a single attribute whose valuations correspond to objects in the domain. DesJardins et al.

(2009) have presented a language for specification of preferences over sets of objects. This framework, in addition to intra-attribute and relative importance preferences over attributes, allows users to express preferences over the number (|\u03c6|) of elements in a set that satisfy a desired property \u03c6. The preference language in this case allows statements such as \u201cSi : |\u03c6| REL n\u201d (number of elements in the preferred set with property \u03c6 should be REL n), \u201cSj : |\u03c6| REL |\u03c8|\u201d (number of elements in the preferred set with property \u03c6 should be REL number of elements in the preferred set with property \u03c8), etc., where REL is one of the arithmetic operators >,<,=,\u2265,\u2264 and n is an integer. In addition, there can be relative importance between the various preference statements such as \u201cSi is more important than Sj\u201d as well as external cardinality constraints such as a bound on the number of elements in the preferred set. Our formalism can accommodate such preference statements, by representing each preference statement Si as a new binary valued attribute in the compositional system. For example, preference statements Si : |\u03c6| \u2265 n and Sj : |\u03c6| \u2264 |\u03c8| can be represented in our formalism by creating new binary attributes Xi and Xj with intra-attribute preferences 1 \u227bi 0 and 1 \u227bj 0 respectively. The relative importance statements such as \u201cSi is more important than Sj\u201d can then be directly mapped to Xi \u22b2 Xj . Any external cardinality constraints on the size of the preferred set can be encoded in our setting by functional requirements, so as to restrict the feasible solutions to only those that satisfy the cardinality constraints.

We develop a formalism that lets users express the relative importance among attributes and qualitative preferences over the valuations of each attribute. We define a dominance relation that allows us to compare collections of objects in terms of preferences over attributes of the objects that make up the collection. We establish some key properties of the dominance relation. In particular, we show that the dominance relation is a strict partial order when the intra-attribute preference relations are strict partial orders and the relative importance preference relation is an interval order. We provide algorithms that use this dominance relation to identify the set of most preferred collections. We show that under certain conditions, the algorithms are guaranteed to return only (sound), all (complete), or at least one (weakly complete) of the most preferred collections. We present results of simulation experiments comparing the proposed algorithms with respect to (a) the quality of solutions (number of most preferred solutions) produced by the algorithms, and (b) their performance and efficiency. We also explore some interesting conjectures suggested by the results of our experiments that relate the properties of the user preferences, the dominance relation, and the algorithms.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.96dev Copyright 2007 Radical Eye Software"}}}
