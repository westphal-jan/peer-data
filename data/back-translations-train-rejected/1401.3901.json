Nonmonotonic description logics have been studied for many years, however no practical such knowledge representation languages exist, due to a combination of semantic difficulties and high computational complexity. Independently, low-complexity description logics such as DL-lite and EL have been introduced and incorporated in the OWL standard. Therefore, it is interesting to see whether the syntactic restrictions characterizing DL-lite and EL bring computational benefits to their nonmonotonic versions, too. In this paper we extensively investigate the computational complexity of Circumscription when knowledge bases are formulated in DL-lite_R, EL, and fragments thereof. We identify fragments whose complexity ranges from P to the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, as well as fragments whose complexity raises to PSPACE and beyond.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:20:50 GMT  (560kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3901v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["piero a bonatti", "marco faella", "luigi sauro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3901"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3901.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Defeasible Inclusions in Low-Complexity DLs", "authors": ["Piero A.

Introduction", "text": "The ontologies at the core of the semantic web - as well as ontology languages such as RDF, OWL, and related Description Logics (DLs) - are based on fragments of first-order logic and inherited strengths and weaknesses of this well-established formalism. However, limitations include monotonicity and the resulting inability to design knowledge bases (KBs) by describing prototypes whose general characteristics can later be refined with appropriate exceptions. This natural, iterative approach is often used by biologists and calls for an extension of DLs with defective traceability (a mechanism normally supported by object-oriented languages).Some workarounds have been designed for specific cases, but no general solutions are currently available (Rector, 2004; Stevens, Aranguren, Wolstencroft, Sattler, Drummond, Horridge, & Rector, 2007)."}, {"heading": "2.

Nonmonotonic description logics have been studied for many years, however no practical such knowledge representation languages exist, due to a combination of semantic difficulties and high computational complexity. Independently, low-complexity description logics such as DL-lite and EL have been introduced and incorporated in the OWL standard. Therefore, it is interesting to see whether the syntactic restrictions characterizing DL-lite and EL bring computational benefits to their nonmonotonic versions, too. In this paper we extensively investigate the computational complexity of Circumscription when knowledge bases are formulated in DL-liteR, EL, and fragments thereof. We identify fragments whose complexity ranges from P to the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, as well as fragments whose complexity raises to PSPACE and beyond.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
