However, there are good reasons for considering belief change in less expressive logics as well. In this paper we build on recent investigations by Delgrande on contraction for Horn logic. We show that the standard basic form of contraction, partial meet, is too strong in the Horn case. This result stands in contrast to Delgrande's conjecture that orderly maxichoice is the appropriate form of contraction for Horn logic. We then define a more appropriate notion of basic contraction for the Horn case, influenced by the convexity property holding for full propositional logic and which we refer to as infra contraction. The main contribution of this work is a result which shows that the construction method for Horn contraction for belief sets based on our infra remainder sets corresponds exactly to Hansson's classical kernel contraction for belief sets, when restricted to Horn logic. This result is obtained via a detour through contraction for belief bases. We prove that kernel contraction for belief bases produces precisely the same results as the belief base version of infra contraction. The use of belief bases to obtain this result provides evidence for the conjecture that Horn belief change is best viewed as a hybrid version of belief set change and belief base change. One of the consequences of the link with base contraction is the provision of a representation result for Horn contraction for belief sets in which a version of the Core-retainment postulate features.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:21:09 GMT  (267kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3902v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["richard booth", "thomas meyer", "ivan varzinczak", "renata wassermann"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3902"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.3902.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On the Link between Partial Meet, Kernel, and Infra Contraction and its Application to Horn Logic", "authors": ["Richard Booth", "Thomas Meyer", "Ivan Varzinczak", "Renata Wassermann"], "emails": ["richard.booth@uni.lu", "tommie.meyer@meraka.org.za", "ivan.varzinczak@meraka.org.za", "renata@ime.usp.br"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Firstly, he showed that the move to Horn logic leads to two different types of contraction functions, referred to as entailment-based contraction (e-contraction) and inconsistency-based contraction (icontraction), which coincide in the full propositional case. Secondly, he showed that Horn contraction for belief sets does not satisfy the controversial Recovery postulate, but exhibits some characteristics that are usually associated with the contraction of belief bases (arbitrary sets of sentences). And finally, Delgrande made a tentative conjecture that a version of Horn contraction usually referred to as orderly maxichoice contraction is the appropriate method for contraction in Horn theories. While Delgrande\u2019s partial meet constructions are appropriate choices for contraction in Horn logic, we show that they do not constitute all the appropriate forms of Horn contraction. Moreover, as referred to above, although Horn contraction is defined for Horn belief sets, it is related in some ways to contraction for belief bases, an aspect which has not yet been explored properly in the literature. In this paper we continue the investigation into contraction for Horn logic, and address both the issues mentioned above, as well as others. Focusing on Delgrande\u2019s entailmentbased contraction, we start by providing a more fine-grained construction for belief set contraction which we refer to in this paper as infra contraction.

However, there are good reasons for considering belief change in less expressive logics as well. In this paper we build on recent investigations by Delgrande on contraction for Horn logic. We show that the standard basic form of contraction, partial meet, is too strong in the Horn case. This result stands in contrast to Delgrande\u2019s conjecture that orderly maxichoice is the appropriate form of contraction for Horn logic. We then define a more appropriate notion of basic contraction for the Horn case, influenced by the convexity property holding for full propositional logic and which we refer to as infra contraction. The main contribution of this work is a result which shows that the construction method for Horn contraction for belief sets based on our infra remainder sets corresponds exactly to Hansson\u2019s classical kernel contraction for belief sets, when restricted to Horn logic. This result is obtained via a detour through contraction for belief bases. We prove that kernel contraction for belief bases produces precisely the same results as the belief base version of infra contraction. The use of belief bases to obtain this result provides evidence for the conjecture that Horn belief change is best viewed as a \u2018hybrid\u2019 version of belief set change and belief base change. One of the consequences of the link with base contraction is the provision of a representation result for Horn contraction for belief sets in which a version of the Core-retainment postulate features.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
