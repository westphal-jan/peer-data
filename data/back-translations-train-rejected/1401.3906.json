Two Game-Theoretic Interpretations of P", "text": "What does it mean that the uncertainty of an agent is characterized by a series of probability distributions? How should we understand P? We give P a game theory interpretation here: namely, that an opponent can choose a distribution from the P.4 series, but this does not mean that we have to define the game completely if the opponent makes the choice. We consider twice that the opponent can choose: the first is before the agents observe the value of X, and the second is after. We formalize this as two different games in which we take the \"opponent\" to be an accountant. We call the first game the P game. It is defined as follows: the bookmaker chooses a distribution Pr-P. 2 The value x of the distribution is chosen according to the nature of PrX and observed by both booksellers. The agent chooses an action from A. 4. The value of the Y distribution is chosen according to Pr-X."}, {"heading": "4.

Calibration", "text": "In this section we will look at the effects of the calibration required. We will then examine the link between calibration and some of the other conditions we have previously considered, in particular the conditions that P convex and P = < P >.8Calibration is typically defined in terms of empirical data. We will consider linking calibration not as a description of empirical data, but as a definition of true distribution. We want to define calibration in such a setting. In the case that P is a singleton, this has already been done, for example, by Vovk, Gammerman and Shafer (2005)."}, {"heading": "7. Discussion and Related Work", "text": "We have studied how uncertainty is represented by a series of probability distributions, where we motivate different strategies for different rules of the game with respect to the Minimax criterion. Our key innovation was to show how different approaches to a game between a bookmaker and an agent can be understood. We believe that this game theory approach should prove useful in a more general understanding of different approaches to updating. In fact, after the publication of the conference version of this paper, we learned that Ozdenoren and Peck (2008) can apply the same kind of approach to analyzing dynamic situations related to the Ellsberg (1961). How we, Ozdenoren and Peck resolve apparent time inconsistency by describing the decision problem as a game between an agent and a bookmaker (called \"malevolent nature\")."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "A preliminary version of this paper appears in Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, Proceedings of the Eighteenth Conference, 2008, entitled \"A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Updating Sets of Probabilities.\" This paper extends the conference version in several respects.
