This is an example of a bipartite tournament. In this paper, we consider the problem of reducing the total travel distance of bipartite tournaments, by analyzing inter-league scheduling from the perspective of discrete optimization. This research has natural applications to sports scheduling, especially for leagues such as the National Basketball Association (NBA) where teams must travel long distances across North America to play all their games, thus consuming much time, money, and greenhouse gas emissions. We introduce the Bipartite Traveling Tournament Problem (BTTP), the inter-league variant of the well-studied Traveling Tournament Problem. We prove that the 2n-team BTTP is NP-complete, but for small values of n, a distance-optimal inter-league schedule can be generated from an algorithm based on minimum-weight 4-cycle-covers. We apply our theoretical results to the 12-team Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league in Japan, producing a provably-optimal schedule requiring 42950 kilometres of total team travel, a 16% reduction compared to the actual distance traveled by these teams during the 2010 NPB season.

Introduction", "text": "Consider a tournament with two teams X and Y, each with n players. In a two-part tournament, players from Team X compete against players from Team Y, with the aim of determining the superior team. Typical of the players {x1, x2,.., xn} and {y1, y2,., but we represent each match by the pair ordered (xi, yj), with indices showing both teams on Day 2, 2,.., n}. The Davis Cup is an example of a two-part tournament in which each country represents a tennis squad consisting of two singles and one doubles team. Their games are five games played between the two countries, with the doubles teams playing on Day 2, y1), (x2, y2) on Day 1 and (x2, y2), (x2), (x2, y1) on Day 3. Another example is the biennial Ryder Cup Championship, where the United States and Europe teams consist of the two-part competition."}, {"heading": "2.

Similar to the original TTP, we need a compact double round robin bipartite tournament scheduling that meets the following conditions: (a) most-three: No team can have a home or road trip of more than three games.

In the NPB, teams are divided into two six-team leagues, with each team playing 120 intraleague- and 24 inter-league games during the regular season. Intra-league issues were recently analyzed by the authors (Hoshino & Kawarabayashi, 2011c), with a multiround generalization of the league based on Dijkstra's shortest-distance algorithm to reduce total travel distances by over 60,000 kilometers (a 25% reduction) compared to the 2010 NPB intra-league schedule (Hoshino & Kawarabayashi, 2011d).

Each NBA team plays 82 regular season games, of which 30 are within the NBA (with one home game and one away game against each of the 15 teams from the other conference). In this theoretical problem, we assume that all interleague games take place in the regular season, as is currently done in the Japanese NPB. We will also enforce all restrictions of the BTTP, including no team that has a home record or a road trip of more than 3 games."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we introduced the two-tier equestrian tournament problem and applied it to two professional sports leagues in Japan and North America that have a uniform weight distribution of the two tournaments in Japan and North America, illustrating the richness and complexity of the two-tier tournament planning. In Section 4, we introduced two heuristics that allowed us to solve BTTP for the n = 6 NPBs. While Proposition 2 only applies to certain 12-team configurations that fulfill a specific geometric property, we point out that Proposition 1 is a general technique that can be applied to other planning problems. Our \"pre-spread reduction\" method breaks down a complex problem into a large number of scenarios and uses each scenario as a global constraint to reduce the search space. We are confident that Proposition 1 can be applied to more complicated problems in sports planning. In Section 5, we have determined an algorithm that produces a solution approaching BTTP = the NBA 15."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research), the C & C Foundation, the Kayamori Foundation, and the Inoue Research Award for Young Scientists."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.", "text": "There is only one function left that is a valid truth assignment, i.e., a function for which we have a p-rooted 4-cycle coverage of KS with exactly 3k (p, a, u, p) cycle coverage of KS with exactly 3k (p, b, p) cycles, which ensures that each p-cycle coverage of Cj is evaluated for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2k cycles.
