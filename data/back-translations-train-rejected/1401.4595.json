Due to the importance of these problems, providing scalable solution schedules for RCPSP/max problems is a topic of extensive research. However, all existing methods for solving RCPSP/max assume that durations of activities are known with certainty, an assumption that does not hold in real world scheduling problems where unexpected external events such as manpower availability, weather changes, etc. lead to delays or advances in completion of activities. Thus, in this paper, our focus is on providing a scalable method for solving RCPSP/max problems with durational uncertainty. To that end, we introduce the robust local search method consisting of three key ideas: (a) Introducing and studying the properties of two decision rule approximations used to compute start times of activities with respect to dynamic realizations of the durational uncertainty; (b) Deriving the expression for robust makespan of an execution strategy based on decision rule approximations; and (c) A robust local search mechanism to efficiently compute activity execution strategies that are robust against durational uncertainty. Furthermore, we also provide enhancements to local search that exploit temporal dependencies between activities. Our experimental results illustrate that robust local search is able to provide robust execution strategies efficiently.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:04:55 GMT  (1179kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4595v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["na fu", "hoong chuin lau", "pradeep r varakantham", "fei xiao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.4595"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.4595.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Robust Local Search for Solving RCPSP/max with Durational Uncertainty", "authors": ["Na Fu", "Hoong Chuin Lau", "Pradeep Varakantham", "Fei Xiao"], "emails": ["na.fu.2007@phdis.smu.edu.sg", "hclau@smu.edu.sg", "pradeepv@smu.edu.sg", "feixiao@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Adjustable Variables (also known as recourse variables) are wait-and-see variables that can adjust themselves when a portion of the uncertain data becomes known. For example, in a planning problem such as RCPSP with uncertain task duration, the non-adjustable variables represent the execution policy, such as the POS proposed by Policella, Smith, Cesta and Oddi (2004), which must be constructed a priori, while the customizable variables are linked to the actual start times of the tasks that are determined in terms of execution policies and dynamic realizations of uncertainty."}, {"heading": "2.2 RCPSP/max", "text": "We now describe the deterministic RCPSP / max planning problem together with the extension to handle permanent uncertainties.

Within a POS, each activity maintains a set of practicable start times, but with the flexibility to respond to unexpected disturbances.

Below we discuss three subcategories of papers that deal with creating flexible schedules."}, {"heading": "8.2.1 Dynamic Controllable Techniques", "text": "An STNU is dynamically controllable (Vidal & Fargier, 1999) when there is a solution that can always be instantiated incrementally based on the results of random edges in the past. An execution strategy that uses dynamic controllability is required to generate an incremental solution based on the subsequent exposure of random events. Morris and Muscettola (2005) proposed a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to handle the dynamic controllability of STNUs based on Constraint Satisfaction. Techniques have been proposed by Wah and Xin (2004) to optimize the limits of the duration of random edges so that the resulting STNU is dynamically controllable."}, {"heading": "8.2.2 Redundancy-based Techniques", "text": "Redundancy-based planning is another proactive technique for planning. The idea is to create a schedule that includes the allocation of additional resources and / or time into the plan so that these buffers help absorb the effects of unforeseen events without rescheduling during execution. Davenport, Gefflot and Beck (2001) proposed techniques to create robust schedules based on the insertion of time bottlenecks of critical activities that are allocated to potentially fragile resources. Lambrechts, Demeulemeester and Herroelen (2010) analytically determined the expected increase in activity duration due to a resource breakdown. Based on this information, simulation-based time buffers were used to protect the schedule from disruptions caused by resource availability."}, {"heading": "8.2.3 Partial Order Schedule (POS)", "text": "In place of the initial plan, another line of work is to consider the design of good schedules, such as the concept of sub-ordination plans (POS) defined by Policella et al. (2004), which aims to maintain temporal flexibility whenever the constraints of the problem allow it and can often absorb unexpected deviations from predictable assumptions, looking at robustness measures such as fluidity and flexibility. POS generation is another example of such flexible approaches: a subset of sequence decisions is made offline and the remaining decisions are made online using a distribution rule (Bidot et al., 2009). Different methods of generating POS have been compared in terms of the robustness of the resulting schedules in the work of Rasconi, Cesta and Policella (2010). In our work, we apply the concept of POS as an execution guideline."}, {"heading": "8.3 Scenario-based Optimization in Scheduling", "text": "Another set of work dealing with planning under uncertainty is based on the use of scenarios (scenario-based optimisation).For example, Kouvelis, Daniels and Vairaktarakis (2000) introduced the concept of robustness into planning problems, looking at uncertain processing times and suggested methods to create a robust timetable based on the maximum absolute deviation between the robust solution and all possible scenarios within a given scenario.One shortcoming of this approach is that all scenarios are known in advance and that the scenario space is usually exponentially large. Worth mentioning are the two terms solution stability and quality robustness, whereby the robustness (or stability) of the solution refers to the insensitivity of the actual start times, whereas the robustness of quality refers to the insensitivity of the solution quality (i.e. lack of multi) compared to different scenarios (i.e., failure) of the solution in 2005 (Leukaemia & Optimisation)."}, {"heading": "8.4 Robust Optimization in Scheduling", "text": "Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (2002) and Bertsimas and Sim (2003) proposed robust optimization models that do not require assumptions about the underlying probability distribution of the data. Often, the idea is to approach the data uncertainty by a detectable (convex) uncertainty theorem, and optimization is performed on this theorem. Hence, a robust counterformulation as a conical optimization problem (e.g. second-order cone) that can be solved in polynomial time. However, few papers have reported on the application of robust optimization to planning, mainly due to the high degree of combination character of the problem. Such an application is the problem of process planning in chemical engineering, such as the work of Janak, Lin and Floudas (2007) and Li and Ierapetritou (2008)."}, {"heading": "9. Conclusion", "text": "Faced with a risk of 0 < \u03b5 \u2264 1, selected by the planner, we investigated the problem of determining the minimum (1 \u2212 \u03b5) guaranteed macespan (i.e. the robust macespan) and proposed methods for setting a schedule policy (POS), so that when uncertainty is dynamically realized, the execution policy will lead to a solution whose value is as good as the robust macespan. First, we introduced a new decision rule that is used in planning to set the start times for all activities related to the execution policy and dynamic realizations of the data uncertainty. Based on the decision rule, a new fitness function was derived to evaluate the robustness, which was eventually integrated into a local search framework to produce the solution with robust macespan. Experimental results illustrate the improved performance of the local search with the new fitness assessment, which has narrower limits for robust macespan and better subset of work schedules, rather comparing the existing method to the variation of work time."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This paper extends previous research by Lau, Ou and Xiao (2007) and Fu, Varakantham and Lau (2010) and thanks all reviewers for their insightful comments."}], "references": [{"title": "Executing production schedules in the face of uncertainties: A review and some future directions", "author": ["H.

Due to the importance of these problems, providing scalable solution schedules for RCPSP/max problems is a topic of extensive research. However, all existing methods for solving RCPSP/max assume that durations of activities are known with certainty, an assumption that does not hold in real world scheduling problems where unexpected external events such as manpower availability, weather changes, etc. lead to delays or advances in completion of activities. Thus, in this paper, our focus is on providing a scalable method for solving RCPSP/max problems with durational uncertainty. To that end, we introduce the robust local search method consisting of three key ideas: (a) Introducing and studying the properties of two decision rule approximations used to compute start times of activities with respect to dynamic realizations of the durational uncertainty; (b) Deriving the expression for robust makespan of an execution strategy based on decision rule approximations; and (c) A robust local search mechanism to efficiently compute activity execution strategies that are robust against durational uncertainty. Furthermore, we also provide enhancements to local search that exploit temporal dependencies between activities. Our experimental results illustrate that robust local search is able to provide robust execution strategies efficiently.", "creator": " TeX output 2012.01.03:1019"}}}
