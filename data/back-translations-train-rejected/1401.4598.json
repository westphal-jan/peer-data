Correctness of SAS+ Based Encoding", "text": "It is important to prove the correctness of the proposed encoding by proving that SASE for SAS + planning has the same solution space as PE for STRIPS planning. Specifically, we show that the SAT instance from SASE is satisfactory for a given planning task and a given time step N only if the SAT instance from PE is satisfactory. At this point, we assume the correctness of the PE encoding in SatPlan06 (Kautz et al., 2006) for STRIPS planning. PE (\u207b, N) denotes the PE formula corresponding to the N-step planning problem.

SAT Solving Efficiency on Different Encodings", "text": "In Section 4, we have shown that PE and SASE are semantically equivalent because they share the same solution space. In this section, we will examine what distinguishes them in terms of the efficiency of the SAT solution. In particular, we want to understand how PE and SASE induce a SAT solver to behave differently in the same planning task. Modern SAT solvers, which all use many sophisticated techniques nowadays, are too complicated to be characterized by simple models. In general, it is difficult to accurately estimate the time it takes for a SAT solver to solve a SAT instance. In this section, we will provide an explanation of why SAT codes from SASE are more efficient for SAT solvers than SAT codes from PE and provide empirical evidence to support this explanation."}, {"heading": "5.1 VSIDS Heuristic in SAT Solving", "text": "The SAT solvers we use are based on the Conflict Driven Clause Learning Framework. A decision variable refers to the variable selected as the next variable for branching. Once a decision variable is selected, more variables could be fixed by the propagation of units. Arrangement of decision variables significantly influences the efficiency of problem solving. Most existing complete SAT algorithms use variants of VSIDS heuristically (Moskewicz et al., 2001) rather than their variable arrangement strategy. VSIDS heuristic essentially evaluates a variable by using the exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the number of times (frequency) they appear in all clauses. This frequency value changes as a result of the clauses learned. Therefore, VSIDS uses a smoothing scheme that periodically scales down the values of all variables to reflect the significance of recent changes in frequencies. This frequency variable is altered because of the clauses we learned. Therefore, VSIDS uses a smoothing scheme that reflects the values of all variables downscales (EMA) in order to reflect the significance of the most recent changes in frequencies."}, {"heading": "5.2 Transition Variables versus Action Variables", "text": "Let us first formulate how the frequency of a variable is measured. In the face of a SAT instance (V, C), for each variable V, we define a function h (v) to specify the frequency of v. That is, h (v) is the number of clauses that v), for which all variables in V are sorted by their h values in descending order, and study the variables over a certain h value. Definition 8 (v) h value variable set of the SAT instance (V, C), for an h number of variables in V (v), which we define V (h) as the variables over a certain h value. Definition 8 (v) h value variable in the SAT instance (V, C), for an h value variable in the SAT instance (V)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Branching Frequency of Transition Variables", "text": "In Section 5.2, we looked at the difference between transition variables and action variables in relation to the h-values. However, as mentioned above, heuristic VSIDS periodically update the heuristic values of all variables, and the dynamic update of heuristic values is not covered by the above analysis. In the following, we present more direct empirical evidence to show that transition variables are indeed more frequently chosen as action variables for branching, especially in the early stages of the SAT solution. That is, an SAT solver spends most of his time deciding on a suitable transition plan. This analysis takes into account VSIDS \"dynamic updating strategy. We test empirically the probabilities that transition variables and action variables are chosen as branching variables. We measure for each k successive decision variables, the number of transition variables (M\u03b4) and action variables (Mo) that are selected as decision variables."}, {"heading": "5.4 Transition Index and SAT Solving Speedup", "text": "The behavior of the transition variables, as shown above, suggests that there is a correlation between the importance of the transition variables and the acceleration that SASE achieves. Nevertheless, the study on the branching of frequency only shows the connection by showing what happens during the SAT solution. Another interesting study should show what leads to the acceleration in a more direct way. To quantify the analysis, we note that the transition processes in the population can be led to the following definition of the transition index.Definition 11 (Transition Index). Faced with a planning problem SAT instance (V, C), we measure the top p variables, and calculate the transition index of p as follows."}, {"heading": "6. Reducing the Encoding Size of SASE", "text": "We now propose several techniques to further reduce the size of the SAT instances in SASE. First, we represent all the mutual exclusions in SASE through a more compact clique representation. Afterwards, we develop a few new techniques to recognize the special structures of SASE and further reduce the encoding size."}, {"heading": "6.1 Mutual Exclusion Cliques", "text": "Mutual exclusions in SASE, of course, define cliques of transitions or actions in which at most one of them can be true at any time. There are two types of cliques: 1) for each x-X, T (x) is a clique of transitions forced by the clauses of class E, and 2) for each transition phase \u03b4 that does not prevail, A (\u03b4) is a clique of actions forced by the clauses of class H. It requires O (n2) clauses to encode all mutexes within a clique of size n in pairs. To reduce the number of clauses used, we use a compact representation in SASE (Rintanen, 2006) in which auxiliary variables and n-logn clauses are used. For cliques with a capital n, the reduction in the number of clauses will be significant. To show how it works, let's look at a simple example."}, {"heading": "6.2 Reduction Techniques", "text": "Action variables form the majority of all variables and, even when using client technology, result in many clauses that represent mutual exclusions. Therefore, it is important to reduce the number of action variables. We propose three methods when observing a specific structure of an SAS + planning task."}, {"heading": "6.2.1 REDUCING SUBSUMED ACTION CLIQUES", "text": "We observe that many action liqueurs share common elements, while transition liqueurs do not. Below, we will discuss the case in which one action liqueurs is a subset of another. Considering two transitions \u03b41 and \u03b42, if A (\u03b41) A (\u03b42), we say that clique A (\u03b41) is subsumed by clique A (\u03b42). In pre-processing, for each transition \u03b41 \u04482, we check whether A (\u03b41) is subsumed by another action clique. If so, we do not encode action liqueurs A (\u03b41). In particular, if A (\u03b41) = A (\u03b42) is for two transitions \u03b41 and \u03b42, we need only encode one of them. Table 2 shows the number of cliques and their average size before and after the reduction of action liqueurs on some representative problems. The reduction is significant in most problem areas, except for drilogs, where no reduction has occurred."}, {"heading": "6.2.2 UNARY TRANSITION REDUCTION", "text": "Since a is the only action that \u03b4 supports, they are logically equivalent. For each such action a, we remove Va, t and replace it with U\u03b4, t, for t = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, N. An effect of this reduction on some representative domains can be seen in Table 3."}, {"heading": "6.2.3 UNARY DIFFERENCE SET REDUCTION", "text": "In addition to simple transition variables, an action variable can also be eliminated by two or more transition variables. A common pattern is the following: If for all actions in A (\u03b4) Trans (A), Trans (a)\\ I | = 1 Trans (I) is set, we call the action set A (\u03b4) a simple difference clause. Consider a transition \u03b41 with A (\u03b41) = {a1, a2,..., a}. If A (\u03b41) is a simple difference set, the transition sets must have the following form: Trans (a1) = {\u03b41, \u03b42,. In this case, a reduction variable can be replaced by a reduction variable."}, {"heading": "7. Experimental Analysis and Results", "text": "We tested all the STRIPS domain problems in IPC-3 to IPC-6. PSR and philosophers were not considered because they derived facts that none of the planners tested could handle correctly. We used Fast-Down's parser (Helmert, 2006, 2008) to generate SAS + formalism from STRIPS inputs. SASE's pre-processing and encoding parts were implemented in Python 2.6. All instances were based on grounded STRIPS. In almost all cases, the problem solving took much longer than pre-processing, so we only reported the total runtime. We ran all the experiments on a PC workstation with a 2.3 GHz AMD quad-core Opteron processor. Runtime for each instance was set to 1800 seconds and memory was limited to 4GB."}, {"heading": "7.1 Comparison Results", "text": "Most of them are able to survive themselves, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "7.2 Ablation Study", "text": "Figure 8 shows the number of solvable problems from all problems in IPC-3 to IPC-6. Runtime was the total time including preprocessing and problem solving. Memory usage was based on the status report of Precosat. Below the maximum CPU time (1800 s) and the memory limit (4Gb) when both clique display and reduction techniques were not used, SASE solved 398 instances. By activating clique display or action reduction techniques, SASE solved 416 and 405 instances, respectively. When clique and action reduction techniques were enabled, SASE solved 426 instances. The reduction method improved both the problem resolution time and clique display. The clique display resulted in a significant improvement in memory consumption followed by action reduction. The number of clauses resulted in a significant reduction in the variable."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions and Future Research", "text": "In this paper, we developed a novel SAS + -based SAT encoding scheme SASE and demonstrated that it improves the efficiency of STRIPS-based SAT encodings in terms of both time and memory. SASE has clear advantages over modern SAT-based planners, as our experimental analysis showed. We proved the accuracy of SASE encoding by showing that there is an isomorphism between SASE's solution plans and SatPlan06's solution plans. We went on to analyze SASE's search space structure and explain why it is more efficient."}, {"heading": "8.1 Other Semantics and Encodings", "text": "The split plot representation (Kautz & Selman, 1992; Ernst et al., 1997) uses a combination of several variables to represent a plot, but the optimism is lost. Robinson et al. (2009) propose a new way of dividing without sacrificing optimism, and the results show that this method has advantages over SatPlan06 (Kautz et al., 2006) There are many published papers with in-depth analysis or improvements along this line of research on SatPlan family coding, in particular the power of mutual exclusion in the context of planning as SAT, which has attracted interest (Chen et al., 2009; Sideris & Dimopoulos, 2010).A new coding scheme called SMP is proposed that maintains the merits of Londex and the merits of existing coding plans."}, {"heading": "8.2 Additional Techniques for Planning as SAT", "text": "The enormous amount of bilingual clauses (such as the mutual exclusion clauses in the case of planning) presents a key challenge for approaches based on satisfaction tests. It has been proposed to reduce the burden of coding by recognizing certain structures (Brafman, 2001). In traditional SAT planning systems such as SatPlan06, the mutual exclusions are encoded square. Rintanen proposes a protocol size representation (Rintanen, 2006), called clique representation, for the mutual exclusion limitations, and later a linear size one (Rintanen et al., 2006). Mutual exclusions in SASE are represented by the clique representation. The protocol size of client representation is said to be less compact than the linear coding. However, our results have shown that SASE is generally more compact (SASE et al., 2006). This is mainly due to the compactness of SAS + formalism."}, {"heading": "8.3 More Understanding of Structure in General SAT Instances", "text": "It is therefore interesting and important to understand why SAT solutions work well in certain cases, and beyond what makes an SAT instance easy or difficult. There is much previous research that attempts to gain such an understanding, including Backdoor Set (Williams, Gomes, & Selman, 2003) and Backbone (Monasson, Zecchina, Kirkpatrick, Selman, & Troyansky, 1999; Zhang, Rangan, & Looks, 2003; Zhang, 2004). Backdoor Set Variables are a set of variables, so when these variables are assigned, the assignments of other variables can be derived in polynomial time. Backbone variables are those that have the same mapping in all valid solutions, which can be further exploited to improve SAT solution efficiency."}, {"heading": "9.

The existing planning as satisfiability techniques usually use encodings compiled from STRIPS. We introduce a novel SAT encoding scheme (SASE) based on the SAS+ formalism. The new scheme exploits the structural information in SAS+, resulting in an encoding that is both more compact and efficient for planning. We prove the correctness of the new encoding by establishing an isomorphism between the solution plans of SASE and that of STRIPS based encodings. We further analyze the transition variables newly introduced in SASE to explain why it accommodates modern SAT solving algorithms and improves performance. We give empirical statistical results to support our analysis. We also develop a number of techniques to further reduce the encoding size of SASE, and conduct experimental studies to show the strength of each individual technique. Finally, we report extensive experimental results to demonstrate significant improvements of SASE over the state-of-the-art STRIPS based encoding schemes in terms of both time and memory efficiency.", "creator": "gnuplot 4.4 patchlevel 0-rc1"}}}
