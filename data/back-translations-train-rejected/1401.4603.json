Introduction", "text": "The main purpose of an ontology in a human-like interaction system is to unify the representation of each concept in relation to the corresponding terms, as well as other concepts with which there is a semantic relationship. Furthermore, the ontological component should also be able to perform certain inference processes, such as calculating the semantic similarity between concepts. The subject of similarity has been and is widely studied in the fields and literature of computer science, psychology and linguistics. Good benchmarks are necessary for several techniques, including the derivation of information, clustering of data, discourse of translation and automatic adaptation to the schema."}, {"heading": "2.

Proposal", "text": "This paper proposes and evaluates a similarity measurement based on the combination of individual similarity measurements according to each of the explained dimensions (see section 3). This combination is produced as a training on numerous observations that influence the weight with which each dimension contributes to the final decision. However, training can be carried out according to different criteria. On the one hand, different human subjects base their assessments on different combinations of dimensions. On the other hand, the nature of the concept determines the most relevant dimension for each comparison. For example, if the concept of \"scanner\" is compared with the concept of \"printer,\" the type of dimension could be very influential, since both are types of computer periphery; however, the restrictive dimension might not be so influential because they are related to different actions. The opposite may happen with the concepts of \"teacher\" and \"tutorial,\" because both are related to similar actions according to the restrictive dimension, such as \"teaching,\" while the type of dimension has little influence in this case."}, {"heading": "4.1 Inference Mechanisms", "text": "This subsection describes the method for calculating the degree of similarity between two predetermined concepts in an ontology. As the ontological knowledge is structured into different dimensions, the measure of similarity will also be based on these dimensions. Therefore, partial similarity calculations will be performed for the previously described essential, compositional, restrictive and descriptive dimensions. The resulting general similarity between the two concepts results from the calculation of the weighted average of the five partial similarities, with Ss, Sc, Se, Sr and Sd being the measures of similarity according to the variety, compositional, essential, restrictive and description dimensions respectively. The values w1, w2, w3, w4 and w5 represent the weights assigned to each dimension, so that the resulting total similarity between the two concepts is a value between 0 (completely different concepts) and 1 (the two concepts are identical)."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 SIMILARITY ACCORDING TO SORT DIMENSION", "text": "The sort dimension represents the is _ a relationship between concepts. This dimension has a polytree structure that allows a concept to be a descendant of more than one concept. Similarity in this dimension is often calculated as being proportional to the intersection of the list of precursors of both compared concepts in terms of the total size of these lists. To define this measure, a variation of the edge-counting technique was used - specifically, the conceptual similarity measure defined in the work of Wu and Palmer (1994). For two concepts, C1 and C2, this measure can be defined so that N1 and N2 are the number of ancestors of C1 and C2, while N3 is the number of common ancestors of C1 and C2 (in the most advantageous tree, if several are found in the polytree)."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 SIMILARITY ACCORDING TO COMPOSITIONAL DIMENSION", "text": "The compositional dimension represents the partial relationship between the concepts. Therefore, the most appropriate method for calculating the similarity between two concepts on the basis of this dimension must be the comparison of the parts (or components) of these concepts. Furthermore, the calculation must also take into account the fact that a concept may consist of required and optional concepts. This detail is important in calculating the similarity, since greater weight must be given to the necessary components occurring in both concepts, while less weight is given to the optional components; the resulting similarity between two concepts, C1 and C2, in terms of the compositional dimension is obtained by applying the formula: where N1 is the number of common components resulting from the intersection of all components of the concept C1 with the components of the concept C2 of the required type; N2 is the number of common components resulting from the intersection of all components of the concept C1; N3 is the number of components required C1 and C2 and, finally, the number of the common component C2 and the number of the common component."}, {"heading": "4.1.3 SIMILARITY ACCORDING TO ESSENTIAL DIMENSION", "text": "The Essential Dimension contains a set of abstract concepts that define generic types of concepts (such as plot, entity, abstraction, circumstance or attribute).This generic classification often influences human speakers in estimating similarities. Some other work on similarity calculation suggested that concepts are comparable only if they are included in the same category of the WordNet taxonomy (RiTa.WordNet, 2008).Such an approach gives this dimension a critical value without taking into account the rest of the classification.The method proposed here for calculating the similarity between two concepts C1 and C2 in the Essential Dimension is based on the intersection of their essential ancestors (ancestors within the subset of essential concepts).The method for calculating the similarity between two concepts C1 and C2 in the Essential Dimension is based on the intersection of their essential ancestors (ancestors within the Essential Concepts)."}, {"heading": "4.1.4 SIMILARITY ACCORDING TO RESTRICTIVE DIMENSION", "text": "The restrictive dimension is defined between a concept representing an action and another concept representing an entity. Similarity in this dimension is calculated differently, depending on the type of concepts to be compared. Therefore, two different measures of similarity exist for the dimension: the comparison of two actions and the comparison of two entities. Similarity between two concepts representing an entity is based on the action concepts that both entities have in common. The formula used to calculate this similarity in the comparison of two entities, C1 and C2, is defined if M1 and M2 are the number of common actions that have a positive or negative restrictive relationship with the entities C1 and C2 respectively. Values N1, N2, N3 and N4 each represent the total number of actions that have a positive relationship with the entity C1, a negative relationship with the entity C1, a positive relationship with the entities C2 and a negative relationship with the entities C2 and a relationship with the entities."}, {"heading": "4.1.5 SIMILARITY ACCORDING TO DESCRIPTIVE DIMENSION", "text": "The Description Dimension represents the relationship between a concept, an attribute, and a value in a specific domain. For concept pairs (C1, C2) representing a unit, the applicable formula is calculated differently, where N1 is the number of common attributes assigned a default value, N2 is the number of common attributes whose value is the same for both entities, and N3 is the number of common attributes with the same value, with one of them assigned by default. M1 and M2 correspond to the total number of attributes associated with the concepts C1 and C2. If both concepts (C1, C2) are attributes, these attributes (C2) are defined, the formula to be applied is defined as a domain."}, {"heading": "4.2 Preliminary Experimentation", "text": "Before the proposal was tested, a number of preliminary experiments were carried out to refine it and gain a first perspective on its validity, using a series of similarity measures carried out by a total of 20 pairs of terms evaluated by 17 human subjects; this data set is described in more detail in Section 5.1. Specifically, the individual impact of each dimension on its similarity was tested by a series of experiments in which each of them was involved at least once. As there is no combination of them, there is no need for training either. Figure 7 shows a field diagram representing the error measurements generated individually for each dimension.Figure 8 shows that in a series of twenty pairs, each dimension produced better predictions than the other. In fact, in almost half of the cases, the essential dimension provided the best answer, while the descriptive dimension was best in only one case. This fact may lead to the conclusion that the basic design was adequate and that the descriptive dimension was weak."}, {"heading": "4.3 Weights Training Methods", "text": "This year, more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country and in which it is a country."}, {"heading": "5.

However, these suppositions are rarely true in the majority of ontologies. For this reason, several strategies have been proposed in response to this fact. One example of such a strategy is the weighting of edges according to their hierarchical depth or the use of node density and link type (Richardson, Smeaton & Murphy, 1994). Nevertheless, these strategies do not solve the aforementioned problems due to the fact that terms at the same depth do not necessarily have the same specificity and that edges at the same level do not necessarily represent the same semantic distance. The second, or node-based, method relies on the comparison of the properties of the terms involved which can be related to the terms themselves, their ancestors or their descendants. A commonly used concept in these methods is that of information content (IC), providing a measure of how specific and informative a term is. The IC of a term c can be quantified as the negative log-likelihood, IC = -log p(c), where p(c) is the probability of the occurrence of c in a specific corpus, generally being estimated by its annotation frequency. Another approach employed to obtain the IC is based on the number of children a term has in the ontological structure (Seco, Veale & Hayes, 2004). The concept of IC can be applied to the common ancestors of two terms in order to quantify the information they share and, thereby, measure their semantic similarity. In this way, two main approaches exist. The first is the most informative common ancestor (MICA) technique in which only the common ancestor with the highest IC is considered (Resnik, 1995). The second is the disjoint common ancestor (DCA) technique in which all disjoint common ancestors are considered (the common ancestors that do not subsume any other common ancestor). In one definition (Lin, 1998), the similarity between two concepts using the node-based method has been expressed as the ratio between the amount of information needed to state the commonality between the two concepts and the information needed to fully describe them. Moreover, a similarity measure for hierarchical ontologies called ontology structure-based similarity (OSS) has also been defined (Schickel-Zuber, 2007) and whose major ingredient is the computation of an a-priori score of a concept c, (APS(c)), which shares some similarities with IC (i.e., both are calculated from the topology and structure of the ontology reflecting the information contained within and between the concepts). Additionally, several hybrid methods have also been defined in an attempt to improve the results of both techniques defined above.

In order to facilitate this calculation, a similarity function is proposed based on five dimensions (sort, compositional, essential, restrictive and descriptive) constituting the structure of ontological knowledge. The paper includes a proposal for computing a similarity function for each dimension of knowledge. Later on, the similarity values obtained are weighted and aggregated to obtain a global similarity measure. In order to calculate those weights associated to each dimension, four training methods have been proposed. The training methods differ in the element to fit: the user, concepts or pairs of concepts, and a hybrid approach. For evaluating the proposal, the knowledge base was fed from WordNet and extended by using a knowledge editing toolkit (Cognos). The evaluation of the proposal is carried out through the comparison of system responses with those given by human test subjects, both providing a measure of the soundness of the procedure and revealing ways in which the proposal may be improved.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}}
