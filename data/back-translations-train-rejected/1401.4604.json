Since ontologies and typical queries are often defined at the time of application design, our approach allows application developers to verify whether a reason term that is commonly known to be incomplete is actually complete for the types of input relevant to the application. We also present a technique that can be used in query Q, ontology T and reason terms R1 and R2 that meet certain assumptions to determine whether for each data set A of reason term R1 calculates more answers to Q w.r.t.

All definitions in this essay are implicitly parameterized by a signature. Any predicate of zero-kind is commonly referred to as propository symbols; the terms of variables, first-order terms are formulas and individuals (commonly referred to as first-order constants); any predicate is associated with a nonnegative action; predicate of zero-kind is commonly referred to as propository symbols; the terms, first-order formulas formulas are defined as formulas, and first-order sentences are defined as common (Fitting, 1996); we do not consider any symbols of function to be and proceed from this article."}, {"heading": "2.2 Datalog\u00b1,\u2228", "text": "Next, we present a fragment of first-order logic called Datalog \u00b1, an extension of the Datalog \u00b1 r of Cal, Gottlob, Lukasiewicz, Marnette, and Pieris (2010).A Datalog \u00b1, a rule (or generally just a rule) r is a formula of form (6) in which each Bj is an atom different from any other, whose free variables are contained in x, and whose free variables are contained in x.

Finally, the symbol \"\u2212\" indicates that the specific founder ran out of memory.

Jena Micro was better than DLE-Jena (apart from query Q4), while DLE-Jena and OWLim behaved in almost the same way (again apart from query Q4). As expected, Sesame was the least complete system. Discrepancies between OWLim, Jena Micro, DLE-Jena and Minerva are quite surprising. Theoretically, OWLim and Jena support the same features of OWL; moreover, DLE-Jena is an extension of Jena (Meditskos & Bassiliades, 2008), so DLE-Jena should be at least as complete as Jena, as in the case of UQUM."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a theoretical framework and practical techniques for establishing formally provable and algorithmically verifiable completeness guarantees for incomplete ontological argumentation patterns. Our approach deviates radically from ad hoc evaluation based on known benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for establishing a balance between scalability and completeness in practical applications. Moreover, our approach opens numerous and exciting opportunities for future research. For example, our work opens the door to designing ontology-based information systems optimized for a particular class of ontologies, queries, and application-relevant data. Such information systems could maximize the scalability of thinking while ensuring the complexity of query responses, even for rich ontologies and sophisticated queries."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This is an extended version of the paper \"How Incomplete is your Semantic Web Reasoner?\" by Giorgos Stoilos, Bernardo Cuenca Grau and Ian Horrocks, published at AAAI 2010, and the paper \"Completeness Guarantees for Incomplete Reasoners\" by the same authors, published at ISWC 2010.

The lack of completeness guarantees, however, may be unacceptable for applications in areas such as health care and defence, where missing answers can adversely affect the application\u2019s functionality. Furthermore, even if an application can tolerate some level of incompleteness, it is often advantageous to estimate how many and what kind of answers are being lost. In this paper, we present a novel logic-based framework that allows one to check whether a reasoner is complete for a given query Q and ontology T \u2014that is, whether the reasoner is guaranteed to compute all answers to Q w.r.t. T and an arbitrary data set A. Since ontologies and typical queries are often fixed at application design time, our approach allows application developers to check whether a reasoner known to be incomplete in general is actually complete for the kinds of input relevant for the application. We also present a technique that, given a query Q, an ontology T , and reasoners R1 and R2 that satisfy certain assumptions, can be used to determine whether, for each data set A, reasoner R1 computes more answers to Q w.r.t. T and A than reasoner R2. This allows application developers to select the reasoner that provides the highest degree of completeness forQ and T that is compatible with the application\u2019s scalability requirements. Our results thus provide a theoretical and practical foundation for the design of future ontology-based information systems that maximise scalability while minimising or even eliminating incompleteness of query answers.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
