INTRODUCTIONAs for human action and skill, internal structure of technical skills is layered with mono-functional skills generated by human intention, and meta-functional skills adapted with environmental variations. [T.Shiose.2004], [Y.Matsumoto et al., in addition, we discuss that highly qualified workers in companies have internal models of layered skills."}, {"heading": "STROKES", "text": "In the research of motion analysis, [H.Oka.1991] records active tension of the muscle fiber with the help of expert needles on the table, and [J.Moribe.1991] uses a marking observation method with multiple markings on the body, where their objects illustrate the body structure and the skeletal structure of the body. Figure 1 shows our system structures, the technical skills consist of internal models of layered structures such as: mono-functional skills associated with each body part, and meta-functional skills as upper layer. We therefore identify the internal models of the observed time series image evaluation with represented actions, without discussing the discussion of the body structure or skeletal structure. In this paper we focus on table tennis among different sports, and analyze the skills of proceeding from observed time series image datasets and qualification evaluations with represented activities."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The part of this research was supported by the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture, Japan; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C), 24520173 (2012-2014), partly under the auspices of the Grant of Institute of Industrial and Economic Research, Hannan University, which was conducted in collaboration with members of the table tennis club of Hannan University, students of Hannan University and Kansai University."}], "references": [{"title": "Nishira: Electromyographic Study", "author": ["H.
