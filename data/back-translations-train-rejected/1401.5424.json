In much of the literature, AI systems have been limited to playing one game. Although, this specialization has resulted in stronger AI gaming systems it does not address the key concerns of AI researcher. AI researchers seek the development of AI agents that can autonomously interpret learn, and apply new knowledge. To achieve human level performance, current AI systems rely on game specific knowledge of an expert. The paper presents the full RTS language in hopes of shifting the current research focus to the development of general RTS agents. General RTS agents are AI gaming systems that can play any RTS games, defined in the RTS language. This prevents game specific knowledge from being hard coded into the system, thereby facilitating research that addresses the fundamental concerns of artificial intelligence.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jan 2014 19:14:22 GMT  (729kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5424v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["roy hayes", "peter beling", "william scherer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5424"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.5424.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Roy Hayes", "Peter Beling", "William Scherer"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Real Time Strategy Language Version 1Roy HayesPeter BelingWilliam Scherer"}, {"heading": "Introduction:", "text": "Over the past decade, researchers have begun to focus on artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time strategy (RTS) games. RTS are popular computer games that involve the development and support of an army of different unit types and buildings. Unlike classic games, such as chess, players perform their actions in real-time to make based decisions. In addition, players move simultaneously to potentially hundreds of units and buildings. That is, researchers have tried to develop a solution for a single aspect of the RTS game. In recent years, there has been a push for the development of AI systems that are capable of playing the full game."}, {"heading": "Language Structure", "text": "The description of the game language was originally designed for turn-based perfect information, symmetrical games. It was later expanded to include imperfect game information. Each turn a player is given suggestions that are true in the given state. In addition, the player receives possible steps that can be made from this state and how they will affect the game. The problem with this formulation is that as the complexity of the game increases also the number of suggestions is required to describe the game state. In addition, the number of possible actions and transitions also increases with complexity [5].Real-time strategy (RTS) games are not conducive to the original format of GDL. Turnbased updates are not feasible for RTS game because they are played over a continuous timeframe. In addition, a player can control hundreds of buildings and units, resulting in exponential growth in possible actions and state transitions."}, {"heading": "Faction Description", "text": "< < < < < > > This describes the factions that comprise the game, along with their buildings and units.; Resources indicate what resources are available in the game.; At the beginning of the game, a player will have 100 pieces of wood for use.
