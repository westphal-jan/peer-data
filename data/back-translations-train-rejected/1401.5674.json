For example, a bitext can be seen as a sequence of biwords ---pairs of parallel words with a high probability of co-occurrence--- that can be used as an intermediate representation in the compression process. However, the simple biword approach described in the literature can only exploit one-to-one word alignments and cannot tackle the reordering of words. We therefore introduce a generalization of biwords which can describe multi-word expressions and reorderings. We also describe some methods for the binary compression of generalized biword sequences, and compare their performance when different schemes are applied to the extraction of the biword sequence. In addition, we show that this generalization of biwords allows for the implementation of an efficient algorithm to look on the compressed bitext for words or text segments in one of the texts and retrieve their counterpart translations in the other text ---an application usually referred to as translation spotting--- with only some minor modifications in the compression algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:11:30 GMT  (471kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5674v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["felipe s\\'anchez-mart\\'inez", "rafael c carrasco", "miguel a mart\\'inez-prieto", "joaquin adiego"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5674"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.5674.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Generalized Biwords for Bitext Compression and Translation Spotting", "authors": ["Felipe S\u00e1nchez-Mart\u0301\u0131nez", "Rafael C.

Extraction of Biword Sequences", "text": "Before extracting the sequence of parallel biwords (Koehn, 2010, Ch 4), the alignments between the words in the left text L = \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 = \u03b2 \u03b2 = \u03b2 \u03b2 = \u03b2 \u03b2 \u00b7 lM and the words in the right text R = r1r2 \u00b7 \u00b7 rN must be determined by the word Aligner. Word aligners usually work by matching which pairs of sentences are parallel in the bittext, i.e. a plausible reciprocal sequence translation exists. Sentence algorithms are often based on simple statistical models for the correlation between sentence lengths (Brown, Lai, & Mercer, 1991; Gale & Church, 1993). Current word aligners use word-based statistical translation models (Brown, Pietra, Jelinek, Lafferty, & Roossin, 1990; Brown, Pietra, Pietra, & Mercer, 1993) to calculate the most probable alignment in the two sentences."}, {"heading": "3. Compression of Biword Sequences", "text": "It is clearly possible to compress the intermediate representation introduced in the previous section by applying a wide range of approaches. Here, we describe and evaluate two different encoding methods, namely Tre (paragraph 3.2) and 2lcab (paragraph 3.3), which use a word-based implementation of Huffman encoding (Moffat & Turpin, 1997; Turpin & Moffat, 2000), in which the input strings are mapped to integers and then compressed with Huffman codewords (Huffman, 1952). Both methods encode the offsets as described below (paragraph 3.1), but differ in the way they encode the lexical components of the biword sequence. Using Huffman codewords allows the two methods described here great spatial savings, but makes it inefficient to search for words in the compressed bittext and find the sequences in the left sequence."}, {"heading": "3.1 Structural Encoding", "text": "Initial tests showed that the biword extraction algorithm was able to generate sequences with a high number (usually over 70%) of biwords without displacements, and therefore an array of zero values can be considered a standard offset sequence. Thus, the offsets can be encoded as two streams of integer values: \u2022 The positions P = (p1, p2,.., pN) of the biwords with shifts in sequence B. These positions can be expressed in relation to the previous biword with shifts in B; for example, the biwords with shifts in Figure 3 are P = (1, 5, 2). \u2022 The offset values O for the biwords with shifts. For example, the offsets are O = (0, 1, 1, 2); the first two offsets belong to the first biword with shifts, while the following two belong to the second and third biwords with shifts."}, {"heading": "3.2 The TRE Compressor", "text": "The translation relationship-based encoder (Tre) assigns code words to the left word and the sequences of the right words in the biword by using two independent methods. In contrast, the right text is encoded by using the left text as context. To do this, Tre uses three dictionaries: one, two, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, two, etc. The translation dictionary letter letter B etc. For each single word, the sequences of the independent B-letters are sorted by frequency and integral letter range."}, {"heading": "3.3 The 2LCAB Compressor", "text": "Unlike Tre, the 2-level Compressor for Aligned Bittexts (2lcab; Adiego et al., 2009) encodes each biword with a single codeword based on a two-level dictionary; the first level consists of two dictionaries, L and R, which contain the left words or the sequences of the right words that occur in the biword sequence B. The second level dictionary B stores the different biwords in B as an integer sequence of alternating references to the entries in L and R. The text in sequence B can then refer to a sequence of references to entries in B. The header line contains L and R, which are compressed, as in Tre, using a PPM algorithm (Cleary & Witten, 1984); it also contains the codewords (selected using the Huffman compression method) for the integrators in the sequence that describe the dictionary B, with a PPM algorithm (Witten, 1984)."}, {"heading": "4.

Translation Spotting with Compressed Bitexts", "text": "The exploitation of bittexts by computer-aided translation tools has evolved from simple bilingual concordants (Barlow, 2004; Bowker & Barlow, 2004) to advanced translation search engines (Callison-Burch, Bannard, & Schroeder, 2005a; Bourdaillet, Huet, Langlais, & Lapalme, 2010).The default translation units processed by bilingual concordants are sentences, and these concordants can therefore only deliver a full sentence as a result of a translation search.In contrast, translation search engines have translation capabilities, i.e. they can retrieve parallel text segments in bitexes.It seems as if existing translation search engines (Callison-Burch et al, 2005a; Bourdaillet et al, 2010) the translation search engines have their translation capabilities, i.e. they can retrieve the sequences in bitexes."}, {"heading": "6.1 Searchable 2LCAB Compression", "text": "There are several alternative compression methods, such as ETDC, that allow direct searches in compressed text. In contrast to the output of Huffman compression, the ETDC header only stores words, since each codeword can be derived from the word position - henceforth, the words are sorted according to their relative frequency in the document to be compressed. This means that there is always an image that can be derived from the word position that the ETDC codeword returns for the nth most common word, along with the corresponding inverted bits. For example, if the B-th byte in the compressed bilingual dictionary contains an image that contains a letterword code whose rank must be searched for in B.9. Of course, this ranking can be achieved by keeping the number of words n in the list, but the standard pattern matching algorithms - such as BM (yer Moore, 1977) or Katt Morris - are not suitable."}, {"heading": "6.2 Translation Spotting", "text": "The 2lcab searchable algorithm described above is supplemented by a search algorithm that, when a single word w is included in the left-hand text, proceeds as follows: 1. The word w is searched for in the ECL - the relatively small size of which allows an uncompressed copy to be stored in memory - and its identifier n, given by the word position in the ECL, is used to obtain its ETDC codeword c = code (n). 2. An exact pattern matching algorithm (Knuth et al., 1977) identifies all occurrences of the codeword c in the ECL biword dictionary."}, {"heading": "6.3 Experimental Evaluation", "text": "The algorithm is clearly not as effective as the 2lcab described in Section 3, resulting in compression ratios slightly inferior to those achieved with the general purpose and word-based compressors. Table 12 also shows that the 1: 1 monotony is more effective in this case than the 1: 1 monotony method, as the latter requires an additional data structure (the RRR bit sequence) to access the structural information. Furthermore, the byte orientation of the ETDC reduces the gain achieved by encoding a smaller number of biwords."}, {"heading": "7.

Within the main loop, the sentences A \u2192 m are aligned with the positions of the right words on the left side of the word lm, and the set A-word n with the positions of the left words on the left side is aligned with the next left and right words. As word alignments are one to many, A \u2190 n contains an element with the positions of the right words. After each iteration, a single double word is produced. If A \u2192 m is empty, lm is not aligned, the next double word consists of the left word lm, an empty sequence of right words on the left side."}, {"heading": "Appendix B. Bitext Restoration Algorithm", "text": "Algorithm 3 provides the pseudo code that can be used to recover the correct text from the biword representation obtained with algorithm 1. Restoring the left text is straightforward because biwords are sorted according to their left components.The main loop in algorithm 3 (lines 3-15) iterates over the sequence of biwords representing the bittext. The variables m and n point to the next biword to be processed or to the next gap in R that needs to be filled with a word. Subsequently, it iterates over the array of offsets \u03c9 = (w1,.., w | \u03c9) (lines 7-10) and places each word in the sequence of the correct words \u03c1 = (\u03c11,..).After each biword has been processed, m is updated to refer to the next biword and n to refer to the next gap in R (lines 12-14)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the Spanish government through the projects TIN2009-14009C02-01 and TIN2009-14009-C02-02 and the Millennium Institute for Cell Dynamics and Biotechnology (ICM P05-001-F scholarship).During the development of the work reported in this thesis, Miguel A.

Bitexts are usually available in a compressed form in order to reduce storage requirements, to improve access times (Ziviani, Moura, Navarro, & Baeza-Yates, 2000), and to increase the efficiency of transmissions. However, the independent compression of the two texts of a bitext is clearly far from efficient because the information contained in both texts is redundant: in theory, one of the texts might be sufficient to generate a translated version if reliable machine translation systems were already available (Nevill-Manning & Bell, 1992). The improvement in compression performance obtained when taking advantage of the fact that the two texts in a bitext are mutual translations may be regarded as an indication of the quality of word alignments (Och & Ney, 2003). This indicator, which bounds the mutual information (Cover & Thomas, 1991) in the two texts of a bitext, does not require a manually-annotated corpus to evaluate the automatic alignment. The first article dealing with the compression of bitexts was published by Nevill-Manning and Bell (1992).

Their algorithm extends the ideas of delta-encoding (Suel & Memon, 2003) to the case in which the right text R is a translated, automatically aligned, version of the source text L: L is compressed first, and each block in R is then encoded as a reference to the parallel block in L. This method requires the computation of wordand phrase-level alignments, together with the lemmatized forms of L and R. The translated text is retrieved from these references, using a bilingual glossary together with other linguistic resources: a lemmata dictionary of words in L, a dictionary with all the possible morphological variants of each word in R, and a bilingual glossary. The authors report slight improvements in the compression of the right text R in comparison to classical compression algorithms such as bzip21 or word-based Huffman (Moffat, 1989) (approximately 1% and 6%, respectively). However, the authors do not take into consideration the size of the auxiliary files needed for the retrieval of the right text.
