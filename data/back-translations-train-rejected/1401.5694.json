Annotation Projection and Semantic Correspondence", "text": "In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the interest of people working for equality between men and women."}, {"heading": "2.1 Sample Selection", "text": "The English-German section contains about 25 million words on both sides. A naive sampling strategy would involve a random selection of two sentences from Europarl that include a FrameNet predicate on the English side and cover a wide range of topics, such as foreign policy, cultural and economic affairs and procedural issues. A naive sampling strategy would involve a random selection of two sentences from Europarl that include a FrameNet predicate on the English side. There are two caveats here. First, the alignment between the two predicates could be wrong, which would lead us to assign an incorrect frame for the German predicate. Second, even if the alignment is precise, it is possible that a randomly selected English will cause a problem that we are not covered by a net.We may be wrong, which leads us to assign an incorrect frame for the German predicate."}, {"heading": "2.2 Annotation", "text": "After the syntactical correction, two commentators with knowledge of the native language in German and English, each two sentence was commented with the frames evoked by us and wg and their semantic roles (i.e., one frame per monolingual sentence).For each predicate, the task comprised two steps: (a) the selection of the appropriate frame and (b) the allocation of the instantiated semantic roles to the sentence constituents.Annotators were given detailed guidelines that explained the task with multiple examples.The annotation took place on the gold standard and proceeded in three phases: a training phase (40 duplicates), a calibration phase (100 duplicates) and a production phase (1000 duplicates).During the training, annotators were familiarized with the annotations that are familiar with the annotation style, during the calibration phase we are familiar with the calibration phase."}, {"heading": "2.3 Evaluation", "text": "In fact, the annotations for each language are made independently of each other, so they can be used to estimate the degree of semantic parallelism between the two languages. We measure parallelism with precision and recollection, treating German annotations as the gold standard. This rating scheme directly measures the applicability of English as the source language for annotations. Less than 100% recall means that the target language has frames or roles that are not available in English, and cannot be replaced by annotations. Conversely, imperfect precision indicates that there are English frames or roles that produce erroneous annotations in the target language. Frames and roles are counted when they occur in both halves, regardless of their role."}, {"heading": "3. Modeling Semantic Role Projection with Semantic Alignments", "text": "Most previous work on projection relies on word alignments to transfer annotations between languages. However, this is not surprising, since annotations of interest are often defined at the word level (e.g. parts of words, sense of words, or dependencies) and rarely comprise more than one character. In contrast, semantic roles can cover sentence components of any length and simply use word alignments for projection, which is likely to lead to incorrect role alignments. Consider, for example, the second sentence in Figure 1.7. Let us now assume that the (English) source has been assigned semantic roles that we want to project onto the (German) target. Although some alignments (indicated by the dashed lines below the sentence) are accurate (e.g. promised to resolve), others are noisy or incomplete (e.g. the time that is temporarily different)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Framework Formalization", "text": "The fact is that this is a very complex matter, and it is only a matter of time before there is a result, until there is a result."}, {"heading": "3.2 Word-based Projection", "text": "In our first model, the linguistic units are word marks. Source and target sentences are represented by sentences of words, Us = {w1s, w2s,..} and Ut = {w1t, w2t,...}. Semantic alignments here are links between individual words. We can therefore conveniently interpret word alignments as semantic alignments off the shelf. Formally, this is achieved with the following binary similarity function, which trivially transforms a word alignment into an optimal semantic alignment."}, {"heading": "3.3 Constituent-based Projection", "text": "In our second model, the linguistic units are components, so source and target sentence are represented by constituent sentences (Us = {c1s, c2s,.}) and (Ut = {c1t, c2t,..) A constitution-based similarity function should grasp the extent to which cs and its projection express the same semantic content. We approach this by measuring word overlaps between the constitutional and the Jaccard coefficients. Let the sentence in the harvest of a constituent c, and the sentence in the target language imply that the word overlaps between the constitutional and the Jaccard coefficient."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Alignments as Perfect Matchings", "text": "First, we look at the most restrictive case, where each constituent has exactly one adjacent alignment edge, and vice versa. Semantic alignments with this property can be considered as bijective functions: each source constituent is assigned to a target constituent, and vice versa. The resulting two-part graphs are roughly perfect matches. An example of perfect two-part matching is given in Figure 3a. Note that the target page contains two nodes called (e), an abbreviation for \"empty\" nodes. Since second sentences often differ in size, the resulting graph partitions will also have different sizes. In such cases, we will insert empty nodes in the smaller partition to allow a perfect match. Empty nodes will be assigned to all other nodes with a similarity of zero."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Alignments as Edge Covers", "text": "Next, we look at edge lids, a generalization of perfect matches. Edge lids are split graphs in which each source and each target component is adjacent to at least one edge (see source nodes (2) and target nodes (4)). Edge lids impose weaker match assumptions than perfect matches because they allow for one-to-many match between components in both directions.10 Thus, in theory, edge lids have a higher chance of delivering a correct role projection than perfect matches when the syntactical structures of source and target sentences are different. They are also better able to deal with situations in which semantic roles are assigned to more than one component in one of the languages (see source nodes (3) and (4), labeled with role 2)."}, {"heading": "3.3.3 Total Alignments", "text": "The last family of allowable alignments we are looking at are total alignments. Since each source constituent is associated with an arbitrary number of source constituents here (i.e. the alignments form a total function on the source node), total alignments do not impose any constraints on the target nodes, which can therefore be associated with any number of source constitution nodes, including none. Total alignments are the most generous alignment class. Unlike perfect matchings and edge caps, components cannot be aligned in the target set. Can10 total alignments. The general definition of edge lids also allows many-to-many alignments. However, optimal edge lids according to Equation (7) cannot be many-to-many, as the weight of edge lids with many-to-many alignments can never be minimal: from each multiple-to-many edge lids, which can result in a slight edge cap being removed."}, {"heading": "3.4 Noise Reduction", "text": "As discussed in Section 2, noise elimination techniques are an integral part of projection architectures. Although our constitution-based model will not be overly sensitive to noise - we expect the syntactic information to compensate for alignment errors - the word-based model will be more error-prone as it relies solely on automatically obtained alignments for transferring semantic roles. Below, we present three filter techniques that correct or reject erroneous projections."}, {"heading": "3.4.1 Filling-the-gaps", "text": "According to our definition of the projection in Equation (5), the span of a projected role r corresponds to the union of all target units aligned to source units labeled with r. This definition is sufficient for constitution-based projection models in which roles rarely comprise more than one component, but for word-based models in which roles typically comprise multiple source units (i.e. words) lead to many incorrect alignments. Due to errors and gaps in word alignment, the target span of a role will often be a disjointed set of words. We can repair non-contiguous predictions in which the first and last word were correctly projected by applying simple heuristics that fill the gaps in a target role span. Let the index of a word be in a given sentence and by expanding the indexes for a set of words. The target span r without gaps is then defined as follows: acct (min) () () on this sentence () \u2264 () ()."}, {"heading": "3.4.2 Word Filtering", "text": "This technique removes words that form a two sentence before being projected according to certain criteria. In our experiments, we apply two intuitive instances of word filtering: the first removes non-substantive words, i.e. all words that are not adjectives, adverbs, verbs or nouns, from the original sentence and target sentence, since alignments for non-substantive words are known to be unreliable and can negatively affect similarity calculations; the second removes all words that are not aligned in the output of automatic word alignment; both filters aim to distinguish real word alignments from words and speed up the calculation of semantic alignments."}, {"heading": "3.4.3 Argument Filtering", "text": "Previous work in the field of flat semantic parsing has shown that not all nodes in a tree are equally likely to be semantic roles for a given predicate (Xue & Palmer, 2004). Indeed, assuming a perfect parse, there is a \"set of probable arguments\" to which almost all semantic roles should be assigned. This set of probable arguments includes all the components that are a child of any ancestor of the predicate, provided (a) they do not master the predicate itself and (b) there is no sentence boundary between a constituency and its predicate. This definition includes extensive dependencies such as control constructions for verbs or support constructions for nouns and can be expanded to accommodate coordination. We apply this filter to reduce the size of the target tree. In the example in Figure 4, all tree nodes except the S and NP are removed."}, {"heading": "3.5 Discussion", "text": "We have presented a framework for the bilingual projection of semantic roles based on the notion of semantic alignment errors. We have discussed two broad instances of the framework, namely word-based and constituent-based models. In the latter case, we operationalize the search for optimal semantic alignment as a problem of graph optimization. Specifically, each two-sentence is conceptualized as a two-part graph. Its nodes correspond to the syntactic components of the second sentence and its weighted edges of lingual similarity between components. Assumptions of semantic agreement between languages are formalized as constraints on the graph structure. We have also discussed three families of constraints. Perfect correspondence forces the similarities between English and German components to be bijective."}, {"heading": "4. Experiments", "text": "We will now describe our assessment of the framework developed in Section 3. We will present two experiments that both take into account the projection of semantic roles from English sentences onto their German translations and rate them against the annotation of German gold standard roles. Experiment 1 uses gold standard data for both syntactical and semantic annotations. This \"oracle setting\" evaluates the potential of role projection on its own, separating errors due to translational divergences and our modelling assumptions from those resulting from pre-processing (e.g. parsing and automatic alignment). Experiment 2 examines a more practical setting that uses automatic tools for syntactic and semantic parsing, thus approximating the conditions of large-scale role projection on parallel corpora."}, {"heading": "4.1 Setup", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Data", "text": "All models were evaluated using the parallel corpus described in section 2, which was randomly mixed and divided into a development group and a test group (each containing 50% of the data).Table 5 indicates the number of tokens, sentences, frames and arguments in the development and test set for English and German. Word alignments were calculated using the GIZA + + toolkit (Och & Ney, 2003).We used the entire English-German Europarl bittext as training data to induce alignments for both directions (source-target, target-source) with the default settings GIZA + +. According to common machine translation practice, alignments were symmetrized using the interface heuristics (Koehn, Och, & Marcu, 2003), which is known to lead to highly precise word alignments."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Method", "text": "We implemented the four models shown in Table 4 alone and with the filtering techniques introduced in Section 3.4, resulting in a total of sixteen models, all of which were evaluated on the basis of the development set. Results for the most powerful models were then validated on the test set. We found that the practical runtime of our experiment was dominated by input-output XML processing, not by the optimization problem itself. In both experiments, constituent-based models were compared with the word-based model that we treat as the basic model. The latter model is relatively simple: the projection is based exclusively on word alignment, does not require syntactic analysis, and has a linear time complexity, making it a good point of comparison for models that take linguistic knowledge into account."}, {"heading": "4.1.3 Evaluation Measure", "text": "We measure model performance using the terms Precision, Recall, and F1 in the \"Exact Match\" condition, i.e. both the label and the range of the projected English role must match the role of the German gold standard to be considered truly positive. We also assess whether performance differences are statistically significant by using layer mixtures (Noreen, 1989), an example of approximation-free randomization testing (see Yeh, 2000, for a discussion).11 Whenever we discuss changes in F1, we refer to absolute (not relative) differences."}, {"heading": "4.1.4 Upper Bound", "text": "Our annotation study (see Table 2, Section 2.2) achieved an interannotator match of 0.84 in the chip-match condition (note the same rolls with the same margin), which can be considered an appropriate upper limit for the performance of an automatic semantic role marking system within a language. It is more difficult to set an upper limit for the projection task since, in addition to the interannotator agreement, we must take into account the effect of bilingual divergence. Our annotation study provided an estimate of the former, but not the latter. In the absence of a method for measuring bilingual match on chip matches, we use the monolingual chip match as the upper limit for our projection experiments. However, please note that this upper limit is not strict - a system with an oracle should be able to exceed it. 11.

Beyond machine translation, parallel corpora can be exploited to relieve the effort involved in creating annotations for new languages. One important paradigm, annotation projection, creates new monolingual resources by transferring annotations from English (or other resource-rich languages) onto resource-scarce languages through the use of word alignments. The resulting (noisy) annotations can be then used in conjunction with robust learning algorithms to obtain NLP tools such as taggers and chunkers relatively cheaply. The projection approach has been successfully used to transfer a wide range of linguistic annotations between languages. Examples include parts of speech (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Hi & Hwa, 2005), chunks (Yarowsky et al., 2001), dependencies (Hwa et al., 2002), word senses (Diab & Resnik, 2002; Bentivogli & Pianta, 2005), information extraction markup (Riloff, Schafer, & Yarowsky, 2002), coreference chains (Postolache, Cristea, & Orasan, 2006), temporal information (Spreyer & Frank, 2008), and LFG f-structures (Tokarczyk & Frank, 2009). An important assumption underlying annotation projection is that linguistic analyses in one language will be also valid in another language. It is however unrealistic to expect any two languages, even of the same family, to be in perfect correspondence. There are many well-studied systematic differences across languages often referred to as translational divergences (van Leuven-Zwart, 1989; Dorr, 1995). These can be structural, where the same semantic content in the source and in the target language can be realized using different structures, or semantic, where the content itself undergoes a change in translation. Translational divergences (in conjunction with poor alignments) are a major stumbling block towards achieving accurate projections. Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) find that parts of speech that are transferred directly from English onto French contain considerable noise, even in cases where inaccurate automatic alignments have been manually corrected (accuracies vary between 69% and 78% depending on tagset granularity).", "startOffset": 99, "endOffset": 1967}, {"referenceID": 10, "context": "In recent years, interest has grown in parallel corpora for multilingual and cross-lingual natural language processing.

The resulting (noisy) annotations can be then used in conjunction with robust learning algorithms to obtain NLP tools such as taggers and chunkers relatively cheaply. The projection approach has been successfully used to transfer a wide range of linguistic annotations between languages. Examples include parts of speech (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Hi & Hwa, 2005), chunks (Yarowsky et al., 2001), dependencies (Hwa et al., 2002), word senses (Diab & Resnik, 2002; Bentivogli & Pianta, 2005), information extraction markup (Riloff, Schafer, & Yarowsky, 2002), coreference chains (Postolache, Cristea, & Orasan, 2006), temporal information (Spreyer & Frank, 2008), and LFG f-structures (Tokarczyk & Frank, 2009). An important assumption underlying annotation projection is that linguistic analyses in one language will be also valid in another language. It is however unrealistic to expect any two languages, even of the same family, to be in perfect correspondence. There are many well-studied systematic differences across languages often referred to as translational divergences (van Leuven-Zwart, 1989; Dorr, 1995). These can be structural, where the same semantic content in the source and in the target language can be realized using different structures, or semantic, where the content itself undergoes a change in translation. Translational divergences (in conjunction with poor alignments) are a major stumbling block towards achieving accurate projections. Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) find that parts of speech that are transferred directly from English onto French contain considerable noise, even in cases where inaccurate automatic alignments have been manually corrected (accuracies vary between 69% and 78% depending on tagset granularity).
