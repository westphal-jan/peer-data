Automated planning can be viewed as a case of this concept: a planning instance is a compact implicit representation of a graph and the problem is to find a path (a plan) in this graph. While the graphs themselves are represented compactly as planning instances, the paths are usually represented explicitly as sequences of actions. Some cases are known where the plans always have compact representations, for example, using macros. We show that these results do not extend to the general case, by proving a number of bounds for compact representations of plans under various criteria, like efficient sequential or random access of actions. In addition to this, we show that our results have consequences for what can be gained from reformulating planning into some other problem. As a contrast to this we also prove a number of positive results, demonstrating restricted cases where plans do have useful compact representations, as well as proving that macro plans have favourable access properties. Our results are finally discussed in relation to other relevant contexts.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:41:51 GMT  (323kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5848v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["christer b\\\"ackstr\\\"om", "peter jonsson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5848"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.5848.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Algorithms and Limits for Compact Plan Representations", "authors": ["Christer B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m", "Peter Jonsson"], "emails": ["christer.backstrom@liu.se", "peter.jonsson@liu.se"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "Most of us encounter such representations on a daily basis in the form of zipped files, mp3 files, etc. In such practical cases, we usually talk about compressed objects, while the terms compact and concise are more common in theoretical studies. Meaning of terms vary, but a more common and interesting case is when the size of representation is used in most polylogarithmic areas of the object. Sometimes, it is sufficient to create just one compact representation of an object, for example, when a file is archived. In other cases, representation must support various operations efficiently without first packing the object into an explicit representation. Operating on a compact representation is often more difficult than performing the same operation on an explicit object, but there are cases where a compact representation can be easier by highlighting some inherent structures."}, {"heading": "2.

The previous result leaves open the possibility that a small fraction of the solutions for a planning instance could have compact representations. However, if we need the actual plan itself, we cannot avoid its exponential size. An interesting case seems to be if we could at least access useful information in the plan. Here, the term representation is used in a loose sense, but does not really need to be defined precisely to determine that each representation needs both a type of data structure and a type of access algorithm."}, {"heading": "5.

As a macroplan can also be considered a compact representation, we will also examine how macroplans relate to our concepts. We will start by showing that if there is a polynomial crar for a plan, there is also a polynomial csar for this plan. If there is a polynomial csar for this plan, then there is also a polynomial csar for this project. If there is a polynomial csar for this project, then there is also a polynomial csar. Proof. Let us be f arbitrary FFP ([P]) instance and let there be a p-crar for a plan. Let's use a plot counter that indicates the first action in the plan."}, {"heading": "6. Problem Reformulation", "text": "If we now come to the conclusion that there seems to be little hope that plans in general need to be presented in a concise manner, we must turn directly to the idea of problem reformulation to see if this can be of any help. While, in this context, this may seem out of place, it is a fairly logical step that we may have to take on the contrary. So, it is hypothetically possible that we could circumvent the problems with this approach, and that is what the results imply for the formulation. However, it is not obvious that anything useful and relevant can be said about it, it is not enough just to look at naive approaches, such as polynomial reductions, so that we will examine a stronger criterionization. The basic idea of reformulating one planning instance into another equivalent instance, either another planning instance or an instance, in order to be useful."}, {"heading": "7. Discussion", "text": "This section consists of five parts. First, we transfer the reformulation theorem to a more general result on the addition of information to planners and discuss how this can explain various results in the literature.

In the fourth part, we discuss some related work on compact diagrams and summaries, and the section ends with a summary of the results and a list of open questions."}, {"heading": "7.1 Reformulation and Additional Information", "text": "Theorem 36 has broader consequences than just reformulation. In fact, it implies that there is no way to help a planner by adding information to a planning framework, no matter what information or how we obtain it, unless we accept that the amount of information is not always polynomically limited in box size. In the following theorem, it is assumed that the function g represents the additional information, and it does not even have to be calculable. We only demand that its result be polynomically limited.

Unlike us, he also considers plans as sequences of states, not just sequences of actions. In both cases, he considers a random access representation as well as a sequential representation. His random representation of action sequences (TA) is essentially the same as our Crar concept, except that it specifies that it must be implemented by a circuit. However, the sequential representation of action sequences (SA) differs from our Csar concept. It is a function that takes one state as input and returns the next state. Therefore, it is more like a restricted reactive plan than a Csar, and its results are therefore not directly comparable to ours. For example, unlike our Theorem 29, he proves that a TA representation cannot be polynomically converted into an SA representation, which is clearly a problem."}, {"heading": "7.5 Conclusions and Open Questions", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Malte Helmert, Anders Jonsson and the anonymous reviewers of this paper and the earlier conference version have provided valuable comments and suggestions."}], "references": [{"title": "Using temporal logics to express search control knowledge for planning", "author": ["F.

Automated planning can be viewed as a case of this concept: a planning instance is a compact implicit representation of a graph and the problem is to find a path (a plan) in this graph. While the graphs themselves are represented compactly as planning instances, the paths are usually represented explicitly as sequences of actions. Some cases are known where the plans always have compact representations, for example, using macros. We show that these results do not extend to the general case, by proving a number of bounds for compact representations of plans under various criteria, like efficient sequential or random access of actions. In addition to this, we show that our results have consequences for what can be gained from reformulating planning into some other problem. As a contrast to this we also prove a number of positive results, demonstrating restricted cases where plans do have useful compact representations, as well as proving that macro plans have favourable access properties. Our results are finally discussed in relation to other relevant contexts.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
