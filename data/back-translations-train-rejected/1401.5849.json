Introduction", "text": "While reactive systems (Pnueli, 1977) are traditionally specified with simple temporal logic, there is a well-established tradition in artificial intelligence (AI) and, in particular, in research with multiple agents (MAS) to apply more expressive languages. Much of this tradition is inspired by the earlier pioneering work in artificial intelligence by McCarthy (1979, 1990) and others aimed at adopting an \"intentional attitude\" (Dennett, 1987) when thinking about intelligent systems."}, {"heading": "1.1 State of the Art", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one is able to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution that is capable of finding a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, and that is able to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution, and that is able to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution."}, {"heading": "1.2 The Present Contribution", "text": "This paper extends the current state of the art in the field of first-order epistemic logic by introducing a family of verifiably complete calculations for a variety of quantified interpreted systems characterizing a number of characteristics, including perfect memory, non-learning, synchronicity, and a unique initial state. We prove the completeness of the presented first-order epistemic logic using a quasi-model construction previously applied (Hodkinson, Wolter, & Sakharyashev, 2002; Hodkinson et al., 2000) to prove the decidability of monodic fragments of first-order temporal logic (FoTL). Quasi models have also been applied to first-order temporal and epistemic logic (Sturm et al., 2000; Wolter & Sakharyashev et al., 2002)."}, {"heading": "1.2.1 Structure of the Paper.", "text": "In Section 2, we first introduce the primary temporal-epistemic languages Lm and LCm with general knowledge for a sentence Ag = {1,.., m} of agents. Then, we present the relevant classes of QIS as well as the monodic fragments of Lm and LCm. In Section 3, we present the axiomatizations for these classes of QIS, while the details of the completeness proofs are presented in Sections 4 and 5. Finally, in Section 6, we go into the results obtained and discuss possible extensions and future work."}, {"heading": "2. First-Order Temporal-Epistemic Logics", "text": "Interpreted systems are a standard semantics for the interpretation of temporal-epistemic logics in a multi-agent setting (Fagin et al., 1995; Parikh & Ramanujam, 1985); we extend the interpretation to the first-order case by adding a domain of individuals to these structures; we first examined \"static\" quantified interpretation systems in which the development of the system is not taken into account (Belardinelli & Lomuscio, 2008, 2009); then full QIS was introduced in a language that also has temporal modalities (Belardinelli & Lomuscio, 2010, 2011); we follow the definition of the QIS contained in the references."}, {"heading": "2.1 First-Order Temporal-Epistemic Languages", "text": "Considering a sentence Ag = {1,.., m} of the agents, the first-mentioned temporal-epistemic language Lm represents individual variables x1, x2,.., the individual constants c1, c2,.., n-ary predicate constants Pn1, P n 2,.., for n \u00b2, the propositional connectives \u00ac and \u2192, the quantifiers \u00b2, the linear formula \u00a9 and U, and the epistemic operator Ki for each Ag. The language LCm also contains the common knowledge operator C (Fagin et al., 1992). For simplicity purposes, we consider only a group of agents for the general knowledge formula, that is, the whole of Ag; C is really acting on CAg. Extending to correct, not empty subsets of Ag and LCm is not problematic. The languages Lm and LCm do not contain a symbol for functions; so all terms are 1, these languages are."}, {"heading": "2.2 Quantified Interpreted Systems", "text": "To introduce quantified systems, we assume a set of local states li, l, i, i. < for each agent i, Ag in a multi-agent system. We consider a set of local states for the environment e, as well. The set S, L1, i,. \u00b7 Lm contains all and only the global states of the multi-agent system. To represent the temporal evolution of the MAS, we consider the quantified interpreted systems for the languages Lm and LCm as follows: Definition 2 (QIS). A quantified interpreted system is a triple P = < R, I >, where we assume a possible evolution of the MAS as the flow of time. \u2022 R is an unempty group of external systems for the languages Lm and LCm as a consequence."}, {"heading": "2.3 The Monodic Fragment", "text": "In the rest of the paper, we will show that a sufficient condition for the annulment of the results in Table 1 to the first order is to limit the languages Lm and LCm to their monodic fragments. Definition 5. The monodic fragment LC1m is the set of formulas LCm in such a way that each subformula of the form Ki\u043d, CC, or 1 UB 2 contains at most one free variable. Likewise, the monodic fragment LC1m is the set of formulas LCm in such a way that each subformula of the form Ki\u043d, CC, or 1 UB 2 contains each free variable. Monodic fragments of a number of modal logic of the first order have been thoroughly investigated in the literature (Hodkinson et al., 2000, 2003; Wolter & Zakharyaschev, 2001, 2002)."}, {"heading": "3. Axiomatisations", "text": "In this section, we present solid and complete axiomatizations of the sets of monodic validities for the classes of quantified interpreted systems in Section 2. First, we present the basic system QKTm, which extends to the formula of first order, in which the multimodal epistemic logic S5m is combined with the linear temporal logic LTL. Definition 6. The system QKTm contains the following schemes of axioms and rules in which these formula are formulas in L1m and = \u21d2 column relation. First order logic Taut of classical propository tautologies MP \u03c6."}, {"heading": "3.1 Kripke Models", "text": "To prove the completeness of the results in Theorem 2, we first present an appropriate class of Kripke models as a generalization of QIS and prove completeness for these models. Then we apply a correspondence between Kripke models and QIS models to obtain the desired results. \u2022 RW is a non-empty set of functions r: N \u2192 W; \u2022 for each Kripke model there is an equivalence relationship to W; \u2022 D is a non-empty group of individuals; \u2022 RW is a non-empty group of functions r: N \u2192 W; \u2022 for each Kripke model i is an equivalence relationship to W; \u2022 D is a non-empty group of individuals. \u2022 W, I is a first-order interpretation, that is a function like that- for each constant c, I (c, w).D, - for each predicate constant P k."}, {"heading": "4. The Completeness Proof", "text": "In this section we outline the most important steps of the proof of completeness, which is based on a quasi-model construction (Gabbay, Kurucz, Wolter, & Zakharyaschev, 2003; Hodkinson et al., 2000). Unlike these contributions, we explicitly consider the interaction between temporal and epistemic modalities here. Intuitively, a quasi-model for a quasi-formula defines a quasi-formula whose points are sentences of subforms of a different kind. Each set of subforms describes a \"possible state of affairs\" and contains sets of subforms that define individuals in this state. More formally, the formula is called \"LC1n,\" we define the sentences of others."}, {"heading": "5. Dealing with each System", "text": "In this section, we will consider the proof of completeness for each system in Theorem 2. In particular, we will show that if a monodic formula \u03c6 is consistent with respect to a system S, we will create a quasi-model (or a quasi-model + in certain cases) for each system based on a framework for S. In the following sections, the symbol \"represents probative force in the corresponding system.\" We will start with some terms that are useful for constructing the quasi-model for each system. (i) For each consistent monodic formula, there is a consistent candidate for the -state C = < T, T con > so that the probative force for some points does not exist. (ii) Let P = < C > be a consistent point for such a system that C = < T con >, and leave c consistent candidates for the state C = < T, and leave c \u00b2 consistent candidates."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions and Further Work", "text": "The paper's contribution concerns the verifiably complete axiomatization of these classes; the presented results extend previous contributions to the epistemic and temporal logic of the first order without interactions (e.g., see Belardinelli & Lomuscio, 2011, Sturm et al., 2000, Wolter & Zakharyashev, 2002) in a direction previously studied only at the level of propositions (Halpern et al., 2004); our results show that the characterization problems considered at the level of propositions can be extended to the level of propositions (Wolter & Zakharyashev, 2000)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The research presented was supported by the European Commission through the Marie Curie Scholarship \"FoMMAS\" (Scholarship # 235329) and the STREP project \"ACSI\" (Scholarship # 257593) as well as the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Leadership Fellowship \"Trusted Autonomous Systems\" (Scholarship # EP / I00520X / 1)."}], "references": [{"title": "Quantified epistemic logics for reasoning about knowledge in multi-agent systems", "author": ["F.
