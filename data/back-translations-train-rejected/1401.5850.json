Under this view, ontologies provide answers to queries about some vocabulary of interest. The difference between two versions of an ontology is given by the set of queries that receive different answers. We investigate this approach for terminologies given in the description logic EL extended with role inclusions and domain and range restrictions for three distinct types of queries: subsumption, instance, and conjunctive queries. In all three cases, we present polynomial-time algorithms that decide whether two terminologies give the same answers to queries over a given vocabulary and compute a succinct representation of the difference if it is non- empty. We present an implementation, CEX2, of the developed algorithms for subsumption and instance queries and apply it to distinct versions of Snomed CT and the NCI ontology.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:43:23 GMT  (710kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5850v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["boris konev", "michel ludwig", "dirk walther", "frank wolter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5850"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.5850.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL", "authors": ["Boris Konev", "Michel Ludwig", "Dirk Walther", "Frank Wolter"], "emails": ["konev@liverpool.ac.uk", "michel.ludwig@liverpool.ac.uk", "dirk.walther@upm.es", "wolter@liverpool.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

The difference between description logic concepts has been investigated, for example, in the work of Teege (1994), and of Brandt, K\u00fcsters, and Turhan (2002) but besides of the interest in some kind of difference the problems considered as well as the techniques employed are rather different.", "startOffset": 15, "endOffset": 1328}, {"referenceID": 10, "context": ", 2007; Cuenca Grau et al., 2008). Nothing is known for ALC about the complexity of inseparability for instance and conjunctive queries. For DL-Lite dialects (Calvanese, Giacomo, Lembo, Lenzerini, & Rosati, 2006), the complexity of concept, instance, and query inseparability ranges from PSpace-hard (and in ExpTime) for the description logic underlying the OWL 2 QL standard, NP-complete for DL-Litehorn, and \u03a0 p 2-complete for DL-Litebool (Konev, Kontchakov, Ludwig, Schneider, Wolter, & Zakharyaschev, 2011; Kontchakov et al., 2010). For DLLitebool model-theoretic inseparability is decidable (Kontchakov et al., 2010) and for DLLitecore concept, instance, and query inseparability are in PTime (Konev et al., 2011). In contrast to the work presented in this paper, however, no attempt is made to present the logical difference to the user if two ontology are not inseparable. As mentioned above, in the work of Konev et al. (2012), CEX2 is extended to the conjunctive query difference case between acyclic ELH-terminologies and various experiments based on the NCI thesaurus are discussed. The work discussed so far is concerned with the logical difference and inseparability between description logic TBoxes.

In all three cases, we present polynomialtime algorithms that decide whether two terminologies give the same answers to queries over a given vocabulary and compute a succinct representation of the difference if it is nonempty.
