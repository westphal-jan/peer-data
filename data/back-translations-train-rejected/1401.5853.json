The algorithm processes K first into a set of rules R - implications to be interpreted under first-order semantics - and into a normalized ABox A, so that K is equivalent to R-A. Pre-processing consists of three steps. First, transitivity axioms from K are eliminated by encoding them using concept inclusions.

As we show in Section 4.1, the presence of nominals precludes the existence of an import-by-query algorithm; hence, in this section we present an overview of a simplified version of the algorithm that is applicable if K is an ALCHIQ knowledge base. The algorithm first preprocesses K into a set of rules R\u2014implications interpreted under first-order semantics\u2014and a normalized ABox A such that K is equisatisfiable with R \u222a A. Preprocessing consists of three steps. First, transitivity axioms are eliminated from K by encoding them using concept inclusions. Second, axioms are normalized and complex concepts are replaced with atomic ones in a way similar to the structural transformation for first-order logic. Third, the normalized axioms are translated into rules by using the correspondence between description and first-order logic.
