Such regions are bounded areas of the search space in which the heuristic function is inaccurate compared to the actual cost to reach a solution. Early real-time search algorithms, like LRTA*, easily become trapped in those regions since the heuristic values of their states may need to be updated multiple times, which results in costly solutions. State-of-the-art real-time search algorithms, like LSS-LRTA* or LRTA*(k), improve LRTA*s mechanism to update the heuristic, resulting in improved performance. Those algorithms, however, do not guide search towards avoiding depressed regions. This paper presents depression avoidance, a simple real-time search principle to guide search towards avoiding states that have been marked as part of a heuristic depression. We propose two ways in which depression avoidance can be implemented: mark-and-avoid and move-to-border. We implement these strategies on top of LSS-LRTA* and RTAA*, producing 4 new real-time heuristic search algorithms: aLSS-LRTA*, daLSS-LRTA*, aRTAA*, and daRTAA*. When the objective is to find a single solution by running the real-time search algorithm once, we show that daLSS-LRTA* and daRTAA* outperform their predecessors sometimes by one order of magnitude. Of the four new algorithms, daRTAA* produces the best solutions given a fixed deadline on the average time allowed per planning episode. We prove all our algorithms have good theoretical properties: in finite search spaces, they find a solution if one exists, and converge to an optimal after a number of trials.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:45:02 GMT  (2140kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5854v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["carlos hern\\'andez", "jorge a baier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5854"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.5854.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "META", "title": "Avoiding and Escaping Depressions in Real-Time Heuristic Search", "authors": ["Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez", "Jorge A.

Introduction", "text": "It is also the case of virtual agents who are able to perform these tasks (e.g. Warcraft, Starcraft), where the time used by the game software to complete tasks is very limited. Therefore, there will usually be no time to plan complete trajectories; rather, limits will be imposed on companies to perform these tasks (e.g. Korf, 1990; Wei\u00df, 1999; Edelkamp & Schro \ufffd dl, 2011). Therefore, there will usually be no time to plan complete trajectories; rather, finding routes will be carried out in a real time to perform these tasks (e.g. Korf, 1990; Wei\u00df, 1999; Edelkamp & Schro \ufffd dl, 2011) is a standard paradigm for finding solutions in an environment where the environment is not fully known to the environment."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "A search problem P is a tuple (S, A, c, s0, G), where (S, A) is a diagram representing the search space. S represents the states, and the arcs in A represent all available actions. A contains no elements of the form (x, x). Furthermore, the cost function c: A associates 7 \u2192 R + costs for each of the available actions. Finally, s0 \u00b2 S is the initial state, and G \u00b2 S is a series of target states. In this paper, we assume that search spaces are undirected; i.e., whenever (u, v) is in A, this is (v, u). Furthermore, c (u, v) = c (v, u), for all (u). The successors of a state u are defined by Succ (u) = (u, v) is the path c)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Real-Time Search", "text": "The objective of a search algorithm is to make an agent's journey from the initial state to a destination state that moves between movements, an amount of the calculation limited by a constant. An example situation is finding the path in a previously unknown grid-like environment, where the agent has enough memory to store his current belief in the structure of the search space. Furthermore, the search in open space (Zelinsky, 1992; Koenig, Tovey, & Smirnov, 2003) is initially assumed to be barrier-free. The agent is able to detect a limited form of sensor technology: only obstacles in neighboring states can be detected. If obstacles are detected, the agent updates its map accordingly. Many state-of-the-art heuristic search algorithms can be described by the pseudo-code in Algorithm 1. The algorithm iteratively executes a lookahead update cycle until the target is reached."}, {"heading": "3. LSS-LRTA\u2217 and RTAA\u2217", "text": "Now we are describing LSS-LRTA * and RTAA *, the two most advanced heuristic real-time search algorithms most relevant to this paper. We are making two small contributions to understanding these two algorithms. First, we are conducting an experimental comparison of these algorithms using benchmarks that were not previously considered. Second, we are demonstrating two theoretical results aimed at understanding the differences between their updating mechanisms (Propositions 1 and 2). To our knowledge, none of these results appear in the literature."}, {"heading": "3.1 LSS-LRTA\u2217", "text": "The local search space LRTA (LSS-LRTA) was first introduced by Koenig (2004) and later presented in detail by Koenig and Sun (2009). It is an instance of algorithm 1. The predictive method is a limited A-search (algorithm 2). The next state Koenig and Sun (2009) move into corresponds to a state in Open with the lowest f-value, i.e. it uses algorithm 3 to implement the Extract-Best-State (). LSS-LRTA updates the values of each state in the local search space in such a way that h (s) is assigned the highest possible value guaranteeing consistency with the states in Open. This is done by implementing the Update () procedure as a modified Dijkstra algorithm (algorithm 4). As the value of h is increased to the maximum, the update mechanism of LSS-LRTA for the respective state is maintained if the knowledge about the current search space can be loosened."}, {"heading": "3.2 RTAA\u2217", "text": "In practice, the procedure is considerably faster than that of the LSS-LRTA."}, {"heading": "4. Heuristic Depressions", "text": "The definition of depression is central to our algorithm. Intuitively, a heuristic depression is a limited region of the search space that contains states whose heuristic value is actually caught in relation to the heuristic values of states bordering on depression. Depression, of course, exists in heuristics, which is used along with real-time heuristic search algorithms. As we have seen above, heuristic algorithms can gradually build solutions by updating the heuristic values associated with certain states as more information is collected from the environment. Ishida (1992) gave a constructive definition of heuristic depression. The construction begins with a node s so that its heuristic value is equal to or lower than that of the thesurinfinite states. The region is then expanded by adding a state to its boundary when all states in the resulting region have a heuristic value that is lower or equal."}, {"heading": "5. Depression Avoidance", "text": "A major problem in solving the already discussed LSS-LRTA and RTAA problems is the presence of heuristic depression. State-of-the-art algorithms are able to essentially solve this problem through extensive learning and / or comprehensive advance planning. By engaging in more forward planning, the chances are low that a state outside of depression will eventually be selected to enter a depression. On the other hand, by learning the heuristic values of several states at the same time, fewer movements may be required to increase the heuristic values of states inside a depression that is high enough to make it disappear. As such, LSS-LRTA procedures performed with a high value for the predictive parameters that trigger the depression faster than LRTA parameters may be executed to increase the depth of search equal to 1 for two reasons: (1) because the heuristic function for states in D is faster and (2) because we sometimes come up with a high predictive value for depression."}, {"heading": "6. Theoretical Analysis", "text": "In this section, we will analyze the theoretical properties of the algorithms we propose. We will prove that all of our algorithms also fulfill desirable properties that apply to their ancestors. We will begin by presenting theoretical results that can be proven on the basis of existing evidence in the literature; among them, however, we will show that the consistency of the heuristic method is maintained by all of our algorithms during runtime. We will continue with results that require other evidence; in particular, the termination and convergence to an optimal solution. As before, we will use hn to refer to the value of variable h at the beginning of execution n (h0, meaning the heuristic function as parameter for the algorithm). Similarly, cn (s, s) is the cost of the arc between s and s. \"Finally, kn (s, s) denotes the cost of an optimal path between s and s.\""}, {"heading": "7. Empirical Evaluation", "text": "We evaluated our algorithms in solving real-time navigation problems in unfamiliar environments. LSS-LRTA \u0445 \u00d7 71 \u00d7 69 \u00d7 69 \u00d7 71 \u00d7 71 * are used as a starting point for our comparisons. To be fair, we used comparable implementations that use the same underlying code base. For example, all search algorithms use the same binary heap implementation as a priority list and fault lines between cells with the same f -values in favor of cells with larger g-values, which are known to be a good strategy. We conducted our experiments using two sets of benchmarks: playing cards and mazes Jungle used. We used twelve maps from used video games to perform the experiments, the first six coming from the game Dragon Age, and the remaining six from the game StarCraft. The maps were used by Nathan Sturtevant's 414 maps and labyrinths."}, {"heading": "7.1 An Analysis of the LSS-LRTA\u2217 Variants", "text": "This section analyzes the performance of LSS-LRTA time per episode for the three algorithms in games and labyrinth benchmarks. Planning time per planning episode is indeed an accurate measure of the efforts made by each TA-TA episode. Thus, these diagrams show how the solution quality varies according to the effort each algorithm performs, we observe aLSS-LRTA episode search results slightly but consistently the LSS-LRTA episodes in solution costs. In the game benchmarks we observe that for the same search efforts, aLSS-LRRTA-LRRTA search results produce average improvement factors between 1.08 and 1.20 in terms of solution costs. In mazes, on the other hand, improvement factors are between 1.04 and 1.25. In games, the greatest improvements are observed when the search time is between 1.08 and 1.20 in terms of solution costs."}, {"heading": "7.2 An Analysis of the RTAA\u2217 Variants", "text": "In this section, we analyze the relative performance of RTAA *, aRTAA * and daRTAA *. Figure 7 shows two charts of the average cost of the RTTA solution versus the average effort executed per search sequence. For the same search effort, we do not observe significant improvements in RTAA * over RTAA *. In fact, for only small values of the average time per search sequence, the RTTA solution is significantly better than RTTA *. However, in general, both algorithms appear to achieve very similar performance. On the other hand, the results show that daRTAA * s mechanism for escaping depression is significantly better than that of aRTAA *. For small values for the lookahead parameter (and thus reduced search effort), daRTAA * achieves better solutions than the other variants used with much greater search progress. In fact, for limited search effort, daRTAA * * * * * * is about an order of magnitude better than the other two algorithms."}, {"heading": "7.4 An Analysis of Disaggregated Data", "text": "To illustrate how the algorithms in different maps perform, Figure 9 shows the improvement of the solution costs of daLSS-LRTA \u0445 compared to LSS-LRTA \u0445 to 4 game and 4 labyrinth benchmarks. They confirm that improvements can be observed in all areas and show that averages are representative of the behavior of daLSS-LRTA \u0445 in individual benchmarks. Although aLSSLRTA \u0445 and daLSS-LRTA \u0445 LSS-LRTA \u0445 perform better on average, there are specific cases where the situation does not apply. In particular, we note that in one of the labyrinth benchmarks daLSS-LRTA \u0445 does not significantly improve in terms of large values of the lookahead parameter."}, {"heading": "7.5 A Worst-Case Experimental Analysis", "text": "Although all of our algorithms perform a resource-limited calculation per planning episode, it is difficult to optimize the Lookahead parameter in such a way that both LRTA \u0445 and LSSLRTA \u0445 cause the same worst-case planning effort, because the time spent extracting the best state from the open list depends on the structure of the search space expanded in each Lookahead phase. In this section, however, we have decided to perform an experimental worst-case analysis based on a theoretical Worst-case boundary. However, this boundary results from the Worst-case effort per planning step as follows. However, if RTAA performs per-planning episode extensions, the open list could include up to 8k states. This is due to the fact that each state has at most 8 parameter neighbors. In the worst case, the effort to add all of these states to the open list Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameters-Parameters-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameter-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameters-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameters-Parameter-Parameters-Parameter-Parameters-Parameters-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parameter-Parents-Parameter-Parents-Parents-Parameters-Parents-Parents-Parents-Parents-Parents-Parents-Parents-Parents-Parents-Parents-Parents-Parents-Parst-Parents-Parst-Parst-Parents-Parst-Parts-Parst-Parents-Parst"}, {"heading": "8.

Such regions are bounded areas of the search space in which the heuristic function is inaccurate compared to the actual cost to reach a solution. Early real-time search algorithms, like LRTA\u2217, easily become trapped in those regions since the heuristic values of their states may need to be updated multiple times, which results in costly solutions. State-of-the-art real-time search algorithms, like LSS-LRTA\u2217 or LRTA\u2217(k), improve LRTA\u2217\u2019s mechanism to update the heuristic, resulting in improved performance. Those algorithms, however, do not guide search towards avoiding depressed regions. This paper presents depression avoidance, a simple real-time search principle to guide search towards avoiding states that have been marked as part of a heuristic depression. We propose two ways in which depression avoidance can be implemented: mark-and-avoid and move-to-border. We implement these strategies on top of LSS-LRTA\u2217 and RTAA\u2217, producing 4 new real-time heuristic search algorithms: aLSS-LRTA\u2217, daLSS-LRTA\u2217, aRTAA\u2217, and daRTAA\u2217. When the objective is to find a single solution by running the real-time search algorithm once, we show that daLSS-LRTA\u2217 and daRTAA\u2217 outperform their predecessors sometimes by one order of magnitude. Of the four new algorithms, daRTAA\u2217 produces the best solutions given a fixed deadline on the average time allowed per planning episode. We prove all our algorithms have good theoretical properties: in finite search spaces, they find a solution if one exists, and converge to an optimal after a number of trials.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
