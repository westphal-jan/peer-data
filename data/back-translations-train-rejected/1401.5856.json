Introduction", "text": "Classical AI planning, which assumes that actions are deterministic and that the planner has complete knowledge and control over the world, is often considered too limited, as many potential application problems appear to have requirements that do not fit into this model. However, it has recently been shown that some problems that go beyond the classical model can still be solved by classical planners through compilation, i.e., a systematic redesign of the problem, such as that a classical plan for the reformulated problem also meets the non-classical requirements. A striking example is the work of Palacios and Geffner (2006), which showed that conform planning has generated robust forms of uncertainty. Another example, closer to the subject of this paper is the work of Porteous, Teutenberg, Pizzi and Cavazza (2011), which use variations of a drama to create variations of a drama by putting a classical problem together in a planning problem."}, {"heading": "2.

Compilation 2: Meta-Planning", "text": "The second compilation is based on the simulation of the process of shaping the intentions of the characters by drawing up plans that are less complex, but also less stringent: plans for a metaplanning that raises problems are not guaranteed to be intentional, according to the definition of Riedl and Young, although most of the time they will undertake it. A metaplanning action allows a character to assume the intention of an action that achieves a goal that the character already intends to do. To avoid characters making plans that they never keep, the number of intentions of each character must have, and is required to be zero at the end of the plan."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "Through compilations, the skills of existing classical planners can be harnessed to solve many more problems than those that superficially appear to be classical planning problems. Like the faithful knight of history, a classical planner will be committed to solving any task that is set for him, as expressed in the specification of the planning area. The trick is to set him the right task. As already mentioned, the narrative planning model defined by Riedl and Young has some limitations. For example, it does not allow a story in which a character tries but fails to achieve a goal. Brenner (2010) describes an approach to story generation that links classical planning for the goals of individual characters based on the level of knowledge of the characters with the plan \"execution,\" i.e., adds events to the story. This allows the system to generate stories in which characters are forced to abandon their plans until crucial facts become known."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "I would like to thank Alban Grastien, Malte Helmert, Robert Mattu \ufffd ller and the reviewers for their useful comments on the drafts of this paper, which was supported by the Australian Research Council Discovery Project DP0985532 \"Exploiting Structure in AI Planning.\" NICTA is funded by the Australian Government, represented by the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, and the Australian Research Council under the ICT Centre of Excellence Programme."}], "references": [{"title": "Computational aspects of reordering plans", "author": ["C.
