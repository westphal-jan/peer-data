Through this work we make two advances to the state-of-the-art in terms of expressive reasoning capabilities of planners: the handling of continuous linear change, and the handling of duration-dependent effects in combination with duration inequalities, both of which require tightly coupled temporal and numeric reasoning during planning. COLIN combines FF-style forward chaining search, with the use of a Linear Program (LP) to check the consistency of the interacting temporal and numeric constraints at each state. The LP is used to compute bounds on the values of variables in each state, reducing the range of actions that need to be considered for application. In addition, we develop an extension of the Temporal Relaxed Planning Graph heuristic of CRIKEY3, to support reasoning directly with continuous change. We extend the range of task variables considered to be suitable candidates for specifying the gradient of the continuous numeric change effected by an action. Finally, we explore the potential for employing mixed integer programming as a tool for optimising the timestamps of the actions in the plan, once a solution has been found. To support this, we further contribute a selection of extended benchmark domains that include continuous numeric effects. We present results for COLIN that demonstrate its scalability on a range of benchmarks, and compare to existing state-of-the-art planners.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:46:26 GMT  (1019kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5857v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["amanda j coles", "rew i coles", "maria fox", "derek long"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5857"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.5857.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "COLIN: Planning with Continuous Linear Numeric Change", "authors": ["Amanda Coles", "Andrew Coles", "Maria Fox", "Derek Long"], "emails": ["AMANDA.COLES@KCL.AC.UK", "ANDREW.COLES@KCL.AC.UK", "MARIA.FOX@KCL.AC.UK", "DEREK.LONG@KCL.AC.UK"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Through this work, we are making two advances over the state of the art in terms of designers \"expressive reasoning capabilities: managing continuous linear changes and managing long-term effects combined with persistent inequalities, both of which require tightly coupled temporal and numerical reasoning during planning.

Motivation", "text": "There are a number of accounts that have been successfully applied to real problems, and the frequency with which applications are reported is increasing. The following examples include domains with discrete discrete continuous dynamics. These dynamics are typically used by discrediting time, packaging, numerical effects in step functions, or integrating propositional planning techniques with specialized solvers. They are all examples in which discrete continuous reasoning can be used to improve plan quality or solution time.

Problem Definition", "text": "COLIN is designed to solve a class of problems that are temporal and metric, and feature linear continuous metric changes. We refer to this as the class of temporal-metric-continuous problems, and it contains an essential subset of the problems described in PDDL2.1.As a step toward the class of temporal-metric-continuous problems, we remember the definition of a simple temporal-metric planning problem - one in which there is no time-dependent metric change. Simple temporal-metric problems can be presented as a tuple < I, A, G, M >, where the initial state is: a set of propositions and an assignment of values to a set of numerical variables. Either of these sentences may be empty. For notoriously convenience, we refer to the vector of numerical values in a given state as v. A, a series of actions, each < dur, eff, \"a series of explanations, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a..."}, {"heading": "4.1 An Example Problem", "text": "As an ongoing example of a time-metric-continuous domain, we use the problem shown in Figure 1. In this context, the borrower is domain, a borrower can use a mortgage to buy a home. The area is simplified to draw attention to some key aspects of continuous reasoning and is not proposed as a realistic application. In addition, the domain does not exploit the variable measures of the duration of life, even if the ability to handle them is a key feature of COLIN. The example illustrates the required parallelism between interesting interactions that affect a single continuous variable, and allows us to point out the differences between alternative heuristics described in Section 9. Management of the required parallel currency is also a key feature of COLIN, and domains with variable maturities will be discussed later in the papers. In this area, it is necessary to obtain a mortgage, have a suitable active savings plan and be able to set a deposit."}, {"heading": "5. Background in Metric and Temporal Planning", "text": "Most current work on discrete numerical planning is based on the ideas introduced in the planners MetricFF (Hoffmann, 2003).A discrete numerical planning problem introduces numerical variables into the planning domain that can have any real numerical value (or be undefined if they have not yet received a value).Actions can be expressed in relation to these variables and have effects that affect them. To enable discrete numerical change, Metric-FF has introduced an extension of the relaxed plan diagram heuristic (RPG) heuristic (Hoffmann & Nebel, 2001), which includes Metric RPG heuristic support for calculating a relaxed plan for discrete numerical change. As with propositional RPG heuristic, it performs a forward-looking accessibility analysis in which the delete effects of actions are relaxed (ignored), ignoring the reduction of mitigating effects does not always solve the problem."}, {"heading": "6.1 Temporal Plan Consistency", "text": "A state S is only temporarily consistent if the steps [0... n \u2212 1] in the plan, P that it can achieve are assigned values [t (0)... t (n \u2212 1)] that represent the times of execution of each of the corresponding steps, but in the temporal case this serves to check the temporal consistency of the plan. Any state for which the temporal constraints cannot be met is directly dependent on the search, since no extension of the action sequence can lead to a solution plan that is valid. The temporal constraints T that are built by CRIKEY3 in a state are each expressed in the form: lb \u2264 t (a) \u2264 ub where lb, < and 0 \u2264 lb."}, {"heading": "7.

This aggregated formulation is then passed on to a SAT-based arithmetic constraint solver, LPSAT. LPSAT consists of a DPLL solver and an LP solver. The SAT solver bypasses the LP solver, which triggers constraints on the LP solver that conflicts in the form of goods cannot be resolved if the constraints do not return."}, {"heading": "7.2 Kongming", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it will happen, until it does."}, {"heading": "7.3 UPMurphi", "text": "Another recently developed planner using PDDL2.1 and reasons for continuous processes is UPMurphi (Penna, Intrigila, Magazzeni, & Mercorio, 2009). UPMurphi takes a very different approach from what we have seen so far. Instead of thinking directly about continuous change, UPMurphi works to guess discrediting and iteratively refine it if the solution to the discarded problem is not validated against the original problem specification. The iterative driver is the coarseness of discrediting and the planning horizon, resulting in an interesting distinct basic architecture of TM-LPSAT.UPMurphi starting with continuous representation of the problem and starting with discrediting it.

Within our representation of the state, the timestamps of snap actions are not fixed in the plan (during the plan construction, the LP is only used to confirm that the plan can be subject to the current constraints), the evaluation of numerical flows in S is limited only within the limits imposed by the interaction between the variables and the variables."}, {"heading": "8.4 Some Comments on LP Efficiency", "text": "An LP is solved at each node in the search space, so it is important that this process is carried out as efficiently as possible.

Direct continuous numerical changes in this state. 2. Direct changes depending on the duration of an action (the duration of which is not fixed). 3. Discrete changes, where the magnitude of the change is based on one or more variables falling into one of the two previous categories. Any variables that do not meet one of these conditions can vary from the duration of an action (the duration of which is not fixed). 3.

Having introduced the necessary machines to support linear continuous numerical and permanent effects, we are now turning our attention to constructing informed heuristics in the face of time-dependent change. In Appendices B and C, we consider the standard Metric-FF Relaxed-Planning Graph (RPG) heuristically and the Temporal RPG (TRPG) used in CRIKEY3, and provide the details of these approaches as a reference, both depending on the initial construction of an accessibility curve introduced in Graphplan (Blum & Furst, 1995).

Fixing the value of tnow (v) to this lower value, maximise and minimise the value of v to find the boundaries on it - these are then used as the boundaries of v in fl (0.0)."}, {"heading": "9.3 Using the Two Variants of the Integrated Heuristic in the Borrower Problem", "text": "This example shows that refined heuristics leads the planner to a shorter Makespan plan than basic heuristics, because improved heuristic information leads to a selection of better decisions of helpful measures. Let's consider the situation after the execution of the first measure that leads the planner to a relaxed start. Figure 7 (top) shows that the TRPG and a relaxed plan have been constructed using the basic heuristic measures. Heuristics generates costs for this state of 5: the four measures shown in the relaxed plan, together with an additional measure to end the saveHard action that has already begun. This relaxed plan generates two helpful measures to start the LifeAudit and make the mortgage short. An attempt to start the LifeAudit action can quickly be dismissed as inconsistent in time, depending on how it comes true on BoughtHouse, so the other helpful action is chosen."}, {"heading": "10. Improving Performance", "text": "In this section, we present two techniques we use to improve the performance of COLIN: the first, described in Section 10.1, is a generalization of our previous exploitation of one-off actions (Coles et al., 2009a) to the situation in which they encapsulate continuous processes, resulting in faster scheduling for problems with these types of action; and the second, described in Section 10.2, takes advantage of the LP, which defines the constraints within the final plan to optimize planmetrics, which in many cases leads to better quality plans."}, {"heading": "10.1 Reasoning with One-Shot Actions", "text": "In previous work (Coles et al., 2009a), we have observed in both cases that there is a common modeling device in planning areas that leads to the use of measures that can only be applied once. We call these actions one-shot actions. They arise, especially if there is a collection of resources that can only be used once at a time. The crucial difference that one-shot actions imply for the TRPG is that continuous effects are generated by one-shot actions as soon as a certain point is reached: \u2022 If a one-shot action has a continuous numerical effect on V and a \"first in the action layer al (t) appears, then the gradient on V is due to this effect of a one-shot action, at the last, at the + dmax action (a).

Evaluation", "text": "The first question we ask ourselves is how expensive it is to expand the underlying CRIKEY3 system to allow COLIN to manage ongoing problems where there are no continuous effects. We compare the performance of COLIN with other temporary planners through a selection of time problems with no continuous effects. (Section 12.1) To evaluate how much overhead COLIN pays when there are no continuous effects, we compare the performance of COLIN with other temporary planners who do not pay these costs. We move on to looking at COLIN's performance in setting up and managing structures (redundantly) compared to state-of-the-art planners who do not pay these costs."}, {"heading": "12.1 Comparison with Existing Temporal Planners", "text": "There are few contemporary planners who can solve a full range of temporal problems. As we have already observed, many contemporary planners cannot solve problems with the required simultaneity. Even within the class of problems that need to be performed simultaneously with other actions in the plan, there are simpler problems that can be solved by leftward packaging of actions within the plan for which this is not possible. By extending the time to the earliest point at which an action currently performed ends, it is sufficient to solve the problem at the same time. This property means that the approach applied in Sapa Forward Search can be extended by a choice to either initiate a new action or to advance to the earliest point at which an action currently performed ends is sufficient to solve the problem. On the other hand, a problem requires that the ability to shift the time during the execution of an action to some intermediate points in order to coordinate the correct interaction with it is sufficient to solve the problem."}, {"heading": "12.2 Solving Problems with Continuous Linear Change and Duration-Dependent Effects", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of us are able to survive ourselves, and that they see themselves able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves.

We call this variant optimalCOLIN.In AUV and Rover domains, there are variable continuous actions in the domain for which the duration can be chosen as small as when these actions are used in a plan. Length actions could be chosen, for example, to relocate that they have drifted slightly, or to recharge a negligible amount of power. In these domains, the optimal search must include plans that are almost entirely geared to the optimal duration."}, {"heading": "12.5 Costs Associated with LP Scheduling", "text": "This year it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "13.

In the case of propositions, relaxation is such that it simply ignores propositional release effects on how (relaxed) actions are applied, the amount of true propositions is not decreasing. In the case of numbers, relaxation replaces exact mappings to numerical variables with bound constraints on their upper and lower actions. The application of relaxed actions extends the boundaries by reducing the decrease of effects and increasing the upper boundaries with incremental effects. Checking whether a numerical requirement is met is then simply a matter of checking whether the constraint is met within the boundaries."}, {"heading": "Appendix C.

Kongming solves a class of control planning problems with continuous dynamics. It is based on the construction of fact and action layers and flow tubes, within the iterative plan graph structure introduced in Graphplan (Blum & Furst, 1995). As the graph is developed, every action produces a flow tube which contains the valid trajectories as they develop over time. Starting in a feasible region, actions whose preconditions intersect with the feasible region can be applied and the reachable states at any time point can be computed using the state equations of the system. In the initial state of the system all the variables have single known values. A valid trajectory must pass through a sequence of flow tubes, but must also meet the constraints specified in the dynamics of the actions selected. The mutex relation used in Graphplan is extended to the continuous dynamics as well as the propositional fragment of the language. The graph is iteratively extended as in Graphplan, with a search for a plan conducted after each successive extension. The plan-graph encoding of a problem with continuous dynamics is translated into a Mixed Logical-Quadratic Program (MLQP). The metric objective functions used by the planner to optimise its behaviour can be defined in terms of quadratic functions of state variables. An example problem considered by Li and Williams (2008) is a 2-d representation of a simple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) problem where the AUV can glide, ascend and descend while avoiding obstacles.", "startOffset": 96, "endOffset": 1490}, {"referenceID": 41, "context": "A good example of this is the work by Boddy and Johnson (2002) and colleagues (Lamba et al., 2003) on planning oil refinery operations.", "startOffset": 78, "endOffset": 98}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "A good example of this is the work by Boddy and Johnson (2002) and colleagues (Lamba et al.", "startOffset": 38, "endOffset": 63}, {"referenceID": 14, "context": "The final domain we use is the Airplane Landing domain (Dierks, 2005), first posed as a challenge by Kim Larsen in his invited lecture at the 2009 International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling.", "startOffset": 55, "endOffset": 69}, {"referenceID": 27, "context": "One of the few planners that can also handle problems requiring temporal coordination is LPG-s (Gerevini et al., 2010).", "startOffset": 95, "endOffset": 118}, {"referenceID": 47, "context": "To evaluate whether or not this is appropriate (or whether always using an LP would be faster), and to compare the overheads of STP solving with LP solving on equivalent problems, we created a variant of COLIN that, at every state S, schedules the plan to reach S independently using three different schedulers: the original STP solver used in the standard version of COLIN, the equivalent LP solved using CPLEX (IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio) and the equivalent LP solved using CLP (Lougee-Heimer, 2003).", "startOffset": 488, "endOffset": 509}, {"referenceID": 30, "context": "We also use the Match-Lift and Driverlog Shift domains (Halsey, 2005).", "startOffset": 55, "endOffset": 69}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "The STP solver used is the incremental STP algorithm due to Cesta and Oddi (1996), as previously used in CRIKEY3.", "startOffset": 60, "endOffset": 82}, {"referenceID": 36, "context": "The Relaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic of Metric-FF (Hoffmann, 2003) has been the most popular numeric planning heuristic over the last decade, being widely used in many planners.", "startOffset": 56, "endOffset": 72}], "year": 2012, "abstractText": "In this paper we describe COLIN, a forward-chaining heuristic search planner, capable of reasoning with COntinuous LINear numeric change, in addition to the full temporal semantics of PDDL2.1. Through this work we make two advances to the state-of-the-art in terms of expressive reasoning capabilities of planners: the handling of continuous linear change, and the handling of duration-dependent effects in combination with duration inequalities, both of which require tightly coupled temporal and numeric reasoning during planning. COLIN combines FF-style forward chaining search, with the use of a Linear Program (LP) to check the consistency of the interacting temporal and numeric constraints at each state. The LP is used to compute bounds on the values of variables in each state, reducing the range of actions that need to be considered for application. In addition, we develop an extension of the Temporal Relaxed Planning Graph heuristic of CRIKEY3, to support reasoning directly with continuous change. We extend the range of task variables considered to be suitable candidates for specifying the gradient of the continuous numeric change effected by an action. Finally, we explore the potential for employing mixed integer programming as a tool for optimising the timestamps of the actions in the plan, once a solution has been found. To support this, we further contribute a selection of extended benchmark domains that include continuous numeric effects. We present results for COLIN that demonstrate its scalability on a range of benchmarks, and compare to existing state-of-the-art planners.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
