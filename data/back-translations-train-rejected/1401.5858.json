One important application area for such technology is the creation of new processes in Business Process Management (BPM), which is essential in an ever more dynamic business environment. A major obstacle for the application of Planning in this area lies in the modeling. Obtaining a suitable model to plan with -- ideally a description in PDDL, the most commonly used planning language -- is often prohibitively complicated and/or costly. Our core observation in this work is that this problem can be ameliorated by leveraging synergies with model-based software development. Our application at SAP, one of the leading vendors of enterprise software, demonstrates that even one-to-one model re-use is possible.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:47:21 GMT  (712kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5858v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["joerg hoffman", "ingo weber", "frank michael kraft"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5858"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.5858.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "SAP Speaks PDDL: Exploiting a Software-Engineering Model for Planning in Business Process Management", "authors": ["J\u00f6rg Hoffmann", "Ingo Weber", "Frank Michael Kraft"], "emails": ["hoffmann@cs.uni-saarland.de", "ingo.weber@nicta.com.au", "frank.michael.kraft@bpmnforum.net"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The model in question is called Status and Action Management (SAM) and describes the behavior of Business Objects (BO), i.e. large-scale data structures, at a level of abstraction that corresponds to the language of economists. SAM comprises more than 400 types of BOs, each of which is described in the form of a set of status variables and how their values are required and influenced for atomic processing steps (actions) from a business perspective. SAM was developed by SAP as part of a major model-based software engineering effort. We hereby show that one can use the same model for planning, thus obtaining a BPM planning application that requires no modeling at all. We combine SAM into a variant of PDDL and adapt a standard planner to solve this type of problem. Thanks to the resulting technology, economists can create new processes by simply specifying the desired behavior in the form of status variable value changes: effectively by describing the process in their own language."}, {"heading": "1.

For weak SAM planning - definition 6 - we use a variant of this search, which we call SAM-AO *. Indeed, we focus on what mainly follows SAM-AO *, since AO * is well known and will become clear as a side effect of the discourse. The search for alternative actions is forward-looking in a single child, so that the node is trivialized. As in AO *, we propagate \"nodes untied\" and \"nodes failed\" markers. The mechanisms for this are the usual in the case of OR nodes."}, {"heading": "5.2 Heuristic Function", "text": "To calculate target distance estimates, we use the all-outcomes determination known in probabilistic planning (Yoon et al., 2007) to get rid of non-deterministic actions, and then perform off-the-shelf FF heuristics (Hoffmann & Nebel, 2001)."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Relaxed Planning Graphs", "text": "The question of the causes and the causes of the extent and the manner in which people have behaved is not only the question of the causes, but also the question of the causes, the causes and the causes.

From this we can easily draw the following result that is relevant to us: Proposal 3 (role-play dead-end detection in SAM is reasonable) Let (X, A, I, G) a SAM planning task with A = Ad and. Let us be a state, and let Andav and a series of non-deterministic measures be. If the role-play is based on these inputs, there is no weak SAM solution for (s, Andav). To see this, note that the plot A \u2032 of Figure 5 represents an excessive approximation from the perspective of planning existence of the actual action that Ad, Andav we have available."}, {"heading": "5.2.3 Helpful Actions Pruning", "text": "Apart from estimating the target distance, the relaxed plan can be used to determine a promising subset of H (s) - the helpful measures - of the measures applicable to the assessed state. Essentially, H (s) consists of the measures applicable to s contained in the relaxed plan described in Section 5.2.1.8 above, which is used as a circumcision method simply by limiting the expansion of the state to take into account only actions H (s) during the search. This type of heuristic action is of paramount importance for the performance of planners (Hoffmann & Nebel, 2001; Richter & Helmert, 2009). In the SAM setting, an important aspect of FF's helpful measures is that it is accurate enough to distinguish relevant BOs from irrelevant measures. That is, if a BO is not mentioned in the target, then no measures are considered."}, {"heading": "6. Experiments", "text": "In the next section, we describe our prototype at SAP. Below, we evaluate our planning techniques in detail from a scientific point of view. Our experiments aim to understand three questions: (1) What is the applicability of strong or weak planning in SAM? (2) Is the runtime performance of our planner sufficient for the intended application? (3) How interesting is SAM as a planning benchmark? First, we explain the experimental setup. Then, we describe our experiments with FF for strong plans and FF for weak plans; we summarize our results with blind search. While these experiments take into account instances that relate to a single BO, we ultimately examine what happens when we scale the number of relevant BOs."}, {"heading": "6.1 Experiments Setup", "text": "All experiments were carried out on a 1.8GHz CPU, with a 10-minute time and 0.5GB BO memory cut-off. Our scheduler is in C as a modification of FF-v2.3. The source code used in our experiments, the problem generator, and the anonymized PDDL encoding of SAM are available for download at http: / / www.loria.fr / ~ hoffmanj / SAP-PDDL.zip. Our SAMAO * implementation is modified by the AO * implementation in Contingent-FF (Hoffmann & Brafman, 2005). Like this planner, we weighted heuristic values by a factor of 5 (we did not play with this parameter).We focus on the case where the initial state is specified in SAM. Thus, an SAM planning instance in what follows, identified by its goal, is a subset of variable values."}, {"heading": "6.2 Strong SAM Plans", "text": "In our first experiment, we evaluate the performance of strong planning on SAM, i.e., we run FF in a standard AO * tree that forces all children of AND nodes to be solved. We identify two parameters that are relevant to FF performance: the type of consideration, and Figure 6 shows how coverage and state ratings (number of calls to heuristic function) depend on these parameters. First, let's consider the number of solved, unsolved, and failed cases within the BOs, i.e., each data point corresponds to a type of BOs. \"The order of BOs depends on decreasing percentage of solved cases. For each BO, the percentage of solved, unsolved, and failed cases within that BO shows.\" The general message is mixed for 194 of the 371 BOs, i.e., for more than half of the BOs, so we have a strong plan."}, {"heading": "6.3 Weak SAM Plans", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "6.4 Blind Search", "text": "To investigate to what extent heuristic techniques are actually required to successfully master this domain - and to what extent the domain is an interesting bench10. The insolubility of certain target value combinations, i.e. partial assignments to variables of a BO, occurs naturally, since these variables are not independent. For example, some of the insoluble cases require a BO to simultaneously fulfill \"BO.zulassung: In Approval\" and \"BO.release: Released.\" In our current example, such a situation occurs, for example, when \"CQ.zulassung: notChecked\" together with \"CQ.Zulassung: Acceptance.\" For such techniques, we conducted an experiment with blind search. We used AO * with a trivial heuristic that returns 1 to non-target states and 0 to target states. Since weak planning is much better applicable than strong planning in SAM, we used blind plansemantics."}, {"heading": "6.5 Scaling Across BOs", "text": "For each BO, we selected a solved instance m (BO) with the maximum number of state ratings. As this will be of interest, we include all 404 BOs here, including those 33 BOs whose planning goals are all trivial (either insoluble or already true in the initial state of the BO); m (BO) is 1 for these BOs. We compared the data obtained with data we call ACCk by summarizing the state ratings for each individual target m (BO). This comparison is valid because the BOs are mutually independent, and a plan for COMk can be obtained by combining the plans for each target."}, {"heading": "7. Application Prototypes at SAP", "text": "We have integrated our technology into two BPM modeling environments and then briefly explain how to transform the planning output into a BPM format. We then outline the positioning of our prototypes within SAP and illustrate the business user view of our technology. We conclude with a few words about how the prototypes were evaluated internally by SAP."}, {"heading": "7.1 Transforming Plans to Business Processes", "text": "We use BPMN (Object Management Group, 2008).The BPMN process model, which corresponds to Figure 2, is shown in Figure 9. This process model uses alternative (\"x\") and parallel (\"+\") execution, combines redundant subtrees (\"Submit CQ.\"), removes failed results, and highlights in red those nodes that can have such outcomes. These changes are achieved with the following simple post-planning process. The \"vertical\" part of the action for ACCk is because, as we noted earlier, the global maximum number of state evaluations, 54386 for BO 347, is an extreme outsider. First, we remove each failed node along with the edge that leads to it."}, {"heading": "7.2 Positioning of our Prototypes at SAP", "text": "As part of our efforts to transfer our research results into the SAP product development organization, we have integrated our planning approach into two BPM prototypes. The first, Maestro for BPMN (Born, Hoffmann, Kaczmarek, Kowalkiewicz, Markovic, Scicluna, Weber, & Zhou, 2008, 2009), is a BPMN process modeling tool developed primarily for research and early prototyping by SAP Research. We focus on the following prototype, which is implemented in the context of the commercial SAP NetWeaver platform (SAP, 2010). NetWeaver is one of the most prominent software platforms at SAP and the central platform for the service-oriented architecture of SAP. It includes all the functionalities required to operate an SAP application. Our prototype is implemented as a research extension of the SAP Weaver BPM.SAP Netaver Weaver models-PM."}, {"heading": "7.3 Demonstration of our NetWeaver BPM Prototype", "text": "In fact, it is the case that we will have to set in motion a procedure at the beginning of the next decade, in which the question is whether and how we will be able to find a solution.

Evaluation within SAP consisted mainly of prototype demonstrations at various SAP events. For example, an early version of the tool was demonstrated at the global meeting of SAP Research \"BPM and SI\" (SI stands for \"Semantic Integration\"), in which participants from SAP partners and development participated. Demonstrations received positive feedback from SAP software architects. The perception was that this functionality would significantly strengthen the connection between SAP BPM and the underlying software infrastructure, thereby facilitating access to the services provided in an effective manner. Most critical comments focused on some decisions in user interface design, such as \"Non-logicians will not understand the meaning of the NOT symbol,\" or \"the list of several hundred BOs is too long for a down-drop box,\" if someone does not have a customer rating problem within 2008 or if there is no such a customer data available."}, {"heading": "8. Related Work", "text": "The basic idea examined in this paper - using planning systems to help business professionals develop new processes that are close to the IT infrastructure - has been around for some time. (For example, it was implemented more than a decade ago by Jonathan et al. (1999). It is also discussed in the roadmap of the PLANET Network of Excellence in AI Planning (Biundo et al., 2003). (More recently, the idea was implemented in the SHAMASH system. SHAMASH is a knowledge-based BPM tool that aims to assist in the development and optimization of process models (Aler, Borrajo, Camacho, SierraAlonso, 2002). Among other things, the tool includes user-friendly interfaces that allow users to conveniently annotate processes with rich context information, in particular in the form of \"rules\" that roughly coincide with planning actions. (and other information) then form the basis for new processes in the DDL and PDL translation."}, {"heading": "9.

One important application area for such technology is the creation of new processes in Business Process Management (BPM), which is essential in an ever more dynamic business environment. A major obstacle for the application of Planning in this area lies in the modeling. Obtaining a suitable model to plan with \u2013 ideally a description in PDDL, the most commonly used planning language \u2013 is often prohibitively complicated and/or costly. Our core observation in this work is that this problem can be ameliorated by leveraging synergies with model-based software development. Our application at SAP, one of the leading vendors of enterprise software, demonstrates that even one-to-one model re-use is possible. The model in question is called Status and Action Management (SAM). It describes the behavior of Business Objects (BO), i.e., large-scale data structures, at a level of abstraction corresponding to the language of business experts. SAM covers more than 400 kinds of BOs, each of which is described in terms of a set of status variables and how their values are required for, and affected by, processing steps (actions) that are atomic from a business perspective. SAM was developed by SAP as part of a major model-based software engineering effort. We show herein that one can use this same model for planning, thus obtaining a BPM planning application that incurs no modeling overhead at all. We compile SAM into a variant of PDDL, and adapt an off-the-shelf planner to solve this kind of problem. Thanks to the resulting technology, business experts may create new processes simply by specifying the desired behavior in terms of status variable value changes: effectively, by describing the process in their own language.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
