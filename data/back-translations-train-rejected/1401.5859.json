Our solution uses and adapts several existing techniques: planning for deterministic mixed discrete-continuous problems and Monte Carlo random samples for policy learning. The paper describes the development of planning techniques that enable a solution to nonlinear continuous dynamic models for recording battery behavior. This approach depends on carefully managed discrediting of the time dimension. Strategies are developed using a classification approach and this idea offers opportunities for wider use of other problems. The approach and its generality are described in the paper crafting. Application of the approach leads to the construction of strategies that significantly exceed those that are currently in use in the simulation, and the best published solutions for the battery physics problem do not match the 99% accurately with the results obtained in the simulation of the battery physics."}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "The paper is an extended and developed version of the work originally presented at the International Conference on Automatic Planning and Planning (Fox, Long, & Magazzeni, 2011) and in particular adds physical results to the work described in this paper. An increasing number of systems depend on the battery supply, ranging from small mobile devices to very large high-performance devices, such as batteries used for local storage in substations. In many of these systems, there are significant user benefits or technical reasons to support the supply of multiple batteries, with the load between batteries being switched by a control system. To operate such systems for the longest time, it is necessary to develop strategies that extract the maximum life of batteries. We show how planning is used as the basis for a highly efficient switching strategy."}, {"heading": "2. Motivations", "text": "Many electrically powered systems rely on large, heavy batteries to provide an adequate level of power and current. If the power requirements of these devices can be met by multiple lightweight batteries that carry the same load as is normally provided by a much larger battery, this could significantly change the way these devices are used and the range of applications for which they may be suitable. Examples of powered systems that could benefit from the distribution of battery power include externally operated electric prostheses powered by electric motors may be more functional and attractive than body-operated prostheses, but they can be heavy and expensive. The performance requirements of a capable prosthetic arm that combines an elbow with a dexterous hand require a large, and therefore heavy battery. The high-speed motors needed to drive a prosthetic elbow require high voltages and current, while modern skillful hands require significantly more power than traditional motorized hands."}, {"heading": "3. The Multiple Battery Usage Problem", "text": "The multiple use of the battery has been studied by several authors, from the perspective of electrical engineering, for example in the work of Benini et al. (2003) and Rao et al. (2003), and also from the perspective of planning (Jongerden, Haverkort, Bohnenkamp, & Katoen, 2009) and an optimization perspective (Wang & Cassandras, 2011) (simplifying the assumption that the load can be distributed arbitrarily between batteries). Benini et al. construct a very accurate battery model to capture lithium ions, detect cadmium nickel types and lead types, and show how to achieve efficiency, between 70% and 97.5%. To achieve this, the policy is designed to choose a new battery, the battery must be maintained."}, {"heading": "3.1 Objectives", "text": "Our main purpose in designing these guidelines is to achieve the longest possible battery life; the best-used solutions typically deliver less than 80% efficiency, while the best published solutions have an efficiency of less than 95% (our reading suggests that these high values are more likely to be found in simulation than in physical experiments); we show that our approach, based on the design of optimizing solutions to Monte Carlo problems and their use in the design of appropriate strategies, produces robust solutions that achieve more than 99% efficiency in simulation; and, as a side effect of the way these solutions are designed, we demonstrate that we achieve this efficiency in service life while using a lower number of battery switches than published strategies; this advantageous side effect reduces potential switching losses in the implementation of the guidelines; we use the Kinetic Battery Model (below this McGowell & Gowan Mixed Solution in 1993)."}, {"heading": "3.2 The Kinetic Battery Model", "text": "In the Kinetic Battery Model (Manwell & McGowan, 1993; Jongerden et al., 2009), the battery charge is distributed over two wells: the existing and the bound charge (see Figure 1); a fraction c of the total charge is stored in the available charge source, and a fraction 1 \u2212 c in the bound charge source; the charge flows from the bound charge source through a solid conductivity \"valve,\" k \u2212 where t is the time, whereas the bound charge source delivers electrons only to the existing charge source; the charge flows from the bound charge source (c) through a solid conductivity \"valve, k \u2212. Furthermore, the speed at which the charge flows between the wells depends on the height difference between the two wells."}, {"heading": "3.3 Battery Usage Planning", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have established in the past."}, {"heading": "3.4 Our Approach", "text": "We choose an approach based on a combination of two ideas: First, we select a deterministic problem from the distribution of loads, which we then solve using the continuous KiBaM model as a battery model, which leads to an interesting continuous nonlinear optimization problem, which we solve using a discretizing and validating approach. Currently, we use UPMurphi (Della Penna, Intrigila, Magazzeni, & Mercorio, 2009) to solve the deterministic instances, but after discretizing, in principle any metric scheduler could be used. Second, we use a decision tree classifier to combine the solutions for the sample instances and learn a policy for the MDP from which the problems are drawn. The classification process captures the measures and produces a policy in the form of a decision tree. Our approach is in a sense domain-specific: \u2022 Our discrediting scheme is based on general principles, but is limited to the problem area and the problem area only."}, {"heading": "4. Solving Deterministic Multiple Battery Problems", "text": "This year it is so far that it will be able to retaliate, \"he said.\" It's not yet so far that we will be able to do it, \"he said.\" But we're not yet able to do it as if we were able to do it as if we were doing it. \""}, {"heading": "4.2 The Discretise-and-Validate Approach", "text": "Our technique is based on a discrediting and validation approach (see Figure 6), in which the continuous dynamics of the problem are transformed into a discredited model, using discrete time steps and associated step functions for resource values instead of the original continuous dynamics (see Figure 6).This relaxed problem is solved by a forward-looking accessibility analysis, and then solutions are used against the continuous model, which considers the validator, the validator, Howey et al as the first to provide analytical solutions to differential equations in the models. The validation process is used to determine whether discrediting of the relaxed problem is required and guide is re-modeled. As an example in our simulation, we first consider a time discretization of 0.1, and get the plan shown in Figure 7 (left).However, if we have found the discrete solution of the relaxed problem and the continuous solution against the following model, we find out that the validation has not actually been shown in the AL, as the following model is validated."}, {"heading": "4.3 The Monotonicity Property and Planning", "text": "The battery domain has an important feature that supports a simple heuristic evaluation function for states: the charge in the battery decreases monotonously over time, and the optimal solution is the one that offers the longest possible plan. An upper limit for the duration of the solution can be found by observing that the optimal duration cannot exceed that of a single battery with combined capacity. In order to put this approach into practice, it is essential that we have an informed heuristics to search the room (assuming the same discharge and flow characteristics). As soon as we have a horizon, we construct and search our warped search space. To make this approach practical, it is essential that we have an informed heuristics to search the room. For this domain, the duration of the current state plan plus the remaining charge is permissible, but completely uninformative, while the duration plus the total charge available is highly informative."}, {"heading": "4.4 Plan Search with Variable Discretisation", "text": "In fact, the number of working women in Germany is many times higher than in other countries compared to men in the USA."}, {"heading": "4.5 Performance on Deterministic Load Problems", "text": "We present a first set of experimental results to show, in the simulation, the performance of our solution approach on the deterministic battery charging system that we first used, up to a decentralized battery charge, that of Jongerden et al. (2009), where two types of jobs are considered, a low current job (250 mA) and a high current job (500 mA), according to the following load profiles: a load with only low current jobs (CL 500) and a switch between a low current job and a high current job (CL old); \u2022 intermittent loads with short idle times of one minute between jobs (ILs 250), one with only high current jobs (ILs 500) and an alternating between a low current job and a high current job (ILs); \u2022 intermittent loads with long idle times between jobs: one with only low current jobs (ILs 250) and one with only high current jobs (ILs 500)."}, {"heading": "5. From Plans to Policies", "text": "Having shown how to generate high-quality plans for deterministic multiple battery management problems, we now turn our attention to the stochastic problem that we are really interested in solving. In general, we cannot know in advance what the load profile that will be applied to the batteries will be, but we assume that a probability distribution that characterizes the typical use of batteries is available. Such a probabilistic problem can be cast as a hybrid temporary Markov model, in which S is a series of states where A is a set of measures, P is a probability function in which Pa (s, s) = Pr (st + 1 = s \u2032 st = s \u2032 st = s \u2032 s st = s) is the probability that the will cause a transition from state s'S to s."}, {"heading": "5.1 Policy Learning through Classification", "text": "To learn a classification policy, it is first necessary to generate an appropriate training data set. To solve our problem, this data set must combine the states of the batteries and the current load with an appropriate decision (which battery will be used to handle the load).We construct the training data by creating a sample of profiles from the stochastic description of the expected loads. The distributions we have used to describe the amplitude, duration and frequency of loads are shown in Figure 13. The deterrent solutions to these problems are constructed as described in Section 4. Training data is then generated from these plans by simulating their execution and recording of battery states, loading and battery states are recorded in a fixed time division within the plan. If the increase is 0.01 minutes, then the training data generated from a plan will be recorded (available and bound), charge states and currently selected batteries (which may not be changed from the previous timeframe)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Results from Policies", "text": "To use the decision tree, we embedded the WEKA classes for charging the classification model in our battery simulation system. Battery Case 8 is represented by a tree with 61 levels and consists of 7645 nodes, each of which contains a comparison between one of the state variables and a threshold. Applying this decision tree to determine which battery to charge at each decision point takes a negligible time.In order to evaluate the performance of the policy, we considered four probability distributions with different average values for the load amplitude, namely 100, 250, 500, 750 mA. For each distribution, we created 100 stochastic load profiles and used the policy for its maintenance. Note that the load profiles used to evaluate the policy are independent of those used for training, although they come from the same probability distributions, namely 100, 250, 500, 750 mA. Table 4 shows the average value and the standard deviation for the lifetime of our policy, and the number of the best policy choices."}, {"heading": "6.

Physical Experiments", "text": "In this section, we report on the results of an experiment with a \"kitchen table\" consisting of a simple circuit constructed from breadboard components and an Arduino Mega Board that we used to capture and control.1 With this device, we were able to show that our simulation results are being translated into reality. As part of our future work, further experiments will be carried out in a professional laboratory to further explore the advantages and limitations of our approach. The experiment aims to show that the plan-based policy method achieves a life span similar to the best of two strategies, but with significantly reduced switching. The simulation results show that the plan-based policy, which requires the best of two strategies, can achieve a near-optimal life span even switching mechanism of 5 minutes within less than 1% of the theoretical optimal switching frequency."}, {"heading": "7.1 The Electronic Apparatus", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this is a very complex situation for both sides."}, {"heading": "7.2 Estimating Parameters", "text": "In this thesis, we used the Kinetic Battery Model (Manwell & McGowan, 1993) and followed the parameter estimation process described by Manwell and McGowan (1994). According to their description, the extended KiBaM consists of three parts: a capacity model, a voltage model and a lifetime model. We use a simple lifetime model (we assume that battery behavior does not change due to charging)."}, {"heading": "7.2.1 THE CAPACITY MODEL", "text": "The capacity of the system varies, how the battery has penetrated and how the battery has penetrated is described by a first set of different systems, and the time it takes to discharge the battery is very long."}, {"heading": "7.2.2 THE VOLTAGE MODEL", "text": "It is well known that it is very difficult to accurately assess the condition of the battery, as the behavior of the battery is smoke.The measured voltage drops because the battery has a typical \"knee shape,\" which represents the decrease in voltage over time."}, {"heading": "7.2.3 EVALUATING THE STATE OF CHARGE OF THE BATTERY", "text": "Using the Arduino Mega Board, we collect voltage and current readings from the batteries at a frequency of Q = every half second. For each battery in use, we calculate a rolling average over the last 65 voltage readings that have been reported since the battery was first charged (before that time, the reported battery readings may be inaccurate). We calculate Eobs and Q every 36 seconds for each battery. The voltage observed is influenced by the load on the battery that we observe at that time, so we adjust the observed voltage value to take into account the internal resistance and load on the battery. These results in the uncharged voltage Vobs: Vobs = Eobs + 0.34IobsWe can then calculate the difference between Vobs and VEMF."}, {"heading": "7.2.4 RECHARGING AND OTHER EFFECTS", "text": "It is clear that conducting multiple experiments with lead-acid batteries will require recharging them between discharges; however, recharging lead-acid batteries is known to have an impact on their performance: they deteriorate with repeated cycle. However, the gel batteries we use are low-cycle batteries that can be recharged hundreds of times before they reach the end of their life cycle. Manwell and McGowan (1994) proposed a life-cycle model based on a Rainflow cycle counter algorithm that takes into account the fact that recharging damages the batteries and impairs their rechargeability. Given the fact that our batteries were brand new and we have not used them more than 30 times, we assume that the effects of repeated discharge and recharging during the life of our experiment2 will have no relevance.For an extended experiment or larger model, the adoption of this model would be of rain straw behavior, but the nature of our study is different."}, {"heading": "7.3 The Experiments", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take one year to move on to the next round."}, {"heading": "1 7.887 71 7.534 73 \u2013 \u2013 8.77", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2 8.033 47 7.000 81 7.079 1 8.91", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3 7.974 91 7.563 705 \u2013 \u2013 9.04", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4 7.831 158 6.998 701 \u2013 \u2013 9.23", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5 7.030 17 6.226 609 \u2013 \u2013 9.11", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6 7.120 36 7.085 706 \u2013 \u2013 8.81", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7 7.669 21 7.645 649 \u2013 \u2013 9.11", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "8 7.677 88 6.515 584 \u2013 \u2013 8.87", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "9 8.341 33 5.901 567 \u2013 \u2013 8.91", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "10 6.972 13 6.890 690 \u2013 \u2013 8.92", "text": "A paired t-test to these results shows that they are significant (p = 0.013). We expect these improvements to be even more pronounced for n > 2 batteries, but conducting such experiments is the subject of future work. The last column in the table called \"max\" indicates the theoretical maximum battery life for the given load profile, which is likely to be higher than the maximum value achievable in practice, since the point at which the batteries are considered dead is based on the observed terminal voltages during charging. The internal resistance of the batteries means that this point is reached earlier than in the idealized battery model used in the simulation. The average efficiency of the batteries is 85% of our policy and 77% of the best-of-two compared to this theoretical maximum, which is in line with both the expectation that the theoretical value is quite high and with the previously reported performance of battery management systems, which typically reach about 80% efficiency."}, {"heading": "8. Future Work", "text": "In fact, we are able to go in search of a solution that is capable of finding a solution that meets the needs of the people."}, {"heading": "9. Conclusions", "text": "This paper has presented an interesting and potentially important problem, the management of systems powered by multiple independent batteries, and has found a novel solution to it. In doing so, we have brought together research on planning and policy learning to arrive at a new and powerful approach. We have evaluated our plans experimentally and learned strategies in simulation, and these results show that our solution can be better than 99% efficiency compared to the theoretical optimum (which is unattainable in practice). Not only do we achieve very high efficiencies, but we do so at a low cost in terms of battery replacement, which is advantageous because switching is energy wasteful and tends to reduce the quality of service without additional smoothing, which leads to energy losses. After confirming our results in the simulation, we explore the behavior of the ideas in physical tests, and these results confirm that the real batteries are far less good than their simulated counterparts."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank Marijn Jongerden and Boudewijn Haverkort for introducing us to the problem of multiple battery use and drawing our attention to the disposition problem and the related policy approaches.

This semantics is one route by which model-checking systems designed to manage timed hybrid automata can be adapted to operate directly on the battery problem.

In solving very large MDPs, researchers have identified a variety of techniques that can help to overcome the prohibitive cost of policy iteration or value iteration, the classical techniques for solving MDPs. In general, these techniques approximate the solution, often focussing on those parts of the policy that apply to states that are likely to be visited along the trajectory.

The problem can be cast as a planning problem under uncertainty. We describe the approach we have adopted to modelling and solving this problem, seen as a Markov Decision Problem, building effective policies for battery switching in the face of stochastic load profiles. Our solution exploits and adapts several existing techniques: planning for deterministic mixed discrete-continuous problems and Monte Carlo sampling for policy learning. The paper describes the development of planning techniques to allow solution of the non-linear continuous dynamic models capturing the battery behaviours. This approach depends on carefully handled discretisation of the temporal dimension. The construction of policies is performed using a classification approach and this idea offers opportunities for wider exploitation in other problems. The approach and its generality are described in the paper. Application of the approach leads to construction of policies that, in simulation, significantly outperform those that are currently in use and the best published solutions to the battery management problem. We achieve solutions that achieve more than 99% efficiency in simulation compared with the theoretical limit and do so with far fewer battery switches than existing policies. Behaviour of physical batteries does not exactly match the simulated models for many reasons, so to confirm that our theoretical results can lead to real measured improvements in performance we also conduct and report experiments using a physical test system. These results demonstrate that we can obtain 5%-15% improvement in lifetimes in the case of a two battery system.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
