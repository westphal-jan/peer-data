For these instances, we can incorporate this geographical information to determine optimal or nearly-optimal solutions to the n-team Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP), an NP-hard sports scheduling problem whose solution is a double round-robin tournament schedule that minimizes the sum total of distances traveled by all n teams. We introduce the Linear Distance Traveling Tournament Problem (LD-TTP), and solve it for n=4 and n=6, generating the complete set of possible solutions through elementary combinatorial techniques. For larger n, we propose a novel \"expander construction\" that generates an approximate solution to the LD-TTP. For n congruent to 4 modulo 6, we show that our expander construction produces a feasible double round-robin tournament schedule whose total distance is guaranteed to be no worse than 4/3 times the optimal solution, regardless of where the n teams are located. This 4/3-approximation for the LD-TTP is stronger than the currently best-known ratio of 5/3 + epsilon for the general TTP. We conclude the paper by applying this linear distance relaxation to general (non-linear) n-team TTP instances, where we develop fast approximate solutions by simply \"assuming\" the n teams lie on a straight line and solving the modified problem.

Introduction", "text": "In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective technique to develop approximate solutions to the problem of travel in Chile by assuming that the n teams are on a straight line, reducing the pairs of distances to only n \u2212 1 variables and then solving the relaxed problem. The problem of travel (TTP) was inspired by the real problem of optimizing the regular schedule in Major League Baseball. TTP's goal is to determine the optimal schedule for an n-team tournament that minimizes the total number of distances traveled."}, {"heading": "2. The Traveling Tournament Problem", "text": "Let D be the n \u00d7 n distance matrix in which the entry Di, j is the distance between the home stages of the teams ti and tj. By definition, Di, j = Dj, i is for all 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, and all diagonal entries Di, i are zero. We assume that the distances form a metric, i.e. Di, j \u2264 Di, k + Dk, j for all i, j, k. The TTP requires a tournament lasting 2 (n \u2212 1) days in which each team has exactly one game per day with no yes or days off (this explains why n must be even.) The goal is to determine the total distance covered by the n teams, subject to the following minimum distance: (a) each venue requires NIS, each pair of teams plays twice, once in each other venue of the other's game."}, {"heading": "3.

Thus, Di, j = Di, k + Dk, j for all triplets (i, j, k) with1 \u2264 i < k < j \u2264 n. Since the triangle inequality is replaced by the triangle equality, we no longer need to consider all (n 2) entries in the distance matrix D; the total travel distance of each tournament is a function of n \u2212 1 variables, namely the set {Di, i + 1: 1 \u2264 i n \u2212 1}. For remarkable convenience, di: = Di, i + 1 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2212 1.Table 2 yields a workable solution for the 4-team LD-TTP.

The optimal solution for the game board is a game board with the total distance S + 2min {d4 + 20d3 + 16d4, d3 + d4, d4, d2 + d5, d3, d3, Xi}.

A natural follow-up question is whether our techniques for greater values of n. \u2212 k. To give a partial answer to this question, we show that our design for all n-4 (mod 6), we can develop a solution for the n-team LD-TTP, whose total distance is at most 33% higher than that of the optimal solution, although in practice this optimization gap is actually much lower. While our design only contains a 43 approximation, we note that this ratio is stronger than the currently best known (53 +) teams, whose total distance for the general TTP (Yamaguchi, Imahori, Miyashiro, & Matsui) is completely different from our 2011 design based on an Expander and Apply to the previous ones."}, {"heading": "6.

Optimality Gap", "text": "In Table 13, all five of the 6-team benchmark instances are identical solutions for both the TTP and the LD-TTP. A natural question is whether this is always the case. We show that the TTP and the LD-TTP solutions for n = 4 must be identical, but not necessarily for n = 1.3. For each instance that is dependent on n-teams, we define the total distance of an optimal LD-TTP solution. In order to be the maximum optimum gap, we define OGn, the largest value of X-Xo-Xo taken across all instances. Theorem 4, whose instance is based on n = 4 teams, the optimal TTP solution is the optimal solution. In other words, OG4 = 0%. In Table 3, we showed that there are 18 non-isomorphic schedules with the total distance 8 (d1 + d2 + d3), i.e. 18 different solutions for the 18 different TTP models."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusion", "text": "In many professional sports leagues, teams are divided into two conferences, where teams within their own conference have league games as well as league games against teams from other conferences. TTP models play within the league. NPcomplete Bipartite Traveling Tournament Problem (Hoshino & Kawarabayashi, 2011) models interleague games, and it would be interesting to see if our linear distance relaxation can also be applied to bilateral distances to formulate new ideas in tournament planning within the league. We close the paper by proposing two new benchmark distances for the Traveling Tournament problem, as well as an open problem and a conjection over the Linear Distance TTP. We start with the benchmark instances. For each n-4, we define LINEn as an example where the n teams are on a straight line, with a distance from a unit separating each pair of neighboring teams, i.e. dk CRT1 = all-INTK-1 for each INTTK-1 distance."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research), the C & C Foundation, the Kayamori Foundation, and the Inoue Research Award for Young Scientists."}, {"heading": "Appendix A", "text": "We used Maplesoft (www.maplesoft.com) to generate the set of optimal LD-TTP schedules for n = 4 and n = 6.
