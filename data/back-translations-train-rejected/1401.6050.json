Unlike all other top systems of semantic dependency parsing that have to rely on a pipeline framework to chain up a series of submodels each specialized for a specific subtask, the one presented in this article integrates everything into one model, in hopes of achieving desirable integrity and practicality for real applications while maintaining a competitive performance. This integrative approach tackles semantic parsing as a word pair classification problem using a maximum entropy classifier. We leverage adaptive pruning of argument candidates and large-scale feature selection engineering to allow the largest feature space ever in use so far in this field, it achieves a state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation data set for CoNLL-2008 shared task, on top of all but one top pipeline system, confirming its feasibility and effectiveness.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 16:45:39 GMT  (265kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6050v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hai zhao", "xiaotian zhang", "chunyu kit"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.6050"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.6050.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Integrative Semantic Dependency Parsing via Efficient Large-scale Feature Selection", "authors": ["Hai Zhao", "Xiaotian Zhang"], "emails": ["zhaohai@cs.sjtu.edu.cn", "xtian.zh@gmail.com", "ctckit@cityu.edu.hk"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

However, we opt to further develop a decoding algorithm to derive the optimal reasoning structure for each predicate that is thus identified by the classifier (Roth & Yih, & Zimak, 2004).

Note that CoNLL-2008 is essentially a common learning task on both syntactic and semantic dependencies. Research results presented in this article focus on semantic dependencies, with the primary evaluation parameter being the semantically labeled F1 score (Sem-F1). Other scores, including the macro-labeled F1 score (Macro-F1), which evaluates the participating systems in CoNLL-2008, and Sem-F1 / LAS, the relationship between the labeled F1 score for both labeled and labeled LAS, are also evaluated."}, {"heading": "7.1 Syntactic Input", "text": "Two types of syntactic input are used to examine the effectiveness of our integrative SRL approach: one is the syntactic input of the gold standard available from the official dataset, and the other is the analysis of the results of the same data generated by two state-of-the-art syntactic parsers, MSTparser9 (McDonald, Pereira, Ribarov, & Hajic, 2005; McDonald & Pereira, 2006) and the parser of Johansson and Nugues (2008).
