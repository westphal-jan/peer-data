The term \"MWE\" is used to refer to various types of linguistic units and expressions, including phrases (many words of thanks), etc. However, while there is no universally agreed definition of MWE, most researchers use the term to refer to these common phrases that are subject to a certain level of semantic optics. Sag et al al al. (2002, p. 1) define them as \"idiosyncratic interpretations.\""}, {"heading": "1.

Baseline System", "text": "As already mentioned, the task of identifying Bengali nouns from a document is little attention in the literature, and therefore there is no previously developed methodology that can be used for the baseline. Therefore, in this experiment, we are simply able to adapt a heuristics to develop our baseline system. Phrases that do not have nominal indicators and determinants at the prefix and suffix positions are selected as MWEs in the baseline system. Of course, the baseline system achieves a high accuracy in relation to most of the identified MWEs meet the above-mentioned candidates, but in terms of precision it shows a very low accuracy (38.68%), as many collocalized and fully compositional elements were incorrectly identified as MWEs. The main challenge of our model was to filter these irrelevant collocations from the selected candidate."}, {"heading": "6.

WordNet::Similarity Measurement", "text": "We also include English WordNet 2.17 in this experiment to measure the semantic distance between two Bengali words after we have translated them into English. Although the idea is trivial when considering the manual intervention of the translation process, our main focus was to get an idea of how the semantic similarity of two components can help identify the combination as MWE, and how a well-defined lexical tool is indispensable in the currently adapted linguistic environment. As mentioned above, WordNet:: Similarity is an open source package developed at the University of Minnesota to calculate the lexical similarity between word (or sense). Basically, it offers six measures of similarity and three measures of kinship based on the lexical WordNet database (Fellbaum, 1998)."}, {"heading": "9. Discussion", "text": "At the beginning of the article, we argued that the increasing degree of semantic similarity between two components of a candidate bigram indicates that the candidate is less likely to be a multi-word expression. Statistical methods achieve low accuracy because the medium-sized corpus does not provide significant evidence of its occurrence to designate the non-compositional expression as MWEs. We have taken an approach that takes into account the semantic interpretation of MWEs, which seems to be unconventional when it comes to identifying MWEs in any language. In the experimental results, the semantic cluster approach outperforms the other systems, but the cluster algorithm is able to identify those MWEs whose semantics are completely opaque to the semantics of their components (strictly non-compositional)."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced a semi-automatic approach to establish the hypothesis. We have compared our results with the base system and traditional statistical systems. We have shown that clustering measures can be an effective measure to improve the extraction task of MWEs. Contributions in the paper are four-fold: firstly, we offer an efficient method for clustering noun signs with similar meaning; secondly, we propose a semantic, similarity-based approach to the identification of MWEs; thirdly, it is a preliminary attempt to reconstruct a monolingual Bengali dictionary as a standard lexical thesaurus; and finally, the current task is a groundbreaking step towards the development of Bengal WordNet. Finally, we would like to stress that this entire methodology can be used to identify MWEs in any other linguistic domain."}, {"heading": "Agarwal, A., Ray, B., Choudhury, M., Sarkar, S. & Basu, A.
