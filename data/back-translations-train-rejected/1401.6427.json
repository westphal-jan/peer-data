Since most existing methods are supervised and require large corpora, which for many languages do not exist, we have concentrated our efforts to reduce the need for annotated data as much as possible. This paper presents two different algorithms towards this goal. The first algorithm is a weakly supervised machine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between events. In the first stage, the algorithm learns a general classifier from an annotated corpus. Then, inspired by the hypothesis of \"one type of temporal relation per discourse, it extracts useful information from a cluster of topically related documents. We show that by combining the global information of such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier, a bootstrapping cross-document classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between events. Our experiments show that without any additional annotated data, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous successful systems. The second proposed method for temporal relation extraction is based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Within EM, we used different techniques such as a greedy best-first search and integer linear programming for temporal inconsistency removal. We think that the experimental results of our EM based algorithm, as a first step toward a fully unsupervised temporal relation extraction method, is encouraging.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:50:50 GMT  (795kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6427v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["seyed abolghasem mirroshandel", "gholamreza ghassem-sani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.6427"}, "pdf": {"name": "1401.6427.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Towards Unsupervised Learning of Temporal Relations between Events", "authors": ["Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel", "Gholamreza Ghassem-Sani"], "emails": ["mirroshandel@ce.sharif.edu", "sani@sharif.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Temporal Relation Learning", "text": "Assuming that we have access to texts in which events and time expressions are adequately labeled, two different tasks relating to time learning can be distinguished: 1) determining whether there is any relationship between a particular pair of events / time expressions; 2) determining the relationship type for positive cases of the first task. The first task is very difficult to judge because commentators ignore many plausible existing relationships while tagging the corpora (Mani et al., 2006). Accordingly, in this paper we have focused only on the second task, which can be defined as follows: \"For a particular ordered pair of components (x1, x2) listing x2 events and xx2 time expressions, a temporal relationship, a temporal classification of the ri relationship that is temporally linked.\" As shown in Figure 1, each temporal relationship can be one of the fourteen types proposed in TimeML."}, {"heading": "2.1 Statistical Methods", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where there is only one occasion when there is a scandal, in which there is a scandal."}, {"heading": "2.2 Rule-Based Methods", "text": "In most of these works, rules (patterns) are defined manually. Perhaps, the simplest rule-based method is the one developed using a knowledge resource called VerbOcean (Chklovski & Pantel, 2005). For example, there are rules like \"to verb-X and then verb-Y,\" \"to verb-Y and eventually verb-Y,\" or \"to verb-X and later verb-Y\" for the \"happens-before\" relationship, and there are rules like \"to verb-X and then verb-Y,\" \"to verb-Y and later.\""}, {"heading": "2.3 Hybrid Methods", "text": "It has been shown that one can increase the accuracy of temporal relation classifiers by merging some of the methods discussed, for example, in the work of Chambers and Jurafsky (2008), local decisions generated by a statistical method were combined with two types of implicit global rule-based properties, which included the transitivity rule (e.g. Abefore B and B before C implies A before C), and the normalization of time expressions (e.g. the last month is the day before yesterday).The constraints were used to create a densely connected network of events, and then a global state of consistency was forced by integrating the constraints into a holistic linear programming framework (Chambers & Jurafsky, 2008).Integrated linear programming with local classifiers was shown to be suitable only for cases where the number of possible relationships between events is limited (Denis & Muller, 2011)."}, {"heading": "3. Bootstrapped Cross-Document Classification (BCDC)", "text": "This section introduces a new method for extracting temporal relationships between events, which we call Bootstrapped Cross-Document Classification (BCDC).The results of the experiments with BCDC show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to previous work (see Tables 6 and 7).We have used SVM with three different cores in the learning process. In our bootstrapping method (self-training) there are two innovations: 1) It is an information retrieval based approach that extracts useful information exclusively from related documents. 2) It builds a specific model for each test document. Before we describe BCDC, our motivation is briefly explained in the next section."}, {"heading": "3.1 Motivation", "text": "In a regular corpus of heterogeneous documents, we assume that similar pairs of events, which often act as event triggers, are very likely related documents that have different senses in different documents. For example, event \"shooting\" may have a sense of \"shooting\" in a document about the message, while it may also have a sense of \"termination\" of someone's job in another document about a company. However, for a cluster of related documents, the distribution should be much less divergent. This motivated us, the so-called \"one sense per discourse\" hypothesis (Yarowsky, 1995) to address the problem of temporal allocation, and expand the scope of the discourse from a single document to a cluster of topically related documents. Also, inspired by another work that suggested assumptions of an event trigger sense and an event reasoning role per discourse (Ji & Grishman, 2008), we base our work on an analogous assumption that we call temporally related documents, which we call \"a kind of a temporal discourse per course.\""}, {"heading": "3.2 Feature Engineering", "text": "BCDC uses two types of attributes: basic and additional event-event attributes. Basic attributes are simple attributes related to individual events, and additional event-event attributes are those extracted from two related events. In the next two sections, these attributes are explained in more detail."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Basic Features", "text": "For each event, there are five temporal attributes identified in standard corpora: 1) tense; 2) grammatical aspect; 3) modality; 4) polarity and 5) event class. Tension and aspect define time place and event structure; therefore, they are necessary in any method of extracting temporal relations. Modality and polarity specify non-occurring or hypothetical situations. The event class shows the event type. In addition to the five attributes mentioned, BCDC also uses the word sequence that constitutes each event and is presented in Table 2. These attributes are either commented on in the input corpus or can be automatically extracted by available tools. In addition to the five attributes mentioned, BCDC also uses the word sequence that constitutes each event: [successfully: its part of language tags as well as a number of contextual characteristics, including a pair-wise coincidence of tenses and aspects."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Extra Event-Event Features", "text": "In our case, there are three types of these characteristics, which are defined as follows: event-event parse tree: If both events are in the same set, the algorithm can use the parse tree of the set to learn some useful syntactical properties such as dominance. In a parse tree, event A dominates event B, if A is an ancestor of B. These characteristics are not explicit characteristics, but implicit characteristics that can be extracted from the SVM using appropriate tree cores, as suggested in the work of Mirroshan-del et al. (2009b). Parse trees can be extracted by a statistical parser, and there is no need for any treebank. Preposition set: A preposition head is often an indicator of a temporal class. Thus, we can use a new characteristic that indicates whether an event is part of a prepositional phrase."}, {"heading": "3.3 Proposed Algorithm", "text": "BCDC applies a novel application of bootstrapping to the classification of temporal relationships between events. It works in two main steps: in the first stage, a general model is learned using a standard corpus, and in stage two, the general model for each test document is retrained based on some related information. Figure 4 shows the flowchart of the proposed algorithm, which is described in more detail in the following sections."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Stage One", "text": "In the first stage, BCDC uses the features discussed, taken from a standard corpus, to train a general model for SVM classification. At the end of this stage, we have a model for classifying temporal relations. However, such models, which have already been suggested by other researchers, all have the problem of being too general. In other words, such a model does not have specific information about the area concerned. In order to better manage this problem, BCDC has an additional boot strapping phase of training."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Stage Two", "text": "To achieve this goal, the BCDC application phase of the BCDC must be made in the following steps: The selection of related documents can be made through the INDRI retrieval system (Strohman, Metzler, Turtle, & Croft, 2005). Note: The large unannotated corpus mentioned is different from the training and test class. In this step, we extract events and required features from the related documents found by INDRI. The events and specified features of Section 3.2 can be automatically explained by EVITA (Saur, Verhagen, Pustejovsky, 2005). The events and specified features of Section 3.2 can be explained by EVITA (Saur)."}, {"heading": "4.

Bootstrapping by using a number of related documents has the following positive effects: 1) Knowing the relationship between events, we can better predict the types of relationships between analog events that may occur in related documents.2) In related documents, the number of sentences with similar patterns will increase, and the tree cores can extract more confident information from the analysis trees.Therefore, it should be noted that our proposed confidence measure only applies to the SVM classification technique.3) The corpora used is rather small with few examples for each relationship. This data-saving problem may affect the performance of any time-related identification method. In BCDC, retrieving related documents and extracting new time relationships of these documents by random numbers.3) If we select a phase of the documents that is not related to other (problematic) documents."}, {"heading": "5.

In EMTRL is the corpus (i.e., pairs of events) and the temporal clustering (10).The EM algorithms include two essential steps of expectation (E) and maximization (M), which can be defined in our task in the following way to estimate the parameters of the model iteratively (i.e., P (ei l j).TCi j))): E-step: fix current parameters of the model, and assign a probability, P (TCi j | ei ej), to any time class for event pairs (ei ej) of the corpus. This probability can be compensated by the following equation: P (TCi) j | ei ej = P (ei ej) P (8).We can write equations on the corpus."}, {"heading": "6. Experimental Results of EMTRL", "text": "Like our experiments with BCDC, TimeBank and OTC were also used in the experiments with EMTRL. However, to simplify the task, we used a different normalized version of this corpora, which contained only the following three temporal relationships: BEFORE OVERLAPThe main reason for this simplification in EMTRL was that reducing the level of surveillance in the task of learning temporal relations makes it an even more difficult task, which is itself already considered difficult (Mani et al., 2006). To normalize this corpora and reduce the number of relationship types to three, we took the same normalization approach as some previous work (Bethard et al., 2007b), VOR and IBEFORE relationships were merged into only VOR relationships. Likewise, the AFTER and IAFTER relationships should also be merged into AFTER relationships."}, {"heading": "6.1 Results and Discussions", "text": "In our experiments, baselines were the majority class of event pair relationships in the used corpora (i.e., OV ERLAP in both corpora). Note that the Mani method is actually supervised, which only uses gold standard characteristics (Mani et al., 2007). However, the method of the chambers is similar to Manis except that it also uses some external resources such as WordNet (Chambers et al., 2007). Here is the result of our implementation of Mani and Chambers methods differ from their reported results, as we have only considered three time relation types, while in their reported experiments, there were six relation types. In Table 11, in addition to the results of using EMTRL with three different initializations, we have also reported the results of these initializations as standalone classifiers. For Random Initialization and EMTRL + Random Initialization, a question that may arise, how these methods can determine the classes of different labels."}, {"heading": "6.2 Inconsistency Removal", "text": "Since in a pair-by-pair relationship learning system, the relationship between the individual pairs of events is predicted without taking into account their impact on the relationships of other pairs of events, the system may encounter some inconsistencies between the predicted relationships, which can occur when selecting temporal relationships through Equation 9 in E-step. It may also occur when searching for definitive class names through Equation 11. Figure 6 shows an example of an inconsistent relationship between events A, B, and C. In this paper, we have used two different approaches: a greedy best-first search strategy and a method based on Integrated Linear Programming (ILP)."}, {"heading": "6.2.1 Greedy Best-First Search Strategy", "text": "To detect possible inconsistencies between predicted relationships, we first create a graph for each text in which each node corresponds to an event, and an edge represents a temporal relationship between corresponding events. Consider, for example, the following three rules: \u2022 before (x, y) & & before (y, z) \u2212 \u2192 before (x, z) \u2022 after (x, y) & before (z, y) \u2212 \u2192 after (x, z) & and includes (y, z) \u2212 \u2192 after (x, z) The inconsistent relationships of each graph are stored in a sorted list called SL, based on a calculated confidence value (i.e. P (TCi j | ei ej) of Equation 9.

Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we have addressed the problem of the temporal relationship between events, which has been of interest since the early days of statistical natural language processing. We have focused our efforts on reducing the need for corpora annotation as much as possible. Therefore, in the first phase of the algorithm, two new algorithms, one weakly supervised and one unsupervised, were presented; the first algorithm was a two-step, weakly supervised approach to classifying temporal relationships; in the first phase of the algorithm, an SVM-based classifier was trained to learn temporal relations of the corpus; then, in the second phase of the algorithm, a cross-document boot-strapping technique was used to improve the model produced in the first phase."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank the co-editor and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments."}], "references": [{"title": "Towards a general theory of action and time", "author": ["J.

NCSU was applied to tasks C, D, E, and F in two different settings: NCSU-indi and NCSU-joint. In NCSU-indi, an independent MLN was trained for each task. On the other hand, a set of global formulae was also added to NCSU-joint to ensure the consistency among classification decisions from four local MLNs (one for each task). NCSU-indi achieved the best result in task F and the second best result on task C. One of the most successful participants of TempEval 2010 was TIPSem that is based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) models for classification purpose (Llorens et al., 2010). TIPSem employs different morphological, syntactic, and semantic features for building CRF models. In Spanish, it achieved the best results in all tasks. In English, TIPSem achieved the best results in Tasks B and D; and was one of the best systems in all other tasks. JU CSE TEMP was another participant of TempEval 2010 that utilized CRF models for temporal relation learning tasks (Kolya et al., 2010). The system needs only the goldstandard features of TimeBank for time expressions and/or events. In comparison with TIPSem, JU CSE TEMP achieved weaker results, which shows the importance of feature engineering in temporal relation learning. There is another approach that applies different machine learning techniques to detect intra-sentential events, and builds a corpus of sentences with two or more events in which at least one event is triggered by a key time word (e.g., after, before, etc.). The classifier is based on a number of syntactic and clausal ordering features (Lapata & Lascarides, 2006; Bramsen, Deshpande, Lee, & Barzilay, 2006). There exist a comprehensive study about statistical methods, which compares three different interval based algebras in terms of classification accuracy, performance, and expressiveness power (Denis & Muller, 2010). There are also a few algorithms that exclusively work on temporal relation classification between events and time expressions. One of such algorithms employs cascaded finite-state grammars (for temporal expression analysis, shallow syntactic parsing, and feature generation) together with a machine learning component capable of effectively using large amounts of unannotated data (Boguraev & Ando, 2005). There is a group of statistical methods that rely on information of argument fillers (called anchors) of every event expression as a valuable clue for recognizing temporal relations. In these methods, by looking at a set of event expressions whose argument fillers have a similar distribution, analogous event expressions are recognized. Algorithms such as DIRT (Lin & Pantel, 2001), TE/ASE (Szpektor, Tanev, Dagan, & Coppola, 2004), and that of the Pekar\u2019s system (2006) are examples of this type of statistical method.", "startOffset": 21, "endOffset": 2770}, {"referenceID": 41, "context": "In Pekar\u2019s approach (2006), co-occurrence of two verbs inside a locally coherent text is used to extract some useful information.", "startOffset": 3, "endOffset": 27}, {"referenceID": 32, "context": "The test accuracy on this enlarged corpus showed some improvements (Mani et al., 2007).", "startOffset": 67, "endOffset": 86}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "Then a classical path-consistency algorithm (Allen, 1984) was applied to the extracted relations of the first step.", "startOffset": 44, "endOffset": 57}, {"referenceID": 30, "context": "The test accuracy on this enlarged corpus showed some improvements (Mani et al., 2007).

Since most existing methods are supervised and require large corpora, which for many languages do not exist, we have concentrated our efforts to reduce the need for annotated data as much as possible. This paper presents two different algorithms towards this goal. The first algorithm is a weakly supervised machine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between events. In the first stage, the algorithm learns a general classifier from an annotated corpus. Then, inspired by the hypothesis of \u201cone type of temporal relation per discourse\u201d, it extracts useful information from a cluster of topically related documents. We show that by combining the global information of such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier, a bootstrapping cross-document classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between events. Our experiments show that without any additional annotated data, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous successful systems. The second proposed method for temporal relation extraction is based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Within EM, we used different techniques such as a greedy best-first search and integer linear programming for temporal inconsistency removal. We think that the experimental results of our EM based algorithm, as a first step toward a fully unsupervised temporal relation extraction method, is encouraging.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
