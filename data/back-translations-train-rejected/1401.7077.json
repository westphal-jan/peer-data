The texts were grouped into two categories: one was integrated by these texts written by authors who won the Nobel Prize for Literature, the other was composed of texts by renowned writers, politicians, military and social figures. By combining writers and Nobel Prize winners in English and Spanish, we obtained four groups for our analyses. Each text was distinguished by its diversity of symbols, entropy and symbol frequency distribution according to the definitions below. We created a mathematical model with these properties for the four groups created. Means and dispersion were examined by statistical methods and cluster analyses."}, {"heading": "2.1 Text length and symbolic diversity", "text": "The length of a text is the total number of symbols used and the variety is the number of different symbols that occur in the text. We define specific diversity as the ratio of diversity and length, i.e. = specific diversity =.

Symbols (words) are treated as units of information, ignoring any different information weight that can be associated with the meaning of the word, length, or context. Text entropy is evaluated as follows: = \u2212. (2) Where is the number of appearances of the symbol in its place. Note that the basis of the logarithm is diversity, and therefore (,) is limited between cero and one. If the base of the logarithm is set to 2, the expression (2) is set to = \u2212 1.

Originally, the texts were written in various languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, German, Japanese, Arabic, Russian, Chinese and Swedish. Since the analysis was conducted in English and Spanish, many of the texts used are translations from the original versions. Most of the texts come from politicians, human rights activists and Nobel laureates for literature. To complete the library, some fragments of novels have also been included. Fragments of novels correspond to English and Spanish writers, as well as Nobel laureates. We created speech groups and novel segments for English and Spanish: one group of texts with undoubtedly good linguistic users, those who have received the Nobel Prize for Literature, and another group of authors for whom we have no particular reason to assume an above-average use of the language. Texts written by a Nobel laureate are all in their original language; therefore, the Spanish version of a speech by M\u00e1c\u00eda Garrez, for example, is considered to be written as their translation in English. \""}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Diversity for literature Nobel laureates and for general writers", "text": "Figure 1 shows how diversity varies with the length of the message.

To visualize the graphs, the difference between the texts, filled points correspond to Nobel literature texts and empty points show texts by non-Nobel laureates. For Spain, there is a higher density of Nobel laureates points placed towards the high 456 region to the right of the horizontal axis.

Obviously, a necessary condition for a Nobel Prize is knowledge of an expanded lexicon and the wisdom to use it appropriately and with a properly organized style, which explains the higher word diversity in Nobel laureate texts presented in Figure 1. Nevertheless, the relatively higher diversity among Nobel laureates does not explain the lower entropy observed in Figure 2. If the shape of the frequency profile is determined, an increase in symbol diversity contributes to an increase in entropy. Therefore, the lower entropy shown in Nobel laureate texts must obey the structure of the symbols used, which overcomes the effect of the greater word diversity in their texts."}, {"heading": "4.2 Symbol Frequency Distribution Profile", "text": "The relatively small p-values, however, indicate that Zipf's deviations express some of the differences between texts written by Nobel and non-Nobel laureates, and therefore justify the inclusion of Zipf's deviations as a sensitive factor for the quality of writing."}, {"heading": "4.3 Writing Quality Scale versus Readability index", "text": "In fact, the assessment of quality and writing style is a highly subjective matter that is difficult to submit to a quantifiable procedure. It is a subtle and elusive task. However, a good writing structure and writing style must include readability as an important feature of the resulting text. Entropy standards studied here add information about more general aspects of writing quality. Another factor that affects the readability indices is the complexity of the idea used with the text. A complex idea probably cannot be explained by the same high readability index as a simple idea. Therefore, the question is: How readable can a writer write a text to convey a complex idea? There is no obvious answer, among other things, because the complexity of the idea itself is a subjective factor. But good writers should tend to produce more readable texts - with better readability indices: >? 6 for English and HI6 for graphics - than those who are less talented than the Spanish Nobel laureates for their high reading ability."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "Our analysis has shown that some characteristics of English and Spanish texts, such as entropy, diversity of symbols and frequency profiles, relate to aspects considered by professionals to be \"good writing\" in natural languages. This is encouraging because it suggests the possibility of applying quantitative measures to characterize certain aspects related to the quality of fonts, opening the door for the development of tools for automatic text evaluation. The fact that quality is associated with less entropy suggests that skillful writing involves not only the inclusion of grammar (Febres, Jaff\u00e9 and Gershenson 2013), but also the inclusion of order in the text. The exact nature of this additional order is still unknown, but our method serves to detect its existence.The results found so far are to be considered findings from a preliminary study of the complexity of texts."}], "references": [{"title": "Zipf and Heaps Laws' Coefficients Depend on Language.\" Barrio Cantalejo, In\u00e9s Mar\u00eda", "author": ["Alexander Gelbukh", "Grigori Sidorov"], "venue": "Editado por Facultad de Medicina", "citeRegEx": "Gelbukh and Sidorov.,? \\Q2001\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Gelbukh and Sidorov.", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Readability: An appraisal of research and application", "author": ["Madrid.
