A leaf means a terminal node. Throughout the paper, unless specified, it is assumed that a tree is a uniform binary tree. In other words, each internal node has only 2 child nodes, and all leaves are the same distance from the root. Figure 1 shows an example of an AND-OR tree of height 2. If we replace the rolls of AND gates (both) and those of OR gates (both), the resulting tree is an OR-AND tree of height 2. A truth assignment for a tree is an illustration of all leaves to {0, 1}. Here, 0 stands for FALSE and 1 stands for TRUE. An example of a truth assignment for the tree in Figure 1 is as follows: 01 (f 01 = 01)."}, {"heading": "3 Relationships between Costs and Probabili-", "text": "tiesLemma 2.

Let's conclude the current work by saying that a brutal induction does not work for the proof of Theorem 1. Let's say that x = x0 c, 2 (x) maximizes. Then, it's not difficult to see that x = x0 c, 3 (x) does not maximize. So, if we prove Theorem 1, we can't easily mislead the reader by saying: \"Let's say the statement of the theorem applies to height = h. Let's examine the case of height = h + 1. By the induction hypothesis, the restriction of a given ID to the left subtree is obviously an IID. And the same applies to the right subtree. Therefore, by the method of lagrange multipliers, the statement of the theorem for height = h + 1 is immediately shown.\""}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "The authors thank Kousuke Ogawa and Masahiro Kumabe for the helpful conversations."}], "references": [{"title": "On the branching factor of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm", "author": ["G.M.
