INTRODUCTION", "text": "Requirements for understanding human activities have increased in the health sector, especially in elderly care, rehabilitation, diabetes and cognitive disorders. [1,2,3] A huge amount of resources can be saved if sensors help caregivers detect and report abnormal behavior all the time. Other applications, such as the human survey system and the location indicator, all benefit from the study. Many studies have successfully identified activities that use portable sensors with very low error rates, but the majority of the work to date is carried out in laboratories with very limited settings."}, {"heading": "2. LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Previous approaches have typically used vision sensors, inertial sensors, and the mixture of the two. Machine learning and threshold algorithms are commonly used. Machine learning generally delivers more accurate and reliable results, while threshold-based algorithms are faster and simpler. One or more cameras have also been used to capture and identify posture [8, 9]. Multiple accelerators and gyroscopes attached to different body positions are the most common solutions [10-13. Approaches combining both visual and inertial sensors are also envisaged [14]. Another essential component of all these algorithms is data processing. The quality of the input functions has a major impact on performance. Some previous work has focused on generating the most useful features from time series data [15]. The usual approach is to analyze the signal in both time and frequency domains."}, {"heading": "3. METHODS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Feature Generation", "text": "To collect the acceleration data, each subject carries a smartphone for a few hours and performs some activities. In this project, five types of common activities are investigated, including walking, limping, jogging, walking up and walking down. The position of the phone may be somewhere near the waist and orientation is arbitrary. The built-in accelerometer we use has a maximum sampling frequency of 50 Hz and a sensitivity of \u00b1 3g. According to a previous study, body movements within frequency components are limited to below 20 Hz, and 99% of the energy is contained below 15 Hz [16]. According to Nyquist frequency theory, a 50 Hz acceleration sensor is sufficient for our study. To suppress noise, a low-pass filter with a 25 Hz limit frequency is applied. Due to the instability of the phone sensor, which can accidentally drop samples, the interpolation is applied to fill the gap of 25 seconds between each of the length of a sample and 25 in a window."}, {"heading": "3.2 Classifiers", "text": "In this project, four types of classifiers are used to classify the activity as described below."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Quadratic Classifier", "text": "If we assume that each class is normally distributed, then the discrimination function for class is defined as () () () | | (), with the mean and the covariance of the Gaussian class distribution represented respectively. In the case of a characteristic vector x, a quadratic classifier assigns () (). Therefore, the decision boundary is generally a quadratic curve."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 k-Nearest Neighbor", "text": "The k-next neighbor (kNN) algorithm classifies unlabeled instances based on matching the labels of the k-next training examples in the space.kNN feature is a lazy learning algorithm because it delays data processing until a classification request arises. As kNN uses local information, it can provide highly adaptive performance. kNN, on the other hand, requires large memory requirements and intensive computation, and the value of k must also be determined correctly."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 Support Vector Machine", "text": "As a supervised classifier, a standard support vector machine (SVM) aims to find a hyperplane that separates 2 classes, thereby maximizing the distance to the closest points of each class. The closest points are called support vectors.Given the n training data points {xi} and class names {yi}, a hyperplane that separates two classes has the form () Suppose {wk} is the amount of all such hyperplanes. The optimal hyperplane is defined by \u2211 and b is defined by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions in which {} is maximized, subject to the linearly separable case. Since the corresponding support vectors x are calculated only via a Dot product, we can use a mapping () to translate them into another feature space, so that the originally non-linearly separable data can be separated after mapping. Furthermore, () it is not necessarily an explicit function."}, {"heading": "3.2.4 Artificial Neural Network", "text": "An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model consisting of interconnected artificial neurons (or nodes) inspired by biological neural networks. ANNs are able to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or find patterns in data. In this project, we are using a class of ANN called Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as a classifier, as shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "3.3 Dimensionality Reduction", "text": "There are two ways to reduce feature dimensions: feature extraction and feature selection."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Feature Extraction", "text": "Feature extraction transforms the original high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional feature space. The transformation can be linear or non-linear. In this project, we used Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Feature Selection", "text": "Feature selection is a technique for selecting a subset of the most relevant characteristics from the original characteristics. Although feature selection can be regarded mathematically as a special case of feature extraction, research in these two areas is fundamentally different. In feature selection, an objective function is required to evaluate the characteristics of candidates. Two types of objective functions are available: filters and wrappers. Filters evaluate feature selection based on its information content, which is comparable to the removal of an interclass or statistical independence. Wrappers evaluate characteristics based on the predictive accuracy of a classifier. In this study, we use wrappers for feature selection."}, {"heading": "3.4 Active Learning", "text": "The core idea of active learning is that a machine learning method can achieve greater accuracy by using fewer training labels when selecting the data from which it learns. [17] The learning process involves interacting with an oracle that labels unlabeled data samples by guided queries that the learner selects as in Fig. 2. In order to obtain a higher classification rate from less labeled training sets, the learner seeks to label the unlabeled instances that are most informative. Thus, the problem of selecting unlabeled instances is the principal challenge for the active learning process. In order to obtain a higher classification rate from less labeled training sets, the learner seeks the unlabeled instances that are most informative. Thus, the problem of selecting unlabeled instances is a principal challenge for the active learning process. Typically, the query relies on notions of uncertainty in the class that are most likely to be classified in samples, for example."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data Collection", "text": "To illustrate the complexity of the classification problem, the first two LDA components are shown in Figure 3 (a), and the two best-chosen features are illustrated in Figure 3 (b). As observed, the classification problem is not trivial. Specifically, two activities of walking up and down are very difficult to distinguish."}, {"heading": "4.2 Passive Learning", "text": "Four classifiers, square, kNN, ANN and SVM, are investigated. SVM-KM [21] and Matlab ANN toolboxes are used in this study.All methods are tested with the samples in the original feature space, LDA subspace and sequential forward selection (SFS) subspace.We run the SFS algorithm on each classifier and select the best five characteristics selected by all classifiers. The selected characteristics are variance, 75 percentiles, frequency entropy and peak frequency. It is also observed that the z-axis is the most informative direction because mobile phones are normally connected vertically to the human body and the z-axis, which is perpendicular to the screen, is independent of the orientation of the phon.Figure 4 shows the performance of each classifier in different feature spaces. The maximum classification rate is achieved when SVM is used with the SFS quate (84.4%, the lowest SVDA) in the other classification ranges."}, {"heading": "4.3 Active Learning", "text": "The fact is that you will be able to go to another world, where you have to go to another world, where you have to go to another world, where you have to go to another world, where you can go to another world."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this project, we developed a smartphone-based recognition system that detects five human activities: walking, limping, jogging, climbing stairs, and climbing stairs. The system collected time series signals using a built-in accelerometer, generated 31 features in both the time and frequency domains, and then reduced the dimensionality of the features to improve performance. Activity data was trained and tested using 4 passive learning methods: square classifier, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, support vector engine, and artificial neural networks. The best classification rate in our experiment was 84.4%, achieved by SVM using features selected by SFS. Classification performance is robust compared to the orientation and position of smartphones. In addition, active learning algorithms were studied to reduce the cost of labeling data. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of active learning while simultaneously saving labor when using SVM measurement strategies for learning SVM."}, {"heading": "6.
