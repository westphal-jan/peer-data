In this paper we study the computational worst-case complexity of exact Bayesian network structure learning under graph theoretic restrictions on the (directed) super-structure. The super-structure is an undirected graph that contains as subgraphs the skeletons of solution networks. We introduce the directed super-structure as a natural generalization of its undirected counterpart. Our results apply to several variants of score-based Bayesian network structure learning where the score of a network decomposes into local scores of its nodes. Results: We show that exact Bayesian network structure learning can be carried out in non-uniform polynomial time if the super-structure has bounded treewidth, and in linear time if in addition the super-structure has bounded maximum degree. Furthermore, we show that if the directed super-structure is acyclic, then exact Bayesian network structure learning can be carried out in quadratic time. We complement these positive results with a number of hardness results. We show that both restrictions (treewidth and degree) are essential and cannot be dropped without loosing uniform polynomial time tractability (subject to a complexity-theoretic assumption). Similarly, exact Bayesian network structure learning remains NP-hard for \"almost acyclic\" directed super-structures. Furthermore, we show that the restrictions remain essential if we do not search for a globally optimal network but aim to improve a given network by means of at most k arc additions, arc deletions, or arc reversals (k-neighborhood local search).", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:33:50 GMT  (399kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0558v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["sebastian ordyniak", "stefan szeider"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0558"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.0558.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Parameterized Complexity Results for Exact Bayesian Network Structure Learning", "authors": ["Sebastian Ordyniak", "Stefan Szeider"], "emails": ["ordyniak@fi.muni.cz", "stefan@szeider.net"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Results: We show that exact Bayesian network structure learning can be performed in unequal polynomial time when the superstructure has a limited tree width, and in linear time when the superstructure also has a maximum degree.

One of the most prominent constraints of the superstructure we are considering is Treewidth. Treewidth is an important and widely used parameter that measures the similarity of a diagram to a tree (Bodlaender, 1993, 1997, 2005; Greco & Scarcello, 2010). Similar to trees, many otherwise intractable problems become apparent on charts of limited Treewidth. More importantly, Treewidth has already been successfully applied in the context of Bayesian Reasoning (Darwiche, 2001; Dechter, 1999; Kwisthout, Bodlaender, & van der Gaag, 2010). It therefore seems only natural to apply Treewidth to (Exact) BNSL (Exact)."}, {"heading": "1.1.2 Local Search BNSL Using the Super-structure", "text": "A popular heuristic for BNSL is the so-called hill-climbing method, or local search. In particular, a highly competitive algorithm for learning large Bayesian networks (MMHC) uses local search to find an optimal solution within a previously constructed superstructure (Tsamardinos et al., 2006). We are investigating the complexity of the worst-case of a well-known generalization of the local search, the k-Neighborhood Local Search (or k-Local Search for short). In this variant of the local search, it is allowed to modify not one, but up to k-arcs in each step of the search. Therefore, one can compensate for speed and accuracy by adapting to k. However, since the k-local search space is of order nO (k), the use of k-local search is particularly desirable for problems where runtime increases only slightly with respect to k. Similarly difficult (2) we are able to solve this problem if the following superstructure (5 is unique)."}, {"heading": "1.1.3 Exact BNSL Using the Directed Super-structure", "text": "We introduce the directed superstructure as a more expressive way to limit the search space of solutions, i.e. once the directed superstructure is fixed, we limit our search to solutions whose networks are contained in the directed superstructure. Here, too, we examine the complexity of the exact BNSL in relation to certain constraints of the directed superstructure and obtain the following result. (7) Exact BNSL is solvable in square time if the directed superstructure is acyclic. The question arises whether we can extend this result by using a more general form of acyclicity. However, we show that this is not the case. (8) Exact BNSL is NP-hard for directed superstructures that can be made acyclic by deleting a node. Hardness applies even if the maximum in-degree and maximum out-degree of the directed superstructure are both limited by 3.A systematic overview of our results (Figure 1)."}, {"heading": "1.2 Related Work", "text": "In this section we present relevant work on BNSL.

(D) The score function f that forms the score structure f (v, P) is as large as possible (the dag D, together with a certain local probability distribution, forms a Bayesian network).

In the following, we assume that N is a series of nodes, f is a local score function on N, and (T, c, r) is a nice tree decomposition of Sf of width at most w. We can improve the runtime of our algorithm by keeping records for each node in tree decomposition in a fixed order. We can improve the time needed on a common tree decomposition node from O (w + 1) f) to O (w + 1f) at no additional cost to sort. We achieve this by generating new records in an orderly manner and tracking the sequence in which the records are stored."}, {"heading": "6. Hardness Results for Exact Bayesian Network Structure Learning", "text": "The following result results from a reduction due to Chickering (1996).Theorem 2. Exact Bayesian Network Structure Learning (2003) is NP-hard for instances with maximum grade 4 superstructures. Since we use a well-known reduction from Chickering, we will only outline the argument. Reduction is done from the Feedback Arc Set (FAS).The problem is whether a maximum grade 4 (V, E) diagram by deleting most k-arcs (the deleted arcs form a feedback arc from D).The problem is NP-hard for maximum grade VII diagrams (Carp, 1972).Faced with an instance (k) of FAS where the skeleton of D has maximum grade 4, we construct a set V \u2032 (D) and a local score function f on V \u2032."}, {"heading": "8. The Directed Super-structure", "text": "In the previous sections, we considered the problem of Exact BNSL and k-Local Search BNSL solvable if the structure of the undirected superstructure is limited. However, it is a natural question whether the additional information contained in the directed superstructure can be used to find new structural constraints under which Exact BNSL becomes solvable if the input is given in the Ararity c representation (Teyssier & Koller, 2005). Fixing an order of variables in a BN corresponds to restricting the search space to acyclic-directed superstructures. Our first observation of this section is that Exact BNSL is solvable in polynomial representation."}, {"heading": "9. Conclusion", "text": "We have studied the computational complexity of Bayesian Structure Learning (BNSL) under various constraints of the (directed) superstructure, taking into account both Exact BNSL and k-Local Search BNSL. We have achieved positive as well as negative results for the theoretical worst-case complexities of the problems. Our main positive result is that Exact BNSL is linear-time tractable when the superstructure has a limited tree width and a limited maximum degree. Our results show which combinations of structural constraints make the problems tractable and which constraints cannot be removed without losing tractability. Considering various combinations of constraints in a systematic way gives us a more comprehensive picture of the complexity landscape (see table in Section 1)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "A shorter and preliminary version of this paper appeared in UAI 2010.

Recently, a novel approach to restrict the structure of BNSL has been introduced (Tsamardinos, Brown, & Aliferis, 2006; Perrier, Imoto, & Miyano, 2008). Here a so-called super-structure, an undirected graph on the same nodes as the resulting BN, is used to restrict the search space of BNSL in advance. After the super-structure has been obtained, usually using an IT-based approach (Tsamardinos et al., 2006), one looks for solution networks whose skeletons are contained in the super-structure. It hence becomes important that the super-structure is sound, i.e., contains at least one optimal solution. There are two main questions concerning the super-structure: First, how can a suitable and sound super-structure be obtained efficiently? And secondly, once such a superstructure is obtained, how can it be used to guide the search for an optimal solution? The goal of this paper is to provide a theoretical analysis of the latter question, considering super-structures that arise from a given local score function adapting the model of Parviainen and Koivisto (2010).

The main obstacle for local search methods is the danger of getting stuck at a poor local optimum. A possibility for decreasing this danger is to perform k > 1 elementary changes in one step, known as kNeighborhood Local Search or k-Local Search for short. For BNSL, when we try to improve the score of a dag on n nodes, the k-local search space is of order nO(k). Therefore, if carried out by brute-force, k-local search is too costly even for small values of k. It is therefore not surprising that most practical local search algorithms for BNSL consider 1-neighborhoods only.

In this paper we study the computational worst-case complexity of exact Bayesian network structure learning under graph theoretic restrictions on the (directed) super-structure. The super-structure is an undirected graph that contains as subgraphs the skeletons of solution networks. We introduce the directed super-structure as a natural generalization of its undirected counterpart. Our results apply to several variants of score-based Bayesian network structure learning where the score of a network decomposes into local scores of its nodes. Results: We show that exact Bayesian network structure learning can be carried out in non-uniform polynomial time if the super-structure has bounded treewidth, and in linear time if in addition the super-structure has bounded maximum degree. Furthermore, we show that if the directed super-structure is acyclic, then exact Bayesian network structure learning can be carried out in quadratic time. We complement these positive results with a number of hardness results. We show that both restrictions (treewidth and degree) are essential and cannot be dropped without loosing uniform polynomial time tractability (subject to a complexity-theoretic assumption). Similarly, exact Bayesian network structure learning remains NP-hard for \u201calmost acyclic\u201d directed super-structures. Furthermore, we show that the restrictions remain essential if we do not search for a globally optimal network but aim to improve a given network by means of at most k arc additions, arc deletions, or arc reversals (k-neighborhood local search).", "creator": "TeX"}}}
