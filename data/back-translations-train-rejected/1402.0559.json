The two main contributions of this paper are the identification of short supports as important for constraint propagation, and the introduction of HaggisGAC, an efficient and effective general purpose propagation algorithm for exploiting short supports. Given the complexity of HaggisGAC, we present it as an optimised version of a simpler algorithm ShortGAC. Although experiments demonstrate the efficiency of ShortGAC compared with other general-purpose propagation algorithms where a compact set of short supports is available, we show theoretically and experimentally that HaggisGAC is even better. We also find that HaggisGAC performs better than GAC-Schema on full-length supports. We also introduce a variant algorithm HaggisGAC-Stable, which is adapted to avoid work on backtracking and in some cases can be faster and have significant reductions in memory use. All the proposed algorithms are excellent for propagating disjunctions of constraints. In all experiments with disjunctions we found our algorithms to be faster than Constructive Or and GAC-Schema by at least an order of magnitude, and up to three orders of magnitude.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:34:04 GMT  (488kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0559v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter nightingale", "ian philip gent", "christopher jefferson", "ian miguel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0559"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.0559.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Short and Long Supports for Constraint Propagation", "authors": ["Peter Nightingale", "Ian P.

One way to do this is to write a specific findNewSupport function for each limitation, which we do in each of the empirical case studies below. In any case, the findNewSupport function is much easier than a propagator for the same limitation. We use Lemma 3.4 to build the findNewSupport functions, which sets the task to finding satisfactory tuples of simple limitations such as x < y and x = y.The alternative is to write a generic version of findNewSupport for the case where all short supports are listed as a list. We now list two generic instances of findNewSupport for lists, and in our case studies below we compare them with the special functions."}, {"heading": "5.5.1 findNewSupport-List", "text": "We provide a generic instance called findNewSupport List (Procedure 5), which takes a list of short support for each dictionary (supportList), including both the explicit and implicit short support for that dictionary, analogous to the Positive Instance of GACSchema (Bessie re & Re gin, 1997).FindNewSupport List has a persistent state: listPos, an array of integers indexed by variable and value, initially 0, indicating the current position in the supportList. The algorithm simply iterates through the list of support by looking for one in which all literals are valid.

In this section, we list a second generic list based on NextDifference lists (Gent et al., 2007); we have a single list (called SupportList) that contains all short-term support (indexed by an integer), and a second list called NDLis where for each support s = SupportList [j], for each dictionary in the sense of the word [DLL] is not supported [DLL]."}, {"heading": "5.6 Literals of Assigned Variables", "text": "Suppose ShortGAC discovers a new support S that contains a literal x 7 \u2192 v, and x is assigned to v.

For example, this constraint could be used to solve a time problem in which classes taking place in different rooms must be different, but we use zero to represent a space that can occur multiple times.

Figure 6 shows the MAD for all algorithm / instance combinations that we found as a fraction of the median for that case. This shows that 511 algorithm / instance combinations that we tested (including some combinations that are not reported in detail in this paper), the maximum MAD for all algorithms / instance combinations that we found is still less than 15% of the median, with a worst case of 14.5%.

The two main contributions of this paper are the identification of short supports as important for constraint propagation, and the introduction of HaggisGAC, an efficient and effective general purpose propagation algorithm for exploiting short supports. Given the complexity of HaggisGAC, we present it as an optimised version of a simpler algorithm ShortGAC. Although experiments demonstrate the efficiency of ShortGAC compared with other general-purpose propagation algorithms where a compact set of short supports is available, we show theoretically and experimentally that HaggisGAC is even better. We also find that HaggisGAC performs better than GAC-Schema on full-length supports. We also introduce a variant algorithm HaggisGACStable, which is adapted to avoid work on backtracking and in some cases can be faster and have significant reductions in memory use. All the proposed algorithms are excellent for propagating disjunctions of constraints. In all experiments with disjunctions we found our algorithms to be faster than Constructive Or and GAC-Schema by at least an order of magnitude, and up to three orders of magnitude.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
