A game of chance is a real function on X, and we denote the set of all games of chance on X by G (X).It is a linear space with point-by-point addition of games of chance, and point-by-point multiplication of games with real numbers. For each subset A of G (X) that we denote by posi (A) x, the set of all positive linear combinations of games of chance in posi (A): A (A)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Coherence and Avoiding Non-positivity", "text": "Definition 1 (Avoidance of non-positivity and coherence): We say that a number of desirable games of chance D avoids G (X) non-positivity if f 6 \u2264 0 for all games of chance f in posi (D) or in other words if G (X) \u2264 0 \u0445 posi (D) = \u2205.

As usual, we suggest in this term that this conclusion with desirable games of chance has a (precise) probable conclusion, in particular Bayes \"rule, as a special case. However, it is easy to see that it also generalizes (excludes as a special case) the classical propositional logy (excludes as a special case): a statement p with a subset of space corresponding to a 0.5 m position can be accepted for all stone space."}, {"heading": "2.4 Helpful Lemmas", "text": "In order to prove a number of results in this work, we need the following lemmas, one of which is a convenient version of the separating hyperplane theorem, relying heavily on the assumption of finite space X and not simply extending to a more general case. Lemma 2. Suppose that X is finite, and consider a finite subset A of G (X) > 0 for all f \u00b2 A.Proof. It is clearly sufficient to prove the necessity.

Basic Notation", "text": "Now that we have modeled the basic facts about this more general approach to uncertainty, we are ready to turn to independence. (To talk about this, we must be able to deal with models that contain more than one variable.) In the current section, we will introduce the notational devices that we will use to make this discussion as elegant as possible. (From now on, we will consider a number of variables Xn, n \"N, the values in the respective finite sets Xn.) Here N is a finite, not empty index set R of N, we denote the tuple of variables (with a component for each r\" R \"), the values in the Cartesian product XR:\" RXr \"RXR.\" This Cartesian product is the set of all cards xxR up to \"R.\""}, {"heading": "4.

By using the terms independent natural expansion and the maximum coherent composition of desirable games of chance, we can consistently define a specific independent product that typically strictly includes independent natural expansion.
