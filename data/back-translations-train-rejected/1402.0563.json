This paper focuses on investigating the state-of-the-art of Chinese-to-Spanish statistical machine translation (SMT), which nowadays is one of the most popular approaches to machine translation. For this purpose, we report details of the available parallel corpus which are Basic Traveller Expressions Corpus (BTEC), Holy Bible and United Nations (UN). Additionally, we conduct experimental work with the largest of these three corpora to explore alternative SMT strategies by means of using a pivot language. Three alternatives are considered for pivoting: cascading, pseudo-corpus and triangulation. As pivot language, we use either English, Arabic or French. Results show that, for a phrase-based SMT system, English is the best pivot language between Chinese and Spanish. We propose a system output combination using the pivot strategies which is capable of outperforming the direct translation strategy. The main objective of this work is motivating and involving the research community to work in this important pair of languages given their demographic impact.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:34:56 GMT  (305kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0563v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marta r costa-juss\\`a", "carlos a henr\\'iquez", "rafael e banchs"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0563"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.0563.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Evaluating Indirect Strategies for Chinese\u2013Spanish Statistical Machine Translation", "authors": ["Marta R.

Motivation", "text": "Although some current web translation systems allow translation between Chinese and Spanish, the quality of current translations between Chinese and Spanish is still significantly below the quality achieved for other language pairs such as English and Spanish. As far as we know, there is little research on this translation task, and the main reason for this may be the lack of parallel corpora. This study intends to make progress and include other researchers in the field of statistical machine translation of Sino-Spanish: 1. List of available parallel corpora for Sino-Spanish.2. Comparison of different methods for performing statistical machine translation: cascaded (Wang et al., 2008), pseudocorpus generation (Banchs et al., 2006; de Gispert & Marin, 2006) and triangulation (Wu & Wang, 2007).3.

Related Work", "text": "One of the first papers dealing with Sino-Spanish machine translation was presented by Banchs et al. (2006). Authors experimented with two independent Chinese-English and English-Spanish corporations to translate from Chinese into Spanish. They built their translation systems using the so-called Ngram-based approach, which differs from the phrases-based system mainly in the translation and reorganization of the translation model (Marin, Banchs, Crego, de Gispert, Lambert, Fondez, & Costa-jussa, 2006). The only recent research event for this language pair was the 2008 Iwslt evaluation campaign (Paul, 2008). This evaluation organized two Sino-Spanish tracks, one of which focused on direct translation through English. The best translation results according to manual evaluation were developed in the Pivot. The best systems were developed by Wang et."}, {"heading": "4. Chinese\u2013Spanish Parallel Corpora", "text": "There are very limited resources for the Chinese-Spanish language pair compared to the number of native speakers in these languages. In practice, it is also common practice to translate Chinese through English, even when manual translations are performed. As a sentence-level parallel corpus, there is the Basic Travel Expressions Corpus (Btec) (Paul, Yamamoto, Sumita, & Nakamura, 2009), which is a collection of sentences that bilingual travel experts consider useful when going to or coming from another country. This corpus contains around 160,000 parallel sentences, but only around 20,000 sentences and 180,000 words are actively used for Mt purposes in the Iwslt evaluation campaign. The full corpus is not freely available and the 20,000 version was only available for participation purposes in the 2008 Iwslt evaluation campaigns. Another parallel corpus is the Holy Bible, which has proven to be a good resource for CR."}, {"heading": "5. Direct and Pivot Statistical Machine Translation Approaches", "text": "There are several strategies we can follow when translating a pair of languages into statistical machine translation (Smt). In this section, we will present the details of those we use in this work. In general, a statistical machine translation system can refer to the translation of a source phrase s into a target sentence s. (In this section, we will present the details of those we use in this work. (2) Among all possible target phrases, we choose the model of decomposition based on Bayes \"theorem, known as the source-channel model of statistical machine translation. (1) = arg max t max t t t [P (s) P (s)]]] (2). It allows modeling the target language independently. It allows modeling the target language model P (t) and the source language."}, {"heading": "5.1 Direct System", "text": "Our direct system uses the phrase-based translation approach (Koehn et al., 2003). The basic idea is to segment the given initial sentence into segments of one or more words, then each source segment is translated from the training corpus with a bilingual phrase, and finally compose the target sentence from these phrase translations. A bilingual phrase is a pair of m source words and n target words that are extracted from a parallel sentence that belongs to a bilingual corpus previously aligned by words. For extraction, we consider the words that are continuous on both the source and target pages and that are consistent with the word alignment. We consider a phrase to be compatible with the word alignment if no word within the phrase is aligned with a word outside the phrase. In terms of the phrase of the phrase of the phrase segmentation of the sentence, we consider the same phrases as the possible phrases in K (that P)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Pivot-Based Systems", "text": "The cascaded approach treats the source pivot approach and the pivot target system independently of each other. Both are built and tuned to improve their local translation quality, and then written to translate from the source language to the target language in two steps: First, the translation output is computed from the source language to the target language using a previously created pivot target system, and then used to obtain the target translation. Then, a source target smt system is computed using the source page and the translated pivot side of the source pivot pivot corpus, and the pseudo-corpus system is matched to the target language using a previously created pivot target target system as we have it available."}, {"heading": "6.

The Holy Bible was used for the same purposes in six languages, so we can experiment with other pioneer islands. In this study, we opt for the Un corpus, which is the largest corpus (among these three), and it contains the same sentences in six languages that we experiment with other pioneer islands."}, {"heading": "6.2 System Implementation and Evaluation Details", "text": "Our systems were built using revision 4075 by Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).For all systems, we used the standard Moses parameters, which include the symmetrization of growth, diagonal, finale and word alignment, lexicalized reordering (where possible), relative frequencies, lexical weights and phrase bonus for the translation model (with phrases up to a length of 10), a 5-gram language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing and a word-punishment model. Consequently, 14 different features are combined into equation (3).The language model was created using Srilm (Stolcke, 2002) Version 1.5.12.Optimization was performed using Mert (Och, 2003).For word alignment, we used Giza + (Och & Ney, 2000) Version 1.0.5.To evaluate translation quality, we used Bleu (Papinenjei, 2001, Roumetku, Zrop, two times, and Srop)."}, {"heading": "7.

Mbr focuses on finding the best performance over all possible translations. To do this, it uses a LF (t, t) loss function that measures the loss of confidence rather than the real translation t. \"Bayes risk is defined as the expected value of the loss function over all possible hypotheses and translations."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions", "text": "This work provided a brief overview of the state of improvement in Sino-Spanish Smt. Firstly, this language pair is of great interest both economically and culturally, considering the high number of Chinese and Spanish speakers. Furthermore, statistical machine translation is the most popular approach in the field of Mt given that great quality has been shown in all international evaluation campaigns such as Nist (2009) and Wmt (2012). The most important points covered in our study were: \u2022 There are mainly three Sino-Spanish parallel corpora (Btec, Holy Bible and Un) that are freely available for research purposes. \u2022 English is the best pioneering language for performing Sino-Spanish translations compared to languages such as French or Arabic. The system that was built with English as a pivot was significantly better than the one built with French or Arabic corpora, with a 99% confidence in both comparisons. \u2022 The preference for a Sino-Spanish translation compared to languages such as French or Arabic seems to be of great interest to other linguistic differences when we consider this proposed translation strategy to increase the number of Spanish speakers as well as the number of linguistic translation metrics in 2012."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would particularly like to thank the reviewers for their comments, which have contributed significantly to the improvement of this work.

Apart from the vocabulary size, the research mentioned above also measured the success of machine translation in terms of word reordering, i.e., differences in word order that occur in a parallel corpus, which are mainly driven by syntactic differences between the languages. In order to measure reordering in translation they assumed that reordering only occurs between two adjacent blocks in the source side. This simplification allowed them to detect a extract all reordering in a deterministic way. A block As is defined by Birch et. al.

The objective of the RQuantity is to measure the amount of reordering we need when translating from a source language to a target language. The minimum RQuantity for a given sentence is 0 if the translation does not involve any word movement and its maximum is ( \u2211I i=2 i)/I when the words in the translation are inverted compared with their order in the source sentence. We have computed the RQuantity for the different language pairs involved in our pivot approaches. It can be seen in table 5 that English appears as the best pivot because it has the lowest average RQuantity between the three, i.e. it is the pivot that needs the least amount of reordering in average to achieve the final translation. French and Arabic required less movements to translate into Spanish than English, but a lot of reordering is needed to obtain the first step from Chinese, hence penalizing the average.

This paper focuses on investigating the state-of-the-art of Chinese-to-Spanish statistical machine translation (Smt), which nowadays is one of the most popular approaches to machine translation. For this purpose, we report details of the available parallel corpus which are Basic Traveller Expressions Corpus (Btec), Holy Bible and United Nations (Un). Additionally, we conduct experimental work with the largest of these three corpora to explore alternative Smt strategies by means of using a pivot language. Three alternatives are considered for pivoting: cascading, pseudo-corpus and triangulation. As pivot language, we use either English, Arabic or French. Results show that, for a phrase-based Smt system, English is the best pivot language between Chinese and Spanish. We propose a system output combination using the pivot strategies which is capable of outperforming the direct translation strategy. The main objective of this work is motivating and involving the research community to work in this important pair of languages given their demographic impact.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
