The most widely used heuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables --- an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domain encodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacity constraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge to these approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents that represent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materials into quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. The usual relaxation of metric fluents is often very poor in these situations, since it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer available to be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problems building on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematical program for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer--consumer planning problems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelled in a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metric Relaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybrid heuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usual relaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures the causal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these two components interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explore how further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into the MIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem to augment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploiting structure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources. Our results show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problems where numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:35:19 GMT  (1246kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0564v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["amanda jane coles", "rew ian coles", "maria fox", "derek long"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0564"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.0564.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Hybrid LP\u2013RPG Heuristic for Modelling Numeric Resource Flows in Planning", "authors": ["Amanda Coles", "Andrew Coles", "Maria Fox", "Derek Long"], "emails": ["amanda.coles@kcl.ac.uk", "andrew.coles@kcl.ac.uk", "maria.fox@kcl.ac.uk", "derek.long@kcl.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "A particular challenge for these approaches is dealing with interactions between metric flows that represent the exchange, such as converting raw materials into quantities of processed goods or trading money for materials.

First, the settler problem is to build the transport and construction infrastructure by extracting, refining and transporting materials; the numerical structure of the domain is perhaps the most complex of the IPC domains to date. First, there are six numerical resources and several measures that affect each of them; the available resources and the effects of their use (consumption of a resource is presented as a negative value and production as a positive value) are shown in Table 12. Another interesting feature of this domain is that not all resources can be produced directly: while the raw materials wood, stone and ore can be obtained directly (wood, coal and iron must be refined from their respective raw material forms)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Producer\u2013Consumer Problems", "text": "We first define the actions of producers or consumers with two categories of producers.

Generally, in the v < all we know is that if v \u2265 k + (where Epsilon is infinite and positive), c units of v can be consumed, indicating a lower limit of v of (k \u2212 c +).

Positive effects on a metric variable increase the upper limit of its achievable values, and negative effects reduce its lower limit. Satisfaction of conditions is verified by checking a value at the interval of each variable that meets each metric condition in the precondition.Interestingly, it should be noted that preconditions are tested individually, so that in principle it is possible that no single value can satisfy all conditions simultaneously, although each condition is met by a certain value separately.

The relaxed plan extraction algorithm is then displayed in lines 3-6, the priority list is initialized with the top objectives of the problem. Both propositional and numerical goals are added to the priority list as goals to be achieved in the earliest factual layer in which they appeared.

MetricFF uses a two-step search approach, and both the number of actions in the relaxed plan is used as heuristic target-distance estimation. The first search phase, forced mountaineering (EHC), is a greedy search approach. It can be assumed that the search will continue broadly from the original state I with state progression through the application of measures until a state with a new globally best heuristic value is found. If such a state, S, is found, all other states will be discarded and the EHC search will be continued in the same way by S. This search strategy is incomplete due to its greedy character, discarding all states other than S could lead to the loss of a solution. In this case, it follows a complete WA * search to guarantee the completeness of the planner (subject to sufficient time and memory). As the phase HC-solutions are already found, however, it is not helpful that FF is so fast."}, {"heading": "3.2 Problems with the Metric RPG Heuristic", "text": "Although metric role-playing is a powerful tool to support planning with metric fluids, there are some common situations in planning problems where heuristics give very flawed guidance. These issues include resource persistence and cyclical resource transfer. We discuss how each of these phenomena can lead to misleading heuristic guidance, as the loosened plan length poorly approximates the actual solution length and is distorted by helpful action distortions."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Resource Persistence", "text": "The ability to reuse the resource may indicate that a much shorter plan is available than is the case in reality. Although this problem occurs for both propositional and metric flows, the fact that metric flows often code resources that need to be carefully managed means that the problem is more acute in areas with metric flows. For example, in a settler domain state where 2 units of each resource have been produced and no ship is needed (either as a destination or as a means to travel to an otherwise inaccessible place), no relaxed plan will require the production of additional resources (see Table 1). An approach to approximating the number of missing resource productions was introduced in planner Sapa (Do & Kambhampati, 2001)."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Cyclical Resource Transfer", "text": "The phenomenon of Cyclical Resource Transfer (CRT) is a consequence of the coding of actions that move resources, combined with the loosening of negative effects. To encode the movement of a resource, it is removed from one place and added to another. Distance is encoded as reduction and this is eased when building the metric role play. As a result, moving resources at the destination seems to generate new resources, making movement a falsely attractive alternative to production. Consider a state where 1 unit of wood and a cart are in one place, P1, and the goal is to have 2 units of wood on P1. Of course, the solution plan must include the production of more wood. However, a valid, relaxed plan solution found heuristically with the help of the metric role play is: 0: (Load v1 p1 wood) 1: (Discharge v1 p1 wood)."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 Helpful Action Distortion", "text": "The problems of resource scarcity and CRT have an important consequence for the EHC search. Not only do they lead to relaxed plans with misleadingly short lengths, but the relaxed plans typically contain too few production actions and useless transfer actions. In this situation, production actions often do not appear in the helpful action plans and are therefore not included in the EHC search, even in states where they could be conveniently applied. We call this problem a helpful distortion of action. To illustrate how this arises, again in relation to the settler domain, we consider a state in which there is a timber unit at Site A, and the goal is to have a timber unit at Site B. A relaxed plan can use the timber to build a wagon and then load the same timber onto the wagon to transport it. Therefore, the planner will not consider producing more timber."}, {"heading": "4. Compiling Producer\u2013Consumer Behaviour into a Mathematical", "text": "In this section we describe how a mathematical program can be constructed to characterize the interaction between numerical variables and options for action within the producer-consumer framework."}, {"heading": "4.1 Constraints for Producer\u2013Consumer Variables and Actions", "text": "The definition of producer-consumer variables (definition 2.4) implies that actions have the useful property that all the prerequisites for the variables can be derived from the effects of actions, along with the global variable limits. Specifically, this means for each action a: \u2022 If a c produces units of v and has a prerequisite that requires v \u2264 d, then d = ub (v) \u2212 c, where ub (v) is the global upper limit of v after a is applied. This condition expresses both the effect of a on the upper limit and the prerequisite on the value of v (da v \u2264 ub (v)). \u2022 If a c consumes units of v, then v \u2265 lb (v) + c must be satisfied before the action is applied. Again, this expression results in effect and prerequisite being bound to a restriction. If the order of actions is loosened (i.e., the causal relationships that force them to be arranged, are arranged)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Bounding Action Variables", "text": "Within the equation associated with each state variable (i.e., each Equation 1), each action has a corresponding variable that indicates how often it has been applied. In general, there is no limit on the number of times an action can be applied. Furthermore, numerical reduction effects and propositional deletion effects can impose limitations in practice due to limited availability of resources. For example, if an action is applied at the expense of reducing w, where w is a resource for which there is no producer, then the limitation of Ca is an implicit consequence of Equation 1, which governs the value of W. Specifically, ai can never exceed w / \u043c (w, a): the value of w divided by the change that is a cause in w. Moreover, because w decreases monotonously and vice versa (w, a) is constant for each action a, the global upper limit of Ca can be set to w (I) / \u03b4 (w) (Caint), where it can only be limited to the fact that (v) and in fact (I)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Assignment Constraints", "text": "In general, direct assignments of values to variables cannot be directly represented in constraints following the form of Equation 1. Assignments effectively correspond to state-dependent increases or decreases. For example, an assignment of value 2 to a variable v, in a state where v = 0 corresponds to the production of 2 units, but corresponds to the consumption of 1 unit when applied in a state where v = 3. However, in the producer-consumer equations, there is no notion of state, only coefficients on action variables to denote their production or consumption. Therefore, state variables can only be subject to constant changes, and the MIP cannot be used to encode general assignment effects without allowing square constraints (that is, constraints affecting the products of pairs of variables). However, there are some specific conditions under which assignments can be safely modeled within the mathematical program while maintaining linearity of constraints."}, {"heading": "5. The Linear Programming\u2013Relaxed Planning Graph Heuristic", "text": "We have defined the behavior of producers and consumers and shown how it supports the construction of a MIP in which the sequence of actions is loosened. A MIP is basically difficult to solve (the construction of solutions is NP-hard), so as a basis for a heuristic assessment of states it makes sense to further loosen the integrity constraints on action variables in order to reduce the problem to a linear program. We will first examine how the LP can be used in the two phases of heuristic assessment of a state (accessibility analysis and relaxed planning extraction) and then reconsider whether the loosening to a linear program is necessary in practice and what compromise could exist between the full MIP and the LP."}, {"heading": "5.1 Overview", "text": "The task we want to use them for is heuristic assessment of states, so we can assume that we have a state (a complete mapping to the variables that define the problem, both propositional and numerical), and we are interested in estimating the number of actions required to transition to a target state. The approach we will use is based on the same strategy used in MetricFF: first, we construct an accessibility analysis based on a layered chart of changing facts and actions, and then extract a laid-back plan. To determine whether an action can be applied at the accessibility level, we check the propositional conditions in the usual way, and numerical conditions are checked by determining whether some values in the accessible ranges recorded for the metric variables meet the condition, and the achievable ranges are calculated using the LP that we have described, as we will explain in the following explanatory paragraphs.The extraction includes both the actions required for the extraction and the actions required in the plan."}, {"heading": "5.2 Using the LP during Graph Expansion", "text": "The graph expansion phase in the calculation of metric RPG heuristically can be regarded as a layer-by-layer analysis of relative propositional accessibility synchronized with a relaxed numerical boundary analysis. Definition 3.1 shows that numerical variables in the diagram expansion algorithm appear in two places. First, at F (i) they are used to determine what actions can appear in A (i + 1), the next action layer (those whose prerequisites are within the achievable range). Then, the actions considered applicable are used to update the variable boundaries for the subsequent fact layer, F (i + 1) they are used to assess the relaxed nature of the way in which numerical values are viewed that metric RPG tend to produce very optimistic values."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Notes on LP Efficiency", "text": "Since the LP needs to be resolved up to twice per variable per shift when expanding the plan chart, it is important that steps are taken to minimize computational costs. We reduce costs through a combination of techniques, some of which avoid having to resolve the LP when calculating the limit to a given variable, and others when its current value is large enough (small enough) to meet all the requirements and objectives in which it appears. In this case, we can avoid having to resolve the LP to determine the variable limit, and instead be able to reuse the limit calculated in the previous shift without affecting the behavior of the heuristics."}, {"heading": "5.3 Basic Use of the LP during Solution Extraction", "text": "First, we observe that the LP is not directly affected by the propositions and therefore cannot be used to determine what actions are capable of achieving a particular goal.

However, it also increases the meaningfulness of the numerical targets that we are able to handle for anything that can be expressed in linear normal form (LNF) - any LNF formula can be added to the LP as a constraint."}, {"heading": "7.2 Catalytic Resources", "text": "These are variables that represent resources that either need to be generated or purchased by reactions, but once they are present, other reactions are possible, or allow them to occur more quickly.

In contrast, the MIP and LP models we propose do not attempt to capture most of the causal plan structure, making the construction of solutions to our programs at each state much more feasible.

The most widely used heuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables \u2014 an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domain encodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacity constraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge to these approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents that represent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materials into quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. The usual relaxation of metric fluents is often very poor in these situations, since it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer available to be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problems building on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematical program for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer\u2013consumer planning problems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelled in a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metric Relaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybrid heuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usual relaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures the causal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these two components interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explore how further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into the MIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem to augment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploiting structure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources. Our results show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problems where numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
