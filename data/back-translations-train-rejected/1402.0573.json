An important question is then: what is the class of logics that can be subsumed as instantiations of this theory? The goal of this paper is to identify and study the large class of logic-based instantiations of Dung's theory which correspond to the maxi-consistent operator, i.e. to the function which returns maximal consistent subsets of an inconsistent knowledge base. In other words, we study the class of instantiations where very extension of the argumentation system corresponds to exactly one maximal consistent subset of the knowledge base. We show that an attack relation belonging to this class must be conflict-dependent, must not be valid, must not be conflict-complete, must not be symmetric etc. Then, we show that some attack relations serve as lower or upper bounds of the class (e.g. if an attack relation contains canonical undercut then it is not a member of this class). By using our results, we show for all existing attack relations whether or not they belong to this class. We also define new attack relations which are members of this class. Finally, we interpret our results and discuss more general questions, like: what is the added value of argumentation in such a setting? We believe that this work is a first step towards achieving our long-term goal, which is to better understand the role of argumentation and, particularly, the expressivity of logic-based instantiations of Dung-style argumentation frameworks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:38:48 GMT  (266kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0573v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["srdjan vesic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0573"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.0573.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Identifying the Class of Maxi-Consistent Operators in Argumentation", "authors": ["Srdjan Vesic"], "emails": ["VESIC@CRIL.FR"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

(I) A case when an instantiation of Dung\u2019s theory is shown to correspond to an existing operator. First, such a work can help to \u201cvalidate\u201d an argumentation-based approach by showing in which cases it returns a result comparable with that of a non argumentation-based approach. The possible criticism of such an instantiation is that it is useless, since one can obtain the same result without using argumentation. But, this is far from being true; namely, argumentation can be used for explanatory purposes. For example, if one wants to know why a certain conclusion is accepted, an argument having that conclusion can be presented. That argument can be attacked by other arguments and so on. Also, it might be possible to construct only a part of the argumentation graph related to the argument in question, thus having a better knowledge representation (i.e. ignoring the parts of the knowledge base unrelated to the argument one wants to concentrate on). The second benefit of this type of work is that it can help to reduce computational complexity by using the simpler approach in the cases when the result obtained by an argumentation-based approaches and a non argumentation-based approaches is the same. Please note that the work in this category (capturing an operator with an instantiation of Dung\u2019s theory) is far from being limited to the case of the maxi-consistent operator, as it was shown by Vesic and van der Torre (2012) that there exists a large class of instantiations of the abstract argumentation theory returning a consistent result substantially different from the one returned by the maxi-consistent operator.", "startOffset": 150, "endOffset": 1648}, {"referenceID": 9, "context": "Maxi-consistent sets play a major role in the characterization of various forms of non-classical logical reasoning (Bochman, 2001) and in belief revision (Alchourr\u00f3n, Gardenfors, & Makinson, 1985).", "startOffset": 115, "endOffset": 130}, {"referenceID": 10, "context": "Amgoud and Vesic (2010) generalised the result by Cayrol (1995) for the case of prioritised knowledge base, by showing that Arg is a bijection between preferred sub-theories (Brewka, 1989), which generalise maximal consistent sets in case of prioritised knowledge base, and stable extensions of the corresponding preference-based argumentation system using direct undercut as an attack relation and the weakest link principle as a preference relation.", "startOffset": 174, "endOffset": 188}, {"referenceID": 17, "context": "Note that the limits of testing a reasoning formalism on a set of benchmark examples have been pointed out by Vreeswijk (1995).

Furthermore, this result is proved under hypotheses which are impossible to satisfy: the attack relation should be both valid and conflict-dependent, which is impossible (as proved in Proposition 3). Some other results in that paper (Amgoud & Besnard, 2010, e.g. Prop. 4) are proved only for an attack relation which is both conflict-dependent and conflict-sensitive, which is not the case for any of the well-known attack relations. Consequently, the majority of the negative results of those papers are only applicable to a minority of attack relations. Furthermore, examples in those papers are often \u201cincomplete systems\u201d; thus, it is not surprising that there is no link between MC(Base(A)) and Ext(A,R) in those examples.

The goal of this paper is to identify and study the large class of logic-based instantiations of Dung\u2019s theory which correspond to the maxi-consistent operator, i.e. to the function which returns maximal consistent subsets of an inconsistent knowledge base. In other words, we study the class of instantiations where every extension of the argumentation system corresponds to exactly one maximal consistent subset of the knowledge base. We show that an attack relation belonging to this class must be conflict-dependent, must not be valid, must not be conflict-complete, must not be symmetric etc. Then, we show that some attack relations serve as lower or upper bounds of the class (e.g. if an attack relation contains canonical undercut then it is not a member of this class). By using our results, we show for all existing attack relations whether or not they belong to this class. We also define new attack relations which are members of this class. Finally, we interpret our results and discuss more general questions, like: what is the added value of argumentation in such a setting? We believe that this work is a first step towards achieving our long-term goal, which is to better understand the role of argumentation and, particularly, the expressivity of logic-based instantiations of Dung-style argumentation frameworks.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
