This holds also for Description Logics, where research has focused on the explanation of both TBox reasoning and, more recently, query answering. Besides explaining the presence of a tuple in a query answer, it is important to explain also why a given tuple is missing. We address the latter problem for instance and conjunctive query answering over DL-Lite ontologies by adopting abductive reasoning; that is, we look for additions to the ABox that force a given tuple to be in the result. As reasoning tasks we consider existence and recognition of an explanation, and relevance and necessity of a given assertion for an explanation. We characterize the computational complexity of these problems for arbitrary, subset minimal, and cardinality minimal explanations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:39:28 GMT  (437kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0575v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["diego calvanese", "magdalena ortiz", "mantas simkus", "giorgio stefanoni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0575"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.0575.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Reasoning about Explanations for Negative Query Answers in DL-Lite", "authors": ["Diego Calvanese", "Magdalena Ortiz", "Giorgio Stefanoni"], "emails": ["calvanese@inf.unibz.it", "ortiz@kr.tuwien.ac.at", "simkus@dbai.tuwien.ac.at", "Giorgio.Stefanoni@cs.ox.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "The role of ontology in an OBDA system is twofold. On the one hand, it is an intermediate layer between the domain user and the physical data, providing a unified view of the information held in the various data sources. In many cases, ontology extends to the data vocabulary by introducing new, more intense predicates that can be used in a more concise and declarative manner. On the other hand, ontology offers limitations that are taken into account as the answers are answered and that may help enrich the answers received. Hence, potentially relevant implicit knowledge that can be derived from the data, plus ontology, can be made explicit by using specifically tailored reasoning algorithms."}, {"heading": "2.

Discussion", "text": "In this section, we discuss some issues that need to be explored further."}, {"heading": "6.1 Computing Explanations", "text": "In our complexity analysis for DL-LiteA, we did not consider the problem of calculating solutions to abduction problems. Nevertheless, we can deduce from the presented results higher limits on the complexity of calculation solutions for a QAP P. If the input query in P is an instance query, then both the calculation of an arbitrary solution and the calculation of all Minimal3 solutions is easy, since according to Proposition 3.10 we only have to consider individual candidate declarations and their number is polynomially limited. Instead, the problem of calculating an arbitrary solution E remains polynomial for UCQs if the signature of P is unlimited, as we can always obtain E by generating a suitable direct instantiation of one of the CQs in the input (see Section 3.3). Instead, under restricted signatures, the total number of (minimal) solutions in the size of the signature can be calculated exponentially and in the maximum size of each signature occurring in the input quantity (see Section 3.3)."}, {"heading": "6.2 Data Complexity", "text": "In this paper, we have focused on combined complexity. In terms of data complexity (i.e., when complexity is measured only in terms of the size of the ABox, while both the query and the TBox are considered fixed) and ontology complexity (i.e. when only the query is considered fixed), we note that the conclusions we have shown to be NP complete are essentially based on verification of ontology consistency and therefore lie in AC0 in terms of data complexity (Calvanese et al., 2009)."}, {"heading": "6.3 Other Description Logics.", "text": "In fact, as we have already mentioned, many lower limits even hold in the absence of a TBox. As for the upper limits, we have relied on DL-LiteA and the existence of the perfect reformulation of a given query (see Proposition 2.1), just to argue that our canonical explanations are small and have a limited signature (more precisely, they can be achieved by instantiating CQs in the perfect reformulation of the input query) and that the query can be performed in NP. Therefore, we expect our results to be transferred to other DLs that allow \"small\" explanations. Since each ABox that is a superset of a solution is itself a solution if we do not impose a minimum condition, there will always be an exponential number of solutions, provided that one exists."}, {"heading": "7. Related Work", "text": "In the literature we have found three different models of explanation for missing answers that differ from the idea of the solution. First, Chapman and Jagadish (2009) have proposed a model in which explanations are these relational operations (e.g., natural connections or selections) that are responsible for preventing the given tuple to be returned in the answers. Second, Tran and Chan (2010) have defined solutions to be refinements to the input squery so that the given tuple is an answer to the relaxed query via the database. Third, Huang, Doan and Nauschel (2008) have defined solutions to be sequences of database updates so that the result of answering the given conjunctive query via the updated relational instance includes the missing answer."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have investigated the problem of explaining negative answers to user questions about DL-LiteA ontologies. We have formalized the problem as an abductive task: given a (U) CQ q, a consistent ontology O and a tuple of constants ~ c, so that ~ c is not in the specific answers of q over O, an explanation is defined as a set of ABox assertions that, when added to O, maintain their consistency and cause ~ c to be in the particular answers. We consider the special cases where only a limited signature is allowed for the assertions in the statement, and only an instance query instead of a complete (U) CQ in the input. We have also considered preference orders between explanations and examined two such orders: subset minimal and cardinality minimal explanations. For all of these cases, we have reached complexity limits for four decision problems that come from the decision-based on knowledge (the existence of a decision on whether or a given) exists."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank the anonymous speakers for their careful reading of the submitted manuscript and their valuable comments.
