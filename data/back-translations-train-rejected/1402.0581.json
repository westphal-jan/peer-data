The modelling is split into two parts. Power flow is a global phenomenon and is therefore naturally represented and analysed by a network comprised of the relevant structural elements from the components of a system. The power flow analysis is a platform for higher-level behaviour prediction of energy related aspects using local component behaviour models to capture a state-based representation with a global time. The primary application is Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and a form of exaggeration reasoning is used, combined with an order of magnitude representation to derive the worst case failure modes. The novel aspects of the work are an order of magnitude(OM) qualitative network analyser to represent any power domain and topology, including multiple power sources, a feature that was not required for earlier specialised electrical versions of the approach. Secondly, the representation of generalised energy related behaviour as state-based local models is presented as a modelling strategy that can be more vivid and intuitive for a range of topologically complex applications than qualitative equation-based representations.The two-level modelling strategy allows the broad system behaviour coverage of qualitative simulation to be exploited for the FMEA task, while limiting the difficulties of qualitative ambiguity explanation that can arise from abstracted numerical models. We have used the method to support an automated FMEA system with examples of an aircraft fuel system and domestic a heating system discussed in this paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:41:55 GMT  (1613kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0581v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["neal", "rew snooke", "mark h lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0581"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.0581.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Qualitative Order of Magnitude Energy-Flow-Based Failure Modes and Effects Analysis", "authors": ["Neal Snooke", "Mark Lee"], "emails": ["nns@aber.ac.uk", "mhl@aber.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The new aspects of the work are a qualitative network analyzer of the order of magnitude (OM) to represent any power range and any topology, including multiple power sources, a feature not required for earlier specialized electrical versions of the approach.

Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "2. The Qualitative Power Network", "text": "The power grid (system circuit) is represented by resistors R as a structural component.The simulation task is to derive the effort for each resistance and the flow through each resistor that represents a power source (force or flow) in the network.A linear network uses the generalized version of the Ohm law for effort, flow and resistance, E = F \u00b7 R, and returns the current mapping in Table 1. The first line is qualitatively ambiguous because each flow does not cause any loss of force due to a zero resistance. Physically, it is not possible to have a force drop over a zero resistance, and therefore the flow is represented in the fourth line as t to indicate an impossible event.A power grid is considered as a diagram G (T = 1 node) containing the nodes T and edges A representing the circuit resistance. Each edge has a value A > R = a pair of resistors measured between two (T = 1 node) and the node (E)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Order of Magnitude Representation", "text": "An order of magnitude of representation for R allows for more detailed modeling without introducing qualitative ambiguity, which is replaced by the separation of artifacts with significantly different properties (Raiman, 1991; Lee, 2000a).This improvement improves the ability to represent nominal behavior, such as the distinction between signal level power in electrical circuits and gravitational \"head pressure\" from the system pump in selected liquid transmission systems. The modeling of errors is also improved by the ability to model exaggerated errors, creating effects for disturbances where effects would otherwise be qualitatively indistinguishable from the nominal operation.We define O (M) qualitative resistance values R = [r1 = 0, r2, rm =] those that ri + 1 ri ri ri / ri + 1 magnitude + 1 for each ii."}, {"heading": "2.2 Network Reduction", "text": "The OM representation is used for each of the resistance, strain and flow variables of a power grid. The goal is to derive flow and effort values throughout the circuit, and this is achieved by reducing the circuit to a single equivalent resistor, by assigning the flow value and expanding the network that allocates effort and flow values at each level of expansion. However, network reduction is performed by a series and parallel (SP) circuit simplification with an OM version of the qualitative start delta (Y) transformation for non-SP cases as a consequence. Within a network graph G, all nodes of stage two can be removed and both connected edges e1, e2 replaced with an equivalent row edge of resistance: R (e1) = max. (R (e1), R (e2))) (1), Any edge e1, e2, e2, e2."}, {"heading": "2.3 Flow and Effort Assignment", "text": "The reduced network may have a flow (or effort for flow sources) for its source directly from the OM extended version of Table 1 = 43. The R = 0 case t is reported immediately because it has a specific physical interpretation in most cases, such as an electrical short circuit. If R = 0 contains another source (Section 2,5) that is currently not considered, this edge is ignored. To determine the flow in a specific circuit component, the edge hierarchy is extended for the required edge \u2212 the sign of a flow determines itsdirection relative to an arbitrary terminal order for each resistor, with a convention t1 being t2 f and t2 t1 being the edge e1, e2 being part of a series pair that is the flow through each, simply the flow through the pair is: F (e1) = F (e2) = F (e1) = F (e1 \u00a6 e2) and the effort over the edge is equal to e1 (E)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Distinguished Node", "text": "Force is measured between two nodes, and for simplicity's sake, it is common practice to identify a distinguishable node in a network and make measurements in relation to that node. This then allows the effort to be measured \"on\" a node with the implicit assumption that the second node is the distinguishable node. This is usually the case in electrical systems where the distinguishable node is called earth or earth and is a reference node for voltage measurement and is often defined as a negative supply pole in a single source system. Generally, we define the symbol Z as the distinguishable zero node for a network of any kind with specific instances, e.g. A to represent the \"atmosphere\" for liquid flow systems. Note that Z does not provide any further limit in the qualitative effort space; it provides a structural reference point in the resistive network.Identifying Z allows the definition of \"absolute\" in relation to this effort."}, {"heading": "2.5 Multiple Effort Sources", "text": "The network solver calculates the power consumption (P = E \u00b7 F) for a single source. For a linear resilient network, we can use a qualitative version of the principle of superimposition, in which more than one source is connected to a single network (in which a single system is schematically recorded, it can actually comprise many isolated networks at any time, possibly in different domains, although all components in the schematic appear connected to each other), each network is analyzed separately for each source by inhibiting all other force sources and adding up the results. For sources s1... sn, the qualitative flow through an edge is given by the value sns1 F (e) = max (Fs1 (e). Fsn (e)))). Clearly, where two opposing flows of the same size exist, the edge suffers from qualitative ambiguity. For error configurations, the ambiguous result is useful to point out to an engineer that a range of possible failure can occur."}, {"heading": "2.6 Representation of Substance Within the System", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "2.7 Computational Enhancements", "text": "The network reduction and flow mapping detailed in the previous sections is sufficient to resolve the OM efforts and flow parameters for each network topology. < / p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p > p p > p > p p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p\" p. \"p\" p \"p\" p \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p.\" p. \"p."}, {"heading": "3. Local Component Models and OM Time", "text": "The resilient network calculates the power consumption, P, but cannot model a component that stores energy, En, since En = P \u00b7 T for the time T. Displacement and momentum are the two independent properties resulting from the incorporation of time into the model (Figure 1). Energy, displacement and momentum are basically local properties of components derived from the power variables and time. Representation of time follows the OM approach described in Section 2.1. For a time t3n and flow f3n, d3 (n + m) = f3nt3n defines a shift d such as quantity of substance and time. An FSM representation of the behavior of local components has been proven sufficient for abstract behaviors to perform the task of error analysis. Time is represented by state changes and is explicitly represented by state transitions that capture the qualitative integration of effort or flow variables. The state of the power supply is used to trigger changes (such as the cause of an external power outlet)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Component Level Simulation", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "3.2 Component Modelling Examples", "text": "A tank of a given volume can be defined by an event that proceeds from empty changes. \"The state of the entry actions is within the rectangle that represents the state,\" continues the author, \"and an event that reflects the state of the fuel.\" The keyword used in this context is used to specify that Dc = Tc, and also that the event is quoted at t = 0, i.e., the immediate event. As an example, let us assume that we have the following OM time values F = {mS, hour, day} and flow levels T = {low, normal, high}, where Sec and normal are the OM index of zero. \"A tank of a given volume can be defined by an event that we have the following OM time values.\" Sec, day} and flow levels T = {low, normal, high}, where Sec and normal are. \""}, {"heading": "3.3 System Modelling and Circuit Topology", "text": "This year it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "4. Faults and Exaggeration Reasoning", "text": "Exaggeration Argumentation (Weld, 1988b, 1990, 1988a) offers an alternative qualitative method of explaining the worst impacts without the need for a differentiated qualitative calculation. Therefore, this form of reasoning is appropriate if we do not have detailed system equations, or, as for the global power grid, reasoning on causality is not carried out. A secondary advantage for our purpose is that exaggerated reasoning often produces more precise explanations. However, the disadvantage is that qualitative deviations are guaranteed, whereas exaggerative reasoning can lead to wrong predictions. For the purpose of the FMEA, there are two reasons why exaggerated errors are a reasonable strategy: first, the worst deviation effects are required, which lead to error models in the extremes of behavior; second, the reasoning can lead to wrong predictions."}, {"heading": "5. Generating an FMEA", "text": "An automated FMEA is typically based on a behavior simulation for many component failures and operating scenarios. The creation of the FMEA has already been described in detail elsewhere (Price, 1998), but since it is the end goal of the modeling and simulation effort, we summarize the most important steps as follows: \u2022 The system is simulated without faulty components over the expected operating conditions. \u2022 The output of the simulation is the qualitative value of all system variables for each step (state) of the simulation. These are used by a completely separate function model that identifies specific (output) behavior with the state of the system functions identified. Functions can be presented in one of four states (Achieved, Failed, Unexpected Behaviour, Inoperative)."}, {"heading": "6.

Conclusions", "text": "Qualitative simulation is a powerful modeling concept that can support a wide range of reasoning tasks. A number of tools for analyzing electrical circuits have been based on this approach, and the authors \"electrical qualitative simulator, known as mcirq, is now in regular industrial use. Structural and behavioral models are composed and do not encode functional system information or make assumptions about their use. It is of course necessary to decide on the range and phenomena to be included in the modeling, and so a library of models is typically created for a specific area of application (e.g. automotive electrics, aircraft fuel system, general plumbing systems, general plumbing systems, etc.), and this includes the set of qualitative variables of interest, their (appropriately labeled) orders of magnitude and relevant component failure modes. The models are then reusable components that are less available to other systems available for use within the component, making it more complex."}, {"heading": "8.1 Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by Aberystwyth University, the Welsh Assembly Government, BAE Systems and the DTI ASTRAEA Program.

The modelling is split into two parts. Power flow is a global phenomenon and is therefore naturally represented and analysed by a network comprised of the relevant structural elements from the components of a system. The power flow analysis is a platform for higher-level behaviour prediction of energy related aspects using local component behaviour models to capture a state-based representation with a global time. The primary application is Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and a form of exaggeration reasoning is used, combined with an order of magnitude representation to derive the worst case failure modes. The novel aspects of the work are an order of magnitude(OM) qualitative network analyser to represent any power domain and topology, including multiple power sources, a feature that was not required for earlier specialised electrical versions of the approach. Secondly, the representation of generalised energy related behaviour as state-based local models is presented as a modelling strategy that can be more vivid and intuitive for a range of topologically complex applications than qualitative equation-based representations. The two-level modelling strategy allows the broad system behaviour coverage of qualitative simulation to be exploited for the FMEA task, while limiting the difficulties of qualitative ambiguity explanation that can arise from abstracted numerical models. We have used the method to support an automated FMEA system with examples of an aircraft fuel system and domestic a heating system discussed in this paper.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
