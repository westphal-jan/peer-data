A number of flights, each with a requirement for a specific number and type of aircraft, are already scheduled over a long horizon. We need to assign aircraft to flights and schedule repair activities while considering the flights requirements, repair capacity, and aircraft failures. The number of aircraft awaiting repair dynamically changes over time due to failures and it is therefore necessary to rebuild the repair schedule online. To solve the problem, we view the dynamic repair shop as successive static repair scheduling sub-problems over shorter time periods. We propose a complete approach based on the logic-based Benders decomposition to solve the static sub-problems, and design different rescheduling policies to schedule the dynamic repair shop. Computational experiments demonstrate that the Benders model is able to find and prove optimal solutions on average four times faster than a mixed integer programming model. The rescheduling approach having both aspects of scheduling over a longer horizon and quickly adjusting the schedule increases aircraft available in the long term by 10% compared to the approaches having either one of the aspects alone.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:42:10 GMT  (663kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0582v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["maliheh aramon bajestani", "j christopher beck"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0582"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.0582.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Scheduling a Dynamic Aircraft Repair Shop with Limited Repair Resources", "authors": ["Maliheh Aramon Bajestani", "Christopher Beck"], "emails": ["maramon@mie.utoronto.ca", "jcb@mie.utoronto.ca"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

The goal is to assign aircraft to shafts to maximize coverage, while at the same time establishing a workable repair schedule.

It splits the problem into a mixed integer master problem (MP), which is a loosening of the global model and a series of linear partial problems (PLCs). Solving a problem by classical benders involves iteratively solving the MP to optimality and using the solution to generate the partial problems. Linear programming of the PLCs is then solved to derive the narrowest limits of the global cost function. If this limit is greater or equal to the current MP solution (assuming that a maximization problem arises), the MP solution and the SP solutions represent a globally optimal solution. Otherwise, a restriction, a benders cut, is added to the MP to express the violated limit and another iteration is performed."}, {"heading": "3. Solution Approach", "text": "The main idea of our approach is to view the dynamic problem as interconnected static sub-problems. As mentioned above, this is a common approach in dynamic planning. This view leads to a re-planning strategy based on the planning of static sub-problems over shorter periods of time. Therefore, we have two sub-goals: How to solve and connect the static sub-problems. In this section, we first show that the static problem NP-hard and present different solution techniques for its solution. Then, we define three re-planning strategies designed to connect the static sub-problems. Finally, we describe our approach to modeling dynamic events, i.e. aircraft failures."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Complexity of the Static Repair Shop Problem", "text": "We establish the NP hardness of the static repair shop problem by reducing a single machine planning problem with the aim of minimizing the weighted number of late orders and having a common due date, i.e., 1 | dj = d | \u2211 wjUj1, where dj, wj and Uj represent the due date, weight and variable whether a job is late or not for job j, respectively. Note: job j is late if its processing is not completed on or before its due date. This problem corresponds to a one-dimensional crunch problem with non-uniform gain, which is completed by a reduction in the PARTITION problem (Pinedo, 2002).Theorem 1. The static problem is NP-hard.Proof. We show that an instance of the single machine planning problem, I, with a common due date and the aim of minimizing the static number of repaired orders is reduced to the late one."}, {"heading": "3.2 Scheduling Techniques", "text": "We examine a number of approaches to solve the workshop planning problem, including mixed integer programming, constraint programming, logic-based benders disassembly, a shipping rule, and a simple hybrid approach.

Therefore, we are investigating a heuristic approach inspired by the apparent Tardiness Cost (ATC) heuristics, a composite disposition rule that is typically applied to individual machine scheduling problems with the sum of weighted delay targets (Pinedo, 2005).The heuristic calculation calculates a ranking index for each job and sorts the jobs in ascending order of the index.The heuristic calculation then iterates through the jobs, with each job planned at the earliest possible time.The ranking index we use is as follows: Ij = ST (kj) Exp (\u2212 FNj FCj FCj) If we designate kj the type of aircraft j, then ST (kj) is the start time of the first wave that an aircraft of type kj requires, and the first stage of the aircraft time that an aircraft of type kj requires a fraction of the aircraft of the number of jobs, Nj is the highest percentage of the aircraft of the number of jobs required."}, {"heading": "3.2.5 Hybrid Heuristic-Complete Approaches", "text": "A hybrid heuristic-complete approach, where the heuristic solution sets a lower limit for the maximization target (Eq.1), can improve the performance of the complete approaches.

The former guarantees finite convergence and the latter guarantees optimality. Since the decision variables in the DAMP have a finite domain, it is sufficient to prove the satisfaction of the two conditions. Theorem 2. section (23) is valid.

Suppose we start by repairing the failed aircraft and assigning them to the shafts based on the calculated schedule. \u2022 A shaft could start while a repair is in progress at the repair shop. If some aircraft do not pass the pre-flight inspection, it goes to the repair shop. Each failed aircraft requires a series of independent repair activities with known processing times and resource requirements. In the repair shop, some of the previously failed aircraft could already be repaired, some could be repaired, and others could wait for repair. Once the failed aircraft enters the repair shop, we have a new static repair schedule, with the number of aircraft that are not in the repair shop for each type of aircraft already covered."}, {"heading": "3.4 Modeling the Aircraft Failures", "text": "In order to model the dynamic events, we simulate the aircraft failures during pre- and post-flight inspections.

Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we address the problem of planning a dynamic workshop in the context of aircraft fleet management. Our proposed solution solves the dynamic problem as successive static planning problems over shorter periods of time. Multiple planning algorithms and different rescheduling policies are proposed to plan repair activities online with dynamic response to aircraft failures. The length of the planning horizon and frequency of rescheduling are the features that define our three policies. Calculation results show that an optimization approach using logical benders decomposition, planning over a longer horizon, incorporating the mean of known information about aircraft failures and adjusting the repair schedule as soon as new jobs enter the workshop results in higher mean coverage and is a reasonable approach to weigh against various uncertain scenarios."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was partially supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the consortium members of the Centre for Maintenance Optimization & Reliability Engineering (C-MORE).

A number of flights, each with a requirement for a specific number and type of aircraft, are already scheduled over a long horizon. We need to assign aircraft to flights and schedule repair activities while considering the flights requirements, repair capacity, and aircraft failures. The number of aircraft awaiting repair dynamically changes over time due to failures and it is therefore necessary to rebuild the repair schedule online. To solve the problem, we view the dynamic repair shop as successive static repair scheduling sub-problems over shorter time periods. We propose a complete approach based on the logic-based Benders decomposition to solve the static sub-problems, and design different rescheduling policies to schedule the dynamic repair shop. Computational experiments demonstrate that the Benders model is able to find and prove optimal solutions on average four times faster than a mixed integer programming model. The rescheduling approach having both aspects of scheduling over a longer horizon and quickly adjusting the schedule increases aircraft available in the long term by 10% compared to the approaches having either one of the aspects alone.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
