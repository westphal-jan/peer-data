Local search has proved successful for this problem. However, there are two main drawbacks in state-of-the-art MVC local search algorithms. First, they select a pair of vertices to exchange simultaneously, which is time-consuming. Secondly, although using edge weighting techniques to diversify the search, these algorithms lack mechanisms for decreasing the weights. To address these issues, we propose two new strategies: two-stage exchange and edge weighting with forgetting. The two-stage exchange strategy selects two vertices to exchange separately and performs the exchange in two stages. The strategy of edge weighting with forgetting not only increases weights of uncovered edges, but also decreases some weights for each edge periodically. These two strategies are used in designing a new MVC local search algorithm, which is referred to as NuMVC. We conduct extensive experimental studies on the standard benchmarks, namely DIMACS and BHOSLIB. The experiment comparing NuMVC with state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms show that NuMVC is at least competitive with the nearest competitor namely PLS on the DIMACS benchmark, and clearly dominates all competitors on the BHOSLIB benchmark. Also, experimental results indicate that NuMVC finds an optimal solution much faster than the current best exact algorithm for Maximum Clique on random instances as well as some structured ones. Moreover, we study the effectiveness of the two strategies and the run-time behaviour through experimental analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:42:48 GMT  (417kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0584v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["shaowei cai", "kaile su", "chuan luo", "abdul sattar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0584"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.0584.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "NuMVC: An Efficient Local Search Algorithm for Minimum Vertex Cover", "authors": ["Shaowei Cai", "Kaile Su", "Chuan Luo", "Abdul Sattar"], "emails": ["SHAOWEICAI.CS@GMAIL.COM", "K.SU@GRIFFITH.EDU.AU", "CHUANLUOSABER@GMAIL.COM", "A.SATTAR@GRIFFITH.EDU.AU"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem is a prominent NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem of great importance both in theory and application.

Edge Weighting with Forgetting", "text": "In this section we introduce a new edge weighting called edge weighting with forgetfulness, which therefore plays an important role in NuMVC.The proposed strategy of edge weighting with forgetfulness works as follows: Each edge is associated with a positive integer number, and each edge weighting is referred to as one (s), but in each iteration the edge weighting of the uncovered edges is increased by a factor of 0 and 1. Note that edge weighting in the local search, including the one in this paper, is the more general streamlining idea for optimization problems based on Morris's breakout method (Morris, 1993) and in the local search for algorithms for contrint optimization problems such as SAT (Yugami, Ohta, Hara, 1994)."}, {"heading": "5.

These instances were generated from real-world problems such as coding theory, error diagnosis, Keller's guess and the Steiner Triple Problem, etc., as well as random charts in various models, such as the Brock and Hat families, ranging from less than 50 corners and 1,000 edges to more than 4,000 corners and 5,000,000 edges. Although proposed two decades ago, the DIMACS benchmark remains the most popular benchmark and is widely used to evaluate heuristic algorithms for MVC (Richter et al, 2007; Pullan et al, 2009; Cai et al, 2011; Gajurel & Bielefeld, 2012)."}, {"heading": "6.1.2 BHOSLIB BENCHMARK", "text": "The BHOSLIB3 (Benchmarks with Hidden Optimum Solutions, 2008; Cai al VC) instances were randomly generated in the area of phase transition according to the RB model (Xu & Li, 2006) and in practice (Xu & Li, 2000; Xu, Boussemart, Hemery, & Lecoutre, 2007).The SAT version of the BHOSLIB benchmark is widely used in the SAT contests both theoretically and practically (Xu & Li, 2000; Xu, Boussemart, Hemery, & Lecoutre, 2007).Nevertheless, the SAT solvers are much weaker than the MVC solvers in these problems, which remains justified in view of the results of the SAT Competition 2011 on this benchmark.

Note that the two failed instances are broken diagrams. Furthermore, NuMVC is consistent among the 35 successful instances in 32 cases (i.e. in all 100 passes), 24 of which are solved in one second. Overall, the NuMVC algorithm performs excellently in the DIMACS benchmark, except for the broken diagrams. It is noteworthy that the broken diagrams are artificially designed to defeat greedy heuristics by integrating explicitly low vertices into the optimal vertex coverage. In fact, most algorithms that favor higher-grade vertices such as GRASP, RLS, k-opt, COVER, and EWCC have also failed in these diagrams."}, {"heading": "6.3.2 PERFORMANCE OF NUMVC ON BHOSLIB BENCHMARK", "text": "In Table 2, we illustrate the performance of NuMVC on the BHOSLIB benchmark. NuMVC successfully solves all BHOSLIB instances in terms of finding an optimal solution, and the size of the worst solution it finds never exceeds V C * + 1. NuMVC finds optimal solutions with a 100% success rate for 33 of these 40 instances, and the average success rate over the remaining 7 instances is 82.57%. These results are dramatically better than the existing results in the literature on this benchmark. NuMVC also finds a suboptimal solution of size V C + 1 for all BSHOSLIB instances very quickly, always in less than 30 seconds. This indicates that NuMVC can be used to solve the MVC problem efficiently even under a very limited time.In addition to the 40 BHOSLIB instances in Table 2, there is a challenging instance frb100-40 that has a vertex coverage that does not solve a hidden minimum coverage of the size 900 BOSLIB-3B Benchmark."}, {"heading": "6.4 Comparison with Other Heuristic Algorithms", "text": "In the more recent literature, there are five leading heuristic algorithms for MVC (MC, MIS), including three MVC algorithms COVER (Richter et al., 2007), EWLS (Cai et al., 2010) and EWCC (Cai et al., 2011) and two MC algorithms DLS-MC (Pullan & Hoos, 2006) and PLS (Pullan, 2006). Note that EWCC and PLS are the improved versions of EWLS and DLS-MC, respectively, and perform better than their original versions on DIMACS and BHOSLIB benchmarks. Therefore, we compare NuMVC only with PLS, COVER and EWCC. When comparing NuMVC with other heuristic algorithms, we report V C, \"suc,\" \"time\" and IQR. The average runtime over only successful runs (\"suc time\") cannot correctly state the comparative performance of algorithms, unless success rates are calculated by narrow."}, {"heading": "6.4.1 COMPARATIVE RESULTS ON DIMACS BENCHMARK", "text": "The comparison results of the DIMACS benchmark are in Table 3. Most DIMACS instances are so simple that they can be solved by all solvers with a success rate of 100% within 2 seconds and are therefore not listed in the table.

For the eight hard instances in which at least one solver does not achieve a success rate of 100%, PLS dominates on the broken diagrams, while NuMVC on the other, including the two supposedly most difficult instances C2000.9 and MANN a81 (et al, 2007; Groset al, so, CVC and CAL respectively, is very good in size of CR and 81)."}, {"heading": "6.4.2 COMPARATIVE RESULTS ON BHOSLIB BENCHMARK", "text": "In Table 4, we present comparison results on the BHOSLIB benchmark. To focus on the significant gaps in the comparisons, we do not report the results on the two groups of small instances (frb30 and frb35) that can be solved by all approaches within a few seconds. We consider the comparison between NuMVC and EWCC significantly better than the other algorithms on all BHOSLIB instances, both in terms of success rate and average runtime, which is also shown in Figure 1. We consider the comparison between NuMVC and EWCC as EWCC is obviously better than PLS and COVER on this benchmark."}, {"heading": "6.5 Comparison with Exact Algorithms", "text": "In this section, we compare NuMVC with a state-of-the-art exact clique algorithm.

For the BHOSLIB benchmarks, we select frb53-24-2, frb56-25-2, which are of different sizes and appropriate hardness."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we have presented two new local search strategies for the problem of minimal vertex coverage (MVC), namely two-step replacement and edge weighting with forgetting. The two-step exchange strategy results in an efficient two-step operator for local MVC search algorithms, which significantly reduces the time complexity per step. On the basis of these two strategies, we have designed a light but effective local MVC search algorithm called NuMVC. The NuMVC algorithm has been evaluated against the most well-known heuristic algorithms for MVC (MC, MIS) on the basis of standard benchmarks, i.e. the DIMACS and BHOSLIB benchmarks provide only minor but effective results. Experimental results show that NuMVC is broadly competitive in terms of performance against other MACS benchmarks."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work is supported by 973 Program 2010CB328103, ARC Future Fellowship FT0991785, National Natural Science Foundation of China (61073033, 61003056 and 60903054) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (21612414).

Local search has proved successful for this problem. However, there are two main drawbacks in state-of-the-art MVC local search algorithms. First, they select a pair of vertices to exchange simultaneously, which is timeconsuming. Secondly, although using edge weighting techniques to diversify the search, these algorithms lack mechanisms for decreasing the weights. To address these issues, we propose two new strategies: two-stage exchange and edge weighting with forgetting. The two-stage exchange strategy selects two vertices to exchange separately and performs the exchange in two stages. The strategy of edge weighting with forgetting not only increases weights of uncovered edges, but also decreases some weights for each edge periodically. These two strategies are used in designing a new MVC local search algorithm, which is referred to as NuMVC. We conduct extensive experimental studies on the standard benchmarks, namely DIMACS and BHOSLIB. The experiment comparing NuMVC with state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms show that NuMVC is at least competitive with the nearest competitor namely PLS on the DIMACS benchmark, and clearly dominates all competitors on the BHOSLIB benchmark. Also, experimental results indicate that NuMVC finds an optimal solution much faster than the current best exact algorithm for Maximum Clique on random instances as well as some structured ones. Moreover, we study the effectiveness of the two strategies and the run-time behaviour through experimental analysis.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.992 Copyright 2012 Radical Eye Software"}}}
