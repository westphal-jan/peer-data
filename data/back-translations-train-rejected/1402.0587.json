Many multi-agent problems include constraints that produce different gains (or costs) for the participating agents. Asymmetric gains of constrained agents cannot be naturally represented by the standard DCOP model. The present paper proposes a general framework for Asymmetric DCOPs (ADCOPs). In ADCOPs different agents may have different valuations for constraints that they are involved in. The new framework bridges the gap between multi-agent problems which tend to have asymmetric structure and the standard symmetric DCOP model. The benefits of the proposed model over previous attempts to generalize the DCOP model are discussed and evaluated. Innovative algorithms that apply to the special properties of the proposed ADCOP model are presented in detail. These include complete algorithms that have a substantial advantage in terms of runtime and network load over existing algorithms (for standard DCOPs) which use alternative representations. Moreover, standard incomplete algorithms (i.e., local search algorithms) are inapplicable to the existing DCOP representations of asymmetric constraints and when they are applied to the new ADCOP framework they often fail to converge to a local optimum and yield poor results. The local search algorithms proposed in the present paper converge to high quality solutions. The experimental evidence that is presented reveals that the proposed local search algorithms for ADCOPs achieve high quality solutions while preserving a high level of privacy.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:43:59 GMT  (869kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0587v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tal grinshpoun", "alon grubshtein", "roie zivan", "arnon netzer", "amnon meisels"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0587"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.0587.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Asymmetric Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems", "authors": ["Tal Grinshpoun", "Alon Grubshtein", "Roie Zivan", "Arnon Netzer", "Amnon Meisels"], "emails": ["grinshpo@cs.bgu.ac.il", "alongrub@cs.bgu.ac.il", "zivanr@bgu.ac.il", "netzerar@cs.bgu.ac.il", "am@cs.bgu.ac.il"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This paper proposes a general framework for asymmetric DCOPs (ADCOPs).

Proof: For example, if we look at the interaction shown in Figure 1, UB (\u00b7) must be consistent with the costs incurred for each agent, and can be described by the following set of linear equations: UA1 (a, \u00b7) + B (a) and unsymmetrical constraint of each variable UA (\u00b7), UB (\u00b7) must be consistent with the costs incurred for each agent, and can be described by the following set of linear equations: U1 (a) + B (x), x (b), y (x) (a), x (b)."}, {"heading": "2.3.3 Private Events As Variables (PEAV)", "text": "The PEAV model (Maheswaran et al., 2004b) successfully captures asymmetric payouts within standard DCOPs.

In the first step of the DSA Algorithm Agents, some value assignments are randomly selected for their variables. Next, agents perform a sequence of steps until each agent sends its value assignment to its neighbors. Each agent sends its value assignment to its neighbors in the Restrictions graph and receives the assignments of its neighbors.

It proceeds in synchronous steps and continues (after a random initial assignment) until a condition for termination is met. In each step, an agent begins to execute ACLS by sending its current assignment to its neighbors and collecting assignments from them (line 3-4). It then collects all assignments that can improve its local state (line 5). Based on this improvement, a proposed assignment PV is randomly selected according to the distribution of profits from each proposal (line 6). This proposal is sent to all neighbors and the suggestions of neighbors (line 7,8). An agent receiving an offer responds with the value of its side of the restriction resulting from its current assignment and the proposed assignment is the assignment of LLS (line 7-10)."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Minimal Constraint Sharing MGM (MCS-MGM)", "text": "Similar to ACLS, the MCS-MGM algorithm depicted in algorithm 7 also tries to use knowledge of the local neighborhood to achieve a better return on the environment. The MCS-MGM algorithm also works in synchronous steps and ends according to a predefined condition. Each step consists of three different interaction phases. An agent starts by exchanging assignments with his neighbors (lines 3-4) and then evaluates the impact of his neighbor's assignment change on his own local state. If the neighbor's assignment change worsens the current state by more than the last known best local reduction of the neighbor, the restriction is passed on to the neighbor, i.e. the agent sends his side of the restriction to his neighbor with the new value of the neighbor and assigns costs from zero to him instead (lines 5-9). The updated restrictions are collected and the local partial problem slightly modified (lines 10-11)."}, {"heading": "4.3.3 Guaranteed Convergence Asymmetric MGM (GCA-MGM)", "text": "Line 7 is replaced by: 7: if \u2206 > 0 doWe call the resulting algorithm Guaranteed Convergence Asymmetric MGM (GCAMGM). Guaranteed convergence comes at a price. GCA-MGM is expected to retain less privacy than MCS-MGM because it has a weaker condition for exchanging restrictions between agents (see Section 5). Proposal 5 GCA-MGM is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum in a limited number of steps. Proof evidence: Suppose that GCA-MGM does not converge. As a result, agents repeatedly change their value assignments. Any change that causes an increase for some agents triggers a restriction exchange, and therefore this assignment change will not occur the next time (i.e., cannot converge again)."}, {"heading": "5. Experimental Evaluation", "text": "The experimental evaluation is divided into two parts.

Two standard metrics for the performance of complete algorithms are used - runtime and network load. In the second part of the experimental evaluation they produce, the proposed ADCOP locale search algorithms are compared with the status-of-the-art algorithms to solve DCOPs. The focus of the evaluation of the incomplete algorithms is on the quality of the algorithms they produce in a given limited runtime. As demonstrated by the experimental evaluation, the proposed ADCOP locale search algorithms are converted to a high quality, as opposed to incomplete methods that are not processed."}, {"heading": "5.1 Evaluation of ADCOP Complete Search Algorithms", "text": "The evaluation of the ADCOP complete search algorithms consists of three experimental settings - two settings of random asymmetric Max DiscSPs, followed by a graphical game setting. 50 random instances were generated for each set of experiments and the results were generated over these 50 instances.

The presented results are the average over the 500 solutions obtained by the algorithms for these instances. Asymmetric Max DisCSPs were generated with an average of 10 neighbors per agent (density parameter p2 = 0.7) and tightness parameters are described above for the asymmetric Max DiscSPs generated to evaluate complete algorithms.

Many multi-agent problems include constraints that produce different gains (or costs) for the participating agents. Asymmetric gains of constrained agents cannot be naturally represented by the standard DCOP model. The present paper proposes a general framework for Asymmetric DCOPs (ADCOPs). In ADCOPs different agents may have different valuations for constraints that they are involved in. The new framework bridges the gap between multi-agent problems which tend to have asymmetric structure and the standard symmetric DCOP model. The benefits of the proposed model over previous attempts to generalize the DCOP model are discussed and evaluated. Innovative algorithms that apply to the special properties of the proposed ADCOP model are presented in detail. These include complete algorithms that have a substantial advantage in terms of runtime and network load over existing algorithms (for standard DCOPs) which use alternative representations. Moreover, standard incomplete algorithms (i.e., local search algorithms) are inapplicable to the existing DCOP representations of asymmetric constraints and when they are applied to the new ADCOP framework they often fail to converge to a local optimum and yield poor results. The local search algorithms proposed in the present paper converge to high quality solutions. The experimental evidence that is presented reveals that the proposed local search algorithms for ADCOPs achieve high quality solutions while preserving a high level of privacy.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
