The theoretical studies of causal graphs have largely analysed the computational complexity of planning for instances where the causal graph has a certain structure, often in combination with other parameters like the domain size of the variables. Chen and Gimand#233;nez ignored even the structure and considered only the size of the weakly connected components. They proved that planning is tractable if the components are bounded by a constant and otherwise intractable. Their intractability result was, however, conditioned by an assumption from parameterised complexity theory that has no known useful relationship with the standard complexity classes. We approach the same problem from the perspective of standard complexity classes, and prove that planning is NP-hard for classes with unbounded components under an additional restriction we refer to as SP-closed. We then argue that most NP-hardness theorems for causal graphs are difficult to apply and, thus, prove a more general result; even if the component sizes grow slowly and the class is not densely populated with graphs, planning still cannot be tractable unless the polynomial hierachy collapses. Both these results still hold when restricted to the class of acyclic causal graphs. We finally give a partial characterization of the borderline between NP-hard and NP-intermediate classes, giving further insight into the problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:44:34 GMT  (453kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0588v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["christer b\\\"ackstr\\\"om", "peter jonsson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0588"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.0588.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Refined View of Causal Graphs and Component Sizes: SP-Closed Graph Classes and Beyond", "authors": ["Christer B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m", "Peter Jonsson"], "emails": ["christer.backstrom@liu.se", "peter.jonsson@liu.se"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

Specifically, it is a causal graph in such a way that there is an arc from one variable x to another variable y if either x in the precondition of an operator with an effect on y or an operator has an effect on both x and y.This standard definition of the causal graph can be traced back to Knoblock, although he did not give it a name. He used the causal graph in the alpine algorithm as a guide for dividing and arranging the variables in the process of automatically deriving causal hierarchies. The actual causal graph can be traced back to Williams and Nayak. Their approach was both more general and restrictive as well as more limited than 2013 AI Access Foundation."}, {"heading": "1.2 Our Contributions", "text": "All theoretical research on studies on the complexity of planning based on the structure of the causal diagram, and possibly other parameters such as domain sizes. An important milestone that deviates from this line of research was an article by Chen and Gime \u0301 nez (2010), which did not even take into account the structure of the causal diagram, but only a simple quantitative measure, the size of the weakly connected components. They proved that the decision on whether there is a plan can be made in polynomial time if and only if the size of the weakly connected components in the causal diagram is limited by a constant. In one sense, this is a very sharp and definitive result. However, the intractability for unlimited components depends on the assumption that W [1] 6 nu-FPT classes can be applied. This assumption is based on the theory of parameterized complexity theory and neither the assumptions of complexity classes nor the assumptions themselves can be related to complexity classes."}, {"heading": "2.

We distinguish the following types of undirected graphs: A tree is an undirected graph in which all two vertices are connected by exactly one path, i.e. it is acyclic and connected. A path graph is a tree in which all vertices have a particular star, i.e. it is a tree that has no branch. A star graph is a tree in which all vertices except one, the middle vertice, have degree 1. For directed graphs we distinguish the following types: An in-star graph is a directed graph, so that U (G) is a star graph and all edges are directed towards the center. An out-star graph is a directed graph, so that G is a star (G) is a directed graph, and all graphs are directed to the star (G) that G is a directed graph (G) that all is a star (G is directed)."}, {"heading": "3. Structurally Restricted Planning", "text": "The subject of the study in this article is causal graphs for planning, but before discussing this concept, we first define the concept of domain transition graphs (Jonsson & Ba \ufffd ckstro \ufffd m, 1998a). Although it is not used explicitly in any of our results, it is useful to explain some of the evidence later in the article. Let it (V, init, ziel, A) be a planning instance. For each variable v \u00b2 V \u00b2 V, we define the domain transition graphs (D (v), E), where for all x, y \u00b2 s, the edge contains (x, y) if there is a causal operator, so that post (a) and either pre (a) (v) or v 6 (pre).vars (pre).The causal graph graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical (x) contains graphical graphical graphs (v) and either pre (v) (v) or v (pre).vars (pre).vars (pre).The causal graph graphical graphical graphical graphical (x) contains graphical graphical graphs (x), not graphical graphical (X) in each graph, which is not a graphical (X) and other graphical (x)."}, {"heading": "4. Basic Constructions", "text": "The first three results, this planning is NP-hard for in-stars (aka. inverted forks), out-stars (aka. forks) and directed path (aka. directed chains), are known from the literature, while the NP hardness result for fences is new. However, we will also provide new evidence for the in-star and out-star cases, the main reason for which is that in Section 6 we have to refer to reductions that have exactly known properties. Furthermore, the original evidence is only published in a technical report (Domshlak & Dinitz, 2001b) and can therefore be difficult to access.

Graph Classes and Closure Properties", "text": "Like most other results in the literature, the results in the previous section are classes that consist of a particular graph type, such as the class Sin of all in-stars or the class F of all fences. This section will deviate from this and instead examine graph classes with certain closure properties. We will first discuss the standard concepts of closure of sub-graphs and smaller closures and find that the former do not contain all the graphs we need, while the latter yield a set with too many graphs. Therefore, we will define a new concept, the SP closure, which is not comparable to closure of sub-graphs but represents a subset of minor closures. We will then show that this closure concept defines a boundary between the non-NP hard graph classes and a large number of useful NP hard classes."}, {"heading": "5.1 Subgraph Closure and Minor Closure", "text": "Suppose C is a class of graphs that is closed using subgraphs. Then, for each graph G in C the case is that each subgraph H of G is also closed in C. Subgraph closure is not sufficient for our purposes, though. Example, a subgraph of a polygraph will always be either a polypath or a graph in which each weakly connected component is a polypath. But a graph does not have to have graphs that are fences of more than trivial size. We will need a closure property that guarantees that if C contains a polypath with m sinks, then it also contains a graph with m sinks. An obvious candidate for this is the concept of small closures, which is a superset of subgraph closures. The concepts of graph minors and small closures have quickly developed into a very important and useful area of research in mathematical as well as computational graph graph graph theory (Lova)."}, {"heading": "5.2 SP-Closed Graph Classes", "text": "To avoid problems with acyclicity (and other similar problems), and to avoid defining specific variants of contraction and smaller concepts, we must instead identify a set of minimal requirements that a closure must fulfill in order to imply a NP hardness for the PlanExist problem. Therefore, we will focus on such a set of constraints by defining a concept that we call SP closure (where SP means the set is closed under stars and polyways).Definition 11. Let G and H be two directional graphs. Then, H is an SP graph of G if H is weakly connected and either of the following graph: 1. H is an in graph that is a subgraph of G, 2. H is an outer star that is a subgraph of G or3. H can be reached by zero or more contradictions of some polypath G."}, {"heading": "6. Beyond SP-Closed Graph Classes", "text": "This section is divided into three parts. First, we will discuss why the previous results, as well as most other similar NP hardness results in the literature, are problematic, which motivates us to move on to the non-uniform complexity theory. Second, we will present a series of preparatory results required for the main theorem in the third part."}, {"heading": "6.1 Why NP-Hardness is Not Enough", "text": "An archetypal example is the world of blocks, where the natural parameter is the number of blocks. However, for a certain encoding and a certain number of blocks, the variables and operators are typically the same, whatever the initial state and destination is. That is, if we fix the encoding, then we get a scheduling framework \u03a6n = (Vn, An) for each number, n, of blocks. That is, the variables and operators are usually the same for all instances with n blocks and are therefore a function of n. All instances (Vn, init, goal, An) with n blocks will be instances of systems and target components, but with the same Vn and a component. An instance can therefore be specified with three unique parameters, n, init and destination, where only the first parameter, n, affects the size of the instance."}, {"heading": "6.2 Preparatory Results", "text": "Before we stick to the main theory of this section, we need some additional results. First, we show that if a planning idea has a causal graph, this graph is a subgraph of the graph, then the instance can be expanded to an equivalent instance with H as a causal graph. We assume that a planning idea has a solution that has such a graph, then there is a planning idea that can be a planning idea for an equivalent instance with H as a causal graph, \u2022 CG (G) = G and \u2022 G has a solution if it has a solution, and only if it has a solution. & ltG has the same maximum number of pre- and post-conditions for its operators as such (or another if this value is zero).Proof. Let a planning idea = (V, init, goal, A) be a planning instance, and let us leave CG = V (E)."}, {"heading": "6.3 The Main Theorem", "text": "We are ready to present and prove the most important theorems of this section. It follows that q q = q (q) | q (q) | | constraints (C), out-deg (C), and upath-length (C) are all limited to a class C of graphs, then the cc size (C) is limited. In this case, it is immediately from Theorem 3 that planning for C. This raises the question of what happens if these parameters are not limited by a constant, but by a slow-growing function? We will consider the case of allowing them to grow slowly as long as they are polynomically related to the instance size. As we have also found that practical planning problems typically do not have a causal graph of any size, we will only need a larger graph G for each graph G in C, which also has a larger graph in relation to size G."}, {"heading": "7.

While most research has been based on the standard definition of causal graphs that was set already by Knoblock, although often in the generalisation to multi-valued variables, there are important exceptions. One potential problem with the standard defintion is that whenever two variables are both affected by the same operator, then the causal graph must necessarily contain cycles, which is the major reason why the focus has mainly been on planning with unary operators.

Chen and Gim\u00e9nez ignored even the structure and considered only the size of the weakly connected components. They proved that planning is tractable if the components are bounded by a constant and otherwise intractable. Their intractability result was, however, conditioned by an assumption from parameterised complexity theory that has no known useful relationship with the standard complexity classes. We approach the same problem from the perspective of standard complexity classes, and prove that planning is NP-hard for classes with unbounded components under an additional restriction we refer to as SPclosed. We then argue that most NP-hardness theorems for causal graphs are difficult to apply and, thus, prove a more general result; even if the component sizes grow slowly and the class is not densely populated with graphs, planning still cannot be tractable unless the polynomial hierachy collapses. Both these results still hold when restricted to the class of acyclic causal graphs.
