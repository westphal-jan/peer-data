Free Email Services", "text": "Several companies (such as Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft) offer free e-mail services, most of which suffer from a particular type of attack: bots that log in to thousands of e-mail accounts every minute. [3] This situation can be avoided or improved by requiring users to prove that they are human before they can get a free e-mail account. Yahoo!, for example, uses a CAPTCHA to prevent bots from registering for e-mail accounts. Your CAPTCHA asks the user to read one or more distorted words like the one shown in Figure 1 to guarantee that they are serving a human, not a computer bot."}, {"heading": "C. Search Engine Bots", "text": "The owners of some websites do not want their pages to be indexed by search engines. There is an HTML tag that prevents search engine bots from reading web pages. However, the tag does not guarantee that the bots do not read the pages; it is only used to reject bots that are used to index the web. Search engine bots respect web pages that they normally do not want to allow. However, these tags do not prevent bots from indexing these web pages. CAPTCHAs are needed to really guarantee that bots do not enter a website."}, {"heading": "D. Worms and Spam", "text": "CAPTCHAs also offer a plausible solution against e-mail worms and spam: e-mail clients can conform to a policy by accepting an e-mail only if they know that there is a human behind the other computer from which that particular e-mail is sent. Some companies, such as http: / / www.spamarrest.com, are already marketing this idea."}, {"heading": "E. Preventing Dictionary Attacks.", "text": "Pinkas and Sander [4] have proposed using CAPTCHAs to prevent attacks on dictionaries in password-based systems; the idea is simple: to prevent a computer from going through the entire password space by requiring a human to type the passwords."}, {"heading": "III. CHARACTERISTICS OF CAPTCHAS", "text": "There are several types of CAPTCHAs that have been used in the recent past. People have used text images and sound CAPTCHAs. People can use any type of CAPTCHA method in their applications as long as the methods have the following characteristics [3]: 1. Automation and grading: However, the test should be generated and graded by a machine. 2. Easy for humans: The test should be performed quickly and easily by a human user (the response time is usually within 30 seconds). 3. The test should be based on a known hard AI problem and the best existing techniques should not be applied."}, {"heading": "IV.

More Line CAPTCHAs", "text": "One such method is to use multiple lines with different colors and ask the user to select a line with a specific color and draw over it, as in Figure 7. However, the validity of this line CAPTCHA is in question for the same reason as the first CAPTCHA we proposed. If a program can identify a line, then it can draw on a line with a certain probability of success. In a safe CAPTCHA, the success rate for random input is considered to be less than 0.2%. To obtain this rate, there should be 500 lines in the image, which is impractical. However, the reason for proposing this line CAPTCHA is this: This line CAPTCHA cannot be considered susceptible to random input attacks, since the computer must first identify the lines before performing a random attack, and this identification will take a significant amount of time. This line CAPTCHA can be further improved by making the TAPA method of displaying TAPA-APA somewhat more friendly."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "CAPTCHAs, or reverse engineering tests, are used by programs (or machines) to distinguish humans from machines. The race between manufacturers and interrupters of CAPTCHAs is at a point where the CAPTCHAs proposed today, due to their complexity and ease of use, are not even human-accountable. We look at CAPTCHAs that humans consider unuser-friendly and irresponsible. In this paper, we have proposed a novel CAPTCHA technique, known as line-CAPTCHAs, which are distorted lines on an unclear background triggered by mouse drag. Line-CAPTCHAs focus mainly on usability without compromising the safety that such systems are intended to provide."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We would like to thank Dhammika Elkaduwe from Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya for his valuable feedback on this project."}], "references": [{"title": "Telling humans and computers apart (Automatically) or How lazy cryptographers do AI", "author": ["L.
