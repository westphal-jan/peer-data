The motivation for this problem is the plethora of examples (influenza strains in humans, or computer viruses in smartphones, etc.) where reliable diagnoses are scarce, but noisy data plentiful. In flu/phone-viruses, exceedingly few infected people/phones are professionally diagnosed (only a small fraction go to a doctor) but less reliable secondary signatures (e.g., people staying home, or greater-than-typical upload activity) are more readily available. These secondary data are often plagued by unreliability: many people with the flu do not stay home, and many people that stay home do not have the flu. This paper identifies the precise regime where knowledge of the contact network enables finding the needle in the haystack: we provide a distributed, efficient and robust algorithm that can correctly identify the existence of a spreading epidemic from highly unreliable local data.

The decision-making task at hand is to distinguish between the two following alternative scenarios. \u2022 An epidemic: At the time t = 0, an arbitrary subset of nodes is infected, and the infection then spreads according to a standard suceptible-infectedmodel (Ganesh et al. (2005)). That is, infected nodes infect their neighbors according to an exponential clock set on each edge. We refer to the group of infected nodes as either S = S (T), and the infection size as | S | = \u03b1 (N) N. At this point, any infected node that is likely to be infected is reported. Unides (N).

First, the more the false negatives (i.e., the smaller the sentence Sr), the more the epidemic statistically resembles the random disease. Second, in the borderline, when all the infected nodes report, the presence (or absence) of a large connected component is easy to test and sufficient to solve the decision problem. Finally, the topology of the graph itself plays an important role. The more strongly the graph is connected, the more the two processes become statistically identical. In the borderline case where the contact network is the complete graph, the two processes are indistinguishable. From an algorithmic point of view, there is another regime of interest: the very small infection setting. It is interesting to understand in this environment how well an algorithm that uses only minimal graph information can work. Our contributions are statistically and algorithmically, addressing both regimes addressed above."}, {"heading": "3 The Algorithm: Hotspot Aggregator", "text": "The intuition behind our algorithm is simple: in an epidemic, there are more plagues than a random number of infections.

Depending on the context, such outbreaks can be computer viruses, opinion trends, or epidemics such as malaria. Identifying these diffuse processes is critical, and one may be forced to rely on a single snapshot of coverage. Furthermore, full knowledge of the underlying network diagram is generally unrealistic. We have presented both analytical evidence and experiments with real data showing that the hotspot aggregator algorithm solves this statistical inference problem in its dismal setting on a variety of networks and settings. We have shown that this algorithm correctly classifies network error rates, even when the rate of false positives and false negatives is infinitely higher than the number of true positives, as well as the presence of multiple epidemic equals in the network. We have pointed this algorithm to both random networks, such as terrestrial networks, and terrestrial networks, as low-level networks, or extreme networks in the Internet."}, {"heading": "A Appendix A - Additional lemmas", "text": "Lemma 6 refers to the report probability of an infected node in the epidemic scenario by pin.
