Hardness Results", "text": "The complexity of the fuzzy-lagged co-clustering problem depends on the nature of the cluster being degraded, which is reflected in the objective function \u00b5 used. Previous literature has shown that many such non-fuzzy and non-lagged instances are NP-complete [17, 49, 60, 70].Observation 1. Any hardness or inapproximation resulting from either the non-fuzzy or non-lagged problem implies the same result for the fuzzy-lagged problem (Ti = 0, 60, 70].The fuzzy-lagged co-clustering problem extends to the lagged co-clustering problem (fi, j = 0, I, J), which in turn extends the co-clustering problem (Ti = 0, I).Thus, any valid instance of the non-fuzzy-clustering problem or the non-lagged problem can be regarded as an instance of the fuzzy-lagged problem."}, {"heading": "3.

The algorithm itself uses a projected cluster approach. This common technique for mining co-clusters [49, 65] uses iterative random projections that unite with the specified \u03b2, F, and the optimal fuzzy-lagged co-clusters. Each mined cluster achieves exactly the rows and delays of the optimal clusters, with a maximum ratio of its columns (i.e., a maximum addition of the J columns) and a maximum ratio of its error.Algorithm 1 represents the FLC algorithms."}, {"heading": "3.2. Run-time", "text": "The line addition phase (lines 8-12) treats a sliding window for O (n \u00b7 | S | \u00b7 F) events for each of the m lines.

Thus, the inner runtime for the loops is: O (mn log (mn) log (n) F).The total number of iterations is limited by theorem 2 to N = O (1 / \u03b2\u03b3 | S |). Thus, for the constants \u03b2 and \u03b3, independent of the matrix dimensions (see Def. \u2212 3) and the discrimination set | S | = O (log (mn) (see theorem 1), the total time of the log FLC (n): 2 (nomatrix), whereby the polymatrix size (see Def."}, {"heading": "3.3. Sub-optimality of FLC Algorithm", "text": "Next, we will analyze the ability of the FLC algorithm to mine a limited and relevant number of co-clusters. (1) Specifically, we will prove that the algorithm guarantees that it will come to me, with a fixed probability, in a polynomial number of iterations. (1) Consequently, the mined cluster will have a maximum ratio of 2 co-clusters that includes an optimal cluster error. We demonstrate this guarantee with experiments on both artificial and real datasets in Section 4. Since the FLC algorithm deeply inspires the non-fuzzy stored co-cluster algorithms [70], its capabilities and theoretical analysis, the structure of the evidence is based on an important finding that a sufficient size is sufficient for a discriminatory co-cluster algorithm."}, {"heading": "3.4. Extensions", "text": "Next, we present several extensions of the FLC algorithm and the resulting algorithmic modifications that support these extensions."}, {"heading": "3.4.1. Varying Fuzziness", "text": "An essential feature of the FLC algorithm is the maximum allowed blur F. This blur is assumed for all entries in the matrix, and the algorithm can be extended to include a different maximum blur for each line of the matrix, which is called Fi, i. To achieve this, the algorithm must be modified in events that are later used by the slider window (lines 9 and 16 of algorithm 1). Essentially, the modification is to use the maximum allowed blur of line Fi instead of the global blur F. The changes are as follows: line 9, which collects lines, should be changed to: Push a 4w-wide window to {es, j, f | it, j = Ai, j + f \u2212 Ap, s, j \u2212 Ap, j \u2212 f, s \u2212 f, s \u2212 f, s, and the maximum number of allowed lines. Line 16, which collects columns, should be modified so that window {es, i, f, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, and the maximum number of allowed lines, it should be changed to Aj, f, f, f, f, f, f, f."}, {"heading": "3.4.2. Reduction in Size of the Discriminating Set", "text": "The discriminatory set S, as shown by theorem 1, is a small subset of size O (log (mn) | IV. Nevertheless, the number of iterations N required to achieve the probable guarantee shown by theorem 2 is exponentially proportional to | S |. To improve the runtime of the algorithm, we propose to take a subset of discriminatory columns S, called S0, and assume that it has zero blur across all rows in the cluster, i.e., let (I, T, J, F) be a blurry co-cluster with a discriminatory set of columns S, assuming that fi, j = 0, is blurred for all i, j, j, S0. The assumption reduces the combinatory number of rows that must be filtered out by the discriminating set, thus reducing the size required for the task (line 4 of the algorithm 1) of blur required set."}, {"heading": "3.4.3.
