In order for a hardness result to be convincing, it must take into account natural algorithmic relaxations. We showed that several relaxations, which are natural from the point of view of algorithmic machine learning, do not make the problem any easier. Conversely, from a complexity theoretical point of view, these are the first hardness outcomes for the approach to matrix completion. A consequence of our work is that the popular incoherence assumption alone is not enough to make the problem comprehensible. Conversely, another difficult question is whether the assumption of uniformly random entries alone already makes the problem easier. Question 4.1. Is matrix completion difficult if the observed entries are randomly selected but the observed matrix is not incoherent? Another difficult question is determining the exact hardness threshold for (k, r) completion."}, {"heading": "A Finding Good Factorizations of Low Rank Matrices", "text": "In this section we will demonstrate a constructive version of Lemma 2.1, which is reconstructed below for convenience.

Important recent results show that the problem can be solved efficiently under the assumption that the unknown matrix is incoherent and the subsample is drawn uniformly at random. Are these assumptions necessary? It is well known that Matrix Completion in its full generality is NP-hard. However, little is known if make additional assumptions such as incoherence and permit the algorithm to output a matrix of slightly higher rank. In this paper we prove that Matrix Completion remains computationally intractable even if the unknown matrix has rank 4 but we are allowed to output any constant rank matrix, and even if additionally we assume that the unknown matrix is incoherent and are shown 90% of the entries. This result relies on the conjectured hardness of the 4-Coloring problem. We also consider the positive semidefinite Matrix Completion problem. Here we show a similar hardness result under the standard assumption that P ,NP. Our results greatly narrow the gap between existing feasibility results and computational lower bounds. In particular, we believe that our results give the first complexity-theoretic justification for why distributional assumptions are needed beyond the incoherence assumption in order to obtain positive results. On the technical side, we contribute several new ideas on how to encode hard combinatorial problems in low-rank optimization problems. We hope that these techniques will be helpful in further understanding the computational limits of Matrix Completion and related problems. \u2217IBM Research Almaden.
