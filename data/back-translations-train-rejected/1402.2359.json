Unlike the current problems [17, 20], the metasystem relies on one or more central ATPs (originally SPASS [21] and E [12]) and one or more machine learners (originally the naive Bayes learners provided by the SNoW system [2]), but the goal in benchmarks such as the MPTP Challenge is to solve as many large theoretical problems as possible within a global time limit, allowing systems to spend time analyzing and solving different problems and transferring the knowledge obtained to other problems, while solving a problem is limited to other problems. However, the most important way MaLARea does this is to gradually explore and learn the relevance relationship, which (sets of) existing theorems are likely to be useful in order to prove a given conjectivity and to make general decisions about which problems to address and which ones to address next."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgements", "text": "It was a great pleasure for us to use Stephan Schulz's open source e-verifier.
