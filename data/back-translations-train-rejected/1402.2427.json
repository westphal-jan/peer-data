SNA provides a mathematical framework for these and related problems of social computing power by defining a social network as a tuple (V, E) corresponding to a finite set of vertices V corresponding to social units (actors), and a set of edges E = {x, y} | x, y V x = 6 = y (V 2). In other words, a social network is a diagram induced by a binary relationship in the mathematical sense usually constructed by observing or modelling an actual social relationship. In this work, we implement and evaluate a method of supplementing the social network diagrams with information extracted from the Extractedar Xiv: 140 2,271 [S11] away from purely topological communication between the individual actors in an order of SNB."}, {"heading": "1.1 Problem Statement and Prior Research", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to another world in which they are able, in which they are able to move, and in which they are able to move."}, {"heading": "1.2 Research Questions", "text": "Starting with the problem, we formulate two research questions: 1. Is it possible to extract a set of keywords from communication artifacts that a human observer considers to be a good representation of the associated social relationship? The intuition is that if sufficient data is gathered from the background noise of words with a predominantly conversation-specific function, a pattern of keywords will emerge. 2. Will a representation considered correct by a human observer inversely improve the performance of social computing systems? In this work, we will focus on the first question and evaluate a keyword extraction system for text messages exchanged between users of the social network Facebook. Section 2.1 describes the design of the keyword extraction system in detail. In Section 2.2, we will build a Facebook application that analyzes private messages and receives user feedback on the quality of the extracted keywords. The results will be presented in Section 3."}, {"heading": "2 Experimental Setting", "text": "In order to obtain a representative sample of interpersonal communication, a large amount of messages needs to be collected. We chose Facebook as the data source because it is known for its large user base and network effects (\"viral marketing\"). Facebook enables users to declare \"friendship\" with each other and exchange private messages. The \"friend\" relationship across users corresponds to individual social relationships that may differ in emotional and geographic proximity. For example, Facebook is often used as the primary tool for maintaining relationships between geographically distant people (Bryant and Marmo, 2009). Facebook offers an API that allows third-party developers to integrate their applications into the user interface and access user profile data as far as possible through the privacy of an individual user. The Facebook application developed for this study fulfills three distinct tasks: private messages sent and received by a user are collected via the API, from the messages collected, each key word is asked for each sender pair, and finally, a set of sender words is extracted by the user."}, {"heading": "2.1 Keyword Extraction", "text": "This year, as never before in the history of the city, where it has reached the point where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, where it is a place is a place, a place is a place, a place is a place, a place is a place is a place, a place is a place, a place is a place is a place, a place is a place, a place is a place, a place is a place, a place is a place is a place, a place is a place, a place, a"}, {"heading": "2.2 Data Acquisition", "text": "Most of them are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves. \"I have no idea how it could happen,\" he says. \"But I have no idea how it could happen.\" \"I have no idea how it could happen.\" \"I have no idea how it could happen.\" \"I have no idea, he says.\" \"I have no idea, but I know how it will happen.\" \"I don't know.\" \"\" I don't know. \"\" \"I don't know.\" \"\" I don't know. \"\" \"I don't know..\" \"\" I don't know... \"\" \"I don't know..\" \"I don't know.\" \"I don't know.\" \"I don't know..\" \"I don't know...\" I don't know... \"I don't know....\" I don't know... \"I don't know........\" I don't know... \"I don't know.........\" I don't know....... \""}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "The data was collected over a period of approximately 2.5 months. During this period, 98 Facebook users installed the application, and 71 users actually submitted usable data. Ratings were submitted for 275 relationships. 46 users (65%) removed an average of one or more words from a keyword sentence before submitting their rating. The average number of messages associated with a relationship is 20, with an average number of 36 words per message. There is a strong linear correlation between the amount of messages sent and received per relationship, with Peer's correlation coefficient of 0.92 for the relationship of messages and \u03c1 = 0.9 for the ratio of total word count. This is evidence of Facebook's reciprocal notification behavior.The main results of the study are summarized in Table 1. The top half of the table contains empirical estimates of the mean and standard deviation of the ratings. Each user can submit ratings for the zero ratings, the zero values for multiple relationships, so each relationship can be interpreted as the resulting two-fold relationship:"}, {"heading": "3.1 Deleted Keywords", "text": "Participants are encouraged to delete those keywords they consider to be completely irrelevant. Analysis of the participants \"solution behavior could help identify ways to improve the keyword extraction process. This is where we suffer most from keyword hashing, which completely obscures the semantics of the keywords. According to usage statistics in Table 2, we did not make use of the ability to remove irrelevant keywords for more than a third of the participants, while those who removed 3.3 keywords on average investigate the reasons for this dichotomous behavior, we construct two different hypotheses by showing the correlation between the quality assessment and the number of keywords removed per relationship and per user. The first hypothesis suggests that there is a subset of relationships for which the keyword extraction system is able to generate high quality keywords so that no removal is necessary."}, {"heading": "4 Related Work", "text": "Culotta et al.
