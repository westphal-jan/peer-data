Furthermore, models trained in a particular field or language are not particularly effective when applied in different areas.The language problem also affects the language dependence of resources, such as LIWC (Tausczik & Pennebaker 2010) and MRC (Coltheart 1981).These are clear limitations in the exploitation of text of personality recognition from other LPs."}, {"heading": "3 PR2: System description, Feature Set and Parameters", "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments: Testing the System", "text": "We tested the system on two sets of data of different size, domain and language: Essays (Mairesse et al 2007), a large collection of English essays, and PersFB (Celli & Polonio 2013), a small set of Facebook posts in Italian. We divided essays into lines to have more or less the same length per text in the two sets (19 words per text in essays and 12 words per text in PersFB). As a test set, we used a sample of 250 essay authors and about 25 authors for PersFB. Patterns (parameter t) were extracted from larger sets of data: 2000 essay authors and about 1000 authors for PersFB. Since each personality trait is bipolar, we decided to cancel the tests, considering the correct predictions for both poles as true positives, false positives as false predictions and false negatives as missed predictions."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We introduced PR2: an online NLP tool for language-independent, unsupervised unlabeled text personality recognition. Unlike monitored systems that require large labeled records for training, this tool only requires a small labeled record to validate the annotation. In the future, we want to improve the accuracy of the system and provide a goal scorer for validation."}], "references": [{"title": "Personality Is Reflected in the Brain\u2019s Intrinsic Functional Architecture", "author": ["J.S.
