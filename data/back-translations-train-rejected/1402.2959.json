The model compresses the information given by the whole search space into a smaller mathematical object that is a graph having as vertices the local optima and as edges the possible weighted transitions between them. Two definitions of edges have been proposed: basin-transition and escape-edges, which capture relevant topological features of the underlying search spaces. This network model brings a new set of metrics to characterize the structure of combinatorial landscapes, those associated with the science of complex networks. These metrics are described, and results are presented of local optima network extraction and analysis for two selected combinatorial landscapes: NK landscapes and the quadratic assignment problem. Network features are found to correlate with and even predict the performance of heuristic search algorithms operating on these problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 20:21:54 GMT  (386kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2959v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["gabriela ochoa", "s\\'ebastien verel", "fabio daolio", "marco tomassini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.2959"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.2959.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Local Optima Networks: A New Model of Combinatorial Fitness Landscapes", "authors": ["Gabriela Ochoa", "S\u00e9bastien Verel", "Fabio Daolio", "Marco Tomassini"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: fitness landscapes, complex networks, combinatorial optimization, local optimum, attraction pools, NK landscapes, square assignment problem"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "2 The Science of Complex Networks", "text": "In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the structure of the large networks that are part of our everyday environment, such as the World Wide Web, the Internet, transportation and power grids, web-based social networks such as Facebook and many others. These networks have properties that are unprecedented in simple diagrams such as grids, properties that are similar to those of complex systems in general. In these systems, it is difficult or even impossible to derive global behaviors given the rules followed by system components and their interactions. For this reason, these large networks are called complex networks and their structure leads to a wide range of dynamic behaviors. Since this chapter relies heavily on complex network nomenclature and methods to largely encompass them, we will give a brief introduction to the field. There are many references to complex networks: a technical but still highly readable intro-book is [12], while [31] a comprehensive reference is made to those networks that form complex networks. Mathematically, the networks are only graphs seen as being complex (E), which are, in some cases, pairs of E are actually formed."}, {"heading": "2.1 Random Graphs", "text": "The random diagram model was formally defined by Erdo \ufffd s and Re \ufffd nyi at the end of the 1950s. In its simplest form, the model consists of N vertices joined by edges that are equally randomly placed between corner pairs. In other words, each of the possible N (N \u2212 1) / 2 edges is present with the probability p and is missing with the probability 1 \u2212 p. The model is often referred to as GN, p to indicate that strictly speaking there is no random number, but rather an ensemble of GN, p equivalent graphs. Another closely related model of a random diagram considers the family of graphs GN, M with N vertices and accurate M edges. For 0 \u2264 M \u2264 (N 2), there is s = (N \u2212 1) / 2 M) graphs that are all graphs with M edges equal."}, {"heading": "2.2 Other Network Topologies", "text": "Random diagrams are interesting objects because they are likely to obey general mathematical properties in a sense. They are also a useful model for generating problem cases to test network algorithms, and they are also used in other ways. But, are random diagrams a useful model for the networks that permeate society? In fact, as early as the 1950s, social scientists had the qualitative sense that social and professional connections and acquaintances did not follow a random structure. If, for example, one person has a relationship with two others, then the latter two are more likely to know each other than two arbitrary persons. However, this does not fit with the random diagram model, in which the probability of two particular nodes being connected to each other is independent of any other consideration. In a groundbreaking paper, Watts and Strogatz [46] proposed a simple network construction algorithm that results in graphs having the following properties: the path length of any node is short, as in random diagrams, but there are large in local networks, as opposed to small ones."}, {"heading": "2.3 Some Graph Statistics", "text": "It is not the way in which the individual nodes of the individual nodes are connected to each other, but the way in which the individual nodes of the individual nodes of the individual nodes are connected to each other.

Model networks that grow according to the Baraba'si-Albert recipe [2] or are randomly generated have little structure in the sense that there are few or no recognizable sub-networks. In other words, if you get an idea of the network, it appears quite homogeneous on a global level. On the contrary, many observed networks, especially those arising from social interactions, show the presence of nodes. These clusters are called communities. It is difficult, if not impossible, to give a precise and unique mathematical definition of a community. An intuitive definition of a community is the following: nodes that belong to a community are more interconnected than to the rest of the network. In other words, connectivity between communities is higher than connectivity between communities."}, {"heading": "3 Example Combinatorial Landscapes", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 The NK model", "text": "The idea of an NK landscape is to have N \"spins\" or \"loci,\" each with two possible values, 0 or 1.

A solution to the QAP is generally written as permutation \u03c0 of the set {1, 2,..., n}. Costs associated with a permutation \u03c0 are characterized by: C (\u03c0) = n \u2211 i = 1 n \u0445 j = 1 aijb\u03c0i\u03c0jwhere n denotes the number of devices / places and A = {aij} and B = {bij} are referred to as distance or flow matrices. The structure of these two matrices characterizes the class of instances of the QAP problem. 11The results presented in this chapter are based on two instance generators proposed in [23]. These generators were originally developed for the multi-objective QAP, but were adapted for the single problem and the multiple local QAP problem were used."}, {"heading": "4 The Local Optima Network Model", "text": "This section formally describes the local Optima network model of combinatorial landscapes. We begin by defining the term \"fitness landscapes\" and follow it by formalizing the nodes and edges of the network model. A fitness landscape [36] is a triplet (S, V, f), where S is a set of potential solutions, i.e. a search space; V: S \u2212 \u2192 2S, a neighborhood structure, is a function that assigns each s a set of neighbors V (s), and f: S \u2212 \u2192 R is a fitness function that can be represented as the height of the corresponding solutions. Local Optima networks have been analyzed for the two combinatorial landscapes discussed in Section 3. Therefore, two search spaces or solution representations have been examined: binary strings (NK landscapes) and permutations (QAP). In each case, the most basic neighborhood structure is considered as described in Table 1."}, {"heading": "4.1 Definition of Nodes", "text": "The algorithm defines an assignment from the search space S to the group of locally optimal solutions S.
