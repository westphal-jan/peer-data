Introduction", "text": "In this sense, four verbs - chi1 \"eat,\" wan2 \"play,\" huan4 \"change\" and shao1 \"burn\" - were chosen as target words to predict their senses. There are two main reasons why these four target words were chosen: (1) they are all transitive verbs; and (2) they each have more than two senses. These two reasons may not fully explain why they were chosen from the many transitive verbs available in the corpus. To clarify our reasoning in selecting these four target words, we will use the module attribute representation of the verbal semantics theory (Huang et al 2000). Before explaining in detail why these four target verbs were chosen, we will present the module attribute representation of the verbal semantics theory (MARVS theory). Finally, we would like to examine the four transitive verbs as chi1 \"eat,\" wan2 \"play,\" \"huan4\" and their combustion theory \"VS.\""}, {"heading": "2.
