INTRODUCTION Speech is an integral part of human communication. Speech synthesis and analysis and its recognition have been researched for years and are still working on the development of a system that is 100% reliable. Speech analysis has been taken to a new level with the discovery of the new technology - Reverse Speech. Reverse Speech is the phenomenon of hidden backward messages in language. When human speech is recorded and played backwards, very clear statements can be heard at regular intervals. These statements usually appear in short sentences and are almost always related to the forward language. By using one's own language, we can find the innermost thought of the person. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is another language analysis method that can be translated into real language, the language, the ASR systems, the language, the language, etc."}, {"heading": "II. REVERSE SPEECH", "text": "A radical new theory of language is illuminated by the discovery of a new form of communication, the reverse speech. [1] David John Oates, the founder of Reverse Speech, claims that in the sounds of human speech, embedded backwards, there is another form of human communication. The new form of communication states that the human brain constructs the sounds of speech at regular intervals so that occasionally another message is said backwards. This second message can be heard when human speech is recorded and played backwards. Mixed between the normal gibberish of audio, one can hear fairly clear grammatically correct sentences. Moreover, these backward sentences often have a unique relationship to what is said at the time. They can confirm the forward speech or they can be contradictory to it. Sometimes, they can be extended to the forward speech by providing additional information or clarifying details."}, {"heading": "A. The Layers of Consciousness", "text": "Sometimes reversals can reflect conscious thoughts that the speaker had at the time, or emotions that he felt. Sometimes, they can communicate deeper thoughts of which the speaker has no conscious consciousness. Based on years of work on word reversals, David John's human psyche has been divided into five distinct parts. [1] Part One - The conscious mind: This is the part of the mind that is in the realm of consciousness. 2) Part Two - The subconscious mind: This is the realm of the mind that is just below the level of consciousness. It contains memories that were once conscious but have been suppressed by the passage of time or psychological factors. 3) Part Three - The deep unconscious mind: There is a level of mind that is deeper than the superficial subconscious level. This level contains the codes and building blocks of behavior and personality. Part of these codes or behavioral patterns that are outside of consciousness are rare occasions for the subconscious to be included in those."}, {"heading": "B. The Different Types of Reversals", "text": "Most of the reversals relate to the forward dialog, that is, they are contemporary reversals. The exception seems to be when collective unconscious information is communicated. Exact categorization of the reversals [1], [4] gives them a greater understanding of meaning in context. The categories are listed below: Congruent reversals These reversals correspond to the content of the forward dialog and confirm it. Incongruent reversals These reversals directly contradict what has been said forward. Expansive reversals add additional information to the forward dialog. External reversals speak directly to another person giving instructions or asking questions. It is assumed that the unconscious hears these reversed messages and responds accordingly. Internal dialogue These reversals reflect internal thought processes, consciously and unconsciously, as the psyche speaks to itself."}, {"heading": "III. SPEECH ENHANCEMENT TECHNIQUES", "text": "Speech enhancement techniques aim to improve the quality and intelligibility of speech impaired by noise [5], [6], [14]. The goal of speech enhancement varies according to the needs of specific applications, such as increasing overall speech quality or intelligibility, reducing listener fatigue, or improving the global performance of an ASR embedded in a speech communication system. Therefore, the noisy speech signal is pre-processed by a speech enhancement algorithm before being passed on to the speech recognition algorithm. There are numerous speech enhancement techniques in the literature. These techniques can be roughly divided into four [7] main categories: spectral subtractive, statistical model-based, subspace decomposition, and perception-based techniques."}, {"heading": "A. Spectral Subtractive Techniques", "text": "One of the most popular methods for reducing the effect of background noise (additive) is spectral subtraction. Spectral subtraction requires only an estimate of the noise spectrum in times of speaker silence (single-channel) or from a reference source (multi-channel). It is a frame-based approach that estimates the short-term spectral size of the noise-free signal from the noise data. Spectral subtraction subtracts the average noise spectrum from the average signal spectrum, which is independently conducted in the frequency bands that are critical to human hearing. This reduces the level of each frequency range by an amount that is proportional to the level of that frequency in the noise sample. Suppose that the speech signal mx is corrupted by background noise mn, i.e.: mnmxmy Windowing the signal: mnmxmy wFourier transforms these two sides of this frequency, yyyyyw and yw noise respectively, where the background noise is generated."}, {"heading": "B. Statistical Model-based Techniques", "text": "The goal is to find a linear (or non-linear) estimator of the original clean signal. Wiener and Minimum Middle Square Error Algorithms (MMSE) belong to the known methods of this category. Wiener filters are considered linear estimators of the pure voice signal spectrum and are optimal in the sense of the middle square. The increased time domain signal is obtained by merging the noisy signal with a linear (Wiener) filter. Likewise, the increased spectrum in the frequency range is achieved by multiplying the incoming noisy spectrum with the Wiener filter."}, {"heading": "C. Subspace Decomposition Techniques", "text": "These techniques are based on the principle that a non-parametric linear estimation of the unknown pure speech signal is obtained by dividing the observed noise signal into orthogonal signal and noise subspaces, assuming that the energy of the less correlated noise is distributed throughout the observation space, while the energy of the correlated speech components is concentrated in a subspace generated by the low-order components. Noise is assumed to be additive and uncorrelated with the speech signal. Noise reduction is achieved by removing the noise subroom and removing the noise contribution in the signal subroom.The decomposition of the vector noise signal into subspaces can be done with the known orthogonal matrix factoring techniques from linear algebra, namely the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or the EVD."}, {"heading": "D. Perceptual-based Techniques", "text": "The aim of perception-based methods is to make residual noise perceptibly inaudible, thereby improving the intelligibility of enhanced signals by taking into account the characteristics of the human auditory system, taking advantage of the fact that the hearing system cannot perceive residual noise when its level falls below the noise mask threshold (Noise Masking Threshold, NMT). In these methods, the spectral estimates of a speech signal play a crucial role in determining the value of the noise mask threshold used to adjust the perception growth factor."}, {"heading": "IV. MFCC FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of us are able to go in search of a solution that is capable, that they are able to find a solution, that they are able to find a solution, that they are able to find a solution, that they are able to find a solution, that they are able to find a solution, that they are able to find a solution, that they are able to find a solution, that they are able to find a solution, that they are able to find a solution, that they are able to find a solution, that they are able to find a solution, and that they are able to find a solution."}, {"heading": "V. GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL", "text": "In speech and speaker recognition, acoustic events are usually modelled using Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) [9], which are described by the mean vector and covariance matrix. However, uni-model PDFs with only one mean and covariance are not suitable for modelling all variations of a single event in speech signals. Therefore, a mixture of individual densities is used to model the complex structure of density probability.A Gaussian mixing model is a weighted sum of M-component Gaussian density according to the equation, Mi iii xgwxp 1, where x is a D-dimensional continuously evaluated data vector, characteristics, iw, Mi,..., 1 are mixing weights, and iixg, Mi,..., 1 are the component Gaussian siandensip 1, with each component density being a D-dimensional, data weights, Mi, Mi,..., the characteristics..., Mi, isisisip, Mi, Mi..."}, {"heading": "VI. PROPOSED WORK", "text": "In the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), requirements capture is the backbone for the successful completion of the project. SRS documentation encounters many problems that lead to the failure of the project at the time of deployment."}, {"heading": "A. Applying Reverse Speech", "text": "The Reverse Speech technology eliminates inconsistencies in the forward language with the help of the reverse language. As already mentioned, it is the phenomenon of hidden reverse messages in the language. By introducing the reverse language to prepare the SRS, we are able to document the SRS very precisely, clearly, correctly and authentically. The more the emotional content, the clearer are the reversals gained from the conversation with the customer. Thus obtained reversals clarify the requirements. In addition, the additive noise, which can occur due to electronic devices and the environment, is removed by filtering and the speech improvement leads to clean speech signals. B. Recognition module in the work recognizes the forward language, which is recorded and stored in the im.wav file format. The file is passed with the extension module to remove additive noise in the recorded file. The reversals, which are obtained as output from the application of the reverse language, are also recognized by additional sound removal techniques - both the forward voice and the recorded ones are documented clearly."}, {"heading": "VII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "The ReverseSpeech Pro 2.6 version and Matlab encoding were used to obtain the reversals. Examples of reversals obtained are listed below: Forward: \"Everybody yeah....\" (part of a song) Backward: \"Thy hate on me why\" Forward: \"I am happy\" (said by a person) Backward: \"We can't fail.\" These reversals are used as input to the Speech Recognition Module and Speech Recognition Module to extract the characteristics of the language using MFCC and use the characteristics obtained in this way to recognize the language. Thus, the conversion of the language into text takes place. By using the MFCC, the extraction of the characteristics is facilitated as it creates a 39-dimensional matrix that can be viewed as different extracted characteristics."}, {"heading": "VIII. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Requirements capture and analysis must be robust and reliable. In the current situation, about 25% of the software fails due to a lack of understanding of the actual requirement of the customer. The proposed work uses reverse language technology as an efficient and reliable system for creating SRS documents. The reverse language technology acts as a cure for modality. The work issues the SRS documentation after both forward and backward language has been detected, and with the help of the documentation of forward and backward language, the discrepancies in the aggregated requirement, from the conversation and from the actual requirement of the user or customer are eliminated."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "I would like to thank Sajeer Karattil, Dr Raghav Menon, Dr Paul Rodingous and all the helping hands who made this work a success."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2013, "abstractText": "Speech analysis had been taken to a new level with the discovery of Reverse Speech (RS).
