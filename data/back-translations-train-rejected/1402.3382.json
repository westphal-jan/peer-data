In modern Tamil, all lexical or root morphemes can be distinguished into four groups: two large groups of nominal and verbal roots, which are composed of two small groups of adjective roots, and adjective roots.

[4] MACHINE LEARNING Machine learning is one of the important areas of research and application of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning deals with acquiring knowledge from an environment in a computational manner. Machine learning is the ability of a computer to learn from experience (training data) and extract knowledge from examples. A successful learner should be able to draw general conclusions about the data on which he is trained, allowing him to act appropriately in new situations.

An automatic Sandhi checker or Sandhi generator can be used as a critical component in morphological analyzers, morphological generators and text-to-speech synthesizers."}, {"heading": "International Journal of Computer Engineering and Applications, Volume IV, Issue III, Oct-Dec,13", "text": "Tamil grammar recognises various ways of conditioning Sandhi changes, such as phonological, grammatical and syntactic relationships. Even within the grammatical relationship and syntactic relationship, the phonological condition can work. In this work, only the characters in the noun stem and suffixes are used as characteristics, without taking any grammatical or syntactical relations between the two components into account. Additional syntactic information can be used as characteristics for a general word-building task. These models can also be used for verbal conjugations and other morphological processing applications for agglutinative languages.
