We consider a multi-agent steering function in the following form: 1 Here, we assume that the xgoal point is sampled with a certain non-zero probability (e.g. 1%) to overcome the need to define the target as a region rather than a point."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS", "text": "In this section we evaluate experimentally the characteristics of the proposed extension of the multi-agent RRT * algorithm. We compare three RRT * -based algorithms - line RRT *, visibility diagram RRT * and ORCA RRT * with reactive ORCA. Experiments were performed on four types of 2d test environments - empty, door, cross and labyrinth environments (see Figure 2). All environments are limited by a fixed limit of 1000x1000. Comparative measures focus on the success rate of the algorithms and the quality of the solution for different environmental conditions. The measured parameters are: \u2022 Idealistic solution costs are the costs of a solution for which the CF function in Equation 1 is loosened in such a way that it disregards its first limitation, i.e. allows collisions between the agents. The idealistic (i.e. lower bound) solution costs is astideal = n = 1di."}, {"heading": "4.1 Benchmark set", "text": "The experiment was carried out using a benchmark set consisting of four environments as shown in Figure 2, with the number of agents varying from 2 to 10 and the body radii of the agents varying from 50 to 100. For each combination of environment, number of agents and agent radius, the benchmark set contains 10 different settings of the starting and destination positions of the agents, totaling 2160 benchmark scenarios. Since RRT * is a stochastic algorithm, we run the algorithm five times with different random seeds for each problem instance. Overall, the presented experimental results are based on 34560 rounds. The benchmark set was created by an algorithm that guarantees that there is exactly one collision cluster for each problem instance, i.e. the path-finding problem cannot be divided into non-colliding groups of agents, which would be easier to solve. This is guaranteed by adding the random start and target positions of the agent, i.e. the path-finding problem can only be divided between each agent and the other, if a shortest path and each agent occurs."}, {"heading": "4.2 Success rate", "text": "It is the time when all solutions above 5 are considered unsuccessful. In Figure 6, we consider all solutions above 2.5 to be unsuccessful. We can observe three significant phenomena."}, {"heading": "4.3 Suboptimality", "text": "Figure 7 and 8 shows the histograms of the ranks assigned to the run-time limitation algorithms of 5 and 1 seconds. Each algorithm is assigned a rank of 1 to 4 for each experiment according to its solution suboptimality compared to other algorithms. If two algorithms achieve the same sub-optimality, the ranks are assigned to them randomly. If an algorithm could not find a solution, its rank is 4th. We observe that the VisibilityGraph-RRT * algorithm has reached the lowest substance optimality for a given problem substance. Line-RRT * is slightly better due to its ability to scan the state space very quickly. ORCA algorithm reached the second rank and ORCA-RRT * always reached the first place in the majority of the problem ranges, while the difference between the 7 and the ARCA shows the best solution * the difference in the problem ranges."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we investigated the problem of finding coordinated pathways for holonomic agents in two-dimensional polygonal environments, a problem that is challenging due to its prohibitive complexity. We examined several RRT * -based algorithms for multi-agent coordinated pathfinding and a reactive approach to ORCA. We found that while both approaches have limited coverage of the problematic instance space, an approach that combines planning and reactive technology benefits both parts, thereby providing better coverage of the problem instance and higher quality of solvement.We call the new algorithm ORCA-RRT *. While RRT * -based algorithms often suffer from the exponential growth of government space and are therefore unable to solve cases with a high number of agents, the reactive part of ORCA-RRT * is able to solve this problem. On the other hand, reactive techniques are often unable to solve problems that contain minima local ones."}, {"heading": "6. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] B. de Wilde, A. W. ter Mors, and C. Witteveen.
