INTRODUCTION", "text": "Synthesis system for a particular natural language is the technology for translating or converting a particular typed or stored text input into its equivalent spoken waveform format. It is used to translate written information into acoustic information where it is more convenient, especially for mobile applications such as voice-controlled e-mails and messages, and also used to help visually impaired persons, so that the content of the screen is automatically read to a blind user. People in India frequently use Hindi language for communication as it is the most popular and most used language of all other local Indian languages, so it requires representation on the web as an expressive language. Unicode has made it possible to read and write over the web, but as it is a highly confusing language, which due to the presence of tight spellings (such as) Hindi word processing is an important issue to which considerable attention should be paid. This paper draws attention to the pre-processing of text by TS being made easier by adding Hindi text to it."}, {"heading": "2. NEED OF HINDI SPELLCHECKER", "text": "Hindi is the most common and popular language of all other Indian languages, so it is more advantageous for Indians to develop a TTS system in Hindi language. To develop a Hindi TTS, it is necessary to enter text in Hindi language, which is a highly confusing language, people with different levels of literacy or lower knowledge of Hindi are not allowed to enter Hindi text accurately or not easily identify errors [3]. Therefore, spell checking is a text correction solution. It is a program that identifies and corrects misspelled words in given input text, and various sources of Hindi input text are: Manually entered text Online Hindi Newspaper, Mail Online Hindi Books and Magazines Hindi WebsitesWith a reference to the above sources, text must be entered manually or extracted from the web, and errors may arise therein. Data that contain errors, errors, or errors are processed, or the data for further processing and synthesis will be inaccurate."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "The entire process of speech synthesis is divided into three major parts (Figure 2): 1) word preprocessing2) word processing3) synthesisThe first task of any text-to-speech system (TTS) is word preprocessing, which includes input text (entered manually or scanned from any online source) and spell checking (a program corrects misspelled words); next is word processing, which includes text standardization and normalization and grapheme to phoneme conversion; and the last is synthesis, which includes waveform generation."}, {"heading": "3.1 Text Input", "text": "Text that a user wants to convert into a speech signal is called text input. For Hindi-TTS, text input should be in Hindi, which can be typed in manually or extracted from an online source, but these sources may contain errors. For example, the above sentence comes from an online Hindi newspaper where words are misspelled and processing misspelled text results in incorrect phonetic information, which reduces the naturalness of synthetic language and thus provides a flexible solution to overcoming this spell checking problem."}, {"heading": "3.2 Spellchecker", "text": "A spell checker is a program to find misspelled words and notify the user of misspellings. Depending on the spell checker, the function can either automatically correct the word or allow the user to select from the list of predicted suggestions for misspelled words. The approach we used for spell checking is based on the dictionary, where we compared each word with a list of thousands of correctly spelled words to determine the approximate number of misspelled words. For example, in the example above, Hindi text entry has some erroneous words such as and can be corrected using dictionary-based spell checker. Now, corrected text is further processed and synthesized, resulting in a high-quality language."}, {"heading": "3.3 Text Normalization and Standardization", "text": "English is a globally recognized language, so it is preferred to convert Hindi language to standard language such as English using WX notation [5]. The problem occurs with the standardization of [6] abbreviations, symbols, numbers, etc. in Hindi. To overcome this problem, text normalization is a solution that typically involves identifying non-standard words such as abbreviations, symbols, and the extension of non-standard words in standard rendering without losing their contextual meaning as: Text input Hindi SpellcheckerText gives 400 entries, but it is not the same case with numbers.. 400 cArso. Since abbreviations and symbols are finite, [7] it is easy to normalize them by preparing an exception lexicon, but it is not the same case with numbers. It is not possible to prepare a lexicon for numbers because numbers have no boundaries and are pronounced differently in other contexts than:"}, {"heading": "3.4 Grapheme to Phoneme Conversion (G2P Conversion)", "text": "Grapheme is the smallest unit in the script similar to phoneme is the smallest unit in the language. In [8] Hindi, words are not pronounced in the same way as they are written to ensure naturalness in the language, it is necessary to convert graphs to phonemes in order to generate phonetic information. However, the biggest challenge for a high-quality language is the misalignment of phonemes to boundaries, such as:.,,,,,,,,,, AwazgaApkA pawazgaApkA pawazgSound of varies when place of changes. \"In word that occurs in between, as pronounced as (p), while in the language at the beginning it is as pronounced as,,,,,,,,, AwazgaApkA pawazgText, which is achieved mainly by manual, rule-based or statistical method. Manual approach is the most convenient approach, but for a living language like, Hindi becomes day-to-day rich, it is impossible to develop a statistical dictionary for single words."}, {"heading": "3.5 Waveform Generation", "text": "The final stage of the speech synthesis process is the generation of a speech waveform of phonetic text. We have created this waveform using the open source [10] MARY TTS tool, which follows an HMM-based approach. HMM-based approach, which is used for various applications such as online fraud detection [11] [12], text-to-speech systems, etc. This approach helps to produce a natural-sounding, high-quality speech. However, in order to construct human-looking speech machines, speech synthesis systems are required to be able to generate speech with the vocal characteristics of any speaker, different speech styles including native and non-native styles in different languages, different emphasis and concentration and / or emotional expressions."}, {"heading": "4. IMPLEMENTATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION", "text": "Based on the above approach, the correctness of the speech waveform directly depends on the correctness of the phonetic text, so we have shown the comparison between the correctness of the phonetic text with / without spell correction on the input text."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this article, we introduced the development of the existing TTS system by adding Hindi spell checking modules to it. Since Hindi is a morphologically rich language, and therefore there is a high probability of making mistakes in the writing of \"mantras,\" which leads to a deterioration in the quality of speech, spell checking is a solution. However, adding spell checking corrects most of the erroneous text, which leads to an increase in the accuracy of phonetic text and thus leads to a high quality / correct speech waveform."}, {"heading": "6.
