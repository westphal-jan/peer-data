Sentiment mining is a kind of text classification in which, messages are classified according to sentiment orientation such as positive or negative. This paper extends the idea of evaluating the performance of various classifiers to show their effectiveness in sentiment mining of online product reviews. The product reviews are collected from Amazon reviews. To evaluate the performance of classifiers various evaluation methods like random sampling, linear sampling and bootstrap sampling are used. Our results shows that support vector machine with bootstrap sampling method outperforms others classifiers and sampling methods in terms of misclassification rate.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Feb 2014 05:24:42 GMT  (45kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3891v1", "4 pages 2 tables, International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology, volume 4, Issue 6, june 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages 2 tables, International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology, volume 4, Issue 6, june 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["vinodhini g chandrasekaran rm"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.3891"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.3891.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Performance Evaluation of Machine Learning Classifiers in Sentiment Mining", "authors": ["G.Vinodhini", "RM.Chandrasekaran"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "Product No.of.review", "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before in the history of the city."}], "references": [{"title": "Opinion Observer: Analyzing and Comparing Opinions on the Web,\u201dProc", "author": ["B.
