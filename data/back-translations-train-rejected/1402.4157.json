We propose an approach that allows detection of collisions even between continuous, stochastic trajectories with the only restriction that means and covariances can be computed. To this end, we employ probabilistic bounds to derive criterion functions whose negative sign provably is indicative of probable collisions. For criterion functions that are Lipschitz, an algorithm is provided to rapidly find negative values or prove their absence. We propose an iterative policy-search approach that avoids prior discretisations and yields collision-free trajectories with adjustably high certainty. We test our method with both fixed-priority and auction-based protocols for coordinating the iterative planning process.

The module we will derive is guaranteed to make this decision correctly, based on knowledge of the moments of the first and second order of the trajectories alone. In particular, we will not make assumptions about the family of stochastic processes to which the trajectories belong. Since the required collision probabilities generally have to be expressed as non-analytical integrals, we will settle for a quick, conservative approach. That is, we are willing to tolerate a non-zero false-alarming rate as long as decisions can be made quickly and at a zero false-negative rate. Of course, for certain distributions and plant forms, solutions to the collision can be derived that are less conservative and therefore lead to faster terminations."}, {"heading": "2.1 Finding negative function values of Lipschitz functions", "text": "Suppose we get a continuous Lipschitz target function f: I \u2192 R with the Lipschitz constant L \u2265 0.

Unlike existing work, we did not have to rely on prior space or time discrediting, which was achieved by deriving criterion functions with the property that collision probability is guaranteed to be below a freely definable threshold. (0, 1) We described a general procedure for deriving criterion functions and presented two such functions based on Chebyshev-like boundaries. The advantage of using Chebyshev inequalities is their independence from the underlying distribution, so our approach is applicable to any stochastic state noise model for which the first two moments can be calculated in arbitrary time steps."}, {"heading": "A Derivations of the covariance and mean of the", "text": "The solution for the SDE dx (x \u2212 K), kD), B = diag (B = diag), B = diag (B = diag), B = diag (B = diag), D (t0, T), D (t0), D (t0), D (t0), D (t0), D (t0), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t), D (t)."}, {"heading": "B Deriving Lipschitz numbers", "text": "So far, we have determined how the knowledge of the Lipschitz number of a Lipschitz function can be used to detect possible functions to exclude the presence of negative function values in a compact range.

In addition to the Lipschitz-based method presented above, we will now consider an alternative method that requires a prior belief in the expected change of a character.
