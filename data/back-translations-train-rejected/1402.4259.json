Introduction", "text": "The analysis of the social network is relevant to several theoretical and applied sciences. Among them we find politics and management sciences [1-3], and all sciences based on the collection of information. Within its framework, some questions relating to subjects, objects, places, times and motivations are fundamental to having an action of actual situations. As in [4], these questions, which are usually mentioned in the news, such as the Five Ws (the, where, when and why), are the same literary scholars desire to answer after studying literary works. Any automatic text analysis, such as those we propose here, must determine what we expect to find in a novel or game, that is, the main characters about whom the work pivots, their interactions and also the motivations of their behaviors."}, {"heading": "2. Purpose of CHAPLIN", "text": "It is clear that such automation cannot be complete: a certain amount of human intervention is required for basic character and location recognition. (;) Another prerequisite for this tool is the support of letters in this task. (;) The first transformation to be done is the automatic extraction of a well-chosen subset of words appearing in T by means of a suitable function X, which splits each iC into individual words and puts them under a reasonable constraint, such as... \"take only words long as,\" \"take only capitalised words,\" \"compositions of the previous ones, and so on.\""}, {"heading": "3. Interface and output", "text": "We implemented CHAPLIN in VB.NET. Fig. 1 shows the user interface, including \u2022 basic commands - upper part of the window \u2022 raw word extraction commands (settings, button) - just below \u2022 lists to help the user select raw words in names \u2022 commands to create the DOT script (settings, button) - right part of the window; two separate thresholds for characters and places have been used for better performance. The output is a GV file written in the script language of the DOT diagram [9]. It can be rendered using the free open source software Graphviz [10]."}, {"heading": "4. An example: Das Nibelungenlied", "text": "In order to test the characteristics of CHAPLIN, we decided to edit the original version of the epic Das Nibelungenlied in its early German original text (Middle High German). The full text, freely available online [11], consists of 39 chapters (\u00c2ventiuren). Fig. 2 is the graph generated with the following values for the editing parameters: \u2022 Many secondary signs and places do not appear in the graphics. \u2022 The protagonist of the poem is Sigfried (S\u00eevrit), but he does not get the best score asscharacter; Hagen von Tronege does so because his action continues after he kills Sigfried. \u2022 The strongest connection connects Hagen with Tronege (the correspondence of this legendary city with a real place is still being discussed by the experts; Hagen von Tronege does so because his action is continued after he kills Sigfried. \u2022 The strongest connection connects Hagen with Tronege (the correspondence of this legendary city with a real place) [because] the elements of the epics of the word are constantly connected."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "CHAPLIN applies basic descriptive statistics and correlation concepts to the analysis of a literary text. The entire process is automated, with the exception of the phase in which human intervention is absolutely necessary. The result is an easy-to-read graph in which signs and places are represented as nodes and the narrative connection between them corresponds to an edge. The meaning of each character / place and the strength of each drawn connection are represented by a score ranging from 0 to 1. The name we gave to this software is clearly from Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin. The first version was published on February 7, 2014, exactly 100 years after the first appearance of Tramp (Charlot). It is then a tribute to one of the most relevant people of the seventh art."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2014, "abstractText": "We are proposing a tool able to gather information on social networks from narrative texts.
