INTRODUCTION", "text": "The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, we offer a practical implementation to find a preference profile for a particular Condorcet dimension by encoding the problem as a Boolean satisfaction problem (SAT) [2], which is then solved by a SAT solver. This technique has proven useful for a number of other problems in the theory of social choice (see e.g. [8, 6, 4, 3]) and can be easily customized. For example, few changes need to be made to answer similar questions for dominant sets, rather than Condorcet profit rates. Second, we give an answer to an open question by Elkind et al. [5] and provide a minimal example of a Condorcet dimension 3 preference profile, which we have calculated with our implementation. This profile comprises only 6 alternatives and agents, improving the size of previous examples both in relation to agents and alternatives. [1] Formalization in SAT turns out to be efficient enough to reveal a minimum profile, not only this specific dimension of Condorcet, but also its 3."}, {"heading": "2.

METHODOLOGY", "text": "The number of objects potentially involved in the CheckCondorcet-Dimension-k problem is in Table 1 for k = 3. It is immediately clear that a new algorithm will not solve the problem satisfactorily. In this section, our algorithmic efforts to solve this problem for relatively large instances are described."}, {"heading": "3.1 Translation to propositional logic (SAT)", "text": "It is indeed the case that it is a matter of a way in which people are able to determine themselves how they want to live.

It could be said that all positive witnesses of the SAT CheckCondorcet dimension k problem are invariant under permutations of the alternatives. Therefore, we have implemented a standard technique in the SAT solution, the so-called symmetry breaking, here in the form of the preferences of Agent 1 over a fixed preference order, for example over lexicographic preferences. This limits the search space for the SAT solver and thus reduces the runtime of the solving process. Coding can be achieved simply by adding a subformula of the form \u0433x < yr (n1, x, y), which specifies the preferences of the first agents in lexicographic order."}, {"heading": "4. INITIAL RESULTS", "text": "All calculations were carried out on an Intel Core i5, 2.66 GHz (quad-core) computer with 12 GB of RAM, using plingeling [1] by the SAT solver. When called with the parameters n = m = 6, our implementation of SAT-Check-Condorcet-Dimension-k delivers the preference profile Rdim3 within about a second. Rdim3 is a smallest preference profile of the Condorcet dimension 3 and is shown in Figure 2.5 Furthermore, this preference profile shows a smallest profile of the Condorcet dimension 3. All strictly smaller profiles (i.e. with fewer agents and at most as many alternatives or with fewer alternatives and at most as many agents) have a condorcet dimension of no more than 2 via SAT-Check-Condorcet-Check-3.6An overview of further (preliminary) results can be found in Table 2.5The witnesses for all sets, e.g. A, where a Dorncet size of maximum 2 can only be achieved by means of a condorcet-Check-SAT-only 3.6c."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This material is based on the work BR 2312 / 9-1 funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation).
