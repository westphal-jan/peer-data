We use the data collected by Singleton and Newport (2004) on the performance of a 7-year boy Simon, who mastered the American Sign Language (ASL) by learning it from his parents, both of whom were imperfect speakers of ASL.

Furthermore, the phenomenon of creolization of Pidgin languages has been studied (Andersen, 1983; Thomason & Kaufman, 1991; Sebba, 1997).Over the course of a generation, a language is created from a multilinguistically derived, limited communication system in which people have only rudimentary knowledge of each other's native tongue.

Suppose a rule has only two forms, form 1 and form 2. In each instance of time, the learner is characterized by two numbers, X1 \u2265 0 and X2 \u2265 0, each corresponding to the probability of using the corresponding form of the rule (we impose X1 + X2 > 0). Specifically, the probability that the learner will use the form 1 is given by X1 / (X1 + X2), and the probability of the learner to use the form 2 is given by X2 / (X1 + X2). You can see that if X1 = 0, then form 2 is always used (the learner's language is consistent with the corresponding rule). Likewise, in X2, only form 1 is used."}, {"heading": "3 Properties of the learning algorithm", "text": "An important application in our context is the consideration of a teacher-learner pair. In general, the teacher does not necessarily have to be a person, it could be a number of people, the only condition being that the statistics of the source do not change with time. To be more precise, we assume that the source is defined by non-negative numbers, namely 1,..., \u03bdM, with the probability that the source sends out each of the M forms of the rule. Thus, it can be assumed that the source is just an agent (whose values are \"frozen\" by Xi, i.e. not updated) or a collection of such non-updating agents. The situation with the teacher-learner pair can be used to model the language acquisition of a child by one or two parents and other adults whose language is frozen. In particular, it can be applied to the situation of Simon, who has only learned from his two parents."}, {"heading": "3.1 Analytical Results", "text": "Consider the case M = 2, or the two alternative forms of the rule. We refer to the probability of the source to use form 1; form 2 is used with probability 1 -2. The amplification algorithms described above are probabilities, that is, if the Markov chain is in state i / L, the probability that the learner will use form 1 can be i / L... 1, with the constant L appearing in the description of the algorithm, Section 2.2. The states are probabilities, i.e. if the Markov chain is in state i / L, the probability that the learner will use form 1 is i / L... 1, this chain being modeled by the distribution vector [X0, X1,..., XL] at any point in time where Xi represents the probability that the chain is in state i / L. The distribution vector is updated step by step by multiplying the transition matrix."}, {"heading": "3.2 Numerical Simulations", "text": "It is intuitive to talk about quantities, the increment of learning. This is the amount with which the probabilities change in each step, following the input of the source. The analytical results can be summarized as follows: M = 2 (the number of steps increases), the learner converts to a quasi-stationary state, in which he is characterized by the frequency of the form (3). This frequency is higher than the frequency of the source (the number of steps increases)."}, {"heading": "4 Applications: Simon", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "This paper presents a model that explains the frequency-enhancing effect observed in children when learning a language. It presents a simple amplification type algorithm that represents successful learning without the learner having any explicit innate biases. In the case of two forms of the rule, the promoting property of the algorithm has been analytically proven and demonstrated numerically for a greater number of forms. Convergence speed and its dependence on parameters and source complexity have also been studied. Finally, the results were discussed in the context of the Singleton & Newport study (2004) to show that the simple model is capable of explaining several key features of Simon's performance and learning behavior."}], "references": [{"title": "Pidginization and Creolization as Language Acqui", "author": ["R.W.
