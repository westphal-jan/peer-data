Note that we do not include the evaluation of the MaxSat Solver because we use a commercially available, previously investigated solver. We have evaluated the Activity Generator (KAR) and the Activity Details Generator (SNACS) separately, as described in the following sections. We use crowdsourcing to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in a comprehensive user study (200 subjects), also in AMT, but with a different pool of employees. We ensure that the subjects answer truthfully by including open test questions and manually checking before accepting the grades. We also estimate that conducting a survey should take 8-15 minutes, so that we filtered out forms completed in less than 4 minutes. Examples of these questionnaires can be found at http: / / aimamt.azurewebsites.net /."}, {"heading": "Activities Generation Evaluation", "text": "The purpose of this experiment is to verify the integrity and coherence of the activities of the scenario list after the exchange of any of their activities.Setup We chose to use the daily schedules that we have already collected from the set for DSA as the original scenario (without the activity details that will be evaluated next).We randomly created a section of 7-8 hours from each of the original activities list to which we refer as the original. We then randomly selected an activity to be replaced for the list. We generated three revised lists by replacing the selected activity, two of the lists were created using KAR algorithms, one with K = 1 and the other with K = 11, which we refer to as KAR K = 1 and KAR K = 11. The third random list was generated with a random substitute and was implemented as a baseline to ensure the validity of the experiment."}, {"heading": "Activity-Details Generation Evaluation", "text": "The purpose of this experiment is to verify the authenticity, integrity and coherence of the generated descriptive activities that accompany the revised scenarios. Setup We decided to evaluate four types of activities: see-a-movie, eat-at-a-restaurant, buy-food and drycleaning. For each activity, we generated 4 user profiles. Each activity detail was associated with its user profile and the AMT workers were randomly selected 4 additional activity details for each activity type. As before, we conducted the experiment using AMT questionnaires. Each activity detail was associated with its user profile and the AMT workers were evaluated (with the same 6 value as before) six aspects of activity details for each activity type."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The paper contains the following two key contributions: (i) This is the first paper to address the problem of modifying scenarios to generate personal information while maintaining consistency, even when generating different scenarios. (ii) It provides a methodology to use crowdsourcing in principle for this task. Instead of modifying scenarios manually, making the development process both time and resource intensive, we used the crowd as the source of our data set, thus reducing the effort required to maintain coherence in these scenarios. To accomplish this task, we use MaxSat's logical engine in combination with a novel approach to generating everyday scenarios using the crowd. Our review showed that our revised scenarios and the details of their activities were rated as reliable and consistent as the original scenarios and the details of the original activities, and also compared them with the details generated with the more expensive game engineering."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was partially supported by ERC grant No. 267523."}, {"heading": "Technologies for Interactive Digital Storytelling and", "text": "Entertainment, Springer (2006), 1-12.19.
