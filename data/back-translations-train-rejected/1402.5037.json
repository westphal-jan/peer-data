INTRODUCTION", "text": "Game-based learning has proven effective in a variety of contexts, including cultural learning [1]. However, as with any educational medium, differences in audience, context and representative medium require individual design considerations. This, in turn, poses a challenge in translating research findings that typically analyze the effectiveness of a single game into generalizable outcomes that can be incorporated into future designs. Section 2 describes, in addition to the specific challenges for the development of cultural competences, a number of assessment methodologies that are applied to digital learning games. This forms the basis for the framework proposed in Section 3, which seeks to reconcile the uniqueness of gameplay as a form of data collection with the need to provide validated research results that allow comparison with other forms of education. Application of this framework to the MASELTOV project is described in Section 4, along with an overview of the serious game developed and its role within the project."}, {"heading": "2. BACKGROUND", "text": "In fact, most people who are able, are able, are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want, are also able to determine for themselves, \"he told the German Press Agency in an interview with\" Welt am Sonntag \":\" I don't think we will be able to change the world. \""}, {"heading": "3. ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK", "text": "This section reflects the background of the previous section and proposes a valuation approach for digital games used to develop cultural competencies. First, it describes the two main objectives common to the interventions of reach and impact. Reach is considered in terms of the delivery and distribution of games, while Impact aims to consolidate the diversity of techniques identified in the previous section in order to provide a basis for proposing clear pathways that are suitable both for the development process of serious games and for the need to demonstrate effectiveness. Here, we consider two central assessment contexts: laboratory studies and deployment among end users. The latter raises a number of important ethical considerations, especially with regard to the informed consent mentioned in Section 3.3. The subsequent question, given that measures of reach and impact can be established, is how the research results can best be returned to both game authors to support the iterative development and the conclusions of the development and learning process itself based on Section 5 and the feedback of indicators."}, {"heading": "3.1 Reach", "text": "For games aimed at generating general awareness, this may be sufficient; in many cases, however, games target marginalized or decoupled demographic groups. Laboratory evaluation is unlikely to be representative of these groups, since they are less likely to be involved in the research process or opt for studies. Player base surveys are a potential way to gain a better understanding of the reach, and can be stimulated by in-game rewards such as content or collectibles. Correlation, for example, of reported zip codes to evidence of multiple discrimination can be a means of gaining an understanding of players \"socio-economic background without explicitly requiring a survey, although it must be conducted in an ethical manner that follows the principles outlined in Section 3.3. In the case of a game intended to allow immigrants to develop their cultural competences, as described in Section 4, it may also be possible to adjust the total number of users to the overall population."}, {"heading": "3.2 Impact", "text": "Section 2 illustrates the variety of methods by which the game has evolved. It means a clear distinction between the evaluations in the development phase, which aims to gain an understanding of the effects of the game."}, {"heading": "3.3 Ethical Considerations", "text": "While ethical principles and practices can be relatively easily adhered to in a laboratory environment, as the researcher has direct contact with the participants to ensure informed consent, research with online audiences can prove to be a more complex issue. Consensus information can be overlooked or \"clicked through\" in the desire for the player to experience the game, so one design requirement is that consent should be given in an opt-in manner, with the player able to fully verify the implications of his consent. Since games per se can provide incentives to play, there is also a risk that players will agree to access the game rather than in an informed and ethical manner. Therefore, another endorsement is that access to the game should be granted regardless of a player's consent to participate in the research process. In the case of cultural learning and skill development, members of the target group may also have limited language skills, and consent approaches should demonstrate awareness and support for communicating research goals and the implications of participating with those players."}, {"heading": "3.4 Implementation", "text": "Some final consideration should be given to how the nature of the design and delivery of a game can contribute to the application of the metrics referred to in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. Content distribution platforms such as Google Play increasingly allow developers to gain insight into their behavior not only by reaching a broad audience, but also by integrating metrics within the game engine. Taking into account the ethical considerations in Section 3.3, care should be taken to obtain informed consent, but if such mechanisms are in place, it is possible to quickly identify metrics of reach, such as the geographical distribution of players, and impacts, through actions such as game times. However, a more concrete demonstration of the impact in educational or behavioral terms may also require participants to report themselves or agree to have their performance monitored, where mobile platforms in particular can serve a useful purpose by allowing participants to report data on the go, and games can be a means of incentivising and maintaining participation in the research process by, for example, taking part in surveys."}, {"heading": "4. CASE STUDY I: MASELTOV", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to survive themselves are not able to survive themselves, \"he told the German Press Agency in an interview with\" Welt am Sonntag \":\" I don't think we will be able to change the world. \""}, {"heading": "5. CASE STUDY II: THE BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS OF ENERGY USE", "text": "The challenge is that people are able to decide for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Games provide a rich source of data for user interaction, and their use as research tools is well documented [27], although the need to better integrate the evaluation process into the game as described in Section 2 is only one potential approach. An alternative technique is to record information in a form suitable for externalized analysis, which requires a rich data collection that can be implemented into the game, with users \"interactions ranging from individual touch interactions on a mobile device to overarching information such as content preferences and deployment times. This has an appeal from a researcher's perspective, as it has the potential to access data collected during the game to a wide range of analytical tools and techniques. In such an approach, the requirement is not for evaluation to be incorporated into the game as a whole, but for the externalized data to be used to generate feedback that is either communicated through the game itself, or through a broader, mixed learning approach."}, {"heading": "7.
