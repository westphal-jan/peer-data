In such simulators, the virtual agent must be capable of representing and reasoning about the user's mental state based on social cues that inform the system about his/her affects and social attitude. In this paper, we propose a formal model of Theory of Mind (ToM) for virtual agent in the context of human-agent interaction that focuses on the affective dimension. It relies on a hybrid ToM that combines the two major paradigms of the domain. Our framework is based on modal logic and inference rules about the mental states, emotions and social relations of both actors. Finally, we present preliminary results regarding the impact of such a model on natural interaction in the context of job interviews simulation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Feb 2014 15:40:08 GMT  (102kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5043v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marwen belkaid", "nicolas sabouret"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.5043"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.5043.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A logical model of Theory of Mind for virtual agents in the context of job interview simulation", "authors": ["Marwen Belkaid", "Nicolas Sabouret"], "emails": ["marwen.belkaid@ensea.fr", "nicolas.sabouret@limsi.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Categories and Theme Descriptions I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Intelligent AgentsGeneral Conceptual Theory, ExperimentationTags Mind Theory, Cognitive Models, Logic-Based Approaches, Human-Agent Interaction, Affective Computing, Serious Games for Inclusion"}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION AND POSITIONING", "text": "Over the past decade, several projects have proposed using smart virtual agents in digital games to empower users [19, 22, 23, 2, 5]. The work presented in this paper looks at the use of virtual agents in simulation games for the young unemployed, also known as NEETs1. However, recent research shows that NEETs often lack self-confidence and improve their social skills. Indeed, it is already proven that training in job interviews with a virtual agent could improve performance [17]. The role of the virtual agent in such training games is to be able to react in a coherent manner: based on non-verbal inputs (smiles, emotion expressions, body movements)."}, {"heading": "2.

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW", "text": "Our ToM reasoning architecture consists of two main components, as illustrated in Figure 1. The mental states of the agent contain beliefs, attitudes, goals, and intentions. Beliefs represent knowledge of general facts, rules of the world (i.e., sound knowledge from theory), and mental states of the self or other (i.e., attributed mental states). Attitudes represent assessments of the current state and thus desires (what the agent wants to be true in the future), and ideals (what the agent always wants to be true). Goals and intentions form the advisory aspect limited to immediate actions. The agent's follow-up machine consists of three parts. Popular psychological reasoning is responsible for generating intent (according to the agent's beliefs and attitudes) and updating the mental state. The role of common sense is to enrich the agent's beliefs by basing rules and facts of common sense."}, {"heading": "4.

All subjects were over 24 years old, had attended university and were familiar with computers. 18 of the participants are native speakers and the rest have at least an intermediate level. As we are not interested in verbal communication, this is enough for the participants to understand what the recruiter is saying. The recruiter's comments were presented in a very simple graphical user interface (GUI). The value of the recruiter's affective state and his / her running time assessment of the candidate's self-confidence, motivation and qualification (values in [-1.1]) were displayed by scrollbars. A text field allows the subject to type his / her answer to the virtual recruiter's questions. In addition, a series of 8 slider controls (values in [0.1]) give them the opportunity to express their affective states to the recruiter as a combination of focussed questions (Ease Factors: 4B)."}, {"heading": "6.2 Results", "text": "The Shapiro-Wilks test shows that none of our measures follows a normal distribution.

It is not only difficult to model, but also to assess. Therefore, a simple protocol such as the one we used in this study is not sufficient to fully assess the impact of our ToM model on the quality of training. Firstly, the GUI we use is not user-friendly and does not allow the user to be involved in the scenario. We assume that using the full TARDIS project [2] would increase the credibility of interaction and help highlight the reasoning and reactivity of the virtual agent. Furthermore, the evaluation process should be based on richer metrics (e.g. a thorough post-hoc questionnaire) to evaluate the impact of our model. Nevertheless, such a specific evaluation protocol for affective and interaction-oriented actions would emphasize the results of the virtual agent."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION & PERSPECTIVES", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed an affective and interaction-oriented Theory of Mind model to support the development of intelligent agents capable of representing and reflecting the mental states of their human interlocutors. It is based on a hybrid approach that combines theory theory and simulation theory paradigms. This model is domain independent, meaning that it can potentially be used in a different application context, including social coaching. It has been implemented and evaluated in the context of the job application simulation, in which the virtual recruiter evaluates both the human candidates based on their affective responses and reacts emotionally according to their wishes and ideals.This study shows the impact of implementing different recruitment profiles on the efficiency of the system. Furthermore, the explanatory capacity of our argumentation model is a key feature for users to benefit from rich post-interview feedback."}, {"heading": "8. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] C. Adam, A.

In this paper, we propose a formal model of Theory of Mind (ToM) for virtual agent in the context of human-agent interaction that focuses on the affective dimension. It relies on a hybrid ToM that combines the two major paradigms of the domain. Our framework is based on modal logic and inference rules about the mental states, emotions and social relations of both actors. Finally, we present preliminary results regarding the impact of such a model on natural interaction in the context of job interviews simulation.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
