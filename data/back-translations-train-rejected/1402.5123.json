Since then, \"Opinion Mining\" has become an important concern for any company that wishes to better understand the preferences and dislikes of its customers, relying on the opinions of those who want to compare the products before they buy them. Thus, Morinaga et al. [11] explain how they verify the reputation of the target products by analyzing the criticism of the customers. First, they access the websites that discuss the product in question and extract the sentences that express the opinion. Subsequently, they classify the sentences according to whether they express a negative opinion or a positive opinion and derive the popularity of the product from it. In this context, Turney [13] divided the comments into two categories, namely, and did not recommend them."}, {"heading": "CREATION OF THE LEXICONS OF OPINION", "text": "This method requires the creation of one or more opinion dictionaries. Three methods can be used to create such dictionaries:"}, {"heading": "Manual Method", "text": "Regardless of the method of constructing the lexicon, a first stage of manual classification is necessary. Corpora-based method It completes the lexicon of opinions and consists of the use of coordinating conjunctions that exist between an already classified word and an unclassified word [4], [5], [8]. For example, if a conjunction AND a positively classified word in the lexicon of opinions separates from an unclassified word, then the unclassified word is considered positive. On the contrary, if the conjunction BUT separates a positive classified word and an unclassified word, then the unclassified word is considered negative. The conjunctions that are used are as follows: AND, OR, BUT, EHER, NEHER and an unclassified word determined on the basis of SITOS [SITO]."}, {"heading": "APPROACHES BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING", "text": "In these approaches, words are usually regarded as equivalent variables, so that the semantic aspect is not taken into account. Monitored classification methods are most commonly used to classify opinions. These methods consist of building a classification model based on samples. Samples are data whose class we already know. In this case, we refer to classified or labeled data."}, {"heading": "HYBRID APPROACHES", "text": "Different types of hybridization methods are discussed in the literature, using all the elements described in the two previous approaches. To these approaches, we can distinguish three different methods, namely: Linguistics in the Service of Machine Learning; Machine Learning in the Service of Linguistics; A fusion a posteriori of the results of the two approaches."}, {"heading": "PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "In our approach, we used two techniques, namely supervised training, which is represented by the Bayesian probabilistic model, and the SO, which is represented by the Turney algorithm."}, {"heading": "SUPERVISED TRAINING (BAYESIAN ALGORITHM)", "text": "In an abstract way, the probabilistic model is a conditional model for a Bayesian classifier. It is based on the Bayes rule, which reads as follows: The probability that event A is given is determined by the relationship between the probability of having given the event B1,......, Bn events, and the probability that B1,.........., Bn has occurred. As long as the denominator does not depend on event A, we can consider the probability P (B1... Bn) to be constant. The counter can still be written as follows: The decomposition of P (A, B1... Bn) ends when we traverse the totality of the B1... Bn classes. The \"naive\" character of this theorem is due to the fact that we assume the independence of the different classes Bi."}, {"heading": "BY SEMANTIC ORIENTATION (TURNEY ALGORITHM)", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into a different world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live."}, {"heading": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "CONSTITUTION OF CORPUS", "text": "Despite the research we have done, we could not find a corpus of tweets (all corpus on the net are not free) and, as a result, we have collected various tweets that come from a corpus. To do this, we followed the following steps: Selection of tweets For the collection of tweets, we have a Java API (Application Programming Interface) called \"Twitter4J 'Twitter4J allows access to the Twitter database to recover / post information. The API is divided into four classes: SEARCH: allows to ask Twitter to restore simple data, primarily tweets. REST: advanced extension of SEARCH, which provides access to advanced functionalities of Twitter, such as users, followers to see the status, publish information on its account, etc. STREAMING: allows communication with Twitter in streaming mode. The advanced function of the API is that it allows access to large amounts of Twitter data and access to those websites are limited by the functions of the websites."}, {"heading": "TREATMENT PROCESS", "text": "(1) Corpus to be treated -- Here the tweets on Twitter are collected on the basis of the specified research request and the filters within a specified date.
