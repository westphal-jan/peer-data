They enable efficient sharing of geographically distributed resources and expand the boundaries of what we perceive as distributed computing. Different sciences can benefit from the use of networks to solve CPU-intensive problems, thereby creating potential benefits for the entire society. Workstation planning is an integrated component of parallel and distributed computing systems. It enables the selection of the correct allocation of resources for a particular job, thus increasing job throughput and resource utilization. Workstation planning should be automatic to make the system more reliable, accessible and less vulnerable to subsystem failures. This paper provides an overview of various heuristic algorithms used for planning on the net.Keywords: computer networks, workplace planning, heuristic algorithms."}, {"heading": "1.

Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we presented an overview of current trends and applications of heuristic algorithms in the field of Grid Scheduling Problem. An application that requires high cost resources that need to be managed and shared requires particular attention in the Grid Environment. In the large Grid, work scheduling provides appropriate solutions for resource management. The Grid Scheduling Problem involves the simultaneous optimization of multiple goals, including completion time, resource utilization, QoS metrics, costs, reliability factors, etc. Some heuristic methods discussed in this paper have been used to optimize this problem and have achieved some good results."}], "references": [{"title": "An ant algorithm for balanced job scheduling in grids, Future Generation", "author": ["Ruay-Shiung Chang", "Jih-Sheng Chang", "Po-Sheng Lin"], "venue": "Computer Systems", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2009}, {"title": "RASA: A New Grid Task Scheduling Algorithm International Journal of Digital Content Technology and its Applications", "author": ["Saeed Parsa", "Reza Entezari-Maleki"], "venue": "Volume 3, Number", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Zhuan-Hong, An IPSO algorithm for grid task scheduling based on satisfaction", "author": ["HU Xu-Huai", "OUYANG Jing-Cheng", "YANG Zhi-He", "CHEN"], "venue": "rate, International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Chompoo-inwai, An Improved Genetic Algorithm with Limited Iteration for Grid Scheduling", "author": ["Hao Yin", "Huilin Wu", "Jiliu Zhou", "Abdul Hanan Abdullah", "Chai"], "venue": "The Sixth International Conference on Grid and Cooperative Computing(GCC", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2007}, {"title": "U.R.Dhepthie and S.N.Sivanandam, Grid Scheduling Using Enhanced Ant Colony Algorithm ICTACT", "author": ["P.
