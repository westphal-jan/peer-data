In this thought experiment, we consider how the subjective experience of the brain would change. Although there are challenging problems such as the smooth linkage with existing neural tissue, it is a scientifically plausible thought experiment, which is also discussed in detail in [Russell and Norvig, 1995, Section 26.4]. Moravec suggests that nothing would change in terms of conscious experience in his book. Marvin Minsky has written in a similar manner while discussing whether machines can be conscious Minsky [1991]. He produces an argument similar to Wittgenstein's thought experiment: Since a brain simulation is supposed to be functionally equivalent, would their utterances be complete, and the brain simulation would claim consciousness and why should we think?"}, {"heading": "3 Naturalist theories of experience", "text": "An often underestimated theory of experience is panpsychism, the view that all matter has mental properties. It is wrongly assumed by some that panpsychism is necessarily incompatible with physicalism, but this is far from a foregone conclusion. Strawson has recently claimed that physicalism brings with it panpsychism Strawson [2006]. We must also mention the view of panexperimentalism: this experience is in every physical system, but not everything is a conscious mind, because that requires additional cognition. Panpsychism is also proposed as a permissible philosophical interpretation of human AI experience in Goertzel [2011]. Why is this standpoint (of panpsychology) significant? The evidence from psychedelic drugs and anesthesia implies that the change in brain chemistry also modifies experience. If experience changes, what can we attribute to the fact that the fundamental compatibility changes, or chemical interactions are actually part of the human experience?"}, {"heading": "4 The debate", "text": "On the one hand, AI researchers like Minsky and Moravec seem to believe that the simulation of a brain simply works and experience remains unchanged compared to the original brain. On the other hand, skeptics like Searle and Penrose do everything they can to deny the \"consciousness\" of bad machine children. Although both Searle and Penrose are purported physicists, they are not afraid to look for almost magical events to explain the experience. However, puns are unlikely to help us much. We need a good scientific theory of when and how experience occurs. The best theory will have to be induced by experimental neuroscience and related facts, which is the most basic criterion for judging whether the theory of experience is scientifically sound."}, {"heading": "5 Asking the question in the right way", "text": "The question is whether a certain whole brain simulation will have an experience, and if so, how similar that experience is to a human experience. However, we wonder which physical states are part of the human experience. We do not think that this is something special, but that the mitochondrial functions within the neurons, or DNA, are part of the experience of pan-experientialism. We wonder which physical states are part of the human experience."}, {"heading": "6 Neural code vs. neural states", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want to do and what they want to do."}, {"heading": "7 Simulation and transcoding experience", "text": "In this case, it is a case of some sort of unforeseen event that has taken place in recent years."}, {"heading": "7.1 General physicalist perspective", "text": "At this point, since we have no conclusive scientific evidence, this is just guesswork, and I will give conservative answers. Question 1: If certain biochemical interactions are indispensable for the functions of emotions and sensations (such as pleasure), then their simulation would not adequately lead to a definitive loss of functional accuracy. B would not function in the same way as A. This is true even if spike traits and changes in neural organization (plasticity) are simulated right elsewhere. It is also unknown whether we can simulate at a higher level, for example, by artificial neural networks that abstract the physiological properties altogether and only use numbers and arrows to represent a possible Izhikevich and Edelman. It is important to know that B is not lacking in significant cognitive functions of A, such as emotions."}, {"heading": "7.2 Pan-experientialist perspective", "text": "It is my hope that the reader will realize that pan-experiencialism is in fact the simplest theory of experience that is consistent with our observations that any physical system can have the potential to experience, regardless of the confusion surrounding the theory. Let's assume that the theory is correct. Then, if we ask a physicist to quantify this, she could measure the energy or amount of computation or communication or the information content or heat depending on what works best. A general characterization of the experience that would exist for any physical system can be precisely defined and can be part of experiments. It would seem to me that the best characterization would then use information theory because experience would not matter if it did not contain information. For example, an experience without information could not contain images or words. I suggest that we use such methods to clarify these finer questions. Let's take the physical version of pan-experiencialism, I can try to give the answers above."}, {"heading": "7.3 Further concerns", "text": "One can also imagine other more subtle questions that are sorely needed, because our ability to analyze is limited if we cannot ask the right questions. If we grapple with superstitious questions forever, we will never have begun to answer our question.

Therefore, according to ordinary philosophical theories of the \"mind,\" I go no further than the neuro-physiological theory of identity, which is a way of saying that your mind is literally the events that happen in your brain. Instead of being something other than a soul, a mind or a spirit, the reader may also have noticed that I did not use the word \"qualia\" because of its somewhat confused connotations. I was referring to the quality of the experience one can think about. For all the qualities that can be distinguished in this beautiful experience of having a mind, some of them may even be luxurious; and that is precisely why I used the word \"quality\" instead of \"qualia\" or \"quale.\" I do not think that the notion that it is a biological similarity is a confusing notion."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Thanks to Ben Goertzel for his detailed comments, which have improved the article considerably."}], "references": [{"title": "Quantum Theory, the Church-Turing Principle and the Universal Quantum Computer", "author": ["D.
