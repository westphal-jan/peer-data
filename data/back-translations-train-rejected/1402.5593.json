RELATED WORK", "text": "A similar approach is already being investigated on three sets of data - a zero-sum game of mixed strategies, an ultimatum game, and repeated social guessing game [21], [22]. Deterministic regularities have been identified for these data sets that exceed the most modern models. It has been shown that some regularities can be easily verbalized, underscoring their plausibility. A very comprehensive collection of work in experimental psychology and economics on human behavior in general games can be found in [23]. The concept of quantum response equilibrium has become popular as a model for deviations from equilibrium [24]. It is a parameterized shift between mixed strategic equilibrium and an equal distribution. The basic idea for the equilibrium of quantum responses is the concept of the trembling hand - people make mistakes with a certain probability. Unfortunately, the Akaike information criterion [25] is rarely calculated to assess the trade between adaptation quality and model complexity."}, {"heading": "III. GIFT-EXCHANGE-GAME", "text": "Since Akerloff and Yellen have published their leading paper [27] on unemployment, Gift Exchange Games (GEG) have become the standard for modeling labor relations. Such a game involves at least two players - an \"employer\" and an \"employee.\" The \"employer\" must first decide whether to grant a higher salary or not. Then, the \"employee\" must decide whether to make additional efforts or not. Unfortunately, the experiment conducted by Ga \ufffd chter et al. has not implemented a real task \u00a3. The \"employee\" does not make a real effort, but can decide to give a gift that reduces his / her own profit. Nevertheless, this game is not a zero sum. For what it is worth, real tasks are already established in experimental economics - in works by Ariely, for example [28]. Therefore, we refuse to draw any conclusions from the behavior in the experiment and determine behavior in real labor relations. The \"employer\" becomes an author of the game and \"successor to the worker\" if the one is named."}, {"heading": "IV. DATASET", "text": "123 subjects participated in the game - 84 for the sequential case and 39 for the simultaneous case. 1233 = 41 authors made 41 \u00b7 2 = 82 decisions - two 2-player games per author. Followers were asked to submit their decisions for any combination of observable decisions of others. There are 4 decision combinations for one author. The first followers in the sequential case submitted 4 \u0445 843 = 112 and all followers in the simultaneous case submitted 4 \u0445 2 \u0445 393 = 104 decisions. The second followers in the sequential case submitted 4 \u0445 843 = 448 decisions. Therefore, we have a data set of a total of 746 human decisions."}, {"heading": "V. ASSUMPTION OF DETERMINISM", "text": "Modeling human behavior outside the game with human subjects should not be confused with artificial player prediction algorithms. On the contrary, artificial players can manipulate the predictability of human subjects through their own behavior. For example, an artificial player who always throws \"stone\" in Roshambo would succeed in predicting a human opponent who always throws \"paper\" in response. Otherwise, if an artificial player maximizes his profit based on modeling the opponent, he would have to face and deal with a change in human behavior. This case is more complex than a viewer's prediction model for a \"human-only\" interaction. This work is limited to modeling behavior without involvement. Human behavior can be modeled either as deterministic or as non-deterministic. Although human subjects fail to generate truly random sequences, as required by mixed strategies, balance models are particularly to deal with uncertainties models."}, {"heading": "VI. NOMINAL, ORDINAL OR NUMERIC", "text": "There are essentially three categories in which variables can be classified - nominal, ordininal, and numerical. Nominal variables assume values from a finite set that has no order. Ordinary variables are like nominal plus order relations from the set of values. Numerical variables assume real numbers R as values. Ordinary variables can be projected into numerical values on the assumption of their distribution along the numerical axis. In contrast, nominal variables that influence human action can be actions of other actors. Since the assumption of human preferences over results has no basis, no order relationship over actions can be assumed. In the problem addressed, all variables that affect human action are actions of others. Preferences over the results in the previously described GEG cannot be assumed. For example, since the results (.4,.6) and (1.4,.1) (0.7, \u00a3) can be considered truthful, they cannot even be injected into the numbers."}, {"heading": "VII. RESULTS", "text": "The two decisions of the originator are nominal or rather Boolean decisions - it is either a gift > gift or not. On average, originator gift in 36.6% of the samples. We calculate kappa [30], [31] to measure the inter-rater agreement between these two decisions. Having zero kappa as a null hypothesis, the importance of the measured kappa can be calculated. Tab.I shows significant fair agreement between the two decisions of the originator in the sequential case. There is no significant agreement between them in the simultaneous case. Unfortunately, the data are too marginal and Fishers test [32] shows no significant difference between the frequencies in both cases - p-value is sequential. We can at least claim that both decisions are dependent in the sequential case. Tab.II shows absolute statistics for the decisions of the successor who does not observe another pendant. Besides own gift gift gift gift gift gift gift gift gift gift pendant, there is the gift gift gift following from the other gift."}, {"heading": "VIII. ON P-HACKING", "text": "Although the p-value has never been considered an objective criterion for proving or refuting a hypothesis, many researchers misunderstand it and perform what is known as \"p-hacking\" on the data in order to archive significant outcomes. The results obtained by p-hacking may not be reproducible, since the a-priori probabilities of the hypotheses have to be taken into account. For example, if the hypothesis is a long shot and has an a a priori probability of 5%, a p-value of 0.01 increases the probability of its validity to only 30%. The more hypotheses tested for p-value, the higher the probability of reaching a p-value below 0.05. Obviously, the difference between long shots and good bets is derived from the expert knowledge of the researcher, which is known not to exist in the case of a pure data scientist analyzing human data."}, {"heading": "IX. FUTURE WORK", "text": "Unfortunately, there is no online portal where most data sets are offered in a common format, which is a problem that we will address in the future. As in the field of bioinformatics, common formats are an important part of an interdisciplinary research infrastructure and are needed to accelerate progress. [35] As regards methodological aspects of machine learning in the context of experimental economics, we would like to use the advanced methods of pattern mining for economic game data analysis. For example, in papers [36] [37], attempts have been made to use sequential patterns and similarity dependencies of pattern structures for the behavioral analysis of video players, especially sequential attribute dependencies could be a tool of choice. We will try to apply sequential pattern mining methods in a supervised task where the outcome of a game (or round) is a goal attribute [38], [39] to see which better patterns of user behavior represent not only based on a general description but also on human knowledge."}, {"heading": "X. CONCLUSION", "text": "First, the average non-gift frequency is only 69% in the one-shot GEGs studied, a far cry from the 100% that a selfish payout assumption would predict, but also above 50% in almost all cases, where it is impossible to create valid non-trivial deterministic models of human behavior without having access to the hidden variables that determine the choice. It is only when the first follower receives a gift in the following case that the frequency of gifts increases slightly above 50%. Although the decision of the first follower does not depend at all on the choices of the creators, the decisions of the creators subsequently depend on each other. Obviously, the order between the players provides one reason why the first follower does not take into account differences in gifts."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors would like to thank Martin Sefton for the kind response and data transfer, the people who provided the Weka library [40] for their wonderful work, and Minato Nakazawa for the fmsb package."}], "references": [{"title": "Maxton, The end of progress : how modern economics has failed us", "author": ["P.
