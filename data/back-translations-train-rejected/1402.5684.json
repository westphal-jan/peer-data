In order to define the functional neighbourhood, the similarities between the time series recorded for voxels are measured and functional connectivity matrices are constructed. Then, the local mesh for each voxel is formed by including the functionally closest neighbouring voxels in the mesh. The relationship between the voxels within a mesh is estimated by using a linear regression model. These relationship vectors, called Functional Connectivity aware Local Relational Features (FC-LRF) are then used to train a statistical learning machine. The proposed method was tested on a recognition memory experiment, including data pertaining to encoding and retrieval of words belonging to ten different semantic categories. Two popular classifiers, namely k-nearest neighbour (k-nn) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are trained in order to predict the semantic category of the item being retrieved, based on activation patterns during encoding.

INTRODUCTIONSeveral methods have been developed to understand how the brain processes information. One, in particular, aims to predict or decode the state of the brain, and / or the type of information associated with cognitive processes, based on distributed patterns of activation in the brain, acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using various machine learning methods [1] - [9]. One of the main motivations of this study is to propose a model for the pattern analysis of fMRI data relating to various cognitive states recorded using statistical learning theory. This representation involves understanding, manipulating and predicting the behavior of the very complex nature of the human brain. Massive coupled dynamic brain interactions on many scales cannot be fully understood by showing the measurements recorded by the individual vocabularies. Therefore, there is a growing interest in growing interspatial use of the brain."}, {"heading": "II.

FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN THE BRAIN", "text": "The estimated LRF vectors, which represent relations between voxels in the same neighbourhood system, have a high discriminatory power compared to individual voxel intensity values. Consequently, the mesh learning algorithm proposed by [22] works better than the known individual voxel-based algorithms (see also Table III). However, using the Euclidean distance to form the neighbourhood system may not fully imply activation patterns in the brain, where the spatially distant neurons may have functional connectivity. \"Nearest\" neighbourhood in the mesh model implies a spatial environment of the seed vox when euclidean is used, which may not be the case during cognitive processing. Furthermore, it is known that spatially distant voxels are strongly coupled during cognitive processes [26]. Therefore, the use of euclidean distance to define neighbourhoods to define voxels may have a partial effect on the matrix function, resulting in a partial improvement in the mesh arches."}, {"heading": "A. Functional Connectivity", "text": "Considering the time series of voxels, where t = (t1, t2, \u00b7 \u00b7, tN) is the time vector whose variables are consecutive points in time, functional connectivity is defined as a measure of the \"similarity\" between the time series of these voxels. Voxels are considered functionally connected if they exhibit \"similar\" functional properties. Therefore, functional connectivity depends on the measure of similarity. \"similarity\" can be measured, for example, by estimating the correlation or covariance between time series pairs. Functional connectivity is intended to capture patterns of deviation between distributed and often spatially distant regions in the brain [27] and construct them by means of an interregional analysis."}, {"heading": "B. Functional Connectivity Graph", "text": "In order to represent functional connectivity in the brain, we define a graph G = (V, E), where V = {\u03d1j} Mj = 1 is the set of nodes (vertices) and E = {ejk} Mj, k = 1 is the set of edges. In this representation, a node corresponds to a time series, as well as (t, s, j), which is measured on a single voxel, and an edge between \u03d1j and \u03d1k is represented as ejk = \u03c1jk. In this study, edges in the functional connectivity graph are represented by symmetrical measures of dependence between time series of voxel signals (t, s, j), j = 1, 2, 3,. In this study, edges in the functional connectivity graph are represented by symmetrical measures of dependence in the time domain. It has been suggested that correlation-based measures are well suited for functional connectivity analysis [28]."}, {"heading": "C. Local Patches", "text": "The construction of a functional connectivity graph by treating all voxels as individual nodes leads to scalability problems. To reduce computational complexity, the voxels are first clustered in relation to their locations, with each cluster referred to as a local patch. Then, the functional connectivity graph for the voxels in each local patch is built with the size \u03c0, for example. This approach reduces the computational complexity from O (M2) to O (C\u03c02), where M is the number of voxels and C is the number of local patches. Note that \u03c0 M is constructed in the experiments by compiling the entire dataset D = {1, 2, 3,.., i = N, j = 1, 2, 3,.., M, using the spatial distance of voxels, s, yj, zj)."}, {"heading": "IV.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this study, we propose a new method of machine learning, called Functional Mesh Learning, to classify cognitive processes based on distributed patterns of neuronal activation patterns in the brain. In the current dataset, the model was tested and successfully performed during the memory process. The proposed method uses functional connectivity to define local networks that represent the relationships between the voxels and their p-functionally closest neighbors. Our goal is to be able to model cognitive processes based on distributed patterns of brain activation patterns in the brain. Our results suggest that the proposed Functional Mesh Learning model can be used to classify cognitive states and information types represented during these cognitive operations based on distributed patterns of brain activation.In the current study, we focused only on modeling memory coding and retrieval processes to enhance the cognitive properties of the cognitive algorithms, while future research would extend these findings to include more general cognitive algorithms."}], "references": [{"title": "Training fMRI Classifiers to Detect Cognitive States across Multiple Human Subjects", "author": ["X.

distributed patterns of neural activation in the brain, acquired via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the proposed learning method, local meshes are formed around each voxel. The distance between voxels in the mesh is determined by using a functional neighbourhood concept. In order to define the functional neighbourhood, the similarities between the time series recorded for voxels are measured and functional connectivity matrices are constructed. Then, the local mesh for each voxel is formed by including the functionally closest neighbouring voxels in the mesh. The relationship between the voxels within a mesh is estimated by using a linear regression model. These relationship vectors, called Functional Connectivity aware Local Relational Features (FC-LRF) are then used to train a statistical learning machine. The proposed method was tested on a recognition memory experiment, including data pertaining to encoding and retrieval of words belonging to ten different semantic categories. Two popular classifiers, namely knearest neighbour (k-nn) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are trained in order to predict the semantic category of the item being retrieved, based on activation patterns during encoding. The classification performance of the Functional Mesh Learning model, which range in 62% \u2212 71% is superior to the classical multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) methods, which range in 40%\u2212 48%, for ten semantic categories.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
