The manual development of such knowledge is a tedious and error-prone task, thus event-based applications may benefit from automated knowledge construction techniques, %developed in the field of machine learning. such as Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), which combines machine learning with the declarative and formal semantics of First-Order Logic. However, learning temporal logical formalisms, which are typically utilized by logic-based Event Recognition systems is a challenging task, which most ILP systems cannot fully undertake. In addition, event-based data are usually massive and collected at different times and under various circumstances. Ideally, systems that learn from temporal data should be able to operate in an incremental mode, that is, revise prior constructed knowledge in the face of new evidence. Most ILP systems are batch learners, in the sense that in order to account for new evidence they have no alternative but to forget past knowledge and learn from scratch. Given the increased inherent complexity of ILP and the volumes of real-life temporal data, this results to algorithms that scale poorly. In this work we present an incremental method for learning and revising event-based knowledge, in the form of Event Calculus programs. The proposed algorithm relies on abductive-inductive learning and comprises an scalable clause refinement methodology, based on a compressive summarization of clause coverage in a stream of examples. We present an empirical evaluation of our approach on real and synthetic data from a video surveillance application.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Feb 2014 21:22:51 GMT  (449kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5988v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Nov 2014 13:24:29 GMT  (347kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5988v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["nikos katzouris", "alexander artikis", "george paliouras"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.5988"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.5988.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Incremental Learning of Event Definitions with Inductive Logic Programming", "authors": ["Nikos Katzouris", "Alexander Artikis", "George Paliouras"], "emails": ["nkatz@iit.demokritos.gr", "a.artikis@iit.demokritos.gr", "paliourg@iit.demokritos.gr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Nikos Katzouris National Centre for Scientific Research \"Demokritos\" and National University of Athens E-mail: nkatz @ iit.demokritos.grAlexander Articis University of Piraeus and National Centre for Scientific Research \"Demokritos\" E-mail: a.artikis @ iit.demokritos.grGeorge Paliouras National Centre for Scientific Research \"Demokritos\" E-mail: paliourg @ iit.demokritos.grar Xiv: 140 2.59 88v2 [cs.LG] 2 2N ov2 01"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it will be able to take the lead, in the way that it has in the past: in the way that it has in the past, and in the way that it has in the past, and in the way that it has in the past, and in the way that it has in the past, and in the way that it has in the present of the past of the past."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "We assume that it is a subfield of machine learning based on logical facts."}, {"heading": "3 Event Calculus and Machine Learning for Event Recognition", "text": "It is a formalism that has been successfully applied in many areas to grasp real numbers, i.e. properties that have certain values in time; and events that occur in time can have an effect on another level, i.e., they can affect their truths and change their value.

To achieve this goal, we had to implement XHAIL because the original implementation was not publicly available until recently (Bragaglia and Ray, 2014).All the experiments were conducted on a 3.2 GHz Linux machine with 4 GB of RAM. The algorithms were implemented in Python, with the Clingo5 Answer Set Solver (Gebser et al, 2012) as the main argumentation component, and a Mongodb6 NoSQL database for the historical memory of the examples.

Then, a new window that did not meet the hypothesis at hand was randomly selected and presented to ILED, which subsequently revised the initial hypothesis to take into account both historical memory and new evidence.For historical memories ranging from 103 to 105 examples, a new size 10, 50 and 100 training window was selected from the entire dataset.The process was repeated ten times for each other combination of historical memory and new window size.Figure 2 represents the average revision time for new windows.

To further facilitate the learning task, we used expert knowledge of the relationship between specific low-level and high-level events, with the language bias explanations being irrelevant to the high-level event that was learned in each case.

ILED combines techniques from non-monotonous ILP and in particular the XHAIL algorithm with theory revision. From the first available data, it derives a first hypothesis and revises this hypothesis as soon as new data arrives. Revisions take into account all the experience gained. The most important contribution of ILED is that it scales XHAIL to large amounts of sequential data, with a time-like structure typical of event-based applications. In this work, ILED has a scalable, single-pass revision strategy that increases the cost of theory revision as a traceable function of perceived experience. In this work, ILED was evaluated on the basis of an activity detection application and a transport management application."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work is partly funded by the EU project SPEEDD (FP7 619435) and we would like to thank the reviewers of the Machine Learning Journal for their valuable comments on the first version of the paper."}, {"heading": "Appendix A Notions from (Inductive) Logic Programming", "text": "In fact, it is as if it is a matter of a way in which one puts oneself in the centre.

The manual development of such knowledge is a tedious and error-prone task, thus event-based applications may benefit from automated knowledge construction techniques, such as Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), which combines machine learning with the declarative and formal semantics of First-Order Logic. However, learning temporal logical formalisms, which are typically utilized by logic-based Event Recognition systems is a challenging task, which most ILP systems cannot fully undertake. In addition, event-based data is usually massive and collected at different times and under various circumstances. Ideally, systems that learn from temporal data should be able to operate in an incremental mode, that is, revise prior constructed knowledge in the face of new evidence. Most ILP systems are batch learners, in the sense that in order to account for new evidence they have no alternative but to forget past knowledge and learn from scratch. Given the increased inherent complexity of ILP and the volumes of real-life temporal data, this results to algorithms that scale poorly. In this work we present an incremental method for learning and revising event-based knowledge, in the form of Event Calculus programs. The proposed algorithm relies on abductive-inductive learning and comprises a scalable clause refinement methodology, based on a compressive summarization of clause coverage in a stream of examples. We present an empirical evaluation of our approach on real and synthetic data from activity recognition and city transport applications.
