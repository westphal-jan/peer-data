As a part of this it is important to predict the Renewable (Wind) energy for efficient scheduling (executing jobs that require higher energy when there is more green energy available and vice-versa). For predicting the wind energy we first analyze the historical data to find a statistical model that gives relation between wind energy and weather attributes. Then we use this model based on the weather forecast data to predict the green energy availability in the future. Using the green energy prediction obtained from the statistical model we are able to precompute job schedules for maximizing the green energy utilization in the future. We propose a model which uses live weather data in addition to machine learning techniques (which can predict future deviations in weather conditions based on current deviations from the forecast) to make on-the-fly changes to the precomputed schedule (based on green energy prediction).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Feb 2014 14:29:33 GMT  (1814kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6552v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ankur sahai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.6552"}, "pdf": {"name": "1402.6552.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Renewable Energy Prediction using Weather Forecasts for Optimal Scheduling in HPC Systems", "authors": ["Ankur Sahai", "Johannes Gutenberg"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "As part of the GreenPAD project, we analyze wind energy (E.ON) and weather data (DWD) using simple statistical techniques such as correlation and Matlab for detailed analyses. The goal of the GreenPAD project is to maximize the use of green energy (wind, solar and biomass) to power the green data centers. This is challenging because the energy that can be transferred to the main grid is limited by the capacity of the transformers. If the combination of wind energy and conventional energy exceeds the capacity of the transformer, it must be used locally to avoid wastage. This is solved by conducting a green data center Xiv: 140 2.65 52v1 [cs.LG], whose energy consumption can be controlled based on the availability of green energy; since it is not possible to control the energy consumption pattern of households. Specifically, we focus on wind energy for analysis similar to that of paper [1]. We start with simple techniques, such as determining the correlation between wind energy and the use of wind power attributes and weather butions."}, {"heading": "2 Motivation", "text": "From the perspective of the GreenPAD project, predicting wind energy is critical to planning jobs in the green data center.

By predicting green energy obtained from the statistical model, we are able to calculate work plans for maximizing the future use of green energy. We find a higher degree of correlation between wind energy and wind direction, indicating that the winds from certain directions - east and west - had higher intensities.
