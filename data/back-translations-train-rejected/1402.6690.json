There has been a series of research examining users \"tweet activity, such as responses and retweets [12, 15, 2]. Twitter has also been used to engage with strangers [13, 10]. Recently, Chen et al. has examined users\" engagement in Twitter in the context of a political movement [6]. Understanding factors of users \"social engagement can benefit from answering social questions [13, 10, 12, 15], viral marketing [3] and information dissemination [1], etc. In this paper, we focus on understanding how users\" word use can influence different behaviors of social engagement on Twitter."}, {"heading": "DATASETS", "text": "We then used Twitter's RESTAPI to get their last 200 tweets. We calculated each user's past _ response _ rate, the ratio of each user's number of responses to the total number of questions asked on Twitter. We used a rules-based method of using only question marks (?) to detect questions. Our choice is justified by previous studies that have shown that most (81.5% as reported in [12]) questions asked on social networking sites contained a question mark (?). Also, a rules-based method that uses only question marks to identify questions in online content achieves more than 97% accuracy in detecting questions [4]. Retweets and tweets that contain URLs were not taken into account. The average past _ response _ rate was 0.754 and the default deviation was 0.007. We also recorded the previous retweet history of each user and calculated the tweet _ rate between each user's number and the number of retweets was 0.15%."}, {"heading": "PSYCHO-LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS FROM TEXT", "text": "We have measured word usage with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) 2001 dictionary [16]. LIWC is the most widely used language analysis tool to investigate the relationship between word usage and psychological variables [16]. LIWC 2001 defines over 70 different categories, each containing several dozen to hundreds of words [16]. We have excluded categories that are not semantic (e.g. share of long words) or relevant to the language (e.g. filler), and considered the remaining 66 LIWC categories. For each person, we calculated its LIWC-based values in each category as a ratio between the number of words in that category in tweets and the total number of words in its tweets. We have excluded retweets from calculating LIWC-based personality values because retweets are content generated by others."}, {"heading": "RESPONSE ANALYSIS", "text": "We start with a Pearson correlation analysis between the LIWC categories and userspast _ response _ rate. Statistically significant correlations are shown in Table 1. LIWC category anger correlates negatively with the response, suggesting that people who use more angry words (such as anger, anger) are less likely to react. LIWC category communication correlates significantly positively with the response, suggesting that more communicative people are more likely to react. An anxious person who expresses in the LIWC category fear and consists of words such as fear and alarm is less likely to react. LIWC category cognition, illustrated by words such as accept, acknowledge, acknowledge and agree, has a significant positive correlation with the response. A social person (illustrated by words such as interaction, involve) and a person with positive feelings (illustrated by words such as care, cheer, attachment) are also more likely to react."}, {"heading": "RETWEET ANALYSIS", "text": "The significant correlations are shown in Table 2. The LIWC categories perception, communication, social process, positive feelings, positive emotions, inclusive and other reactions show positive significant correlations with retweeting behavior. The LIWC category perception represents words such as questions, calls and contacts. These words are often used by people who are more interactive, and it seems intuitive that a person who scores highly in the perception category is also more likely to retweet. The LIWC category positive emotions is illustrated by words such as accept and admit. It is quite intuitive that a person who scores highly in this category is more likely to retweet. In addition, we found that a person who scores highly in the perception category is more likely to retweet. The LIWC category positive emotions is illustrated by words such as accept and admit."}, {"heading": "PREDICTION MODELS", "text": "We have performed both regression analysis and a classification study using WEKA [19], a widely used machine learning tool. For regression analysis, we formulated linear regressions to predict response and retweet rates using LIWC measures. Thus, LIWC attributes were independent variables of the regression model and the past of the user _ response _ rate / past _ retweet _ rate was the dependent variable. We have tried a number of regression approaches, including simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, temporal regression, logistic regression and SVM regression. We have performed 10-fold cross-validation. SVM regression has slightly exceeded other algorithms. Table 3 presents the result of regression analysis in terms of mean absolute error (MAE). We find that the response can be predicted within 25.3% -29.9% MAE. LIK-2K results are predicted within categories -23.6% -LIK."}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our work is the first to show correlations between word use and various social engagement such as reactions and retweets. Our work also discovers a number of psycholinguistic categories that exhibit significant correlations with users \"reactions and retweets on Twitter. Such psycholinguistic categories are also useful for predicting the likelihood of reactions and retweets. Our results also suggest that certain word usage can predict such similarities. People who use angry words (such as anger, hate, kill) are less likely to react, people who write about communication are more likely to react, and people who write about positive feelings are more likely to retweet. Predictive models of word usage response can identify users who are more likely to respond to a question. Questioning systems such as [12, 13] can emerge from such predictions to send questions to potential announcers."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we have presented a study to understand how people with different word usage exhibit different behaviors of social engagement through an analysis of responses and retweets on Twitter. We conducted psycholinguistic analyses of word usage and found that certain psycholinguistic categories exhibit significant correlations with such social engagement behavior. Furthermore, our results suggest that some psycholinguistic categories share common traits for both response and retweet behavior. We have developed predictive models of social engagement behavior from the characteristics of the psycholinguistic category, and have shown that our models are reasonably accurate at predicting such social engagement behavior. In the future, we would like to extend our analyses to other social media platforms, verify the generality of results with other forms of social engagement, and continue a more in-depth investigation of predictive models of social engagement behavior based on word usage."}], "references": [{"title": "The role of social network in information diffusion", "author": ["Bakshy.E", "Rosenm", "I.
