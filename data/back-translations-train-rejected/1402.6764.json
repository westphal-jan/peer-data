INTRODUCTION", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to orient themselves in a certain direction, and they will be able to take that direction."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Although various research has focused on disambiguation techniques, not many have highlighted how these ambiguous words came into being. Furthermore, most previous research has focused on the English language. Due to the limited scope, it is quite difficult to reference and construct Malay ambiguous words. Therefore, this research applies the methods used in English and other languages to suit our field of research."}, {"heading": "2.1. Vagueness Vs Ambiguity Issues", "text": "A sentence that contains a vague word would not convey its intended meaning. Uncertainty is one of the many sources of ambiguity. For example, \"Five stones stacked on top of each other are a pile.\" [10] Five stones can be considered a pile, while another might disagree with the statement, since he can say that ten stones stacked on top of each other are then a pile. Uncertainty can cause ambiguity that leads to uncertainty and multiple interpretations (see Figure 2). However, uncertainty and uncertainty are distinguished, they correlate with each other [9]. They are complementary but not parallel. Uncertainty has a close similarity as semantic uncertainty or it is called \"semantic nihilism.\" [10] Therefore, much research has concluded that in order to solve ambiguity, the inclusion of context is necessary to ensure that the interpretation is unique in a sentence."}, {"heading": "2.2. Criterion of Ambiguous Words", "text": "A dictionary of 100 ambiguous Arabic words developed takes into account more than 10 sense of words as a criterion [11]. These senses were extracted from the Arabic dictionary. Chantree et al. extracted ambiguous sentences indicate coordination ambiguity and developed ambiguity thresholds to set the standard for ambiguity [12]. Factors that help readers understand what a sentence means include sentence length, ambiguous adjectives, adjectives and passive verbs [13]. A list of potentially ambiguous English words was constructed in an ambiguous technical report as a guide to avoid ambiguous sentences [14]. Tjong et al. developed rules for clearer sentences in an attempt to avoid ambiguities [15]. These research results prove that in order to initiate an investigation to disambiguate an ambiguous sentence, one must first begin by identifying and identifying the ambiguous words."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY", "text": "We believed that in order to minimize and manage ambiguity, one must go to the root. In this case, it is necessary to locate and identify the potential vague and ambiguous words before the process of ambiguity detection can take place. Therefore, this strategy will be the first stage of the overall research."}, {"heading": "3.1. Ambiguity Attributes", "text": "Table 2 below shows the structure of our proposed ambiguity attributes in an attempt to compile a list of potential ambiguous Malay words. These attributes are compiled on the basis of several relevant quality attributes from previous literature, consisting of six attributes that are best suited for Malay words. Malay ambiguous words are extracted from the RS working language based on these attributes, and some have been translated from English with Dwibahasa Kamus Oxford Fajar [16]. Some of the words in the word class attributes have been taken from Kamus Komprehensif Bahasa Melayu [17] for their part of the language (POS)."}, {"heading": "3.1. Process of creating Malay Ambiguous Lexicons", "text": "Step 1: We collected samples of Malaysian requirements specifications from companies as the source of our training data. Potentially ambiguous words were extracted from the sentences based on criteria as shown in Table 1. We constructed six ambiguities from literature references that are most relevant and appropriate to our scope (see Table 2). Based on these characteristics, we mapped the extracted potential ambiguities with the ambiguities to confirm features of ambiguities. By filtering against the above criteria, the list of potentially ambiguous words is also referred to as ambiguous candidates, which are kept in a repository and further analyzed using context-based recognition techniques. Step 3: The identified potentially ambiguous Malay words are subjected to a verification process to ensure true ambiguity. Verification is expected by Malay language experts. Step 4: The verified words are stored in a database for the next phase of operations."}, {"heading": "4. DISCUSSION", "text": "A total of 2,900 words were eliminated from these sources. Examples of inappropriate words include English loanwords, short words, duplicate words such as \"rekod-rekod,\" \"kata nama khas (KNK)\" and symbols such as dots and other symbols. We then managed to extract 120 potentially ambiguous Malay words. Table 3 below shows the statistics for the words \"mapping to their appropriate ambiguity assignments.\" From the statistics generated, the highest percentage of potentially ambiguous Malay words falls into the categories \"implicit\" followed by \"connective\" and \"referential.\" The articulated data show that potentially ambiguous Malay words, which are most commonly used, are very general, have a vague boundary, are too subjective and reflect an unquantifiable criterion."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The after-effects of the situation could jeopardize the development cycle of the system and the time limit of the project as well as the budgets. In the Malaysian requirements environment, there is still a lack of research focused on this situation. We have presented a method to identify potentially ambiguous Malaysian words and have managed to compile a list of 120 potentially frequently used ambiguous Malaysian words in a Malaysian requirements specification. This study is an attempt to help authors avoid the use of potentially ambiguous words and to promote greater clarity in the sentence construction of the documentation as well as to significantly reduce misinterpretations by readers."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "We thank the Malay Linguist Experts from UPM, UM and UKM for their support and helpful comments.
