INTRODUCTION", "text": "Data mining is generally concerned with the discovery of non-trivial, hidden and interesting knowledge from different types of data. As information technologies evolve, the number of databases, as well as their dimensions and complexity, grows rapidly. It is necessary to automate the analysis of large amounts of data, and the results of the analysis are then used for decision-making by humans or a program. Outliers, on the other hand, are defined as observation that is explained by the underlying probability density function. An outlier is the observation of data that differs so much from other observations that it is suspected that they were generated by a different mechanism from most data [1]. Outliers, on the other hand, are defined as observation that is explained by the underlying probability density function. This function represents the probability distribution of the bulk of data observations [2]. Many data mining algorithms manipulate outliers as a by-product of cluster algorithms. However, these techniques define outliers as points that do not lie in clusters."}, {"heading": "2. IMPROVED GENETIC K-MEANS (IGK)", "text": "IRTG is an efficient cluster algorithm for handling large amounts of data that can select the initial cluster center using genetic algorithms (GAs), reduce sensitivity to isolated points, avoid the separation of large clusters, and overcome to some extent the data distraction caused by the disproportionate data partitioning due to the introduction of multisampling [5]. The middle steps of the proposed algorithm can be summarized as follows: Algorithm: Improved genetic K agents (S, k), S = {x1, x2,..., xn}. Input: The number of clusters K '(K' > K) and a dataset of n objects xi.Output: A set of k clusters Cj that minimize the square error criterion."}, {"heading": "3. OUTLIER DETECTION METHODS", "text": "In outlier detection methods based on clusters, outlier detection is defined as an observation that does not fit into the general cluster scheme. [6] The ability to detect outliers can be improved by a combined perspective of outlier detection and clustering. Some outlier algorithms [7-16] treat outliers as special observations, but their main concern is clustering the data set, not detecting outliers. The following techniques have been proposed to detect outliers: Begin 1. Multiple partial samples {S1, Sj}; 2. For m = 1 to j doGenetic K means (Sm, K '); / / Execution Genetic Kmeans, produce K'clusters and j groups.3. Choose min {Jc} as the refined starting points Zj, j [1, K']]; 5. Genetic K means (S, K means."}, {"heading": "4. PROPOSED METHOD", "text": "Unlike traditional clustering-based methods, the proposed algorithm offers much more efficient outlier detection and data clustering capabilities in the presence of outliers. This approach is based on filtering the data according to the clustering process. The purpose of our method is not only to generate data clusters, but also to find outliers from the resulting clusters. The algorithm of our outlier detection method is divided into two stages. The first step, which is performed using the IGK process and the second stage, is to remove outliers according to a selected threshold. Thus, the proposed method is like the ORC method except in the first stage, ORC was the application of K means. But K means suffer from some drawbacks such as K means being sensitive to the first choice of cluster centers, the clustering method can be very different by starting from different centers, K means cannot handle massive data."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "We conduct experiments with three synthetic datasets, referred to as A1, A2 and A3 [17], which are shown in Figure 3 and summarized in Table 1 with threshold equal to 0.9 and number of iterations equal to 10, with N being the number of examples and M not representing clusters.Figure 3: Datasets, A1 (left), A2 (center) and A3 (right) The mean square error (MSE), which is used to calculate the difference between the outlier points, was calculated to calculate the error.Figure 4 shows that the error decreases very quickly as the threshold increases, thereby removing more and more objects, reducing the distance between the points and cluster centers.Begin C \u2190 IGK for j \u2190 1,..., I do / / / I is not an iteration dmax \u2190 maxi | | xi \u2212 cpi |} for i, 1..., N > cpi-cpi-2 for the averaged 1.800.SE (1.800.SE)."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we proposed to integrate outlier distance into clustering for non-parametric model estimation.The proposed method was also compared with the standard methods of non-outlier removal of means, and a simple approach was followed in which outlier removal precedes actual cluster building.The proposed method uses both cluster and outlier discovery to improve the estimation of the centroids of generative distribution.The experimental results show that the proposed method can identify outliers more successfully than existing algorithms, indicating that our method has a lower error rate than the competing methods in data sets with overlapping clusters."}, {"heading": "7.
