While there has been an extensive amount of research in network anomaly detection, current state of the art methods are only able to detect one class of anomalies at the cost of others. The key tool we will use is based on the spectral decomposition of a trajectory/hankel matrix which is able to detect deviations from both between and within correlation present in the observed network traffic data. Detailed experiments on synthetic and real network traces shows a significant improvement in detection capability over competing approaches. In the process we also address the issue of robustness of anomaly detection systems in a principled fashion.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 2 Mar 2014 04:18:00 GMT  (785kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0157v1", "Submitted to The Journal of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (DAMI)"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to The Journal of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (DAMI)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NI", "authors": ["tahereh babaie", "sanjay chawla", "sebastien ardon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1403.0157"}, "pdf": {"name": "1403.0157.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Network Traffic Decomposition for Anomaly Detection", "authors": ["Tahereh Babaie", "Sebastien Ardon"], "emails": ["tahereh.babaie@nicta.com.au", "sanjay.chawla@sydney.edu.au", "sebastien.ardon@nicta.com.au"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 3.01 57v1 [cs.LG] 2 Mar 201 4Keywords Anomaly Detection \u00b7 Hankel Matrix \u00b7 SVD"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it will be in a position to achieve the objectives I have mentioned."}, {"heading": "2 Hankel Matrix and Generative Model", "text": "We will now justify the decomposition of the Hankel matrix on the basis of a generative model of the data.

In this section, we describe the different types of common anomalies and explain why M-SSA offers other anomalies. Table 1 lists the common anomalies that are defined as 5-fold using the flow (source IP address, destination IP address, source port number, destination port number, transport protocol); for more details, see Silveira et al (2010a, b); Lakhina et al (2005, 2004a). A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack occurs when the attacking hosts send a large number of small packets - typically TCP-SYN segments - to the attacked host and service, i.e. a single IP address and port number in order to draw system resources from the target host with a relatively small amount of data flows resulting from a DoS attack."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental evaluation", "text": "We have evaluated our proposed approach using both real and synthetic datasets and have implemented well-known network anomaly techniques based on wavelength, kalma filtering, Fourier analysis and the newer ASTUTE methodology for comparison.

The dataset consists of a one-month traffic trace from a backbone router in New York in August 2007. Juniper router captured the generated data at a sampling rate of 1 / 100. Data flows were aggregated at five-minute intervals, with the most important attributes of the flow being: number of packets, number of unique source IP addresses, number of unique destination IP addresses, number of different source port numbers and number of different destination port numbers.

However, in addition to previous work, we are building a simulation model that captures several characteristic features of anomalies. We are looking at the time distribution between anomalies, duration, size (number of packets for DoS attacks, number of streams for port scans, etc.) and the anomalous type distribution (DoS, port scan, etc.).We first estimate the above parameters based on available observations of traffic tracks. For example, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show the histograms of these property values for DoS attacks or port scans as observed in the image track."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 Results", "text": "The ROC curves shown in Fig. 8 show that M-SSA has a higher true positive rate than all other techniques for a given false positive rate. For example, M-SSA detects 90% of anomalies at a false positive rate of 0.01%, while Wavelet and ASTUTE detect only 77% and 81%, respectively. A hybrid detector including Wavelets, Kalman and ASTUTE shows slightly better compensation for a false positive rate of less than 10 \u2212 5, but M-SSA is better for the rest of the interval.

Dividing the Y series into these two parts is practicable if the resulting additive components X and E are approximately separable from each other. Represent the fully reconstructed components with Vi = Mz for i = 1.2,... m \u00d7 \u00b2.

In principle, the biggest challenge is to offer anomaly-based detection systems (ADS) as an attractive alternative to signature-based systems.ADS are based on the notion of \"statistical normality\" and malicious events that cause deviations from normal behavior.The biggest challenge is to characterize the normal traffic that is subject to the compulsion of network traffic to exhibit non-stationary behavior. Existing techniques for ADS are based on decomposition methods of network time series.

A DoS attack is an example of time deviations, while a port scan attack violates spatial correlations. In addition to using M-SSA to detect network anomalies, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation and compared M-SSA with other approaches based on wavelengths, Fourier analysis, calman filtering, and the recently introduced ASTUTE method. We have also conducted a rigorous analysis of the parameter configurations associated with the use of M-SSA, and addressed some of the important issues raised in the network community."}, {"heading": "Appendix A Hankelization", "text": "The averaging over the diagonals i + j = composition of the matrices XIi is called Hankelization.

In other words, diagonal averaging maps the matrices XIi into a time series. To be continued... Let Hankelization operator H act on any matrix to optimally transform it into a Hankle matrix. By applying the Hankelization method to all the matrix components of XIi, the expansion will look like this: X = XI1 +... + XIm 3 http: / / nicta.com.au / where XI1 = H XI1.

While there has been an extensive amount of research in network anomaly detection, current state of the art methods are only able to detect one class of anomalies at the cost of others. The key tool we will use is based on the spectral decomposition of a trajectory/hankel matrix which is able to detect deviations from both between and within correlation present in the observed network traffic data. Detailed experiments on synthetic and real network traces shows a significant improvement in detection capability over competing approaches. In the process we also address the issue of robustness of anomaly detection systems in a principled fashion.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
