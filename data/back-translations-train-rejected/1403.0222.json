We extend this notation to include sets of figures in natural fashion.A signature is a pair (S) in which S is a set of sorts and meanings of first order logic. For the sake of general applicability, we will work in this article with a multi-sorted formula of first order, formalized here as follows. A signature is a pair (S) in which S is a set of sorts and meanings, a set of relation symbols; each relation symbol R has a related arbitrariness ar (R), which is an element of the S signature. Each variable v has an associated signature s (v). An atom is a formula R (v1,)."}, {"heading": "3. QCSP proof system", "text": "In this section, we will present our system of proof for the QCSP and outline some basic properties of it, including solidity and completeness. Let's (\u03c6, B) be a QCSP instance, and let's understand the formula of \u03c6 as a tree. The system of proof allows us to derive what we call an instance at the various nodes of the tree. To facilitate the discussion, let's assume that each Qc sentence contains either a set of indexes containing an index for each subformula, that is, for each node of the tree that corresponds to both. Let's note that (generally) the collection of constraints is derivable from a subformula that does not depend on the subformula, but also on the subformula whose location is in the complete formula. If i is an index, let's use this subformula (i) to name the actual subformula, we will also refer to i."}, {"heading": "4. Propositional proof system", "text": "In this section, we will introduce a different system of evidence that includes a meaningful interpretation of the QCSP proof system. To differentiate, we will refer to judgments and judgments as defined in the previous section. A clause is an exclusion of words that contains at least one word about the variable for each variable; a clause is sometimes considered to be the set of words it contains, and the other is v; each clause is empty if it does not contain words. A clause's variables are simply the variables underlying the clause, and the variables of a clause are considered by a set of words it contains. A clause is empty if it does not contain words; the variables of a clause are simply the variables underlying the clause, and the variables of a clause are considered by a set of words it contains."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The author thanks Moritz Mu \u00bc ller and Friedrich Sliwovsky for their useful comments.

For each clause judgment proof that there is a restriction judgment proof for (\u03c6, B) length \u2264 2s and width \u2264 w + 1 so that: each clause judgment that appears in the first evidence has the condition property that there is a restriction judgment on the form (i, vars (\u03b1), F) so that each f-clause judgment fulfills (equally, the unique g: vars) \u2192 {0, 1} that the satisfaction is not in F. A direct consequence of this theory is that if the original clause judgment contains proof, then the produced restriction proof contains an empty clause."}, {"heading": "Appendix B. Proof of Theorem 4.5", "text": "The theorem follows directly from the following two theorems. Theorem B.1. Let us be a QCBF instance. (Given a tree-like clause that proves that P (as a tree) exists of an empty clause, there is a track E whose root has a label (\u2205, e) and where the number of nodes in E is equal to the number of non-flow judgments in P. (Here we use e to denote the unique mapping of P to {0, 1}.) Also, the translation from P to E is polynomial-time computable.Proof. We prove the following result that results in the theorem. Suppose that P is a tree-like clause reasoning that is considered a tree to denote the clause judgments at the root of P, there is a trace E whose number of nodes is equal to the number of non-flow judgments in which P and their root judgments (S)."}, {"heading": "Appendix C.

If there is a k-constraint system P for the instance, then the instance is k-Richter-consistent.Proof. We show that if (i, V, F) there is a derivative judgment, then P [i, V] is a derivative judgment, on the basis of which rule was used to derive (i, F).In the case of (atom) we have P [i, V] F by property (F] F by property (\u03b1).In the case of (p) we assume that V, F) is an earlier judgment with P [i, V] F, and that the judgment of interest has the form (i, U, F U U V) where U V is."}], "references": [{"title": "Constraint propagation as a proof system", "author": ["A.
