A direct statistical interpretation of the corpus should be approached with caution; the corpus digitizes all symbolic representations in a book, including numbers, letters and symbols. For example, \"70%\" is considered gram. Google also acknowledges on its website that the degree of optical character recognition (OCR) is not perfect. These errors can make it difficult to define the likelihood of occurrence of Ngrams, as the same word could be inappropriately identified as two different words. I used the corpus in 2009, as this project was started before the Corpus in 2012. Each non-letter-based gram was parsed, so that each gram was removed with numbers, punctuation or non-Arabic characters."}, {"heading": "Twitter", "text": "For the Twitter corpus, the live English Twitter stream was searched for a space. \"This eliminated any bias in the data stream and distorted it when tweeting with spaces.

Thus, for example, of the 3,769,991 unique words extracted from Google 1-gram, the most are used at 20,510,449,496 times (~ 8% of the corpus), while the 10,000 most commonly used word words are used 1,813,662 times (~ 7x10 -6% of the corpus) and the 100,000 word-holders are used only 3330,001 times (~ 1x10 -7% of the corpus).

The confusion matrices were created on the premise that if a word is randomly selected from a random corpus and I try to determine which corpus the word came from based on usage frequency alone not my a priori knowledge of origin, can I do it? An example would be if I randomly select a word from the Twitter corpus, but based on our statistics that it came from the 1 gram corpus, then it is said that the word is \"confused.\" It means that I cannot correctly guess based on my best guess method alone with no a priori knowledge. I did not want to do this with just one word, but with several words to construct a sentence like analysis. So, instead of looking for the probability of just one word, I looked for a combined probability of several words."}, {"heading": "Case Study", "text": "I met the author Cory Doctorow and decided to use his corpora because he has open and free books available, which I have converted into 1 gram, a Twitter account and videos of him speaking and interacting on Youtube.

Mr. Doctorow's 1 gram resemble Twitter and Talk more than they resemble Google's 1 gram distributions. Again, the distribution of Google 1 gram is completely different compared to all the other distributions. Why is that? As you can see from the Doctorow data, it is not an intrinsic property of books.

INTRODUCTION The evolution of new dialects of spoken languages has often been studied and modeled with respect to the contribution of idiolects (1) and the impact of spatial pressures (2). With technology allowing ease of communication between spatially distant individuals, there is the possibility that modern dialects may form between members of social networks without similar geographical locations. This raises a somewhat semantic question: What constitutes a dialect? It is clear that graphemic communication can be very different from phonemic communication, as these have been suggested to be different dialects in English (3). However, overall this question is complicated and overlooks a simpler question: How similar or different are communication corpora from each other? In the past 25-30 years modes of online communication, such as Chat, appear as a combination of phonemic and graphemic dialects, but it is unclear how much these modes differ. Modern modalities of communication were developed on the basis of previous forms of communication, but it is unclear if the language usage is more similar to written or spoken \u201cdialects\u201d. In this study, I have analyzed the vocabulary from four different bodies of work: books from the Google Books project (4), chat logs from IRC, transcribed verbal communication (i.e., Talking), and over one million unique messages sent on Twitter. What I find is unexpected. Though Chat and Twitter could be considered forms of written communication, the word usage patterns are more similar to Talking. Comparisons between Fiction and Nonfiction writing show that Fiction more closely resembles Chat and Twitter. Using a case study of Author, Speaker and Twitter user Cory Doctorow I find that the way someone speaks can be as similar to Nonfiction writing as it is to Fiction writing but we incorrigibly Tweet like we speak.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
