It plays an important role in qualitative spatial reasoning, geographical information science, and ontology. The computational complexity of reasoning with RCC has been investigated in depth in the literature. Most of these works focus on the consistency of RCC constraint networks. In this paper, we consider the important problem of redundant RCC constraints. For a set $\\Gamma$ of RCC constraints, we say a constraint $(x R y)$ in $\\Gamma$ is redundant if it can be entailed by the rest of $\\Gamma$. A prime network of $\\Gamma$ is a subset of $\\Gamma$ which contains no redundant constraints but has the same solution set as $\\Gamma$. It is natural to ask how to compute a prime network, and when it is unique. In this paper, we show that this problem is in general co-NP hard, but becomes tractable if $\\Gamma$ is over a tractable subclass of RCC. If $\\mathcal{S}$ is a tractable subclass in which weak composition distributes over non-empty intersections, then we can show that $\\Gamma$ has a unique prime network, which is obtained by removing all redundant constraints from $\\Gamma$. As a byproduct, we identify a sufficient condition for a path-consistent network being minimal.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Mar 2014 22:01:16 GMT  (1194kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0613v1", "An extended abstract appears in Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on the Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR-14), Vienna, Austria, July 20-24, 2014"], ["v2", "Fri, 13 Feb 2015 15:22:28 GMT  (418kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0613v2", "An extended abstract appears in Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on the Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR-14), Vienna, Austria, July 20-24, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "An extended abstract appears in Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on the Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR-14), Vienna, Austria, July 20-24, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sanjiang li", "zhiguo long", "weiming liu", "matt duckham", "alan both"], "accepted": false, "id": "1403.0613"}, "pdf": {"name": "1403.0613.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On Redundant Topological Constraints", "authors": ["Sanjiang Lia", "Zhiguo Longa", "Weiming Liub", "Matt Duckhamc", "Alan Bothc"], "emails": ["sanjiang.li@uts.edu.au", "zhiguo.long@student.uts.edu.au", "liuweiming@baidu.com", "matt@duckham.org", "aboth@student.unimelb.edu.au"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The Region Connection Calculus (RCC) [41] is a well-known calculus for the representation of sub-networks as a whole and topological relationships.

Empirical Evaluation", "text": "In this section, we evaluate our method empirically against the methods of Wallgru \ufffd n [53]. In [53], Wallgru \ufffd n proposes two greedy algorithms for removing redundant constraints in the constraint network: the basic and advanced simplification algorithms (hereinafter Simple and SimpleExt). The Simple algorithm loops through all triples of the i, j and k regions and identifies as redundant all constraints Rik, so Rij Rjk Rik. One disadvantage of the Simple algorithm is that redundant relationships that are removed can affect subsequent iterations of the algorithm. Therefore, the order in which the tripel is visited by the Simple algorithm can alter the resulting subnetwork. SimpleExt solves this problem by first marking potentially redundant relationships for removal before removing all marked relationships in an end loop."}, {"heading": "6.1. Data Sets", "text": "The following assessment used two real datasets: the geographical \"footprint\" dataset provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in the UK, which was introduced in Section 1.1 (3443 regions in total), and the Level 1-4 statistical domain dataset for Tasmania (1559 regions in total), which was derived from social media. The footprint dataset contains a variety of regions of different sizes and shapes, but relatively unstructured distribution with almost no contiguous boundaries. In stark contrast, Tasmania's statistical domains are highly structured, consisting of four levels of spatially contiguous and nested but non-overlapping regions. To assist in our analysis, five subsets of the two datasets were generated in addition to the complete datasets, and the subsets were generated from the selection of regions that intersect a randomly selected spatial region of increasing size."}, {"heading": "6.2. Redundant Constraints", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the simple algorithm is almost as good in practice as the SimpleExt algorithm in eliminating redundant relationships. In this section, we compare the three types of subnets (Prime, SimpleExt and Simple) in practice and in the context of these conjectures. Figure 12 shows the growth of the size of the three subnets in the six subranges of the two datasets. Several features are worth noting in Figure 12: All three subnets grow roughly linearly with the number of regions (coefficient of determination R2 > 0.97 in all cases, indicating a high degree of adaptation between the data and linear regression."}, {"heading": "6.3. Scalability", "text": "As discussed above, algorithm 1 can calculate the primary subnetwork in O (n3) time for each consistent network using a tractable subclass of RCC5 / 8, taking the constraints from a distributed subalgebra. Similarly, the Simple and SimpleExt algorithms must at worst locate all triple regions, resulting in a general O (n3) scalability. However, on average, all algorithms showed average scalability relative to n2 (where n is the number of regions). Figure 14 shows the number of constraints checked by each algorithm, the decisive factor in the computation time. All algorithms increased linearly with the number of constraints (i.e. relative to n2), again with the exception of the simple algorithm that operates in the statistical domains. In fact, algorithm 1 was on average slightly more scalable than the other two algorithms. These differences arise because other constraints run faster on average than the other algorithms, the constraints are easier to detect."}, {"heading": "6.4. Removing Disconnected Constraints", "text": "Overall, the primary subnetwork has substantially reduced the number of constraints that would need to be stored to be linear in the number of regions (see Section 1.1). Table 4 shows the proportion of constraints identified as redundant that would be achieved by the various algorithms in the case of complete datasets, up to 98.44% in the case of the primary subnet in the highly structured statistical ranges. [7] However, in some cases it may be possible to achieve a similarly high level of storage efficiency more easily, for example by omitting the most numerous relationships (typically DC) from the constraint network. Figure 15 shows a scatter graph of the number of constraints in the constraint network that omit DC relationships against the number of constraints in the prime network, both expressed as a percentage of the total number of constraints (typically DC) in the full constraint networks (for eachtetetete74 Table 1.737 allows the full size of the DC network to be calculated)."}, {"heading": "6.5. Reconstituting the Full Network", "text": "As already emphasized in Section 1.1, there are many potential applications for the purely qualitative primary network, without involvement of geometry, including facilitating comparison and uncovering the essential structure of the various constraints networks. However, one last question we will address empirically is the efficiency of reconstructing the complete constraint network from the primary subnet, when this is compared geometrically, when the geometric information is complete and available.The complete constraint network can be reconstructed from the primary submesh in O (n3) time by calculating the A closure of the primary submesh. Calculating the constraint network directly from geometry requires in the worst case O (n2) iterations of an O (m2) algorithm for calculating the intersection between two polygons (where m is the number of nodes in the DC polygon).In cases where m \u00b2 n this can lead to a worst case, is the complexity of the algorithm (O) natics."}, {"heading": "6.6. Summary", "text": "In summary, our analysis of the performance of the three subnetworks using practical geographical datasets with thousands of regions shows: 1. The primary subnetwork consistently exceeds Simple and SimpleExt algorithms in terms of the number of redundant relationships identified, especially in cases where the proportion of PO relationships across the constraint network.2. The average scalability of cases for calculating the primary subnet required n2 operations, where n is the number of regions. Since the primary subnet identified redundant relationships, it performs fewer constraint checks on average than the SimpleExt and SimpleExt algorithms and has always been scalable in our tests.3. For less structured datasets, the primary subnetwork can significantly improve the number of relationships identified as redundant, compared to the naive solution of excluding DC relationships from the full constraint network.3."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have systematically examined the computational complexity of redundancy testing for RCC5 / 8 constraints. Although these constraints are generally insoluble, we have shown that a prime subnetwork in O (n5) time has a tractable subclass of RCC5 / 8 for each consistent network. If the constraints are taken from a distributive subalgebra, we have proven that the constraint network has a unique prime subnetwork that can be found in cubic time. As a by-product, we have also proven that any path-consistent network using a distributive subalgebra is weak globally consistent and minimal. Our empirical analysis showed that for real geographic data, the prime subnetwork can lead to significant increases in the number of redundant relationships that are identified when compared with the approximations proposed by [53]. In practice, the algorithm was efficient and showed average case 2 (O) scalability."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank Ross Purves, University of Zurich, for his help in developing the Footprint dataset shown in Figure 1, which was partially supported by ARC (DP120103758, DP120104159) and NSFC (61228305)."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.

representing part-whole and topological relations. It plays an important role in qualitative spatial reasoning, geographical information science, and ontology. The computational complexity of reasoning with RCC5 and RCC8 (two fragments of RCC) as well as other qualitative spatial/temporal calculi has been investigated in depth in the literature. Most of these works focus on the consistency of qualitative constraint networks. In this paper, we consider the important problem of redundant qualitative constraints. For a set \u0393 of qualitative constraints, we say a constraint (xRy) in \u0393 is redundant if it is entailed by the rest of \u0393. A prime subnetwork of \u0393 is a subset of \u0393 which contains no redundant constraints and has the same solution set as \u0393. It is natural to ask how to compute such a prime subnetwork, and when it is unique. In this paper, we show that this problem is in general intractable, but becomes tractable if \u0393 is over a tractable subalgebra S of a qualitative calculus. Furthermore, if S is a subalgebra of RCC5 or RCC8 in which weak composition distributes over nonempty intersections, then \u0393 has a unique prime subnetwork, which can be obtained in cubic time by removing all redundant constraints simultaneously from \u0393. As a byproduct, we show that any path-consistent network over such a distributive subalgebra is weakly globally consistent and minimal. A thorough empirical analysis of the prime subnetwork upon real geographical data sets demonstrates the approach is able to identify significantly more redundant con\u2217Corresponding Author Email addresses: sanjiang.li@uts.edu.au (Sanjiang Li), zhiguo.long@student.uts.edu.au (Zhiguo Long), liuweiming@baidu.com (Weiming Liu), matt@duckham.org (Matt Duckham), aboth@student.unimelb.edu.au (Alan Both) Preprint submitted to Elsevier February 16, 2015 ar X iv :1 40 3. 06 13 v2 [ cs .A I] 1 3 Fe b 20 15 straints than previously proposed algorithms, especially in constraint networks with larger proportions of partial overlap relations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
