In writing a paper recently [3], it became clear that there is no proper or concise definition of what artificial intelligence is. Since this is really just an extension of intelligence, it also means that it is difficult to define intelligence, even if it is hard coded. A few examples of definitions of intelligence are as follows: The ability to apply knowledge and skills to be considered intelligent in a computer program. It is able to make the decision on what to do next."}, {"heading": "2 A Universal Intelligence", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "3 Human-Level Artificial Intelligence", "text": "The ability of a machine to artificially imitate intelligent human behavior. (Merriam Webster) (1) Artificial intelligence is the study of human intelligence so that it can be artificially replicated. (2) Artificial intelligence is the study of human intelligence and artificially replicated actions so that the resulting rationality exhibits a reasonable level of rationality. (3) What is rationality? - > \"Doing the Right Thing.\" (WikiBooks, AI Definition) The characteristic of a machine that is able to learn reason through which it can normally learn functions associated with human intelligence. (McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific & Technical Terms) These definitions refer to human intelligence and act like creativity that cannot be easily programmed."}, {"heading": "3.1 An Acid Test for Human-Level Artificial Intelligence", "text": "If a self-confident or conscious program can be written, intelligence will result from the correct development of the model. Inherent in this is the ability of the program to learn, because if it is to be self-aware of new information, it must be able to understand the new model first. Many movies and programs have shown that the artificial intelligence program overlays it, which is necessary for a higher level of intelligence: Proposition 3: It can be said that a company has a higher level of (artificial) intelligence when it correctly and consistently overlays its environment. Any over-regulation would have to be correct and probably consistent to remove the possibility of a random act. This would also imply that the program was aware of what it was doing. If we are defined by our model, then it would be more obvious that higher intelligence is capable of breaking the coding of the model, but that is not so clear."}, {"heading": "4 One Related Work Example", "text": "The argument of Section 3.1 is the kind of argument also given by Searle [7] with his \"Chinese Space\" example: a person who has no knowledge of Chinese can provide answers to Chinese questions by associating symbols that he / she understands with the Chinese, and then with rules supplied to manipulate them. He also points out that intention and causal elements (neurons, synapses, nervous system, etc.) are missing as keys in human intelligence and the difficulty of artificially creating them. These elements seem to be missing from the process that man uses to answer Chinese space questions that are defined at a higher level and are the kind of process that a computer would have to use. The argument is that following the symbolic process does not lead to a human understanding, but only to repeating the algorithm and therefore a computer program would not be able to understand it."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "It is as if it is an attempt to change the system.
