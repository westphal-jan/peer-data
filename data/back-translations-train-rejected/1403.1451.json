In this work, we explore the types of triggers that spark trends on Twitter, introducing a typology with following four types: 'news', 'ongoing events', 'memes', and 'commemoratives'. While previous research has analyzed trending topics in a long term, we look at the earliest tweets that produce a trend, with the aim of categorizing trends early on. This would allow to provide a filtered subset of trends to end users. We analyze and experiment with a set of straightforward language-independent features based on the social spread of trends to categorize them into the introduced typology. Our method provides an efficient way to accurately categorize trending topics without need of external data, enabling news organizations to discover breaking news in real-time, or to quickly identify viral memes that might enrich marketing decisions, among others. The analysis of social features also reveals patterns associated with each type of trend, such as tweets about ongoing events being shorter as many were likely sent from mobile devices, or memes having more retweets originating from a few trend-setters.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Mar 2014 14:23:53 GMT  (1128kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1451v1", "Pre-print of article accepted for publication in Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology copyright @ 2013 (American Society for Information Science and Technology)"]], "COMMENTS": "Pre-print of article accepted for publication in Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology copyright @ 2013 (American Society for Information Science and Technology)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["arkaitz zubiaga", "damiano spina", "raquel mart\\'inez", "v\\'ictor fresno"], "accepted": false, "id": "1403.1451"}, "pdf": {"name": "1403.1451.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Real-Time Classification of Twitter Trends", "authors": ["Arkaitz Zubiaga"], "emails": ["arkaitz@zubiaga.org,", "damiano@lsi.uned.es", "raquel@lsi.uned.es", "vfresno@lsi.uned.es"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 3.14 51v1 [cs.IR] 6 Mar 201 4Index Termstwitter, Microblogging, Trending Topics, Realtime, Classification"}, {"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "While these social trends are highlighted by the ever-growing number of users, Twitter1 stands out as the quintessence of a platform that can openly access breaking news and current events. With over 500 million users, Twitter sees a daily stream of more than 400 million short messages known as tweets. These tweets range from one-to-one conversations to updates on topical topics that encompass all kinds of information. One of the most attractive phenomena of the microblogging service is the fact that certain events are of great interest to a user community that produce a sudden increase in real-time mentions as they unfold. Interestingly, users will discuss live tweets about sporting events as they watch them on television, as they mark certain events on Memorial Day, among other things."}, {"heading": "BACKGROUND", "text": "In this section, we provide background information on Twitter that is relevant to this work and describe the syntax used by its users, the way they interact with each other and disseminate information, and then learn in detail how Twitter presents and handles trends (defined by the microblogging system as Trending Topics) that we use as input for our trend classifier."}, {"heading": "Twitter", "text": "Twitter has evolved into a huge social media service, forwarding millions of RT tags every day. Similar features have been fundamental to its success: (1) the brevity of tweets that cannot exceed 140 characters facilitates the creation and delivery of messages in a matter of seconds, and (2) the ease of spreading these messages to a large number of users in a very short time. Over time, the Twitter user community has established a syntax for interacting with each other that has become the default syntax that was later officially adopted by its developers. Most major Twitter customers have also implemented this standard syntax. Standards in the interaction syntax include: \u2022 User Mentions: when a user mentions another user in their tweet, an at sign is placed in front of the corresponding user name, for example, you should follow all @ usernames, it is always up to date with news and interesting stuff. \u2022 Repetitions: when a user wants to address another user in their tweet, or place them at the beginning of a tweet, Twitter is always up to date with news and interesting stuff."}, {"heading": "Trending Topics", "text": "One of the main features on Twitter's home page displays a list of the top terms, the so-called Trending Topics at all times. These terms reflect the topics that are most discussed at the moment on the fast-flowing stream of tweets on the site. To avoid topics that are regularly popular (e.g. good morning or good night at certain times of the day), Twitter focuses on topics that are discussed much more than usual at the moment, i.e. topics that have recently experienced an increase in usage, so for some reason there has been a trend. Trending Topics have aroused great interest not only among users themselves, but also among other information consumers such as journalists, real-time application developers and social media researchers. Being able to know the top conversations that are being discussed at a given time helps keep abreast of current issues and discover the main concerns of the community. Twitter defines Trending Topics as \"topics that are immediately popular, rather than topics that are most frequently used for a while on a daily basis, or that there are no @ algorithms.\""}, {"heading": "TYPOLOGY OF TRENDING TOPICS", "text": "Next, we will present the typology that we use in this work to organize trending topics. After describing the typology, we will describe the process of generating a data set that is composed of trending topics and organized according to the typology."}, {"heading": "Definition of a Typology of Trending Topics", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able to survive themselves are able to survive themselves by going in search of themselves.

The list of trending topics obtained in real-time through the API can be supplemented by another method in the API that allows you to search for tweets that contain a specific query term, the query term of each of these trending topics. The search API applies to all public tweets posted by each user on the website, and it returns up to 1,500 of the most recent tweets. We used the top trends and search API methods to track the trending topics shown on the website from 1 to 7 March 2011. We had two processes running at the same time to collect both trends and the underlying tweets, the first process working on the top trends of the API by showing the list of trends on the website."}, {"heading": "CHARACTERIZATION OF TRENDING TOPICS", "text": "Next, we present the classification experiments and the characteristic analysis, with which we evaluate and quantify the validity of the typology introduced. We first analyze and discuss the characteristics and then present classification experiments based on these characteristics."}, {"heading": "Features of Trending Topics", "text": "The main motivation of this work is our hypothesis that, depending on the type of trigger that generates a trend, the social patterns observed on users \"behavior in terms of information diffusion are different. As we use this hypothesis as motivation and starting point, we define a set of 15 social characteristics to capture this social behavior. We analyze the extent to which these characteristics identify behavioral patterns in order to accurately categorize real-time trends. In addition, we delve into these social characteristics to gain insights into what they mean in each type of trend. As an approach to discovering the type of trigger behind a trend topic, we propose 15 social characteristics that take into account the way they propagate. Furthermore, since we want to categorize a trend topic as soon as it appears on the website trending topic, the characteristics must be easy and cheap to calculate."}, {"heading": "Understanding the Features", "text": "Next, we will analyze and discuss the features studied, not only for the Twitter features, but also for the textual content of tweets. To this end, we will examine the distribution of Twitter features for each type of Trending Topic and explore the main terms that characterize each of the types, helping us understand whether and why the features we use differ between the types of Trending Topics."}, {"heading": "Analysis of Twitter Features", "text": "The use of features produced a precise performance for the classification of trending topics according to the proposed typology or diversity. Further, it is of utmost importance to analyze how the values of these features are distributed for each type of trending topic, and the extent to which they can help to distinguish different types of tweets. However, we rely on ongoing tweets to show these distributions of values and differences or similarities between types. Each box / whiskey plot shows the distribution of values of a feature for the 4 types of trending topics. The line in the center of the box is the middle (second quartile), the bottom of the box is the first quartile, the top of the box is the third quartile, and the top bar is the maximum value that is observed where the bottom bar are the classes of trending topics. This type of action helps to visualize the value range for each feature, as well as to see qualitative bar, where most of the values can perform an analysis."}, {"heading": "Analysis of Text in Tweets", "text": "To analyze the textual content of the tweets, we give an overview of the top terms that occur in each type of Trending Topic \u2022 i.e., the most common vocabulary used in each type of Trending Topic. To this end, we first conducted a filtering process to remove irrelevant words. The filtering process removed all the stopwords contained in the tweets. The process of stop word removal included Twitter-specific words such as RT and words in stop word lists for the most important languages in Dataset Charlie. Afterwards, we calculated the TF (term frequency) of each word for each type of Trending Topic. This process produced a list of words for each type of Trending Topic, ordered in descending order by TF value. Table 4 shows a list of the top 15 terms for each type of Trending Topic. It can be seen that several words in these lists have a strong relationship to the definitions of the types of Trending Topics, which have Happy Birthday, For example, and Happy Birthday related topics, including:"}, {"heading": "AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF TRENDING TOPICS", "text": "Next, we describe the technical details of the classifier used in our experiments to classify trend topics, and then present the results of assessing the accuracy of the classifier and the appropriateness of the typology presented in this paper."}, {"heading": "Experimental Setup", "text": "In order to evaluate the appropriateness of classification of subjects according to the established typology, we offer a classification, which is carried out with the help of Vector Machines (SVM) (Joachims, 1998). Since it is a multi-class task, we specifically rely on a one-on-one combination method (Rifkin and Klautau, 2004), which was implemented with svmlight78. Instead of treating the multi-class problem as a single task, we split it into smaller binary topics. For a problem with one-on-all, different classification methods are defined. In the training phase, each of the two classes learns to separate one class from the other. This model creates a hyperlevel to separate the class from the rest of the others. In our task, where 4 classes are defined, the following classifiers are created: 1 vs 2-3-4, 2 vs 1-3-3-3."}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This study attempts to analyze, characterize and classify social trends in their early stages, with the goal of disseminating information in real time. Thus, it is relevant not only for researchers who study trends in social media, but also for developers who want to improve their systems in real time.

Regarding the classification of individual tweets, Sriram et al. (2010) define a typology of five generic classes of tweets (news, events, opinions, offers and news) to improve information filtering."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have introduced a typology to organize Twitter's trending topics according to the type of event that caused them. To this end, we have defined 15 simple features for the presentation of trending topics: news, ongoing events, memes and commemorative events. These features are independent of the language used in the tweets and are based on the social diffusion of the trending topic. The features consist of two different types: averages and diversity values. We have conducted classification experiments with SVM classifiers to investigate the usefulness of these features in order to distinguish the types of trending topics. We have shown that the proposed features provide more accurate classification results than the use of textual content in tweets. Furthermore, without the proposed method being directly modifiable, these features can only serve to distinguish the proposed characteristics."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work was partly funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education (FPU grant no.
