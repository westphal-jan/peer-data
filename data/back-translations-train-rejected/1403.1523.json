Introduction", "text": "Comparative analysis of DNA sequences is a fundamental task in genome research. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) has assumed a key role in comparative structure and function analysis of biological sequences, but MSA has high computational complexity and depends on a high level of sequence algorithms. Several alignment-free sequence algorithms have been proposed to address the problems of MSA. These alignment-free methods can be divided into categories that include feature frequency profiles (FFP) (Sims et al., 2001), graphic theory (Qi et al., 2011), and analysis in frequency domains (Zhao et al., 2011). In these methods, feature extraction or transformation of a sequence may cause loss of information and may not reflect the actual similarities and differences between DNA sequences."}, {"heading": "2.

A DNA sequence can be represented as a permutation of four characters A, T, C and G in different lengths. Before signal processing methods are applied to symbolic DNA sequences, the sequences are converted into numerical rows or binary indicator sequences (Voss, 1992). A DNA sequence designated as x (1), x (2),.., x (N) can be divided into four binary indicator sequences, uA (n), uT (n), uG (n) and uG (n), indicating the presence or absence of four nucleotides, A, T, C and G at the n \u2212 th position."}, {"heading": "2.2.

Discrete Fourier Transformations (DFT) are generally applied to periodic or quasi-periodic signals, but this technique is not suitable for analyzing aperiodic random signals. As a result, numerous methods have been developed to analyze aperiodic time series with low frequencies (Planat et al., 2009; Planat et al., 2001).3The Ramanujan sums cq (n) are the real sums of the n \u2212 th power of the q \u2212 th power of the q \u2212 th roots of the unit (Ramanujan, 1918), cq = q functions."}, {"heading": "2.3.

Distance metrics", "text": "A distance metric d (x, y) is a non-negative function in the set of pairs (x, y) of finite sequences across a specified alphabet. For example, one of its applications is a measure of the evolutionary change from DNA sequence x to y. The evolutionary changes are reversible, and the least number of evolutionary changes is from x to y. Therefore, a distance metric should be reflective, symmetrical and transitive (Waterman, 1976; Kanas and Lecko, 1991; Otu and Sayood, 2003). A metric space is a set of X along with a metric d on it.

We performed various DNA sequence mutants and evaluated the accuracy of the new RFT metric on the mutants. Similarity metrics were evaluated by constructing phylogenetic virus trees at the gene level.
