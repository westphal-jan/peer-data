Automated extraction of such relationships can support literary analysis by providing basic facts for further reflection on history. In the current work, we are dealing with the problem of extracting family relationships from the English narrative. Extraction has been studied in depth over the last two decades, and there are a number of existing approaches to the problem. Among others, the extraction of characters (Banko et al., 2007) is appealing as the method and availability of easy-to-use tools has been researched over the last two decades. The author was a student at the University of Alberta at the time this research was conducted. Such tools, namely ReVerb et al., 2011), a state that serves the tool with the default settings, we have extracted."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Most efforts have traditionally focused on the development of Open RE systems (Banko et al., 2007; Fader et al., 2011), which could easily be scaled to web-size corpora and did not require labeled data or predefined relationship categories. Therefore, it is difficult to highlight work specifically devoted to extracting family relationships from literary fiction. However, there has been some recent research in this direction. Santos et al. (2010) are developing a rules-based approach to extracting family relationships from Portuguese fiction. The authors are developing 99 rules, including some rules of dissemination, and combining them with NER and anaphora resolution systems. The work was evaluated on two corpora: bibliographic texts and a collection of sentences. For both cor-pora, the authors report close results with.71 precision and.24 remember among the best settings. Kokkinakis and Malakm (2011) are developing an unadulterated approach to extraction, including 91% of the three sentences."}, {"heading": "3 Extracting Family Relations", "text": "Our method consists of the following four steps: 1. Utterance assignment: attributes each utterance to one of the characters; 2. Vocabulary recognition: identifies vowel expressions; 3. Relationship extraction: extracts relationships between the speakers and the characters they address; 4. Relationship propagation: derives new relationships between indirectly related characters. In the following sections, we discuss each of the steps in detail."}, {"heading": "3.1 Utterance Attribution", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "3.2 Vocative Detection", "text": "We first define target nominals, i.e. nouns that describe family relationships. A list of basic family relationships is presented in Table 1. We expand it by including WordNet synonyms and hypernyms for each nominal value, to have a total of 635 target nominals.After we have finished the list, we select candidate expressions for the vowel recognition task. An expression is considered a candidate if it contains at least one target nominality.For the recognition task, we have tried both uncontrolled and monitored methods.The uncontrolled method predicts a word expression if a candidate matches the following pattern: < P my dear (est) T >. Here T stands for the target nominality.We consider all punctuation marks that are commonly used, including quotation marks. The occurrence of words mine and beloved (est) is optional."}, {"heading": "3.3 Relation Extraction", "text": "We extract relationships in the form of a standard triple (A1, R, A2), where A1 and A2 denote the arguments of a relationship, and R. From a given vowel utterance, we can immediately restore the relationship that is the vocative itself, e.g. mother, son, etc. Moreover, the speaker assigned to the utterance becomes the second argument of the relationship. So the biggest challenge is to extract the first argument of the relationship, or, in other words, to identify a recipient to whom a vocative has been addressed. In the face of an utterance, we have up to two potential recipients of the vocative: the speakers of the previous and subsequent utterances. Sometimes, one or even both may not be present. To eliminate unsuitable candidates, we introduce the following three limitations: 1. The gender of a candidate must correspond to the gender of a vocative, i.e., if a vocative is \"my dear sister.\" If we reject a male candidate, then we must use two vocabularies."}, {"heading": "3.4 Relation Propagation", "text": "As a final step, we try to derive new relationships from the extracted seed relationships by means of a rules-based propagation technique. We have applied a total of 21 rules to further disseminate the seed. These rules can be divided into three main categories: \u2022 Simple principles of complication \u2022 Rules of transitivity \u2022 Composition principles Table 2 lists sample propagation rules by category. Each rule has an analog that works in the opposite direction. Likewise, each gender rule has an analog that works for the opposite sex. Depending on the accuracy of an initial propagation rule, there may be contradictions. For example, suppose we have extracted the following relationships: (i) (A, father of, B) (ii) (C, sister of, A) and (iii) (C, sister of, B). According to the second compound rule in Table 2, we can propagate the relationship (C, aunt, B) from the first two relationships."}, {"heading": "4 Data Set Description", "text": "A relatively high number of characters and a rich set of family relationships make this novel a plausible choice. Furthermore, in Victorian novels, family relationships are well-defined, making the distribution rules perfectly applicable. We have used the first volume of 23 chapters as a development corpus and keep the rest for evaluation. Basic characteristics of the data are in Table 3. We will refer to the test theorem as the PnP corpus. We have commented on the novel in the manner of the Columbia QSA corpus (Elson and McKeown, 2010) and name entities and nominals exactly as they were labeled in the original work. The gender-specific list of characters also includes statements, a list of family relationships and a gender-specific list of personalities. The list of family relationships has a total of 202 relationships between 28 characters. All relationships are bi-direct. The gender-specific list of characters also includes cross references to characters, although Elizabeth's names are classified as Eliza and Eliza."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "In this section, we report on the performance of our method at each step that contributes to the final result. We begin by matching the utterance and compare our implementation of the method with the original work. Then, we report on the results of the vocative recognition task. Here, we compare monitored and unsupervised approaches. Finally, we report on the results of the relation extraction, assess the effects of the propagation step and perform the error analysis."}, {"heading": "5.1 Utterance Attribution", "text": "To assess the quality of our implementation of the Elson and McKeown method (2010), we report on the overall accuracy of our method with respect to the data used in the original paper, i.e. the Columbia Quoted Speech Attribution (CQSA) corpus. In this experiment, our implementation achieved an accuracy of 78%, which is 5% lower than the results reported in the original paper. We found that heuristics worked closely with the original method, but the classifiers did not perform as well. In the PnP corpus, the overall accuracy of the method was 79%. A closer analysis of the results revealed a similar trend to that in the CQSA corpus: Heuristics performed better than classifiers."}, {"heading": "5.2 Vocative Detection", "text": "When experimenting with our monitored method, we tried a number of classifiers. NaiveBayes, as provided by Weka, reached the highest F level and detected 33 vowel expressions, making four false positive predictions. However, the unsupervised method produced twice as many false positives as true positives despite higher recalls, suggesting that pattern match, although unsupervised, can potentially lead to a high false positive rate at the extraction step. Therefore, in the extraction step, we use vowel expressions that are detected by the monitored method."}, {"heading": "5.3 Relation Extraction and Propagation", "text": "Both relations extraction and propagation depend on the accuracy of the utterance assignment 05. To account for this dependence and for comparison purposes, we introduce the oracle that uses soil truths loudspeaker information at the relation extraction step; therefore, it is free from the utterance assignment error. Also, we would like to assess the effects of the propagation from both positive and negative angles. Propagation increases recall, but due to possible propagation errors, it may violate precision. To blame for such errors, we employ manual cleaning of seed relationships after the extraction step. Cleaning involves the removal of the wrong seeds, not the correction of them. Table 6 shows precision / recall of the relation step. Precision of the extraction is quite high, in fact it is higher than that of the oracle. This is due to semantic errors, which we will discuss later."}, {"heading": "5.4 Error Analysis", "text": "If we compare Figures 1a and 2a, we can immediately see that the former misses the knots Maria and Lydia and the relationships (Lydia, sister of, Mary) and (Mrs. Bennet, mother of, Lydia), which is the main reason why the recall of the spread of the extracted seeds was lower than that of the oracle seeds. In the case of the relationship between Lydia and Mary, a provocative statement was wrongly attributed to Lydia, which led to an invalid (Lydia, sister of, Lydia) relationship that was rejected. Likewise, another statement was wrongly attributed to Lydia in the case of a relationship between Lydia and Mrs. Bennet. This also led to a rejected relationship. In short, for our method it is really important to whom a given statement was attributed. Unfortunately, there is another problem with some provocative statements."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "Our method succeeds in applying dissemination rules to derive new relationships from originally extracted relationships. We conducted an error analysis and concluded that the method is sensitive to the accuracy of articulation and susceptible to the semantics of vocabulary. We plan to work on these questions in the future. As an additional line of work, we plan to examine context cues. For example, in a passage like \"Mr. Bennet,\" his wife, (current speaker, wife of Mr. Bennet) replied, we can infer a relationship from the utterance and the surrounding context."}], "references": [{"title": "Identifying relations for open", "author": ["Oren Etzioni"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Etzioni.,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Etzioni.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "The weka data mining software", "author": ["Ian H.
