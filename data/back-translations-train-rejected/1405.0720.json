Specifically, a PrASP program consists of down-to-earth or non-down-down-down formulas annotated in full syntax with numerical annotations (provided by some domain experts or learned from data).If the weights are removed directly and limited variable domains are provided, any such program can be converted into an equivalent program."}, {"heading": "4 Inference", "text": "It is about the question of to what extent it is actually about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about a way, in which it is about which it is about a way, in which it is about which it is about a way, in which it is about which it is about a way, in which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about a way, in which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about a way, in which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about a way, in which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which it is about which"}, {"heading": "An alternative approach: conversion into an equivalent non-probabilistic answer set program", "text": "An alternative approach to a probable conclusion without calculation \u00b5 and without counting the weighted possible worlds (\"much\") would be to find an uncommented first-order coin program that reflects the desired probable nondeterminism (choice) of a given formula 1 program. To make this idea more intuitive, we imagine that every possible world corresponds to a room.

While our current framework certainly leaves room for future improvement, we believe we have already identified a new path toward more viable, likely inductive response set programming with a high degree of meaningfulness. Ongoing work focuses on performance improvements, theoretical analysis (especially in terms of minimal sample count and inference accuracy), empirical evaluation, and exploration of viable approaches to PrASP structural learning."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work is supported by the EU FP7 CityPulse Project under grant number 603095. http: / / www.ict-citypulse.eu"}], "references": [{"title": "Probabilistic reasoning with answer sets", "author": ["Gelfond Baral", "C.
