The issue of belief revision has been studied in various formalisms, in particular, in qualitative algebras (QAs) in which the result is a disjunction of belief bases that is not necessarily representable in a QA. This motivates the study of belief revision in formalisms extending QAs, namely, their propositional closures: in such a closure, the result of belief revision belongs to the formalism. Moreover, this makes it possible to define a contraction operator thanks to the Harper identity. Belief revision in the propositional closure of QAs is studied, an algorithm for a family of revision operators is designed, and an open-source implementation is made freely available on the web.

One way to examine this problem from the point of view of presenting knowledge is to consider a formalism and to study some of them defined faith revision operators: how they are defined and how they can be implemented. In particular, it is quite easy to define a revision operator on the basis of a qualitative algebra (such as the Allen algebra) by reusing the work of Condotta et al. (2010) on the related problem of faith fusion. The result of such a faith revision is a set of faith foundations that must be interpreted disjunctively and that are not necessarily depicted as the only basis of faith: qualitative algebras are not closed under disjunction.

Intuitively, an agent (2008) provides a general detailed overview of any satisfaction of performing operators (i.e., it consists in looking at the change in their beliefs when confronted with a new set of beliefs, assuming that this type of beliefs is considered unchallengeable by the agent. However, the resulting set of beliefs is modified in such a way that the conjunction of \"I\" and \"I\" is consistent, and the result of the revision is this conjunction. Therefore, there is more than one possible operator, since the definition of \"I\" depends on how faith change is \"measured.\" More precisely, the principle of minimal change was formulated by a series of postulates known as AGM postulates - after the names of Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors and Makinson (1985)."}, {"heading": "Belief contraction", "text": "is the process of faith change associated with a set of beliefs \u043a and a set of beliefs \u00b5, a set of beliefs \u043a'\u00b5, so that ds'\u00b5 6 | = \u00b5.
