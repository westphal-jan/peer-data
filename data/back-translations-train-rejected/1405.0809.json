To date, it has been used to embed in it default logic (propositional case), autoepistemic logic, Turner's logic of universal causation, and general logic programming under stable model semantics. Besides showing the generality of GK as a logic for nonmonotonic reasoning, these embeddings shed light on the relationships among these other logics. In this paper, for the first time, we show how the logic of GK can be embedded into disjunctive logic programming in a polynomial but non-modular translation with new variables. The result can then be used to compute the extension/expansion semantics of default logic, autoepistemic logic and Turner's logic of universal causation by disjunctive ASP solvers such as claspD(-2), DLV, GNT and cmodels.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 May 2014 07:45:30 GMT  (39kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0809v1", "Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["jianmin ji", "hannes strass"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.0809"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.0809.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Implementing Default and Autoepistemic Logics via the Logic of GK", "authors": ["Jianmin Ji", "Hannes Strass"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The idea is that one starts with a set of assumptions (which are under the modal operator A), calculates the minimum knowledge under this set of assumptions, and then checks whether the assumptions are justified, that they match the resulting minimum knowledge.

If I am a complete number of literals, we use it as an interpretation when we say that it is a model of a formula, and we use it as a set of literals when we say that it brings with it a formula.

The meaning of standard theories is given by the term extensions. An extension of a standard theory (W, D) is \"interpreted as an acceptable set of beliefs that can be held about the incompletely specified world W.\" [Reiter, 1980] For a standard theory (W, D) and any set of formulas, the smallest group of formulas (S) leaves (1) W (S) satisfactory if it (S), (T), (S), (E), (E), (E), (E), (E) and then (E)."}, {"heading": "Autoepistemic Logic", "text": "Moore [1985] endeavors to formalize an ideally rational agent who thinks about his own beliefs.

In other words, T is an extension if it corresponds to what can be derived from the original beliefs A and positive and negative introspections regarding T himself. Later, it was discovered that this definition of expansions permits unfounded, self-justifying beliefs. However, such beliefs are not always desirable when they represent the knowledge of agents."}, {"heading": "The Logic of GK", "text": "The language of GK is justified in the sense that minimum knowledge is the same starting formula."}, {"heading": "Main Result: From Pure GK to Disjunctive ASP", "text": "s use trp (F) to denote the preliminary formula obtained from F by replacing each occurrence of a K-atom formula with a different formula.

We have implemented the translation prototypically and experimentally analyzed what we considered satisfactory in view of the generalization of the system. In the future, we plan to integrate further non-monotonous argumentation formalisms. This is more or less simple due to the generalization of this work: to implement a language, it is sufficient to provide a translation into pure formulas of GK, then Theorem 1 of this paper does the rest.
