It exploits algorithm selection techniques based on classification to select one among a set of out-of-the-box heterogeneous ASP solvers used as black-box engines. In this paper we report on (i) a new optimized implementation of MEASP; and (ii) an attempt of applying algorithm selection to non-ground programs. An experimental analysis reported in the paper shows that (i) the new implementation of \\measp is substantially faster than the previous version; and (ii) the multi-engine recipe can be applied to the evaluation of non-ground programs with some benefits.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 May 2014 12:45:07 GMT  (36kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0876v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marco maratea", "luca pulina", "francesco ricca"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.0876"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.0876.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Marco Maratea", "Luca Pulina", "Francesco Ricca"], "emails": ["marco@dist.unige.it", "lpulina@uniss.it", "ricca@mat.unical.it"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 5.08 76v1 [cs.AI] 5M ay2 01"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to put itself at the top of the group, which is able to put itself at the top of the group."}, {"heading": "A Multi-Engine ASP system", "text": "Next, we look at the components of the multi-engine approach, and we report on the way we instantiated this problem in order to deal with the instantiation and solution.

Each instance in a fairly designed training set of instances is analyzed taking into account both the properties and performance of each solver. An inductive model is calculated by the classification algorithms during this phase. Then, each instance is processed into a test set by first extracting its characteristics, and the solver is selected on the basis of this learned model."}, {"heading": "Implementation and Experiments", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}], "references": [{"title": "J", "author": ["Rice"], "venue": "R.", "citeRegEx": "Rice 1976", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 1976}, {"title": "and Lifschitz", "author": ["M.
