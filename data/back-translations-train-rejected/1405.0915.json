One of the most effective approaches is the Distribution Semantics which was adopted by many logic programming languages and in Descripion Logics. In this paper, we illustrate the work we have done in this research field by presenting a probabilistic semantics for description logics and reasoning and learning algorithms. In particular, we present in detail the system TRILL P, which computes the probability of queries w.r.t. probabilistic knowledge bases, which has been implemented in Prolog.

In the field of Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP for a short time), many proposals have been presented. An effective and popular approach is the distribution semantics (Sato 1995), which underlies many PLP languages, such as PRISM (Sato 1995; Sato and Kameya 2001), which are able to combine probability theory (Poole 1997), Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions (Vennekens et al al al al al al al) and ProbLog (De Raedt et al al al al al al 2007)."}, {"heading": "2 Description Logics", "text": "In this section we recall the expressive description logic ALC (Schmidt-Schau\u00df and Smolka 1991).

Here, we report on a comparison between the performance of TRILL, TRILLP and BUNDLE in calculating the query probability. We used four different bases of knowledge of varying complexity: 1) BRCA1 models of breast cancer risk factor; 2) an extract of DBPedia2 ontology derived from Wikipedia; 3) Biopax Level 33 models of metabolic pathways; 4) Vicodi4 contains information about European history.For the tests, we used a version of DBPedia and Biopax KBs without the ABox, a version of BRCA with an ABox containing 1 individuals and a version of Vicodi with an ABox containing 19 individuals. To each KB, we added 50 probabilistic axioms, which we added to each dataset we randomly created."}, {"heading": "8 Open Issues and expected achievement", "text": "Our work aims to develop fast algorithms for performing conclusions on probable DISPONTE semantics. Section 5 shows that TRILL and TRILLP can calculate the explanations for a query and its probability w.r.t. of a SHOIN (D) or an ALC probabilistic KB. For the future, we plan to improve the performance of both algorithms. We also investigate the problem of increased inference for probable logic programming by eliminating elevated variables. To this end, we are developing the LP2 system, which expands GC-FOVE by introducing two new operators, heterogeneous sum and heterogeneous multiplication. This work will be presented at ICLMaxiP 2014."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper we presented two algorithms TRILL and TRILLP for arguing about DISPONTE KBs written in Prolog.
