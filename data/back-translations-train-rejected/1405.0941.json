However, such applications are always limited by the fact that arguments of natural language cannot be processed automatically by such argumentation technologies. Arguments are usually presented either as abstract nodes of a directed graph in which the edges represent the relationships of attack and support (e.g. in abstract argumentation theory (Dung 1995) and in bipolar argumentation (Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex 2005). Natural language arguments are commonly used in argumentation literature to provide ad-hoc examples of the understanding of rationality that is then introduced, but the need to find automatic ways of processing natural language arguments."}, {"heading": "Natural Language Arguments: datasets", "text": "Within a framework of application, we can divide this task into two successive sub-areas, namely i) the recognition of the semantic relationships between the parties in dispute in a debate (i.e. when one statement supports or attacks another), and reflecting all the arguments that are part of a debate and the acceptance of the semantic arguments. To reflect this separation into two sub-areas, we must describe each dataset that we describe in the following sub-areas."}, {"heading": "Debatepedia dataset", "text": "To build our first benchmark of natural language arguments, we have selected Debatepedia and ProCon, two encyclopaedias of pros and cons arguments on critical issues. To fill out the first level of the dataset, we have manually selected a series of topics (Table 2 Topics column) of the Debatepedia / ProCon debates, and for each topic we apply the following procedure: 1. the main question (i.e., the title of the debate in its affirmative form) is considered as the starting argument; 2. every user opinion is extracted and considered as an argument; 3. since attack and support are binary relationships, the arguments are paired with the following arguments: (a) the starting argument or (b) other arguments in the discussion, to which most current arguments are put forward. (If a user opinion supports or attacks an argument, we pair the former with another user, we couple the former with the latter), we follow ged in chronological order to maintain the dialog structure; and the corresponding pairs of.e.e."}, {"heading": "Twelve Angry Men", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them are able to survive themselves without a process in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which a process occurs, in which it occurs, in which a process occurs, in which it occurs, in which a process occurs, in which it occurs, in which it occurs, in which it occurs in which it occurs, in which it occurs in a process, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs, in which it occurs in which it occurs in a process, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs in a process, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs in a process, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs, in which it occurs in which it occurs in a process, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs in a process, in which it occurs in which it occurs in a process, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs in a process, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs, in a process, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs in a process, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs, in which it occurs in a process, in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs in which it occurs"}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are able to live, in which they are able to live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live."}], "references": [{"title": "Support in abstract argumentation", "author": ["G.
