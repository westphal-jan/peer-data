In addition, the descriptions of knowledge and uncertainty that come from different sources can complement or contradict each other and have varying degrees of relevance for current or future tasks. Therefore, the widespread use of robots presents basic knowledge representation and argumentation challenges - robots must present, learn from and argue with qualitative and quantitative descriptions of knowledge and uncertainty. To achieve this goal, our architecture combines knowledge representation and non-monotonous logical reasoning capabilities of declarative programming with the uncertainty modeling capabilities of probable graphical models. The architecture consists of two tightly coupled levels and has the following key features: 1. An action language is used for HL and LL system descriptions and the definition of recorded history is expanded in the domain to allow prioritized specifications."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Probabilistic graphical models as POMDPs have been used to represent knowledge and plan sensing, navigation and interaction for robots (Hoey et al. 2010; Rosenthal and Veloso 2012). However, these formulations (per se) make it difficult to carry out common sense reasoning, e.g. standard analysis and non-monotonous logical reasoning, especially with information that is not directly relevant to the tasks in hand. In parallel, these algorithms require considerable prior knowledge of the domain, task and framework of action. Many of these algorithms also do not support the merging of new, unreliable information from sensors and humans with the cur-ar Xiv: 140 5.09 99v1 [cs.AI] 5M ayrent beliefs in a knowledge base.

Action languages are formal models of parts of the natural language that are used to describe transition diagrams. AL has a sorted signature that contains three types: static, fluidity, and actions. Static are domain properties whose truth values cannot be changed by actions, while flowability are properties whose truth values are changed by actions. Actions are defined as a series of elementary actions that can be performed in parallel. A major property p or their negation \u00ac p is a domain literal. AL allows three types of statements: a cause lin, if p0,..., pm (causal law) l, if p0,., pm (state restriction) impossible a0,.., ak, if p0,.., pm (executability condition), if a literal, lin (code) is."}, {"heading": "3.1 HL domain representation", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive themselves.

Their elements fulfill the static relationship part of (cell, space). We also introduce the static neighboring states (cell, cell) to describe the neighborhood relationship between cells. Fluents of L of space include the search results (cell, object) - robot searches a cell for an object - and two defined fluents: found (object, place) - an object was found in a place - and continues the search (space, object) - the search for an object is continued in a space.The actions of L include the HL actions, which are viewed at a higher resolution, e.g. movement is possible to specific cells."}, {"heading": "3.3 Control loop", "text": "Algorithm 1 describes the control loop3 of the architecture. First, the LHL observations that are made at the current location are supplemented by statements about the HL history, and the HL initial state (sHinit) is communicated to the LHL (line 1). The assigned task determines the HL target state (sHgoal) for the planning (line 2). Planning in HL provides for a sequence of measures with deterministic effects (line 3). In some situations, planning in HL can provide several plans, e.g. if the object to be recorded can be at one of several locations, preliminary plans can be drawn up for the various hypotheses regarding the location of the object. In such situations, all HL plans are reported to the3We as proof of the accuracy of this algorithm as future work.Algorithm 1: Control loop of the architecture input i.

To provide realistic observations in the HL-DP simulation, we recorded object models that characterize objects using probabilistic functions of features extracted from images taken by a camera on physical robots (Li and Sridharan 2013).The simulator also uses action models that reflect the motion of the robot.Specific cases of objects of different classes were simulated in a number of rooms.The experimental setup also included an initial training phase in which the robot repeatedly performed the various motion actions and applied the visual input algorithms to images of known objects. A human participant provided some of the basic truth data, e.g. labels of objects in images. A comparison of the expected and actual results was used to define the functions describing the probable transition diagram (T, O) in the L, while the reward specification is defined by objects."}, {"heading": "4.2 Experimental Results", "text": "To evaluate the results, we first compared PA with POMDP-1 in a series of studies in which the initial position of the robot is known, but the position of the object that needs to be moved is unknown. The solution approach used in POMDP-1 is a fixed amount of time to calculate action strategies. Figure 2 summarizes the ability to successfully achieve the assigned goal as a function of the number of cells in the domain. Each point in Figure 2 is the average of 1000 studies, and we put each room to have four cells. PA significantly improves the robot's ability to achieve the assigned goal compared to POMDP-1. As the number of cells (i.e., the domain) increases, it will be difficult to generate good POMDP action policies computationally, which, combined with false positive observations, significantly affects the ability of objects."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "This paper describes a knowledge presentation and argumentation architecture for robots that integrates the complementary strengths of declarative programming and probabilistic graphical models; system descriptions of tightly coupled high-level (HL) and low-level (LL) domain representations are provided using an action language; and the HL definition of recorded history is expanded to allow for prioritized default values; procedures created in HL using default values and common sense are implemented in the LL using probabilistic algorithms and generate observations that add appropriate statements to HL history; in connection with robots that move objects to specific locations in indoor areas, experimental results suggest that the architecture supports knowledge representation, non-monotonic logical consequences, and probabilistic planning with qualitative and quantitative descriptions of knowledge and uncertainty, and that the domain is becoming more complex."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank Evgenii Balai for modifying SPARC to support some of the experiments reported in this work, which was partially supported by the U.S. Office of Naval Research (ONR) Science of Autonomy AwardN00014-13-1-0766.
