Entailment with existential rules is undecidable. We focus in this paper on conditions that ensure the termination of a breadth-first forward chaining algorithm known as the chase. Several variants of the chase have been proposed. In the first part of this paper, we propose a new tool that allows to extend existing acyclicity conditions ensuring chase termination, while keeping good complexity properties. In the second part, we study the extension to existential rules with nonmonotonic negation under stable model semantics, discuss the relevancy of the chase variants for these rules and further extend acyclicity results obtained in the positive case.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 May 2014 20:58:01 GMT  (49kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1071v1", "This paper appears in the Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)"], ["v2", "Fri, 25 Jul 2014 12:49:54 GMT  (328kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1071v2", "This paper appears in the Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper appears in the Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jean-fran\\c{c}ois baget", "fabien garreau", "marie-laure mugnier", "swan rocher"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.1071"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.1071.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Baget", "Fabien Garreau", "Marie-Laure Mugnier", "Swan Rocher"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 5.10 71v2 [cs.AI] 25 Jul 2 014"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In fact, one sees oneself in a position to put oneself at the top, in the way it is: in the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is, the way it is."}, {"heading": "Preliminaries", "text": "An atom is of the form p (t1,., tk), where p is a predicate of the nature k and the ti are terms, i.e., variables or constants (in the paper we denote constants by a, b, c,... and variables by x, y, z,...).

Position-related approaches that are identified as dangerous are those that can contain existential variables; intuitively, such a cycle means that the creation of an existential variable in a given position can lead to another existential variable in the same position."}, {"heading": "Extending Acyclicity Notions", "text": "In this section, we combine rule dependence and the propagation of existential variables into a single graph. < W.l.o.g.

If A is an atom, let's say that < a > is in A, i > is in A, if term (< a, i >) is an existential (resp. frontier) variable, < a, i > is an existential (resp. frontier) position. In the following, we use \"position graph\" as a generic name to denote a graph whose node positions in atoms.We first define the notion of a basic position graph that takes each rule in isolation."}, {"heading": "Further Refinements", "text": "We define the concept of the incompatible order of unifiers, which ensures that a particular sequence of rule applications is actually impossible. In short, a marked cycle, for which all sequences of unifiers are incompatible, can be ignored, however. In addition to gaining positive rules, this sequence will allow one to take better advantage of the negation. We first point out that the term \"piece-unifier\" is not appropriate for our purpose. We need to relax it, as illustrated in the next example. We call unifier, a rule group B2 with a rule head H1, a substitution of vars (B) 2)."}, {"heading": "Handling Nonmonotonic Negation", "text": "In fact, it is not so that we see ourselves in a position to be in a position, as if we were able to survive ourselves.

Thus, we can define the C-stablefinite as the class of nonmonotonous existential rules for which the C-chase tree exists on each (F, R). Our first intuition was to claim that \"if there is (R) no C-finite, then R-stable-finite.\" However, this property is generally not true, as the following example shows: Example 14 Let R = {R1}, where R1 (x), p (x, y), h (y) and R2 = p (x, y), not h (x), p (x, x)."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "First, a new tool that makes it possible to unify and extend most existing cyclicity conditions, taking into account good arithmetic properties. Second, a hunting mechanism for non-monotonous existential rules under stable model semantics, as well as the extension of cyclicity conditions taking into account negation. This latter contribution broadens the concept of negative dependence on (Magka, Kro \ufffd tzsch and Horrocks 2013) and does not rely on layering (and therefore does not force the existence of a single stable model). This work is continued on the theoretical side by a complexity study of the allocation to the new acyclic classes and by a deeper study of the logical basis for the NME rules, as it remains to relate our core stable sets with an existing first-order semantics for general NME rules."}], "references": [{"title": "Pushing the el envelope", "author": ["Brandt Baader", "F.
