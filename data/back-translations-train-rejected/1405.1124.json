We address this challenge by developing an agent architecture and reasoning algorithms based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). ASP has been chosen for this task because it enables high flexibility of representation, both of knowledge and of reasoning tasks. Although ASP has been used successfully in a number of applications, and ASP-based architectures have been studied for about a decade, to the best of our knowledge this is the first practical application of a complete ASP-based agent architecture. It is also the first practical application of ASP involving a combination of centralized reasoning, decentralized reasoning, execution monitoring, and reasoning about network communications.

This increased utilization and congestion has created the need for new and other ways to coordinate assets that use airspace. Currently, airspace management is the job of most human controllers. As the number of units using airspace increases enormously - many of which are autonomous - the need for improved autonomy techniques becomes evident. The challenge in an environment full of UAVs is that the world is highly dynamic and the communications environment is uncertain, making coordination difficult. Communication systems in such an environment are neither reliable nor free."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "The results of the authors suggest that the effectiveness and performance of plan execution is increased with increased network awareness during the planning phase. The UAV coordination approach in this current work process combines network awareness during the reasoning process with a plan-conscious network layer. The problem of mission planning for UAVs under communication constraints was addressed in (Kopeikin et al. 2013), where an ad hoc task assignment process is used to engage under-utilized UAVs as communication relays. In our work, we do not separate planning from the engagement of under-utilized UAVs and do not rely on ad hoc, hard-wired behaviors. Our approach gives the planner more flexibility and finer control over the actions that occur in the plans, allowing the emergence of sophisticated behaviors without the need to specify them beforehand."}, {"heading": "Motivating Scenario", "text": "To underscore the need for networking, it is necessary for individual countries to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "Technical Approach", "text": "In this section we will formulate the problem in more detail, provide technical background information, discuss the design of the agent architecture and the argumentation modules, and demonstrate the sophistication of the resulting agent behavior in two scenarios."}, {"heading": "Problem Formulation", "text": "A problem instance for coordinating UAVs to observe targets and transmit information (e.g. images) to a home base is defined by a set of UAVs, u1, u2,.., a set of targets, t1, t2,.., a (possibly empty) set of fixed radio relays, r1, r2,.. and a home base. UAVs, relays, and home base are referred to as radio nodes (or network nodes). Two nodes are in radio contact when they are located at a distance between the targets, called radio range1, or when they can forward information to each other through intermediate radio nodes that are within radio range. UAVs will travel from home base to the targets to take pictures of the targets and transmit them to home base. UAV will automatically take an image when it reaches a target."}, {"heading": "Answer Set Programming", "text": "In this section we provide a definition of the syntax of ASP and its informal semantics. We refer the reader to (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1991; Niemela \ufffd and Simons 2000; Baral 2003) a definition of formal semantics. Let's be a signature that contains a constant, function and predicate symbols. Concepts and atoms are formed as usual in first order logic. A (basic) system of letters is either an atom a or its strong (also classical or epistemic) negation. A rule is a statement of the form: h1 OR. OR hk \u2190 is the answer of l1,.,. lm, not lm + 1, not ln where Hi's and li's are basic letters and not the so-called standard negation. The intuitive meaning of the rule is that an advocate who believes {l1, lm} and has no reason to believe."}, {"heading": "Agent Architecture", "text": "In fact, it is a purely reactionary project, which is a reactionary project, which is a reactionary project, which is a reactionary project, which is a reactionary project, which is a reactionary project, which is a reactionary project, which is a reactionary project, which is a reactionary project, which is a reactionary project, which is a reactionary project."}, {"heading": "Network-Aware Reasoning", "text": "The most important argumentation tasks (centralized mission planning, as well as anomaly detection, explanation and planning within each agent) are reduced to the search for models of formalizations of the corresponding problems based on answers. Central to all argumentation tasks is the ability to represent the evolution of the environment over time. Such a development is conceived into a transition diagram (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1993), a diagram whose nodes correspond to the states of the environment, and whose arc describes the transitions due to the execution of actions. Let F be a collection of flows, expressions representing relevant properties of the domain that may change over time, and let A be a collection of actions."}, {"heading": "Simulation and Experimental Setup", "text": "The simulation for the experimental component of this work was created with the Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) (Ahrenholz 2010). CORE is a real-time network emulator that allows users to create lightweight virtual nodes with a full-fledged network communication stack. CORE virtual nodes can execute unmodified Linux applications in real-time. The CORE GUI includes a basic rangebased model for emulating networks typical of mobile ad-hoc network environments (MANET). CORE provides an interface for creating complex network topologies, node mobility in one environment, and access to lower-level network conditions, such as network connectivity. The use of CORE as a real-time simulation environment allows agents, represented as CORE nodes, to execute mission plans in realistic wireless environments."}, {"heading": "Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "The drone scenarios considered in this paper are bound to become more common as more autonomy is needed to create large-scale systems. Previous work on distributed coordination and planning has mostly overlooked or simplified communication dynamics and at best treated communication as a resource or other planning constraints.Our work demonstrates the reliability and performance gains that result from network-aware thinking. In our experimental evaluation, our approach led to a reduction in mission duration of up to 30% and a total intransigence of between 50% and 100%. We expect that in more complex scenarios the benefit of a realistic networking model will be even more evident. In our experiments, the execution time has always been satisfactory, and we believe that several state-of-the-art techniques can be applied to reduce execution time as the scenarios become more complex. In the future, we intend to expand execution time by a reasonably aware, network-aware, and rational."}], "references": [{"title": "Diagnostic reasoning with A-Prolog", "author": ["Balduccini", "M.
