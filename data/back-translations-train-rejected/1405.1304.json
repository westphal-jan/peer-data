INTRODUCTION", "text": "Aquaculture refers to the breeding of aquatic organisms such as fish and aquatic plants, including the cultivation of freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled conditions. The use of sensor technologies to monitor the environment in which aquaculture operations take place is a current trend. The sensors collect data on the aquaculture environment used by farm managers for decision-making purposes. A number of activities related to decision support systems in aquaculture operations are described in the literature. Decision support systems have been developed for some of them, some of them using machine learning and methods, others not. For the sake of completeness, we will briefly discuss these other methods first and explain in the following section the methods based on machine learning. Bourke et al. [1] developed a framework that outlined real-time indicators of water quality and operational information and their impact on the survival rate, biomass and production failures of aquaculture species were evaluated by padre et al. [2] To develop a [Early growth system] for hazardous conditions developed by aquaculture physicists."}, {"heading": "2.
