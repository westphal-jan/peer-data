UNL", "text": "The UNL is defined as a digital meta-language for describing, summarizing, refining, storing, and disseminating information in a machine-independent and language-neutral form. It represents information sentence by sentence. Each sentence is represented as a hypergraph, with nodes > > > terms and slurs influencing the relationships between concepts >. This hypergraph is also represented as a set of directed binary relations between the pair of terms present in the sentence. Concepts are represented as character strings called Universal Words (UWs). Knowledge within a UNL document is expressed in three dimensions: Universal Words (UWs): Word knowledge is expressed by Universal Words that are language-independent. UWs form the UNL vocabulary and the syntactic and semantic units are combined in accordance with UNL laws to form UNL expressions. They are characterized as constraints that describe the meaning of the word in the current context."}, {"heading": "3. UNL to XML", "text": "There are a number of issues to consider when converting the UNL expression into a corresponding XML document. As one of our goals is to generate graphs from the XML document that represent knowledge in a native language, structural considerations must be considered when creating XML from UNL. A UNL XML parser is developed to analyze the required units in UNL. Figure 3 illustrates the steps for parsing the UNL document and generating XML documents. For example, consider the following UNL expression agt (read (icl > do) @ entry. @ present. @ progress, John (iof > person) UNL parser extracts Relation (agt), Head Word (read), and Universal Word (John) from UNL, and these units are used to generate the corresponding XML document."}, {"heading": "4. Graph Generation", "text": "DOM parser for Java was used to parse the XML document. After extracting the data from XML, the diagram generation tool first organizes the data as a parent-child relationship. To draw diagrams, we use the DOT scripting language provided by Graphviz (http: / / www.graphviz.org / Home.php). The diagram generation tool generates a DOT script file from XML document. A diagram can then be created using Graphviz API. The steps of graph generation are illustrated in Fig. 4."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "We have developed a tool to automatically generate XMLdocument and the corresponding graphical representation from UNL expressions. Our main focus was to represent knowledge in a native language in a graphical form and to use a universally accepted platform to represent knowledge. In addition to generating graphs and XML documents, the tool also carries the knowledge instances from UNL to XML, using the relationship (knowledge) of the totality.UNL has already been widely used as a means of machine translating Interlingua and several papers suggested that UNL can store the intended meaning of the original text. Instead of extracting knowledge from a native language, our tool uses UNL to obtain the required information from a language.The novelty of the current work is to use the advantages of UNL to represent knowledge in a widely acceptable format. Whenever knowledge-oriented minds are present in XML, it can then be used in a variety of applications and multiple tools have been used for the same thing."}, {"heading": "6.
