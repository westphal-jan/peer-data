WSD was recently addressed as a combinatorial optimization problem in which the goal is to find a sequence of senses that maximize the semantic relatedness among the target words. In this article, a novel algorithm for solving the WSD problem called D-Bees is proposed which is inspired by bee colony optimization (BCO)where artificial bee agents collaborate to solve the problem. The D-Bees algorithm is evaluated on a standard dataset (SemEval 2007 coarse-grained English all-words task corpus)and is compared to simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and two ant colony optimization techniques (ACO).

In this work, we have adapted the optimization of bee colonies meta-heuristically (BCO), which was first proposed by Teodorovic \"(2009). Social insects in general are self-organized and adapt well to ecological changes. This is usually facilitated by the exchange of information between individual insects, in order to achieve a collective intelligence (emergence) for the benefit of the colony. Unlike ants, which interact indirectly by depositing a chemical substance along the path designated as pheromone, bees interact directly by doing a kind of dance on a dance floor at Hive.First, bee scouts explore the unknown environment from which they can collect nectars for the hive. Once a food source has been found, they go back to the hive and perform a specific dance on the goodness of the food resource and the distance to that comes from this recruitment or advertising."}, {"heading": "3 D-Bees", "text": "It's a matter of time before we go in search of a solution.
