In (Liao, et al. 2013), the author summarizes remarkable expert systems from 1995 to 2004 and mentions expert systems for different science industries. Different types of expert systems have been designed and implemented in fisheries and aquaculture. In (Deng, et al. 2013), the authors propose an expert system for diagnosing fish diseases. Grant and Berks identified nine categories of knowledge that are important for finding and catching large pelagic fish and then developed an expert system based on this knowledge (Grant and Berkes 2007).

Knowledge acquisition", "text": "The first, most entrepreneurial and important step in the development of an expert system is the acquisition of knowledge (Durnkin 1994) (Sasikumar et al. 2007). We used various experts to build our knowledge base. First, we used expertise from the Encyclopedia of Aquarium & Pond Fish, a well-known encyclopaedia (Alderton 2008) and the website of Aquarium Life (Pardee n.d.). Second, we consulted human experts with academic and experimental backgrounds who work in renowned research and educational institutions (Research Centre for Aquaculture and Fisheries Department of the Islamic Azad University Ahvaz) and had at least three years of experience in aquarium conservation themselves. For each fish, a profile was defined that reflects its state of life. We gathered our information from the above sources and experts. Table 2 shows characteristic of a model fish, namely molly.Afterwards, we again used the above sources and experts to collect charts that show the compatibility of the respective particles with the very specific ones."}, {"heading": "B. Knowledge representation", "text": "When defining the problem, the state of the water for each fish must be reviewed. A rule has been defined to implement any limitation of the state of the water. For example, the following rule stipulates that if the water temperature for fish in the working memory is sufficient, this causes the fish to be appropriate and removed from the working memory. For each factor that affects the state of the water, there are similar rules in the knowledge base. As there is no strict rule for the compatibility between two fish and two fish under certain circumstances, we cannot or must not accept this uncertainty. The safety factor is a number that reflects the degree of belief in a hypothesis that has been provided (Durnkin 1994). As you can see in Figure 2, some fish are \"sometimes compatible.\" Various Factorswww.ijascse.org page 6this us existence of a hiding place for fish, the existence of a specific third fish that strengthens confidence or threatens the relationship between these factors, the number of fish and the number of fish in each other, may further increase the probability that there is a relationship between these factors (the number of fish and the number of replacement factors)."}, {"heading": "C. System derivation approach", "text": "The expert system includes the profile of 100 fish species from the Islamic Azad University Ahvaz Research Center. We compare the research results of the experts with the research results of the fisheries experts. Then the system asks the user for his current fish species. The system asks for the future compatible fish species. The results are in the form of groups of proposed compatible fish species in working memory and shows compatible fish species in groups sorted from the most compatible to less compatible prices. Since each candidate was selected by the system, new restrictions would be imposed on future compatible fish, the results are in the form of proposed compatible fish species of single fish.III. Results to evaluate the performance of our expert system, we compared our expert system with human experts in terms of conclusions. We used experiences of experts with the background of aquarium conservation for at least 3 years from two important educational and research institutions, namely the Fisheries Department of the Islamic Azad University Research Center Azhaz."}], "references": [{"title": "Encyclopedia of Aquarium & Pond Fish", "author": ["Alderton", "David."], "venue": "DK ADULT.
