We are given a unit length limitation field [0, 1] \u00b7 [0, 1] containing a given fixed block (rectangle), as shown in Figure 1 (a). The block is identified by the four constants (x1, y1, dx1, dy1), with (x1, y1) the bottom left corner of the rectangle and dx1 its width and height, respectively. Now, we assume that we are assigned the task of adjusting another block identified by the variables (x2, y2, dx2, dy2), in the same bounding box, so that the following cost function is minimized: Cost: = w1 \u00d7 dx2 + w2 \u00d7 dy2 (4) with the additional requirements that (i) touch the two blocks \"either from above, below, or sideways, and (ii) do not overload."}, {"heading": "5.

Learning to Draw Characters", "text": "This section is about automatic drawing, a novel structured output problem that consists in translating any character into its symbolic representation. (...) Specifically, the goal is to construct an equivalent vector representation of the same character (...). In this paper, we assume that the input image can be represented by a polyline consisting of a certain number of directed segments, i.e. segments identified by a starting point (xb, yb) and an end point (xe, ye). The input image is considered a set P of the coordinates of the pixels belonging to the character, while the output O is a set of directed segments {xbi, ybi, xei, yei} mi = 1. Just like the previous section, we assume that all coordinates within the unit box. Intuitively, any good output O should satisfy the following requirements (i)."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we presented a novel class of methods for structured learning problems with mixed Boolean and numerical variables. These methods, called Learning Modulo Theories, are based on a combination of structured SVMs and Satisfiability Modulo Theories. Unlike traditional first-order logic, SMT allows numerical variables and mixed logical-arithmetic constraints to be natively described and reconsidered. By leveraging existing industrial MAX-SMT and OMT solvers, LMT is well suited for dealing with hybrid constructive learning problems, avoiding the combinatorial explosion of government space that would affect equivalent FOL formulation. Experimental results on both sides of the real world show the potential of this approach. This learning framework has a wide range of potential applications, from robotics to computational creativity and design."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank Luc De Raedt, Guy Van den Broeck and Bernd Gutmann for their useful discussions."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "Modelling problems containing a mixture of Boolean and numerical variables<lb>is a long-standing interest of Artificial Intelligence.
