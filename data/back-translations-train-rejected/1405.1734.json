The state-of-the-art in solving DCOPs relies on the use of ad-hoc infrastructures and ad-hoc constraint solving procedures. This paper investigates an infrastructure for solving DCOPs that is completely built on logic programming technologies. In particular, the paper explores the use of a general constraint solver (a constraint logic programming system in this context) to handle the agent-level constraint solving. The preliminary experiments show that logic programming provides benefits over a state-of-the-art DCOP system, in terms of performance and scalability, opening the doors to the use of more advanced technology (e.g., search strategies, complex constraints) for solving DCOPs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 May 2014 20:02:09 GMT  (329kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1734v1", "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"], ["v2", "Wed, 14 May 2014 22:55:33 GMT  (343kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1734v2", "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI", "authors": ["tiep le", "enrico pontelli", "tran cao son", "william yeoh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.1734"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.1734.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Logic and Constraint Logic Programming for Distributed Constraint Optimization", "authors": ["Tiep Le", "Enrico Pontelli", "Tran Cao Son", "William Yeoh"], "emails": ["tile@cs.nmsu.edu)", "epontell@cs.nmsu.edu)", "tson@cs.nmsu.edu)", "wyeoh@cs.nmsu.edu)"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Key concepts: DCOP, CLP, Implementation"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Distributed Restraints Optimization problems (DCOPs) are descriptions of constraints Optimization problems where variables and constraints are distributed among a group of agents, and where each agent can only interact with agents who share a common constraint (Modi et al. 2005; Petcu and Faltings 2005; Yeoh and Yokoo 2012) Researchers have recognized the importance of DCOPs because they naturally capture real-world scenarios in which a collective tries to achieve optimal decisions, but without the ability to gather all information about resources and constraints into a centralized approach.

In the context of this paper, the logic program is a CLP program whose entry point is a predicate named agent: - agent (ID), (\\ + is _ leaf (ID) - > get _ utils; true), (\\ + is _ root (ID) - > compute _ utils, send _ utils, get _ value; true), (\\ + is _ leaf (ID) - > value; send _ compute)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Modeling LP-DPOP as CLP", "text": "In this section, we will illustrate the structure of the logic program that encrypts each individual agent.

Each agent has a main set of typerun agents: - proflag (argv, [Host, Port]), linda client (Host: Port), agent.The process of sending a UTIL message from b to the parent a is done simply by a code fragment of the types end util (Vars, Utils, To): - out (msg to (Host: Port), [table info b (Vars), table max b (Utils)]).The corresponding reception of UTIL messages by a is accomplished by a predicate of the form (Utils, Utils, Me (max), Utils (msb)."}, {"heading": "3.5 Some Theoretical Considerations", "text": "The solidity and completeness of the LP-DPOP system is a natural consequence of the solidity and completeness of the DPOP algorithm, together with the solidity and completeness of the CLP (FD) solver of SICStus Prolog. Since LP-DPOP emulates the calculation and communication operations of the DPOP, each of these programs is a correct and complete implementation of the corresponding agent. In the worst case, each agent in LP-DPOP, such as DPOP, must calculate, store and send a utility for each value combination of variables in the separator set of the agent. Therefore, both LP-DPOP and DPOP suffer from exponential memory requirements, i.e. the memory requirement per agent is O (maxDomw), where axDom = argmaxi | Di | and w is the induced width of the pseudo-tree."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results", "text": "In fact, most people are able to understand themselves and what they are doing."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "The use of a generic CLP solver to implement the individual agents proved to be a profitable option, far surpassing the existing DCOP technology in terms of speed and scalability. The paper also represents the tentative case for a different encoding of existing technologies; the ability to explicitly model hard constraints provides agents with additional knowledge that can be used to narrow the search space and further increase performance. In many ways, this is a preliminary effort that will be expanded in several directions. First, we believe that different types of DCOP problems can benefit from different types of local solvers within each agent; we are currently exploring the use of ASP as an alternative for coding the agents. The preliminary results are competitive and superior to those produced by DPOP.

The state of the art in solving DCOPs relies on the use of ad-hoc infrastructures and ad-hoc constraint solving procedures. This paper investigates an infrastructure for solving DCOPs that is completely built on logic programming technologies. In particular, the paper explores the use of a general constraint solver (a constraint logic programming system in this context) to handle the agent-level constraint solving. The preliminary experiments show that logic programming provides benefits over a state-of-the-art DCOP system, in terms of performance and scalability, opening the doors to the use of more advanced technology (e.g., search strategies and complex constraints) for solving DCOPs.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
