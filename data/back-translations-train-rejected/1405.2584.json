INTRODUCTION", "text": "In fact, most people who are able, are able, are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want to do, are not able to determine for themselves."}, {"heading": "2. TASK SUB-DIVISION", "text": "The task of Sentimant Analysis can be roughly divided into three levels: document level, sentence level, and function-based approaches (aspect level). [Bing Liu]"}, {"heading": "2.1 Document level Sentimant Analysis", "text": "The classification of the general feeling of a document based on the general mood of the opinion holder. This problem is essentially a problem of text classification. Here, it is generally assumed that the document was written by a single person and expresses the opinion about a single entity. One of the biggest challenges with classification at the document level is that the whole sentence in a document may not be relevant to express the opinion about a entity. Therefore, subjectivity / objectivity classification is very important in this type of classification. Irrelevant sentences must be removed from the processing functionality. Both supervised and unsupervised learning methods can be used for classification at the document level. Any supervised learning algorithm such as the naive Bayes classifier, the Support Vector Machine or the Maxmimum Entropy etc. can be used to train the system.For training and verification of data, the evaluation of the reviewer (in the form of 1-5 stereotypes) can be used on the language, which are reciprocal for learning the adjectives of the language."}, {"heading": "2.2 Sentence level Sentimant Analysis", "text": "Again, the assumption is that each sentence is written by a single person and expresses a single positive or negative opinion / sensation. Sometimes, the sentiment classification at the document level is too crude for our pupils. One of the reasons for this may be that the size of the document is too large or a more granular level of sensations needs to be derived. Many early work in the Ofsentence Level Analysis region focused on the identification of subjective sentences. Most techniques use supervised learning. This can be divided into two tasks: First, determining the old opinion about the sentence (subjective sentences) and then classifying each sentence as positive / negative or star rating. But there will also be complex sentences in the text. In such cases, a sentiment-sentiment classification is not desirable. Knowing that a sentence is positive or negative is of less use than knowing the polarity of a particular feature of a product."}, {"heading": "2.3 Feature based or Aspect level Sentiment Analysis", "text": "The product or the review. They do not identify the objectives of opinions. Much of the research is based on online reviews and blog-related data. In the case of reviews where the entity (product or service) is known, this is a simpler problem. But for blogs, forum discussions, etc., it is much more difficult, because the entity is unknown, there can also be many comparisons, and there is also a lot of irrelevant information. This problem is in some ways similar to the problem of the named entity resolution. Another interesting approach to solving the sentiment analysis was presented in [4] by using concept chains to create a diagram model of a text. The model used part of the speech tagging to extract graph relationships and perform graph queries to maintain the general mood of the text."}, {"heading": "3. DATA", "text": "Important forms of data available for sentiment analysis are: blogs, review portals, data and lexical dictionaries."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data Sets availble", "text": "Most work in this area uses movie review data for classification. Movie review data is available as a dataset http: / / www.cs.cornell.edu / People / pabo / movie-review-data. Other datasets available online are Multi-Domain Sentiment (MDS) datasets http: / / www.cs.jhu.edu / mdredze / datasets / sentiments. The MDS dataset contains four different types of product reviews extracted from Amazon.com, including books, DVDs,. Electronics and kitchen appliances, with 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews for each domain. Another available dataset on reviews is http: / / www.cs.uic.edu / liub / FBS / CustomerReviewData.zip. Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) (Stoyanov et al, 2005): News articles and other text documents are manually commented on, i.e., other opinions and emotions."}, {"heading": "3.2 Review Sites", "text": "Nowadays, almost all e-commerce websites have reviews for their product. Some of the famous review sites that have made their data available for research are: www.amazon.com (product review), www.yelp.com (restaurant review), www.CNET download.com (product review), and www.reviewcentre.com, which hosts millions of consumer product reviews."}, {"heading": "3.3 Lexical Dictionaries", "text": "Some of the famous dictionaries are: Sentiwordnet 3.0 (http: / / sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it /), which assigns three sentiment scores to each WordNet synthesis: Positivity, Negativity, Objectivity LIWC: (http: / / www.liwc.net /), Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count General Inquirer: (http: / / www.wjh.harvard.edu / \u0445 inquirer /): Word database and manually created semantic and cognitive categories, including positive and negative connotations."}, {"heading": "4. SUBJECTIVITY AND OBJECTIVITY CLASSIFICATION", "text": "The subjective sentences are the relevant texts, and the objective sentences are the irrelevant texts, so we have to sort out the sentences that are useful to us and those that are not. Subjective sentences are those sentences that contain useful information for emotional analysis, a classification known as subjectivity classification, and some work has been done that focuses on this particular problem. [1] In one of the most pointed works, the authors present a method for identifying subjectivity for emotional analysis, which is important because the irrelevant data could be eliminated from the reviews, thereby eliminating the processing costs of a large amount of textual data, and the method they propose is to use minimal cuts to produce subjective extracts from the text."}, {"heading": "5. APPLICATIONS", "text": "Mood analysis has been a hit lately and there is a lot of research in this area. Nowadays, it is used in social media monitoring and in VOCs (Voice of Customer) to track customer reviews, survey responses, competitors, etc. However, it is also practical for use in business analysis and in situations where text needs to be analysed. Mood analysis is in demand because of its efficiency. Thousands of text documents can be processed for mood (and other characteristics, including named units, themes, topics, etc.) in seconds, compared to the hours that a team of people would have to fill in manually. Because it is so efficient (state of the art is about 80 percent), many companies adopt text and mood analysis and incorporate it into their processes.Mood analysis also has many applications in business intelligence as it is a very difficult and expensive process to interview customers. It also answers some questions such as: Why does the product not sell?"}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "There are several methods for classifying text. There are several methods for classifying word and phrase. Many lexical and dictionary-based approaches [11] are used and have been quite successful, some of them even showing an accuracy of more than 70 percent for standard data sets. Another approach that is more commonly used is machine learning. In the papers mentioned, various machine learning techniques have been tested and applied: Naive Bayesian, support vector machine [9] and maximum entropy. The success of a machine learning algorithm depends on how well the features are selected and extracted. Various different features have been used, with the most common being unigrams, parts of language tagging, emoticons recognition, category tagging, using graph-based techniques. Topical modeling [10] and phase-based features [8] are also used."}, {"heading": "7. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] B. Pang and L.
