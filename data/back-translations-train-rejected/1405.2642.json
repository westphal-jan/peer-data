We introduced the knowledge base dynamics to deal with two important points: first, to handle belief states that need not be deductively closed; and the second point is the ability to declare certain parts of the belief as immutable. In this paper, we address another, radically new approach to this problem. This approach is very close to the Hansson's dyadic representation of belief. Here, we consider the immutable part as defining a new logical system. By a logical system, we mean that it defines its own consequence relation and closure operator. Based on this, we provide an abductive framework for knowledge base dynamics.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 May 2014 06:54:12 GMT  (32kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2642v1", "Applied Mathematics &amp; Information Sciences, 2014"], ["v2", "Thu, 22 May 2014 16:29:54 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2642v2", "Applied Mathematics &amp; Information Sciences, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Applied Mathematics &amp; Information Sciences, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["radhakrishnan delhibabu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.2642"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.2642.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An Abductive Framework for Horn Knowledge Base Dynamics", "authors": ["Radhakrishnan Delhibabu"], "emails": ["delhibabu@kbsg.rwth-aachen.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 5.26 42v2 [cs.LO] 2 2M ayKeyword: AGM, Immutable, Integrity Constraint, Knowledge Base Dynamics, Kidnapping."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Over the last three decades [15], we have defined connections with the Horn knowledge base as non-monotonous principles that we have adopted to address some of the limitations of deductive thinking in classical logic.

By a logical system we mean that it defines its own consequence relationship and its own closure operator. It has been shown that the relationship of the general meeting's coherence approach with this sequence operator is exactly the same as our basic approach when the IC is empty. We believe that the Horn Knowledge Base Dynamics also applies to other applications such as maintenance, diagnostics and we plan to explore it in further work [9]. Nevertheless, many developments are possible to improve existing operators or define new classes of change operators. As an immediate extension, the question arises: Is there a real application of the AGM in the 25-year theory? [18] The revision and updating of the Horn Knowledge Base Dynamics are more demanding, so that we can expand the theory to combine results similar to those of Konieczny [24] and Nayak [34]."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The author appreciates the support of RWTH Aachen, where he is a visiting scholar with an Erasmus Mundus External Cooperation Window India4EU of the European Commission at the time of writing the paper.

In this paper, we address another, radically new approach to this problem. This approach is very close to the Hansson\u2019s dyadic representation of belief. Here, we consider the immutable part as defining a new logical system. By a logical system, we mean that it defines its own consequence relation and closure operator.
