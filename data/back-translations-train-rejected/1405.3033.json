The compound textual forms and glyphs of Sindhi language presents a substantial challenge for developing Sindhi spell checker system and generating similar suggestion list for misspelled words. In order to implement such a system, phonetic based Sindhi language rules and patterns must be considered into account for increasing the accuracy and efficiency. The proposed system is developed with a blend between Phonetic based SoundEx algorithm and ShapeEx algorithm for pattern or glyph matching, generating accurate and efficient suggestion list for incorrect or misspelled Sindhi words. A table of phonetically similar sounding Sindhi characters for SoundEx algorithm is also generated along with another table containing similar glyph or shape based character groups for ShapeEx algorithm. Both these are first ever attempt of any such type of categorization and representation for Sindhi Language.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 May 2014 04:33:04 GMT  (768kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3033v1", "9 pages, 6 figures, 5 Tables, Sindhi Computing, Sindhi Language"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 6 figures, 5 Tables, Sindhi Computing, Sindhi Language", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zeeshan bhatti", "ahmad waqas", "imdad ali ismaili", "dil nawaz hakro", "waseem javaid soomro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3033"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.3033.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Phonetic based SoundEx & ShapeEx algorithm for Sindhi Spell Checker System", "authors": ["Zeeshan Bhatti", "Ahmad Waqas", "Ali Ismaili", "Nawaz Hakro", "Javaid Soomro"], "emails": ["zeeshan.bhatti@usindh.edu.pk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Authors: Zeeshan Bhatti, Institute of Information and Communication Technology, University of Sindh, Jamshoro, Pakistan.

A study of trends in Sindhi text errors and patterns shows that the most common spelling effects are the phonetically similar words with (i) similar sound / pronunciation and (ii) similar shape / glyph of Sindhi characters [6] the motivation to first develop a phonetically based algorithm for Sindhi text before a more practical Sindhi spell checker can be developed."}, {"heading": "Related Work:", "text": "In this context, it must also be mentioned that the persons mentioned by him are persons who are able to comply with the rules and that they are able to comply with the rules.

Therefore, in order to develop a Sindhi spell checker system, we first need to figure out how to generate the suggestion list. In order to develop a method or routine for finding similar word lists, a simple architecture consisting of three main algorithms was implemented in Figure 2. According to this architecture, the three algorithms used in the system are the Levenshtein Edit Distance Algorithm (also commonly known as the Edit Distance Algorithm), the second is the Sindhi Phonetic SoundEx Algorithm, and the last algorithm used is the ShapeEx Pattern Matching Algorithm. The Levenshtein Algorithm was not discussed in this essay because there is already a huge level of literacy on the topic, and currently, for the context of this essay, each form of similar Sindhi words has been designed to be combined with each other in similar algorithms."}, {"heading": "SoundEx Algorithm:", "text": "The first algorithm for generating similar words suggestion list is the SoundEx phonetic algorithm, which is used to encode the words and characters by their sound or pronunciation. According to this algorithm, each character or letter in a language is assigned a number or code, and the characters with similar homophones are all grouped with the same code, so that when comparing, the words with similar homophones characters can be matched, regardless of minor differences in spelling. For Sindhi language, the letter is grouped by the similar homophones of each character, as shown in Table 1. All letters in Sindhi language have been grouped and an alphanumeric code has been assigned to each group. There are also few characters in Sindhi language that cannot be grouped with any other characters, other than their pronunciation is completely different from the other characters of the characters. There are 22 groups that are generated for Sindhi.Ex according to the Sindhi algorithm algorithm we created for Sindhi algorithm."}, {"heading": "ShapeEx Algorithm:", "text": "The second algorithm used in the Sindhi spell checker system to generate the similar word suggestion list is the ShapeEx algorithm, which is used to encode words and characters by similarity of form and glyph, and is therefore also known as the glyph matching algorithm. Similar to the soundEx algorithm, each character or letter in the Sindhi script is assigned a number or code, and all characters with similar shapes or glyphs are all grouped with the same code, so that when comparing the words with similar shapes, regardless of minor differences in spelling. For Sindhi language, the character was grouped by similarity of the shapes or glyphs of each character, as in Table 4. All letters in Sindhi language were grouped, and a simple alpha numeric code was assigned to each group."}, {"heading": "Results:", "text": "The phonetic algorithms, SoundEx and ShapeEx are the most commonly used algorithms in English and other regional language spell checkers, and the previous work done in this regard for Sindhi language is non-existent. Therefore, two tables were first created that define Sindhi letters based on SoundEx and ShapeEx principles. We then developed a test application to examine our results by implementing these two algorithms, as shown in Figure 3. The application uses an internal Sindhi keyboard that is mapped directly to the English keyboard, so the user is freed from the tedium of installing and setting up regional language settings; as discussed by Bhatti and al to enter the Sindhi text without installing the additional Sindhi keyboard. As the user enters the text into the application, all wrong or misspelled words are marked with a red line."}, {"heading": "Conclusion and Future Work:", "text": "In this essay, we discussed the first attempt to solve the problem of developing a Sindhi spell checker. We used phonetic based Sindhi SoundEx and ShapeEx algorithms. Sindhi is a very rich and ancient language, but unfortunately no previous attempt was made to create such a system; to the best of our knowledge and belief. We used a combinational approach to generate a similar word list for the misspelled Sindhi string. A phonetic based Sindhi SoundEx algorithm was developed together with a pattern or glyph matching algorithm called ShapeEx. For these two algorithms, we used for the first time the phonetic grouping of Sindhi characters based on their pronunciation and secondly on their shapes or glyph representations, the system is able to correctly identify the misspelled words and then provides the most suggested exactly by the user when they are requested for the word correction."}, {"heading": "Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp: 89-94.", "text": "[18].
