In this paper, a new theory, called as D numbers theory (DNT), is systematically developed to address this issue. The combination rule of two D numbers is presented. An coefficient is defined to measure the exclusive degree among the hypotheses in the framework of discernment. The combination rule of two D numbers is presented. If the exclusive coefficient is one which means that the hypothesis in the framework of discernment is exclusive of each other totally, the D combination is degenerated as the classical Dempster combination rule.

Introduction", "text": "Quantitative handling of incomplete, uncertain, and inaccurate information justifies the use of soft computing methods [1]. However, soft computing methods such as fuzzy set theory [2], rough theorem [3, 4], Dempster-Shafer evidence theory [5, 6] can essentially provide rational solutions to complex real-world problems. Traditional Bayesian (subjectivist) probability approaches cannot distinguish between aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, and are unable to deal with unspecific, ambiguous, and contradictory information without strong assumptions. These limitations can be addressed in part by applying Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, which has proven flexible enough to combine the rigor of probability theory with the flexibility of rule-based systems."}, {"heading": "2.

(Let's express the \"uncertainty\" by assigning the basic probability number to a subset of N objects, rather than relying on an individual object. (A) = 1 (10) BPA has the advantage of directly expressing the \"uncertainty\" by assigning the basic probability number to a subset of N objects, rather than relying on an individual object. Nevertheless, there are some strong hypotheses and hard limitations on the framework of discrimination and BPA, which must limit the representation of the Dempster-Shafer theory in relation to the unclear information of the discriminatory ability on the hand."}, {"heading": "3.2.

The smaller, the more exclusive the propositions of the application are. If \u03b5 = 0, the application propositions are completely excluded. That is, this situation depends on the requirements of the Dempster-Shafer proof theory. Firstly, the combination rule of the D numbers should be subtracted from the exclusive coefficient \u03b5, which can ensure that the elements are excluded within the scope of the evaluation."}, {"heading": "3.3.

Five performance criteria are considered: (1) emotional perseverance (C1) (3) personality (C4) (5) self-confidence (C5) Figure 5 shows the hierarchical structure of the decision-making process. The proposed method is now applied to solve this problem."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "One of the assumptions to apply the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is that all elements in the differentiation framework should be mutually exclusive. However, it is difficult to fulfill the requirement in the real world. In this paper, a new mathematical tool for modeling uncertain information, called D numbers, is used to model and combine the opinions of domain experts on the condition that linguistic constants are not mutually exclusive. An exclusive coefficient is proposed to discount the D numbers. Once the discounted D numbers are available, the opinion of domain experts can be merged based on our proposed rule of combination of D numbers. It is inevitable to address the subjective opinion of experts, the proposed D numbers is a promising methodology as it provides more flexible ways to deal with uncertain than the classical evidence theory. Although the D numbers illustrate the theory when dealing with mutual situations, the D numbers illustrate each other in this theory can deconstruct."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The author highly appreciates Professor Shan Zhong, the Chinese academic from the Academy of Engineering, for his encouragement of this work.

modeling of uncertain information in real world is still an open issue. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is one of the most commonly used methods. However, the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory has the assumption that the hypothesis in the framework of discernment is exclusive of each other. This condition can be violated in real applications, especially in linguistic decision making since the linguistic variables are not exclusive of each others essentially. In this paper, a new theory, called as D numbers theory (DNT), is systematically developed to address this issue. The combination rule of two D numbers is presented. An coefficient is defined to measure the exclusive degree among the hypotheses in the framework of discernment. The combination rule of two D numbers is presented. If the exclusive coefficient is one which means that the hypothesis in the framework of discernment is exclusive of each other totally, the D combination is degenerated as the \u2217Corresponding author: Yong Deng, School of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, China.
