Even if various authors have underlined its importance for probabilistic logic programming (PLP), lifted inference has been applied up to now only to relational languages outside of logic programming. In this paper we adapt Generalized Counting First Order Variable Elimination (GC-FOVE) to the problem of computing the probability of queries to probabilistic logic programs under the distribution semantics. In particular, we extend the Prolog Factor Language (PFL) to include two new types of factors that are needed for representing ProbLog programs. These factors take into account the existing causal independence relationships among some of the random variables and are managed by the extension to variable elimination proposed by Zhang and Poole for dealing with convergent variables and heterogeneous factors. Two new operators are added to GC-FOVE for treating heterogeneous factors. The resulting algorithm, called LP^2 for Lifted Probabilistic Logic Programming, has been implemented by modifying the PFL implementation of GC-FOVE and tested on three benchmarks for lifted inference. The comparison with PITA and ProbLog2 shows the potential of the approach.

The probability of a set of variables X taking the value x can be expressed as a product of n factors if: P (X = x) = i = 1,..., n \u03c6i (xi) Zwhere xi is a subvector of x that depends on the i-th factor and Z is a normalization constant (i.e. Z = x = i = 1,..., n \u03c6i (xi))). Bayean networks are an example where there is a factor for each variable that is a function of the variable Xi and its parents Xj.. Xk, so that these dimensions (Xi, Xj. Xk) = P (Xi | Xj.) and Z = 1.

Variable elimination (ve) (Zhang and Poole 1996) is an algorithm for calculating this trailing probability in factored probability distributions. The key idea is then to eliminate the random variables one by one from a series of factors until only the query variable X is left. To do this, one eliminates a variable V by first multiplying all factors that include V into a single factor; V can then be calculated by summing up the newly constructed factor.Formally, suppose 1 (X1. Xi, Y1. Yy.) and 2 (Y1. Yj.

All tests were performed on a machine with an Intel dual core E6550 2.33GHz processor and 4GB of memory. The workshop attributes problem differs from Example 1 because the first set for the series is missing and the second set contains a probable atom in its body. The competing workshop problems differ from workshop attributes because it differs from workshop attributes, a set of competing workshops W, each with a binary hot (W) variable indicating whether it is focused on popular research areas."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We have proven that with the introduction of the two new heterogeneous operators, we can calculate the probability of queries following the distribution semantics very efficiently.

Even if various authors have underlined its importance for probabilistic logic programming (PLP), lifted inference has been applied up to now only to relational languages outside of logic programming. In this paper we adapt Generalized Counting First Order Variable Elimination (GC-FOVE) to the problem of computing the probability of queries to probabilistic logic programs under the distribution semantics. In particular, we extend the Prolog Factor Language (PFL) to include two new types of factors that are needed for representing ProbLog programs. These factors take into account the existing causal independence relationships among random variables and are managed by the extension to variable elimination proposed by Zhang and Poole for dealing with convergent variables and heterogeneous factors. Two new operators are added to GC-FOVE for treating heterogeneous factors. The resulting algorithm, called LP for Lifted Probabilistic Logic Programming, has been implemented by modifying the PFL implementation of GC-FOVE and tested on three benchmarks for lifted inference. A comparison with PITA and ProbLog2 shows the potential of the approach.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
