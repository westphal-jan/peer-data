Although important potential applications in areas such as medicine, finance and networking abound, a convincingly practical implementation of PSI has yet to come to the surface. This situation is particularly acute in the context of smartphone apps, where we probably have the most exciting and relevant use cases of PSI [5, 6], but the strict CPU and memory constraints slow down the performance of existing PSI algorithms in a matter of seconds."}, {"heading": "2 Proposed Algorithm", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Encryption", "text": "The algorithms begin with the encryption of W, for which there is an encryption."}, {"heading": "2.2 Finding the Intersection", "text": "The goal of PSI is for the two users to discover the intersection point of their respective private sets W and W. To do this, they simply measure the intersection point of their encrypted Sn and S'n. If both private sets have at least partial n elements in common, this intersection point will not be empty and each user can easily find out which n-tuples are responsible for this intersection point and to what extent. In the course of calculating Sn, for example, the user can create an inverted dictionary in which elements of Sn are mapped to lists of elements in the ratio i. Then, knowledge of Sn identifies a subset of Sn that the dictionary then maps to a group of elements Y, and we can assign a \"suitable score\" to each of the original elements mapped by the ratio i | i | i | i | n."}, {"heading": "3 A Geometrical Application", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one will be able to move to another world, in which one must move to another world, in which one is able to move to another world, in which one is able to move to a new world, in which one is able to move to a new world, in which one is able to move to a new world, in which one is able to move to a new world, in which one is able to move to a new world, in which one is able to move to a new world, in which one is able to move to move to a new world, in which one is able to move to move to a new world, to move to a new world, to move to a new world, to move to a new world, to move to a new world, to move to a new world, to move to a new world, to move to a new world, to move to a new world, to move to a new world, to a new world, to move to a new world, to a new world, to a new world, to a new world."}, {"heading": "4 Application to Message Comparison", "text": "In fact, the two are a'very selective' group, which is able to form a'very selective group', which is a'very selective group', which is' a very selective group ', which is' a very selective group ', which is' a very selective group ', which is' a very selective group ', which is' a very selective group ', which is' a very selective group ', which is' a very selective group ', which is' a very selective group ', which is' a very selective group, 'a very selective group,' a very selective group, 'a very selective group,' a very selective group, 'a very selective group,' a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group, a very selective group,"}, {"heading": "4.1 Encryption Storage", "text": "The amount of disk space required to store an encryption Sn is not entirely negligible; medium-length messages encrypted with S2 typically generate a list of thousands of keys (i.e. 10-100 KB), and this increases exponentially at higher levels of encryption (see Figure 5). The example of \"Blue Sapphire Laser Millisecond Pulse Reheat\" in the US automotive industry as a text file is over 500 K, although in bit packaging the 62461 key (32-bit int each) really only takes up half of that disk space. Standard compression tools can reduce this storage requirement by a factor [10]; in this way, most encrypted messages typically take up the space of a thumbnail."}, {"heading": "4.2 Encryption Speed", "text": "The encryption of a set needs to be done only once in this algorithm, and this represents the majority of the total time spent. Compared to other sets, intersections then follow sorted sets that are fast: partial for small (< 104 elements) to 10 ms for large sets of millions of elements [11]. Figure 6 below shows upper-limit timing metrics for encryption - note that these are non-optimized single-thread speeds, while the algorithm is actually highly parallelisable (e.g. any n-tuple combination can be executed in (1) on its own thread), so those times can easily be an order of magnitude smaller in a production environment.11 For all but the highest encryption levels (S4 and higher), this initial runtime overhead is comparable to what current PSI techniques use in (1) each sentence comparison. In situations where a set is compared multiple times with the number of other sets, the overhead is compared over this number."}, {"heading": "5 Use Cases for Fast PSI", "text": "In the social sphere, i.e. in the area of comparing interests, it is quite likely that users will offer a much more liberal type of interest than they currently do with public protocols, since assurances that conflicting interests will not be disclosed to anyone. The fact that their private lists can be persistently stored in encrypted form negates the need for a simultaneous transmission protocol: one-sided matching is a very quick and practical option. A few examples: \u2022 Privacy-Preserving Social Networking: Users compare lists of private profile descriptors in order to establish relevant new connections. \u2022 Advertising: Marketers compare a list of potential features of advertising with private stakeholders to predict the success of advertising. \u2022 Scientific collaboration: researchers compare lists of key terms to find potential collaborators without naming their ideas or intentions."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and Remarks", "text": "This year, it has never been as good as it has been this year."}, {"heading": "Appendix A: n-Sum Encryption", "text": "# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"}, {"heading": "Appendix B: Overlapping Shapes Code", "text": "# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2014, "abstractText": "Private Set Intersection (PSI) is usually implemented as a sequence of encryption rounds between pairs of users, whereas the present work implements PSI in a simpler fashion: each set only needs to be encrypted once, after which each pair of users need only one ordinary set comparison.
