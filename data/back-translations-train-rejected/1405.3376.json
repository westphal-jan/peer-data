For two arguments A, B, Arg the relationship A \u2192 B means that argument A attacks argument B. For A, Arg define AttAF (A) = {B, B, A}. Semantics is given to each abstract argument frame using extensions [Dun95] or labels [WC10]. In this work we use the latter. A, labeling L is a function L: Arg \u2192 {in, out, undec}, which assigns each argument A, labeling L, either the value in, meaning that the argument is accepted, out, meaning that the argument is not accepted, or undec, meaning that the status of the argument is undecided.

A probability function P in a given area is a function P: 2X \u2192 [0, 1] with other arguments X (X) = 1. Let P: 2Arg \u2192 [0, 1] be a probability function on Arg. We abbreviateP (A) = [0, 1] This means that the probability of an argument is the sum of the probabilities of all arguments containing this argument. The following definition is a generalization of the notion of epistemic extensions given in [Hun13]. For an argument A, it is labeled if it is believed to a certain degree (which we identify as P) > 0.5), it is labeled if it is labeled to a certain degree."}, {"heading": "4 Standard epistemic extensions", "text": "We will consider some constraints on the probability function, which can take into account different aspects of the structure of the argumentation diagram.

If this is the case, then it would be desirable to have techniques to handle this incomplete information. Ideally, we would identify an appropriate mapping for all arguments based on the mapping to the remaining arguments."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we have examined the use of a probability function to represent the belief in an argument. We use this to identify an epistemic label and thus an epistemic extension. The notion of an epistemic extension is very general, since there are no limitations on the probability function in general. However, we have taken into account various limitations of the probability function, which lead to two views on the use of probability functions, namely the standard view and the non-standard view. Many of the limitations of the probability function that we have examined take into account aspects of the structure of the argument graph. We have applied our classification of the properties of probabilistic reasoning to the problem of supplementing partial probability assignments. An initial investigation leads us to believe that maximizing entropy within the probability functions of a particular type provides adequate results for this problem. In future work, we will examine this problem in more depth."}], "references": [{"title": "A logical account of formal argumentation", "author": ["M. Caminada", "D.
