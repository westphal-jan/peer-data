The most successful statistical methods (e.g. n-gram-based) require much larger corpora of aligned data than we currently have, but some smarter algorithms such as chart parsing (the CYK) algorithm with probable grammars (PCFGs) should already be applicable on the current scale of our data, possibly complemented by leaner memory-based approaches such as k-next-door neighbor in the MBT toolkit."}, {"heading": "1.
