Intuitively, it is assumed that it uses KF to designate a proposal F that is true in some beliefs of the agent. This extension is useful in discussing its application to the formalization of sound thinking.

Here, we consider a trace of the effects of executing an action sequence as a belief, so we can intuitively encode these safety conditions in epistemic specification constraints. We use non-executable actions, contradictory, to determine that a state is illegal, success, to sign a state that meets the goal, and the goal (m) to denote the state that is reached after a certain number of m."}, {"heading": "4.2 Constraints Satisfaction", "text": "In some situations, limitations of variables are associated with epistemic characteristics, that is, the value of a variable is influenced not only by the values of other variables, but also by all possible values of other variables.

An essential feature of this solver is that its language is more compact than that defined in literature, but is capable of representing many subjective literals through a set of transformation rules. Furthermore, this solver can compute worldviews under gel funds of new definition, while the language presented by Zhang in (Zhang 2007) and Watson in (Watson 1994) is based on the early definition of epistemic specifications. Furthermore, we find the compact coding of compliant planning problems and constraint satisfaction problems in the epistemic specification language, which primarily demonstrates the potential of ESmodels in applications."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "We appreciate the support of Projects 60803061 and 61272378 by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and of Project BK2008293 by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu.1 In early related work, Gelfond explored the value of epistemological specifications in formalizing common sense."}], "references": [{"title": "A logic programming approach to knowledge-state planning, ii: The dlvk system", "author": ["T.
