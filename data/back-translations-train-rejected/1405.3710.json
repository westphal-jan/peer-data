Three systems, LP2SAT3 + GLUCOSE, LP2SAT3 + LINGELING and LP2SAT3 + PLING-MT, rely on SAT translation, which involves the normalization of aggregates and the coding of level mappings for non-leaky problem substances, the latter part being expressed in terms of bit vector logic or acyclicity checks, both supported by the back-end SMT solvers of the LP2VV2 + BOOLECR and BOT systems."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "The 5th ASP Contest is jointly organized by the University of Calabria (Italy), Aalto University (Finland) and the University of Genoa (Italy) and is part of the 30th International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2014).The main objectives of the 5th ASP Contest are to measure progress in ASP solving and to promote the adoption of the standard format ASP-Core-2. In this paper, the design of the 5th edition of the ASP Contest was presented, together with an overview of the participants.

It features a completely re-designed setup, with novelties involving the design of tracks, the scoring schema, and the adherence to a fixed modeling language in order to push the adoption of the ASP-Core-2 standard.
