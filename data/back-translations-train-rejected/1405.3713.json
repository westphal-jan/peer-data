Evans, Barston and Pollard carried out a psychological syllogistic reasoning task to prove this effect. Participants were asked whether they would accept or reject a given syllogism. We discuss one specific case which is commonly assumed to be believable but which is actually not logically valid. By introducing abnormalities, abduction and background knowledge, we adequately model this case under the weak completion semantics. Our formalization reveals new questions about possible extensions in abductive reasoning. For instance, observations and their explanations might include some relevant prior abductive contextual information concerning some side-effect or leading to a contestable or refutable side-effect. A weaker notion indicates the support of some relevant consequences by a prior abductive context. Yet another definition describes jointly supported relevant consequences, which captures the idea of two observations containing mutually supportive side-effects. Though motivated with and exemplified by the running psychology application, the various new general abductive context definitions are introduced here and given a declarative semantics for the first time, and have a much wider scope of application. Inspection points, a concept introduced by Pereira and Pinto, allows us to express these definitions syntactically and intertwine them into an operational semantics.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 May 2014 23:12:45 GMT  (39kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3713v1", "14 pages, no figures, 1 table"], ["v2", "Fri, 16 May 2014 02:27:40 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3713v2", "14 pages, no figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, no figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["lu\\'is moniz pereira", "emmanuelle-anna dietz", "steffen h\\\"olldobler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3713"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.3713.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Contextual Abductive Reasoning with Side-Effects", "authors": ["Lu\u0131\u0301s Moniz Pereira", "Emmanuelle-Anna Dietz", "Steffen H\u00f6lldobler"], "emails": ["lmp@fct.unl.pt", "dietz@iccl.tu-dresden.de", "sh@iccl.tu-dresden.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 5.37 13v2 [cs.A"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In the context of abductive thinking, the discovery of abductive explanations for some given primary observations requires that one also wants to verify whether some other given secondary observations are true, as the logical consequences of the abductive explanations found for the primary observation. In other words, whether the secondary observations are plausible in the abductive context of the primary observation is a common scientific reasoning task. Thus, for example, one can try to find abductive explanations for such secondary observations strictly within the context of the present abductive explanations for the primary observation - that is, to prohibit new abductions - or still allow additional abductions as long as they coincide with the primary.

As specified by the classical hypothetical-deductive method (Hempel 1966), scientific research is conducted in three phases: hypotheses generation, prediction, and evaluation. One or more hypotheses can be generated by kidnapping to explain observed events. Therefore, a generated set of hypotheses (or assumptions) can be applied to the prediction of invisible events by derivation, with the implicit condition that no further abductions are made (cf. Pereira and Pinto (2011). The predicted events can then hopefully be tested against reality in the form of such observable side effects to evaluate the plausibility of the hypotheses. Abduction or inference to the best explanation (their usual designation in the philosophy of science) is a method of reasoning, selecting those hypotheses that are considered to be true when some areas of evidence are observed or observed in order to satisfy."}, {"heading": "4.1 Abductive Framework", "text": "The question we have to ask is whether there is at all an alternative that can take either its positive or negative form to produce an abductive explanation for an observation - or a solution for a query that has a consistent set of assumed hypotheses in the form of abductible.An abductive solution in the form of abductible.An abductive solution in the form of abductible.An abductive solution in the form of abductible.An abductive solution is a consistent set of assumed hypotheses in the form of abductible.An abductive solution in the form of abductible.An abductive explanation for an abductive explanation for an observation - or a solution to a query - that is a consistent set of accepted hypotheses in the form of abductible.An abductible solution is a consistent set of abductive views in the form of abductible.A"}, {"heading": "4.2 Usual Contextual Abduction", "text": "An important extension of abduction relates to the problem that whenever the discovery of abductive solutions, i.e. explanations, is to be verified for some particular primary observations, whether some other given secondary observations are true, a logical consequence of the abductive explanations found for the primary observation is false. In other words, whether the secondary observations are plausible in the inductive context of the primary observation, we may also want to know some of the side effects of these assumptions. We address the problem of relaxing or loosening the implicit condition, which is not permitted while considering the observable side effects explained by deductive prediction. In other words, prediction may be permitted to make recourse to additional assumptions, but nevertheless we must apply at least some of the initial explanations."}, {"heading": "5 Inspection Points", "text": "Until now, we assumed that the possible observations could be taken for granted and easily identified from the appropriate context, which was the exception and which is the usual case.

In what follows, we discuss this approach and show how checkpoints can be modeled for our previous examples in terms of ductive logic programming, and show how to use them to investigate side effects of interest in order to choose between abductive solutions. In what follows, we add this approach and show how checkpoints for our previous examples can be modeled accordingly, in terms of abductable programs.

Evans, Barston and Pollard carried out a psychological syllogistic reasoning task to prove this effect. Participants were asked whether they would accept or reject a given syllogism. We discuss one specific case which is commonly assumed to be believable but which is actually not logically valid. By introducing abnormalities, abduction and background knowledge, we adequately model this case under the weak completion semantics. Our formalization reveals new questions about possible extensions in abductive reasoning. For instance, observations and their explanations might include some relevant prior abductive contextual information concerning some side-effect or leading to a contestable or refutable side-effect. A weaker notion indicates the support of some relevant consequences by a prior abductive context. Yet another definition describes jointly supported relevant consequences, which captures the idea of two observations containing mutually supportive side-effects. Though motivated with and exemplified by the running psychology application, the various new general abductive context definitions are introduced here and given a declarative semantics for the first time, and have a much wider scope of application. Inspection points, a concept introduced by Pereira and Pinto, allows us to express these definitions syntactically and intertwine them into an operational semantics.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
