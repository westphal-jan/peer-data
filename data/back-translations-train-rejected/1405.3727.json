Data analysis is one way to reduce the dropout rate and increase the enrollment rate at the university. In fact, the number of first-year dropouts is quite high, especially in the first semester.The dropout rate at the boarding school depends on the education system introduced by the university. Current research results are as follows: 12 | P a g e Predicting dropouts at an early stage of studies not only helps management to focus more on the smart students, but also to make more efforts in developing programs for the weaker ones in order to improve their progress and at the same time to try to avoid dropouts. The knowledge generated will be very useful to better understand the problem and to have adequate planning or decision to reduce the dropout rate. This study is quite useful for better planning and implementing educational programs and infrastructure to increase the enrollment rate of certain students at the university."}, {"heading": "1.4 Social Implication of this Research", "text": "Dropouts are also more likely than graduates to become dependent on benefits, engage in illegal activities, and experience health and affective problems [54, 55, 13]. Finally, a high dropout rate creates a negative impulse for young people in a society, especially in difficult economic times when a high school degree does not guarantee a job. Such dynamics could encourage even higher dropout rates in the future. To overcome these problems, this research will be very helpful. To reduce dropout rates or predict students who need special attention, we need to focus on parental support, personal and family factors, the campus environment, and the quality of education. The results of this case study focus on policy makers with an overview of the dropout problem research and the best strategies to build an early warning system that can control the most pressing issues facing institutions."}, {"heading": "1.5 Objective", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them are able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves, \"he said in an interview with the\" New York Times, \"in which he focused on the role of the\" New York Times \"and the\" New York Times. \"\" I am very proud that I am able to change the world, \"he said to the\" New York Times, \"\" New York Times, \"\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" New York, \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"New York Times,\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" New York Times, \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\" the \"the\""}, {"heading": "METHODOLOGY", "text": "In the present study, information on various parameters was collected using a structured questionnaire based on a face-to-face interview from a composite sample of 220 undergraduate (BCA and B.Tech) students in Computer Science / Information Technology at the University.
