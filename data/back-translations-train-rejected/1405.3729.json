Recently, one of the remarkable facts in higher educational institute is the rapid growth data and this educational data is expanding quickly without any advantage to the educational management. The main aim of the management is to refine the education standard; therefore by applying the various data mining techniques on this data one can get valuable information. This research study proposed the \"classification model for the student's enrollment process in higher educational courses using data mining techniques\".

Data mining is rooted in three family lines: statistics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Statistics is based on many technologies such as regression analysis, standard distribution, standard variance, standard deviation, cluster analysis and differentiated analyses. Data mining builds on these technologies and these technologies are also useful to study data and data relationships. Data mining classification algorithms use statistical methods to create decision trees and rules to validate machine learning based models. Artificial intelligence is based on heuristics and is used to apply human thought processing to statistical issues. Data mining incorporates ideas from artificial intelligence and pattern recognition such as signal processing or visualization techniques. Machine learning is a combination of statistics and artificial intelligence because it mixes artificial intelligence with advanced statistical analysis.Figure 1.1 shows intersections of data mining with various related technologies."}, {"heading": "Data Mining Definition", "text": "A knowledge finding process in databases consists of the following steps: StatisticArtificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition Data Mining Understanding the Requirements Selection of a Target Data Set Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing Integration of the Data Set Modeling Select Data Mining Algorithms Evaluation of the results Testing the results Using this found knowledge"}, {"heading": "Working of Data mining", "text": "Data mining is the process of analyzing and aggregating data into useful information. Data mining software is an analytical tool that allows the data to be analyzed, categorized and aggregated.

Classification is the process of searching for a set of models or functions that describe and differentiate data classes or concepts, with the aim of being able to predict from the model the class of objects whose class name is unknown. Unlike a classification model, the purpose of the predictive model is to determine the future outcome and not the current behavior. Its output can be categorical or numerical value. It is a supervised learning, as the classes are determined before the data is examined. Clustering: Clustering is best suited to find groups of similar data elements. Clustering divides a group of data elements into classes, so that similar characteristic elements are grouped together. Association analysis: It is used to discover relationships between attributes and elements, as the presence of one pattern implies the presence of another pattern. Association rule is a popular technique for market banner groups, unable to combine all possible product combinations."}, {"heading": "Data Mining Advantages", "text": "Data Mining is so sought after because of its many advantages. We have many cheaper techniques to collect and manage the data, but there are only a few techniques to extract useful knowledge from this data. Data Mining has several advantages in many areas.

A credit card issuer can detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

Method: After initial research, choose a classification method for data mining. Evaluate: Find a method that is capable of correctly classifying a data set of a student with a success rate of at least 70%. For this requirement, the Decision Tree method is used here to develop a classification model that provides a model accuracy of 69.69%. 1.4 Research Contribution This project aims to develop a classification model for enrollment programs using data mining techniques.
