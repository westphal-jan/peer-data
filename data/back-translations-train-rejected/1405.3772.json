We have divided the task into two stages: (1) produce INAUT text that corresponds to a particular node of S.; (2) convert INAUT language to LitINAUT. Suppose that a node S of S. Creating the corresponding INAUT text is typically a Natural Language Generation problem. Reiter & Dale [4, \u00a7 3.3] divide the language generation task into seven subtasks: content determination, document structuring, lexicalization, aggregation, reference to expression generation and structure realisation.Determination of the content by means of algorithm 1, we find the subgraph K of K that is geographically most relevant to S.

In other cases, such as in \"est divise par\" of Fig. 2, it is imperative to group some relationships: The text representing \"an i\" must immediately follow the text representing \"diviseuri,\" since indices disappear in the textual realization and only proximity allows to distinguish the dividers of the whole. Another important phenomenon is the text added by default: for example, to realize the relationship \"est divise par,\" we must add the number of dividers by counting the members of the relationship of the type \"diviseur\" and generating \"en deux parties\" (= in two parts). Aggregation and reference expressions are generated: LitINAUT language. At this stage, the generation of INAUT par has been completed. The result, as seen in Fig. 3, is not very eloquent, but remains intimately related to the AUL structure, so that we create two sentences in order to AUL."}, {"heading": "La plage est domine\u0301e par l\u2019agglome\u0301ration.", "text": "\"L '[anse de la Ville] est borde \u0301 e par une plage, domine \u0301 e par l'agglome\" ration.In other cases, successive sentences have the same subject and verb; in this case we use conjunction:"}, {"heading": "La [baie de Banyuls] est limite\u0301e au NW par le [cap d\u2019Osne].", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "La [baie de Banyuls] est limite\u0301e a\u0300 l\u2019Est par l\u2019[\u0302\u0131le Grosse]. \u00d1 La [baie de Banyuls] est limite\u0301e au NW par le [cap d\u2019Osne] et a\u0300 l\u2019Est par l\u2019[\u0302\u0131le Grosse].", "text": "If we have an objective identity, but with different verbs, reference expressions are generated:"}, {"heading": "La [baie de Banyuls] est divise\u0301e en deux parties par. . .\u00d1 Elle est divise\u0301e en deux parties par. . .", "text": "In some cases, text is omitted during realization because it is taken out of context: For example, when realizing the text that corresponds to a subdivision of the type \"mouillages\" (= mooring), we will systematically omit the part \"Le mouillage est autorise \u0301 a \u0430\" because it is implied by the subdivision title. These are just a few examples of mechanisms used to convert INAUT to LitINAUT. Work is underway to improve the result and bring it closer to the outdated (man-made) text."}, {"heading": "5 Interaction with ENCs", "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, the Instructions nautiques are defined as a supplement to the maps, especially to the ENCs. Therefore, it is important to define the interactions between K and ENCs via INAUT. By specifying an area of interest on an ENC (for example, by drawing a zone on a touch screen), the user can obtain LitINAUT text in return. Automatic generation of this text has the advantage of (a) being limited to the area of interest specified by the user; (b) adapting it to local conditions, e.g. time of day (some relationships or attributes in K may be time-dependent) or meteorological conditions or parameters of the user's ship (size, tonnage, etc.); (c) current, as other users can constantly provide new information. To provide adaptable LitINAUT text, we first position the area U specified by the user in A and thus in G. If we know the subgraph of AUG, we can find the exact structure of a K as is possible in a corresponding point 1."}, {"heading": "6 Collaborative updates of the knowledge base", "text": "In order to achieve this goal, INAUT is used as a tool for collaborative updates. In fact, INAUT was conceived as an optimal compromise between usability (since contributors a priori do not have KM knowledge) and formality (since the knowledge base is fed directly by the incoming data). In order to make the system more robust, we validate on two levels. First, on the lexical and syntactic level: A web interface analyzes segments written in INAUT and validates them. In case of errors, it provides corrective information. Second, on the semantic level: A human controller monitors incoming INAUT data, which is automatically fed into the knowledge base depending on the confidence level of the contributors (with the possibility of making the change retroactively) or stored in a waiting list until manual validation."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion and future work", "text": "We have described the controlled natural language INAUT (and its variant LitINAUT), which is used for updating the maritime knowledge base SHOM, for the automatic generation of instructions nautical documents and for interacting with ENCs. One of our plans is to extend INAUT to a QA system. This requires the extension of INAUT to include questions and the increased use of the concept hierarchy. Another extension deals with the problem of hazardousness. In fact, one of the objectives of Instructions nautiques is to warn the navigator of possible hazards. Ideally, the ENC should automatically send questions about hazards to the knowledge base concerning the current position of the ship and various external conditions, and in case of a positive response warn the navigator by all means. Special NLG techniques can then be used, as the communicative objective is not simply to inform, but to alert."}, {"heading": "1. Cimiano, P.: Ontology Learning and Population from Text.
