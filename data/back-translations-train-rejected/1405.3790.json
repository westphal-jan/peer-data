In T Rev, similar to T R, we further define executive dichotomy to talk about properties of a particular execution path. But, in order to think about executing transactions over a particular path, care must be taken because, as described above, the satisfaction of a new event in a path can invalidate the transaction formulas that were previously applicable. In order to deal with a similar behavior, nonmonotonic logic relies on the concept of minimal or preferred models: Instead of considering all possible models, non-monotonic theories limit themselves to the most skeptical. Likewise, T Rev uses the minimal models of a program to define dichotony whenever a minimum model is defined by a minimum execution of a formula, such as a minimum model is used."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion and Related Work", "text": "Several solutions exist to think about complex events. Complex event processing (CEP et al. 1998) systems such as (Adaikkalavan and Chakravarthy 2004; Wu et al. 2006) can efficiently argue with large data streams and detect (complex) events, which support a rich specification of events based on event pattern rules that combine atomic events with some temporal constructs. As shown in Theorem 1, T R and T Rev can detect most event patterns of SNOOP and ETALIS (Anicic et al. 2012) CEP system even uses T R syntax and connectives, although the T R model theory is abandoned and a different satisfaction definition is provided. Unlike T Rev, CEP systems do not deal with executing actions in response to the detected events. Extensions of Situation Calculus, Event Calculus, Action Languages, Action Languages, etc. exist with the ability to react to 1998 events, and have some transitional properties."}], "references": [{"title": "Formalization and detection of events over a sliding window in active databases using interval-based semantics", "author": ["R.

With this as goal, we build on Transaction Logic (T R), a logic precisely designed to model and execute transactions in KBs defined by arbitrary logic theories. In it, transactions are written in a logic-programming style, by combining primitive update operations over a general KB, with the usual logic programming connectives and some additional connectives e.g. to express sequence of actions. While T R is a natural choice to deal with transactions, it remains the question whether T R can be used to express complex events, but also to deal simultaneously with the detection of complex events and the execution of transactions. In this paper we show that the former is possible while the latter is not. For that, we start by illustrating how T R can express complex events, and in particular, how SNOOP event expressions can be translated in the logic. Afterwards, we show why T R fails to deal with the two issues together, and to solve the intended problem propose Transaction Logic with Events, its syntax, model theory and executional semantics. The achieved solution is a non-monotonic extension of T R, which guarantees that every complex event detected in a transaction is necessarily responded.
