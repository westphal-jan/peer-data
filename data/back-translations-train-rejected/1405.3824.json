They are a development of the network method (Sorensen and Moss 1973), and they contain qualitative relations. The first matrix, M, considers the activities that can be carried out in a plan, and associates them with the environmental stresses. The pressure can be positive or negative, and they take into account the impact on the environment of human activities. Each element mij of the matrix M can assume values {high, medium, low, zero}, and defines a qualitative dependence between the activity i and the negative or positive pressure J. The second matrix, N, relates the pressure with the environmental receptors that register the effects of the pressure on the environment, are high, medium, low, zero, power plant \"generates the pressure\" emissions of pollutants in the atmosphere. \""}, {"heading": "2.1 A CLP solution", "text": "In order to overcome the constraints and improve current practices, we have developed a Decision Support System (DSS) that is able to provide optimal planning and environmental assessment (Gavanelli et al. 2013): The planning problem has been modeled as a linear program in CLP on the type of reals (CLP (R)). In view of a number of activities, we consider a vector A = (a1,..., aNa) in which we associate each activity with a variable ai that defines its size. ai's domain depends on the availability of the resource in the given region; for example, some regions are very windy, while others can use better biomass or solar energy. We distinguish primary activities directly related to the given type of activity, while secondary activities are those that support the primary activities by providing the required infrastructure. E.g. in an energy plan, primary activities are those that produce energy (e.g., others, and others) require (e.g.)."}, {"heading": "3 Extended solution", "text": "The CLP (R) program, described in Section 2.1, was used in the development of the 2011-13 Regional Energy Planning of the Emilia-Romagna Region of Italy: the overall goal was to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix and to fulfill the primary activities. In the coming years, experts expect the closure of coal-fired power plants with residual use when renewable energy is not available or used at peak times. Regional experts urged us to also consider the closure of power plants. Decommissioning power plants implies that some activities have a negative magnitude: e.g. the scale at which oil-fired power plants are built can be reduced. However, negative activities lead to non-linear, if the construction of a new power plant i has a cost ratio of e / MW, there will not be."}, {"heading": "3.1 Computing emissions", "text": "For this purpose, we rely on the data of two databases: INEMAR (Caserini et al. 2002) and ISPRA (ISPRA): Both databases provide the different types of pollutants emitted by 2 per fuel unit (in GJ). While ISPRA provides the average emissions for each type of plant, INEMAR provides fine-grained information that also takes into account the type of boiler and the size of the power plant (in MW). Let NB be the number of boiler types and B = (b1,..., bNB) a vector of limited variables, where bi is the total output of power plants that correlate the boiler type i. Let O be the matrix that relates the power plants and the different types of boilers: each element oij of the matrix."}, {"heading": "3.2 Indicators", "text": "Thanks to the extension presented in Section 3.1, it is possible to quantify the emissions of some gases, metals, etc. Such data can be used to examine plans aimed at minimising them, but it is not clear how the emissions are to be compared. For example, a policy maker might know that NOX is toxic to humans, but what about heavy metal emissions? The European Commission (2006) published a set of indicators that quantify the effects of different substances on human toxicity, global warming and acidification: e.g. Annex 1 contains 100 chemicals with their human toxicity factor, defined as the toxicity of the substance compared to that of lead (Pb). Using the weights in the tables, for example, one can give the total human toxicity (in kg equivalent emitted Pb), global warming (kg equivalent emitted Pb), global warming (kg equivalent of CO2), and global warming (kg equivalent of CO2)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Computing the Pareto front", "text": "The approach outlined in section 2 enables the optimisation of a single function. However, in the case of regional planning, it is very difficult (if not impossible) to design a unique function that includes all the objectives important to the user. Therefore, we have added a further extension towards multi-objective optimisation. In the case of a multi-objective optimisation problem, a solution \u00b5 is optimal if it is not possible to improve the result for an objective function without at least degrading another objective function. Specifically, in the case of a multi-objective problem with n functions to be minimised, a solution \u00b5 is optimal if there is no other solution \u00b5, so that \u00b5j \u2264 \u043c j exists for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n and there is at least one i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, so that \u00b5i < \u00b5 \u0445 i. The set of Pareto points is pareto-optimal at the so-called Pareto border."}, {"heading": "4 Graphical User Interface", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to do so without being able to play by the rules, and that they will be able to do so in order to achieve their goals."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "The CLP program has been integrated into a standard web service and has an intuitive graphical user interface. The CLP program will be the centerpiece of the platform of the EU-FP7 ePolicy project, which also includes components such as a social simulator, an opinion leader and a mechanism designer, all controlled by the described CLP program. Preparatory work has been carried out to integrate with the mechanism designer (Milano et al. 2012) and a social simulator (Borghesi et al. 2013).
