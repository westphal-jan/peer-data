In this section, three structural properties are defined: defect, excess and irregularity, which make the discrediting of existence, relevance or cumulativity possible by only one model.

This theoretical endeavor is reasonable from the perspective of prospectively evaluating the behavior of such types of semantics with respect to a number of properties that are desirable, both from a computational (relevance and cumulativity) and a semantic (existence) standpoint. To this end, we focused our study on two subgroups of the ASM class defined here, two evaluated conservative extensions of the semantics of SM, the non-disjunct classes ASMh and ASMm, the elements of which are somewhat similar to already known semantics of SM and the semantics of MH. As a result of this study, refined definitions of careful monotony, section, and cumulativity were established."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Alexandre Pinto for some important debates on conservative extensions of SM semantics.
