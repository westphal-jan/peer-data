In this article, we give a short and easy-to-understand introduction to the problematic nature of the storage, display and interpretation of lexical data. We then describe the main methods and specifications used to build and represent lexical data.

Such a model determines the way in which the lexical entries are represented, for example, how the relations of a lexeme to its meanings or to other lexical men are represented, or more generally how subtly the corresponding entries are represented. In this section we will consider two different classes of models that are in a complementary relationship to each other. These models can in a certain way be called meta-models that can map different types of lexical representations or different theoretical approaches to the representation of lexica.The two models or meta-models now being betrayed are the onomasiological and semasiological model classes. The semasiological models themselves are based on a representation, in the lemma, as a sequence of concepts."}, {"heading": "3.2 Polysemie", "text": "The semasiological models are structured in such a way that, with polysemic words, the multiple meanings that can be assigned to a lexicon entry are directly associated with the lexicon entry. It follows that each lexicon entry 1 can be assigned to different meanings. Most printed dictionaries and encyclopaedias are constructed in accordance with this organizational principle. However, this structure is also frequently found with electronically stored monolingual and multilingual dictionaries. How complex the meanings of a lexical word are described or how finely the granularity of the selection of the corresponding meanings is, of course, an editorial decision that varies from dictionary to dictionary."}, {"heading": "3.3 Synonymie", "text": "In the case of synonymy, the storage of lexical terms is in a certain way exactly complementary to the storage in the case of polysemy. Modelling synonymy is a task that can be approached more easily with an onomasiological approach. In the case of onomasiological models, the meaning is in the foreground and the different words that can be used to express this concept, the individual concepts, depending on the depth of the modeling and the volume of the respective dictionary, are then all synonyme expressions, i.e. words that can be assigned to the linguistic descriptions for this concept. Thus, the synonyms of a word w1 are supposedly words w2 -wn that are assigned to the same concept. In this way, the entire set of words can be classified by subject groups and connotations."}, {"heading": "3.4 Aspekte der Multilingualit\u00e4t", "text": "The representation of lexical units conceived for multilingual dictionaries can be accomplished by semasiological or onomasiological models, whereby the modelling is similar to the representation of synonyms. In semasiological modelling, corresponding meanings must be given for the different linguistic variants of the translations, which results in the assignment of different words to the other language for each word of the one language according to its meaning. This approach becomes particularly problematic if one considers not only bilingual, but also multilingual dictionaries with three or more languages. This problem results from combinatorial exploitation. In contrast to semasiological modelling, onomasiological modelling is ideally suited for the representation of multilingual lexicographics and dictionaries."}, {"heading": "4.
