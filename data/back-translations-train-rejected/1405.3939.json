INTRODUCTION", "text": "Machines that are as intelligent as humans should be able to do most of the things that humans can do. Flexible automation systems and systems are rapidly gaining ground and are increasingly being used in industry. Today, they use robots for the manufacturing process. Applications of artificial intelligence in medicine have increased in recent years. Artificial intelligence is mainly used in the medical field to perform a rational analysis of the data available from clinical trials (such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, digital angiography, etc.) to obtain a reliable diagnosis of the patient's disease and appropriate decision-making aid. Also, many robots have been invented to work at home. Robots have also been invented to play chess, football, etc. Robots can think well when we apply artificial intelligence concepts to them. This paper describes a method of producing robots with artificial intelligence."}, {"heading": "2. SHORT HISTORY OF ROBOTICS", "text": "The truck is a chess robot. Robotics is based on two enabling technologies: telemanipulators and the ability to numerically control machines. Telemanipulators are remotely controlled machines that normally consist of an arm and a gripper. The movements of arm and gripper follow the instructions given by man through his controller. The first telemanipulators were used to deal with radioactive material. Numerical control allows the very precise control of machines in relation to a given coordinate system. It was first used at MIT in 1952 and led to the first programming language for machines (APT: Automatic Programmed Tools). The combination of these two techniques leads to the first programmable telemanipulator. The first industrial robot to use these principles was installed in 1961. These are the robots known from industrial plants such as automobiles."}, {"heading": "3. HISTORY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE", "text": "The first work that is now universally accepted as AI was written by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943), who drew on three sources: knowledge of the basic physiology and function of neurons in the brain; a formal analysis of the logic of statements based on Russell and Whitehead; and Turing's computational theory. They proposed a model of artificial neurons in which each neuron is characterized as \"on\" or \"off,\" with a switch to \"on,\" which occurs in response to stimulation by a sufficient number of neighboring neurons; the state of a neuron was considered \"factually equivalent to a sentence\" suggesting its adequate stimulus; they showed, for example, that any calculable function could be calculated by a network of networked neurons; and that all logical connections (and, or, not, etc.) could be implemented by simple network structures. McCulloch and Pitts also indicated that neural networks could be adequately defined today, and that today's simple networks could provide a powerful demonstration of what Donald currently calls a \"lever-rich.\""}, {"heading": "4. DEFINATION TO GENERAL TERMS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Artificial Intelligence", "text": "The term was coined by John McCarthy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956. Artificial intelligence includes games: programming computers to play games like chess and checkers, expert systems (programming computers to make decisions in real-world tasks (for example, some expert systems help doctors diagnose diseases based on symptoms), natural language (programming computers to understand natural human languages), neural networks (systems that simulate intelligence by trying to reproduce the kind of physical connections that occur in animal brains), and robotics (programming computers to see and hear and respond to other sensory stimuli)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Agents", "text": "A human agent has eyes, ears, nose and other organs for sensors and hands, legs, mouth and other body parts for effectors. A robotic agent replaces the cameras and infrared rangefinders for the sensors and various motors for the effectors."}, {"heading": "4.3 Robots", "text": "The term \"robot\" generally refers to an anthropomorphic (human-like) appearance; one thinks of robot arms for welding. The tendency to view robots as human appearance could have its origin in the term \"robot.\" The word \"robot\" entered the public consciousness on 25 January 1921 in Prague with the premiere of Karel Capek's play R.U.R. (Rossum's universal robot)."}, {"heading": "4.4 Internet of Things", "text": "The next wave in the age of computing technology will be outside the realm of the traditional desktop. Currently, the definitions of the \"Internet of Things\" are diverse; they vary according to the context, impact and views of the person who provides the definition, but we can say that many of the objects that surround us will be in the network in one form or another. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) and sensor network technologies will rise to meet these new challenges, in which information and communication systems are invisibly embedded in the environment around us."}, {"heading": "5. Method", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Analyzing tasks", "text": "The analysis of tasks is a very complicated process. The tasks we want to implement to build a robot can be entered as points or tables. This way we can easily find out how many tasks we want to implement to this robot."}, {"heading": "5.2 Concept to make robot", "text": "The general concepts for making the robot as a specific task are the second step in this method. The concepts include the sensors that are used to build a robot according to the given tasks. Programming the robot is also considered as a general concept. Therefore, the programming of the sensors and other parts (such as microprocessor, some chipsets, etc.) belong to this concept. For example, to make a robot that can take something. The sensors must manufacture the robot and program the dimension of this thing."}, {"heading": "5.3 Concept via artificial intelligence", "text": "It is very important to program artificial concepts for each task individually. In this process, we do not consider the hardware strokes and sensors. Concepts that include artificial intelligence in each task are found out in this process. These concepts of artificial intelligence can be found directly from the tasks and also through the general concepts of making a robot."}, {"heading": "5.4 Binding the concepts to make robot", "text": "In this process, we have considered the sensors that are able to implement our concept of artificial intelligence. We may need some additional sensors or additional requirements to implement artificial concepts on robots that are not listed in the second step (see 4.2). In this process, we incorporate the concepts and also find out the complete requirements to produce robots that are able to think like a human."}, {"heading": "5.5 Make a robot", "text": "All hardware parts of connected robots and programs are also written to sensors and other parts."}, {"heading": "5.6 Make it to connect with other systems or robots", "text": "Finally, we can make the robot to connect other systems or robots with infrared or blue tooth or other wireless devices. We can use these wireless devices to connect to mobile phones or computers, so the robot can be accessed from mobile phones, computers or other similar devices."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "Nowadays, robots are urgently needed for fast production, which enables us to manufacture robots simply and efficiently."}, {"heading": "7.
