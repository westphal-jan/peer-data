Often, the purpose of this novel framework is to describe data probability or probability of occurrence, which in turn can be poorly defined or vary in nature. It is important to know the source and nature of the data in order to think about it. The purpose of this novel framework is to intuitively describe data that are coupled with uncertainty or follow unknown distributions, without losing any knowledge of the problem definition. cdf intervals extend the cdf interval approach (Saad et al."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "3 Input Data Representation", "text": "This year it is as far as it has ever been until the next round."}, {"heading": "4 Constraint reasoning", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to save themselves.

P-boxes have never been implemented in the CP paradigm before, yet they are very good candidates for dealing with and reasoning about uncertainty in the probabilistic paradigm, especially when the data forms an unknown distribution. The case study of the inventory management problem shows that p-box cdf intervals can be applied practically to intuitively comprehend the uncertain data found in various modeling aspects with minimal overhead. Evaluation results show that stochastic CPs and probable models have the slowest performance. Fuzzy models have proven to be more powerful and their output solutions are reliable, i.e. they seek the satisfaction of all possible realizations. Convex models and the p-box cdf intervals have all possible distributions."}], "references": [{"title": "Interval constraint logic programming", "author": ["F. BENHAMOU", "R.
