Syllable network is a network in which nodes are syllables and links between them are constructed according to their connections within words. In this paper we analyze networks of syllables generated from texts collected from the Croatian Wikipedia and Blogs. As a main tool we use complex network analysis methods which provide mechanisms that can reveal new patterns in a language structure. We aim to show that syllable networks have much higher clustering coefficient in comparison to Erd\\\"os-Renyi random networks. The results indicate that Croatian syllable networks exhibit certain properties of a small world networks. Furthermore, we compared Croatian syllable networks with Portuguese and Chinese syllable networks and we showed that they have similar properties.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 May 2014 08:57:40 GMT  (602kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4097v1", "in Proceedings MIPRO junior - Student Papers"], ["v2", "Thu, 17 Jul 2014 16:13:58 GMT  (602kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4097v2", "in Proceedings MIPRO junior - Student Papers"]], "COMMENTS": "in Proceedings MIPRO junior - Student Papers", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kristina ban", "ivan ivaki\\'c", "ana me\\v{s}trovi\\'c"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.4097"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.4097.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A preliminary study of Croatian Language Syllable Networks", "authors": ["K.

Syllable networks construction strategies", "text": "The idea of a network of syllables is to represent syllables as nodes and to establish connections between them according to their connections within words. In general, a network of syllables can be either undirected or directed and unweighted or weighted. In a directed network of syllables, a directed link can indicate the direction of the connection; the indication of which syllable (node) is the starting point and which syllable (node) is the destination. By using a directed network, the successor or predecessor of an intended syllable can be seen, which may provide the reason for further statistical analysis of the linguistic structure at the phonetic level. Weighted networks of syllables contain information on the number of established connections between two syllables, which in turn is important in phonetic structural analysis.A question of how the connections between the nodes (syllables) can be established needs to be discussed. One possibility is to connect the syllables belonging to the same word."}, {"heading": "B. Data", "text": "The first corpus is the Croatian Wikipedia. The second corpus contains 3,218 articles from various Croatian blogs (including 4 religious and 5 political portals, 6 blogspaces, 3 web pages with comments and 4 columns from daily newspapers).The reason why we chose this corpus is that our future work focuses on the text collected from the web. Another possible approach is to select a dictionary of the Croatian language as a network source. However, in [13] it shows that there is not much difference between syllable networks constructed from the book and syllable networks constructed from the dictionary of unweighted networks. One problem we encountered was the Wikipedia corpus, which contained a certain number of foreign words. This is why the initial network had certain syllables that are unusual for the Croatian language."}, {"heading": "C.
