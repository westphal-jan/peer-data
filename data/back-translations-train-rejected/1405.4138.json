In order to achieve an acceptable result, many parameters need to be adjusted in AFSA. Among these parameters, the visual and step-by-step parameters are very important given that artificial fish essentially move on the basis of these parameters. In standard AFSA, these two parameters remain constant until the completion of the algorithm. Large values of these parameters increase the ability of the algorithm in global search, while small values improve the local searchability of the algorithm. In this paper, we empirically examine the performance of AFSA and various approaches to balancing local and global exploration based on the adaptive modification of image and step during the execution of the algorithm."}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "2. ARTIFICIAL FISH SWARM ALGORITHM", "text": "In the underwater world, based on their individual or shoal search, fish can find areas with more food. Inspired by this characteristic, the Artificial Fish (AF) model is represented by prey, free movement, swarm and behavior. AF searches the problem area by these behaviors. AF lives in this problem area. AFSA's objective function is to find maximum food density. As Figure 1 shows, AF observes external concepts with their visual perception. The current position of AF is represented by the vector X = (X1, X2,..., Xn). The visual corresponds to the visual area of the AF and Xv is a designated position in the visual area to which the AF chooses to move. If Xv has a better food density than the current position, the AF moves one step towards Xv, resulting in a shift of the AF from X to Xnext. Otherwise, the current position of the AF is better than Xv, it chooses a different position in its visual position from < the fit density is equal to the distance between the food density; the X in the fit density."}, {"heading": "3. ARTIFICIAL FISH SWARM ALGORITHM WITH", "text": "VARIABLE VISUAL AND STEP In AFSA, artificial fish seek the problem environment in their visual environment based on the behavior and then they move to the target through a random value of their step. In standard AFSA, determining the initial values of the step and visual essentially affect the end result. Values of separation parameters remain constant and equal to the initial values during the execution of the algorithm. By having large initial values for these parameters, artificial fish move faster toward the global optimum. That is, artificial fish are able to seek larger surroundings around them and move with larger steps. Therefore, artificial fish are able to escape from the local optima under such circumstances. However, there are some deficiencies in large values of the step and the visual. Accuracy and steadfastness of the algorithm decrease in such a situation. In fact, the algorithm acts better in the global search, but after finding itself in the global position, it is not appropriate to the local one."}, {"heading": "3.1 Linear Movement Weight", "text": "In this method, MW is a positive function that fluctuates between a minimum and a maximum and is calculated according to the current iteration and final iteration number. In the case of linearly decreasing MW [16], MW corresponds to the maximum value at the beginning of the algorithm. During the execution of the algorithm, this amount is reduced linearly to the minimum value based on the iteration number. MW in each iteration is calculated according to Equation 3. In the case of linearly increasing MW [17], the first MW is set to the minimum value, then increases linearly during execution and finally reaches the maximum value. MW in each iteration is specified according to Equation 4: MinMax Max Max Max Max Max MinItr MWItrItrItrItrItrMW (3) MinMax Max Max Max MaxItr MWMMItrItrItrItrItrItrItrMW (4), with border being a random value between 0 and 1 with normal distribution."}, {"heading": "3.2 Random Movement Weight", "text": "In random MW [18], MW is a random number between two values: minimum and maximum.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we applied a parameter called Movement Weight (MW) to the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA). Experimental results show the positive effects of this parameter on the performance of AFSA. It is easy to see that AFSA can operate better than standard AFSA with a suitable MW parameter. In addition, time-varying MW and a random MW lead to a significant improvement in AFSA performance. Various simulations have been conducted to support the competence of the MW."}], "references": [{"title": "Particle Swarm Optimization", "author": ["J. Kennedy", "R.C.
