Adaptation is a basic task in the CBR inference that can be modeled as the knowledge base revision problem and solved in propositional logic. However, in DLs, it is still a challenge problem since existing revision operators only work well for strictly restricted DLs of the \\emph{DL-Lite} family, and it is difficult to design a revision algorithm which is syntax-independent and fine-grained. In this paper, we present a new method for adaptation based on the DL $\\mathcal{EL_{\\bot}}$. Following the idea of adaptation as revision, we firstly extend the logical basis for describing cases from propositional logic to the DL $\\mathcal{EL_{\\bot}}$, and present a formalism for adaptation based on $\\mathcal{EL_{\\bot}}$. Then we present an adaptation algorithm for this formalism and demonstrate that our algorithm is syntax-independent and fine-grained. Our work provides a logical basis for adaptation in CBR systems where cases and domain knowledge are described by the tractable DL $\\mathcal{EL_{\\bot}}$.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 May 2014 14:24:42 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4180v1", "21 pages.

Based on a classical revision operator in the statement logic, a framework for adaptation was presented and it was shown that the adaptation process should meet the AGM postulates.

Based on an extension of the classical tableau method used for deductive conclusions in the ALC, an algorithm for fit cases was proposed. It was shown that besides the requirements for syntax independence and the minimum of change (i.e. R4 and R5 in our work), all other requirements specified by the AGM are satisfied in depth (i.e. R1-R3 in our work) by its algorithm."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We have demonstrated that existing revision operators and algorithms in DLs for EL operator-based adjustment did not work.

Adaptation is a basic task in CBR that can be modeled as a knowledge base revision problem which has been solved in propositional logic. However, in DLs, adaptation is still a challenge problem since existing revision operators only work well for DLs of the DL-Lite family. It is difficult to design revision algorithms that are syntax-independent and fine-grained. In this paper, we present a new method for adaptation based on the tractable DL EL\u22a5. Following the idea of adaptation as revision, we firstly extend the logical basis for describing cases from propositional logic to the DL EL\u22a5, and then present a formalism for adaptation based on EL\u22a5. With this formalism, we show that existing revision operators and algorithms in DLs do not work for it, and then present our adaptation algorithm. Our algorithm is syntax-independent and fine-grained, and satisfies the requirements on revision operators.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
