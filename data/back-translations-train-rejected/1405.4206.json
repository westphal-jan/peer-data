However, over time, the solution found needs to be revised: new information (e.g. changed circumstances) needs to be taken into account. In this case, it is desirable to start from the old (close) solution and turn a limited amount of changes into a solution in which the new information is processed. At the moment, there are no efficient, general solutions to this type of problem; the only way to solve this problem is to write special algorithms."}, {"heading": "1.2 Model revision: a motivating example", "text": "Here we present a small motivating example of the conclusion of the model revision based on the situation shown in Figure 1.2. In this illustration, the tracks are marked by grey lines between the nodes; the train starting in S1 (which we will also call Train 1) must pass by the stations Brussels and London, and the train starting in S2 (which we will call Train 2) must visit the stations Brussels and Paris. The designated route is marked by a green dotted line, which is marked by Train 2 with a red dotted line. Imagine that the train track between S1 (Shunting Track 1, Shunting Tracks are intersections in railway tracks where you can change direction) and P1B (Track 1 in Brussels) is identified as defective. By using the model revision, we can construct a new route for Train S1 that does not use broken tracks. Figure 2 (a) shows a high-quality modification of the track: A modification of the train in 2 is necessary."}, {"heading": "1.3 Formal definition of model revision", "text": "The formal definition of the model revision problem is as follows (Wittocx et al. 2009): In view of an FO (\u00b7) theory T, a model M for this theory, and a collection of domain atoms C, henceforth C is referred to as the required changes. In Example C, the use of the tracks between S1 and P1B. Model revision for < T, M, C > means search for a new model M \u00b2 of T, so that all domain atoms in C have a different value from their old in M. M \u2032 is also referred to as a revised model. Figure 2 shows two possible revised models for the example; the run-down railway tracks are not used in both cases. (a) A high-quality revised model (b) A qualitatively inferior revised model Figure 2. Examples of upgraded and inferior revised models Figure 2 are presented in addition to the required modifications; two possible revised models are presented; one must usually refer to other parts of the original model < the other parts of the original model is modified to be modified to include additional elements < the other parts of the original problem will be modified."}, {"heading": "2 Existing Literature", "text": "Although this kind of flexible thinking is essential for a CBS, there is no research for model revision (in a general sense) in the context of an expressive modeling language. Similar research has been conducted in areas of incremental programming of constraints (Freeman-Benson et al. 1990) and reactive programming of response sentences (Gebser et al. 2011). This research supports only a limited form of new requirements: it takes into account certain forms of new knowledge, but for example, there is no way to apply previously foreseen changes. Recent research also attempts to address this problem at the SAT level (Subscription et al. 2011). These SAT level techniques are interesting for implementation, which will eventually be provided because IDP uses a SAT solver in its workflow, but does not work in the context of a complex modeling language."}, {"heading": "3 Background", "text": "This section provides a brief introduction to the terminology used. The following concepts are briefly introduced: Knowledge Base System Paradigm (De Pooter et al. 2011), FO (\u00b7) (Blockeel et al. 2013) and the IDP System (De Cat et al. 2013; IDP 2013).Figure 3. A conceptual representation of a Knowledge Base System"}, {"heading": "3.1 The language: FO(\u00b7)", "text": "Each declarative system requires a language in which the problems are represented, preferably expressive, so that the problem domain can be expressed intuitively. The language family FO (\u00b7) was developed by the KRR group for this purpose.FO (\u00b7) is a family of expressive knowledge representation languages that extend the classical first-order logic (FO) with various concepts.Apart from the logical symbols (away, away, away, away), FO (\u00b7) also includes: Inductive definitions are presented as a set of definition rules. Formulated expressions of the form {x y: p (x), q (y) or (x, y)} represent the totality of all combinations of x and y, so that p (x), q (y) or (x, y) represent a set of definition rules. Aggregates express the result of an aggregated function of a summarized expression together with a cost function (maximum for each of the following two functions)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Knowledge Base System", "text": "In a Knowledge Base System (KBS), the data and knowledge (expressed in the modeling language, e.g. FO (\u00b7)) are maintained in a Knowledge Base. A KBS then offers a variety of conclusions to solve problems with the knowledge. A conceptual representation of a KBS is shown in Figure 3.These conclusions include model expansion (extend a trivalent structure to fulfill a theory), model verification (check if a given structure fulfills a theory), optimization (extend a trivalent structure to a bivalent structure that satisfies a theory that has the lowest cost) and model revision (see Section 1.3).3.3 The IDP systemThe IDP system is a state-of-the-art implementation of the KBS paradigm using FO (\u00b7) IDP as the modeling language. The workflow of the IDP system is as follows (De Cat et al. 2013)."}, {"heading": "4 Goal of the research", "text": "The goal of my doctoral thesis is to develop logical inference methods for various forms of model revision in the context of the FO (\u00b7) modeling language. For this to be possible, we need a mechanism to think about changes that propagate through a theory. To this end, the approximate definition of a theory (Wittocx 2010; Vlaeminck 2012; Vaezipoor et al. 2011) must be calculated and used to propagate the effects of a change in the solution throughout the theory of the problem. Currently, the theory behind this theory supports fundamental FO. For my thesis, I will expand the scope of the definition to include theories that contain more meaningful constructs, such as inductive definitions, aggregates... Since the approximate definition is a definition that needs to be calculated, there must be efficient techniques to do so. It was proposed in Wittocx 2010 that the definition can be evaluated using any external system that (or) defines."}, {"heading": "5 Current status of the research", "text": "The first part of my doctoral thesis was to construct an interface between XSB and IDP in order to calculate definitions that can be fully evaluated, for which the inductive definitions were converted into rules for the submitted prologue, which was published in the TPLP (Jansen et al. 2013), and I expanded the IDP to calculate the approximate definition using the existing theory on the subject. Furthermore, the IDP was extended to include the possibility of making the input structure as bivalent as possible before grounding using the approximate definition (De Cat et al. 2013) as an alternative approach to the technique depicted in (Wittocx 2010; Vlaeminck 2012). Currently, benchmarks are being executed to compare the two approaches. According to (Vaezipoor et al. 2011), the new approach includes an approximate approach that exceeds the classical GWB technique because it calculates all possible propagation possibilities."}, {"heading": "6 Preliminary results", "text": "Benchmarks on problems in the P complexity class, which are usually solved by evaluating definitions for fully predefined structures, show that a large acceleration is achieved compared to the classical approach (Jansen et al. 2013). Preliminary results (a full study is being conducted) suggest that it is no better to make the input structure as bivalent as possible before grounding it using approximate definitions than its counterpart to the classical GWB workflow, which has already been implemented in the IDP. Furthermore, there were very few problems where grounding was smaller."}, {"heading": "7 Open Issues", "text": "Among the tasks that still need to be addressed are the extension of the approximation definition for theories that contain more meaningful constructs such as inductive definitions, aggregates, etc. Additionally, the solver MINISAT (ID) needs to be adapted to support a model revision. To support the interactive search for a revision, the solver workflow also needs to be updated to work interactively with user input."}], "references": [{"title": "Reducing chaos in sat-like search: Finding solutions close to a given one", "author": ["I.
