However, minimizing such energies is challenging. None of existing techniques (such as s-t graph cut, QPBO, BP and TRW-S) can individually do this well. In this paper, we present an efficient method, namely ESSP, to optimize binary MRFs with arbitrary pairwise potentials, which could be nonsubmodular and with dense connectivity. We also provide a comparative study of our approach and several recent promising methods. From our study, we make some reasonable recommendations of combining existing methods that perform the best in different situations for this challenging problem. Experimental results validate that for dense and nonsubmodular energy functions, the proposed approach can usually obtain lower energies than the best combination of other techniques using comparably reasonable time.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 May 2014 03:06:14 GMT  (432kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4583v1", "9 pages, 11 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 11 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["wei feng", "jiaya jia", "zhi-qiang liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.4583"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.4583.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "ESSP: An Efficient Approach to Minimizing Dense and Nonsubmodular Energy Functions", "authors": ["Wei Feng", "Zhi-Qiang Liu"], "emails": ["wfeng@ieee.org"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 5.45 83v1 [cs.CV] 1 9M ay2 014 1Index Terms - ESSP, dense and non-submodular energy minimization, MRF, image restoration."}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "In this paper, we focus on binary labeling problems = L {0, 1} For most problems of the early vision techniques of early vision techniques, the energy efficiency of the following formE (x) = \u03b8const + 0, and the neighborhood system M defines the paired dependencies between pixels.

QPBF is a general energy functionality for many problems in computer vision and machine learning. For example, some combinatorial problems such as graph matching can be formulated as QPBF minimization. QPBF minimization has been studied in discrete optimization for decades [26]. We know that if a QPBF is submodular, it can be precisely minimized in polynomial time. However, the minimization of non-submodular QPBFs is NPhard. Only approximate methods exist for this general problem. One of these methods is SSP, which is designed to minimize the difference between two submodular functions."}, {"heading": "3 THE ESSP ALGORITHM", "text": "We will now present the proposed ESSP algorithm in detail, the main idea being to transform QPBF minimization into a minimal intersection problem on an undirected graph."}, {"heading": "3.1 Undirected Graph Characterization", "text": "Let's look at the QPBFs of the following FormE (x) = + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +"}, {"heading": "3.2 Flipping Transformation", "text": "In practice, however, some newer energy functions of real problems are usually not submodular functions and an equivalent transformation on the undirected graph.

SSP is one of these methods and is designed to minimize the sum of a submodular function and a supermodular function [27]. We are now expanding SSP to minimize general QPBFs based on undirected graph characterization, which provides us with a convenient way to convert QPBF E (x) to the sum of a submodular part Sub (E (x)) and a supermodular part Sup (E (x). It is known that the intersection function of an undirected graph is symmetrical and submodular when all edge capacities are not negative. This means that for a QPBF we can automatically decompose to Sub (E (x) + Sup (E (x)) by simply checking the positivity of the GE (x)."}, {"heading": "3.4 Supermodular Suppression", "text": "The optimality and effectiveness of SSP is highly dependent on the modular approach to the supermodular function (27). Therefore, it would be desirable if we could suppress the influence of supermodular functions (E (x)) as much as possible if we could minimize the sum of all negative edge capacitances in GE (x) in our process. Of course, according to the definition of flipping transformations (see Figs. 2 and 3), in order to minimize the influence of supermodular functions (E (x)), we can measure the sum of all negative edge capacitances in GE (x). Consequently, we are according to the definition of flipping transformations (see Figs. 2 and 3) to minimize the influence of sup (x)."}, {"heading": "3.5 The Algorithm", "text": "The proposed ESSP algorithm is an iterative refinement process. The initial labeling of the ESSP algorithms consists of three essential steps: (1) modular alignment, 2 (2) maxflow computation, and (3) repermutation. The iterative process refines the initial labeling according to the random permutation (i). Each permutation actually corresponds to a set of labels. Different permutations can lead to different local minimums. To avoid being trapped at a bad local minimum, we try it for each iteration of the ESSP = 5 random permutations in our experiments.

Some methods, such as QPBO (P) partially produce labeling."}, {"heading": "4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have proposed a new algorithm, ESSP, to minimize dense and non-submodular energy functions. Such energies have recently shown great potential in computer vision. Our approach is based on an undirected graph characterization of QPBFs, which allows us to extend the classic submodular-supermodular method [27] to a general solver for generic binary labeling problems. Experiments show that our ESSP algorithm for dense and non-submodular energy functions can generally improve the results of existing methods in a reasonable amount of time. We have also presented a thorough comparative study to minimize dense and non-submodular QPBFs through existing techniques. We empirically identify three important factors, namely connectivity, supermodularity, and uneven guidance, which are closely related to the hardness of the problem. Finally, based on our study, we make several reasonable recommendations to combine existing methods in different situations to minimize such challenging energy functions."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work is supported by the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-11-0365), the National Nature Science Foundation of China (61100121) and the National Science and Technology Support Project (2013BAK01B01)."}], "references": [{"title": "A comparative study of energy minimization methods for Markov random fields with smoothness-based priors", "author": ["R.

problems. However, minimizing such energies is challenging. None of existing techniques (such as s-t graph cut, QPBO, BP and TRW-S) can individually do this well. In this paper, we present an efficient method, namely ESSP, to optimize binary MRFs with arbitrary pairwise potentials, which could be nonsubmodular and with dense connectivity. We also provide a comparative study of our approach and several recent promising methods. From our study, we make some reasonable recommendations of combining existing methods that perform the best in different situations for this challenging problem. Experimental results validate that for dense and nonsubmodular energy functions, the proposed approach can usually obtain lower energies than the best combination of other techniques using comparably reasonable time.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
