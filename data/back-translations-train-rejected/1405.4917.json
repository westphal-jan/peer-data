We present an algebraic condition on the polymorphism clone of B and prove that it is sufficient for the hardness of the surjective CSP on a finite structure B, in the sense that this problem admits a reduction from a certain fixed-structure CSP. To our knowledge, this is the first result that allows one to use algebraic information from a relational structure B to infer information on the complexity hardness of surjective constraint satisfaction on B. A corollary of our result is that, on any finite non-trivial structure having only essentially unary polymorphisms, surjective constraint satisfaction is NP-complete.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 May 2014 23:23:24 GMT  (11kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4917v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 2 Jun 2014 10:29:27 GMT  (11kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4917v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["hubie chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.4917"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.4917.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An Algebraic Hardness Criterion for Surjective Constraint Satisfaction", "authors": ["Hubie Chen"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 5.49 17v2 [cs.LO]"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "For a natural number n we use n to denote the set {1,.., n}.
