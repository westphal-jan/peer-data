After an introduction to the cognitive science concepts from which this work is inspired and the current development in the use of simulation as a decision-making technique, we propose a generic framework based on theory of mind, which allows an agent to reason and perform actions using multiple simulations of automatically created or externally inputted models of the perceived environment. A description of a partial implementation is given, which aims to solve a popular game within the IJCAI2013 AIBirds contest. Results of our approach are presented, in comparison with the competition benchmark.

Although much research has been done in recent years with a wide range of successful solutions in specific areas of activity, overall purpose implementations have not yet been achieved, and most approaches require case-based parameterization to function. In this paper, we propose to model the decision mechanisms of a virtual entity by drawing inspiration from studies in cognitive science. To be more specific, our focus is on the ability of humans to adapt during interaction."}, {"heading": "1.1 Cognitive Approach towards Artificial Intelligence Decision Making", "text": "To claim that an artificial intelligence system is founded like a human being, we need to know how people think by exploring the mechanisms of the mind. There are several ways to achieve this: through introspection, psychological experiments on the behavior and imaging of the brain. This work can help formalize a theory of the mind clearly enough to express it in the form of a computer program. Interdisciplinary cognitive science is advancing in this direction by combining experimental psychological techniques and computer models of computer-assisted intelligence. In this context, mental simulation is a theory that seems to be a particularly interesting approach to modelling the mechanisms of decision-making [Hesslow, 2002; Berthoz, 1997; Berthoz, 2003]."}, {"heading": "1.2 Theory of Mind and Mental Simulation", "text": "The ability of an individual to assign himself or herself to other mental states is known in literature as the Theory of Mind (ToM) [Premack and Woodruff, 1978]. Functionally, owning a model of the decision-making process of others, observations as input, allows the individual to determine goals, anticipate actions, and deduce the causes of certain observed behaviors.The two dominant approaches to how the decision-making process is presented are Theory Theory (TT) [Carruthers, 1996], which implies a \"popular psychology\" used to argue about others in a looser manner, and Simulation Theory (ST) [Goldman, 2005], which assumes that one's own decision-making mechanism is used for inferring (simulation), with feigned input based on observation.Regardless of the debate about which of the two constitutes the mechanism of arguing about other individuals, Ejectivity Michlmayr shows in Science [2002, Aplmayr] that it is important to achieve this predictive situation [2002, Fisher]."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "In terms of the recent research focus, simulation-based approaches to artificial decision-making, anticipation, and learning can be distinguished from two main directions."}, {"heading": "2.1 Behavioral mental simulation", "text": "The first branch focuses on modeling individuals that are very similar to the \"self,\" in which the agent performing the simulation can use his own decision-making system to derive knowledge about others; the second branch, which could be considered an extension of the first, attempts to extrapolate the models used in the simulation to agents with completely different skills; the imitation of robots, as claimed by ST, takes an important position in terms of detecting intentions, anticipating actions, and learning behavior; such an approach was implemented in Max T. Mouse [Buchsbaum et al., 2005], an animated mouse character that uses its own motor and action representations to interpret the behaviors it achieves from its friend Morris Mouse.Placing itself in the context of another individual that is very similar."}, {"heading": "2.2 Environmental mental simulation", "text": "Another application of mental simulation is the prediction of the consequences of actions on the physical environment. For example, in the case of a domino scenario, the use of mental simulation would allow the agent to anticipate different sequences of falling parts depending on which domino was first set in motion and what structure the setup has. This result would require an agent to have a physical model of its environment, including properties such as mass, gravity, elasticity and friction. Interestingly, the mental image of the environment can be considered a medium for integrating perceived information [Cassimatis et al., 2004] and through this approach an agent capable of simulating on such a model can anticipate and perform actions in complex interactions with other agents in the environment or with avatars controlled by humans."}, {"heading": "2.3 Discussion", "text": "\"Mental simulation\" has been approached computationally as an efficient decision-making technique for intelligent agents in a wide range of real-world problems, including the anticipation of intruder behavior [Ustun and Smith, 2008], simulation of cultural transmission [Axtell et al., 1996], or optimization of public transport [Fourie et al., 2012]. However, in most cases, a specialized model is developed by domain experts and then used in parameterized simulations to predict the future states of the system. Furthermore, this function requires an expanded understanding of the problem in order to build the models used for simulations. Implementations based on ST seem to behave very well when placed in a familiar environment with similar actors, and are even able to extrapolate their behavior to take into account different behaviors."}, {"heading": "3 Generic Framework", "text": "Given the difficulty of making decisions in complex dynamic virtual environments, we propose a ToM-inspired framework that allows the agent to simulate the behavior of others, as well as himself, in different contexts. Our goal is to use the advantages of simulation as a mechanism to make predictions, but also as a learning tool, using the results of the simulation and comparing them with the results of the real situation. Thus, the agent can learn and perfect his models of the reality that he holds. Our framework proposal consists of three layers of abstraction that can be considered asynchronous processes. The primary level represents an interface between the agent and his environment and consists of all the mechanisms required by the agent to interpret the environment."}, {"heading": "4 Application: Angry Birds Agent", "text": "In order to evaluate this architecture, we have implemented a minimalist instance of the simulation framework within an agent developed for the game Angry Birds. Figure 2 illustrates how the instantiated agent fits into the specifications of the proposed framework, mentioning the part to be implemented in a future version (the learning module shown in faded color in the figure). We believe that the AIBirds competition1 represents an opportunity to test and evaluate this framework in the context of a physical environment with moderately stochastic results due to the unavailability of the game's internal mechanisms. In this section, we describe the implementation of this agent in terms of the proposed architecture."}, {"heading": "4.1 Interface with the Game", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able to change the world, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live."}, {"heading": "4.2 Knowledge Representation", "text": "All objects in the simulation are animated by a two-dimensional physics engine, which corresponds to an integration of technical models within the proposed frame. Knowledge representation is inspired by the object-oriented paradigm and thus offers the possibility to model attributes and inheritance, among other things. Each type of bird (red, yellow, etc.) inherits the behaviour of the main bird class, which in turn is a physical object. The aim of this representation is to be able to accurately describe the effects of actions carried out and the evolution of the environment over time. This representation makes it possible to easily assign different behaviours to instances. In this application, the values of attributes are learned empirically at the origin and not automatically for convenience, but this will be the ultimate goal of the proposed frame."}, {"heading": "4.3 Simulation in the Simulation", "text": "Once the environmental structure is interpreted, the agent will use his imaginary world to create a number of simulations that differ by a small bullet angle (Figure 4).The depth of the simulation tree can be increased by adding the \"tip function,\" which triggers a special behavior for some bird species. For each bullet angle, the agent is able to select a time to perform the detection of a different array of possibilities, adding another layer to the simulation tree (Figure 4), similar to the first level, through simulation duplication. This method proves to be mathematically inexpensive because the initial object detection and mapping are not realized, but their results are copied and simulated in other ways (e.g. different angles or tipping times, but with the same original scene configuration).In the simulations, a special bird behavior triggers effects similar to those in the real game, such as blue birds gaining new angles from different velocities."}, {"heading": "4.4 Preliminary Results", "text": "Our implementation currently creates a number of 106 simulations that differ from each other by a recording angle of 0.01 radians. Normal simulation time is about 15 seconds, however, the simulations are run at three times the normal speed due to the time limitation imposed by the competition rules.We compare our implementation to the standard \"naive\" agent provided by the competition organizers. This choice for the benchmark was made due to the fact that the current standard agent is an extension of the winning agent of the 2012 edition of the contest, which is an improvement in visual recognition modules.However, since the standard agent is based on a random target selection, and this may affect the resulting results, we limit the number of freely available \"poached eggs\" episode of Angry Birds that feature only red birds that have no special abilities. According to the assessment of the naive agent provided by the competition organizers, we limit the levels of the poached eggs that we have available to the special levels of our first Birds, which have no special abilities available to the special levels of our first Birds."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we have described a generic framework that addresses the problem of decision-making, learning and anticipation in dynamic environments. Our approach is motivated by the need for a non-specific framework that can be used in multiple contexts and that is open to heterogeneous models that can be entered or learned to maximize the potential of existing problem solving techniques. The architecture of the proposed framework consists of three main components that can be run in parallel and revolve around the concept of pre-event simulation, which enables not only the prediction of results, but also the learning and improvement of models based on the differences between simulations and the real environment."}], "references": [{"title": "Imitation with alice: learning to imitate corresponding actions across dissimilar embodiments", "author": ["A.
