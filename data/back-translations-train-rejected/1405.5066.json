Inspired by natural phenomena, researchers have developed many successful evolutionary algorithms which, at original versions, define operators that mimic the way nature solves complex problems, with no actual consideration of the exploration/exploitation balance. In this paper, a novel nature-inspired algorithm called the States of Matter Search (SMS) is introduced. The SMS algorithm is based on the simulation of the states of matter phenomenon. In SMS, individuals emulate molecules which interact to each other by using evolutionary operations which are based on the physical principles of the thermal-energy motion mechanism. The algorithm is devised by considering each state of matter at one different exploration/exploitation ratio. The evolutionary process is divided into three phases which emulate the three states of matter: gas, liquid and solid. In each state, molecules (individuals) exhibit different movement capacities. Beginning from the gas state (pure exploration), the algorithm modifies the intensities of exploration and exploitation until the solid state (pure exploitation) is reached. As a result, the approach can substantially improve the balance between exploration/exploitation, yet preserving the good search capabilities of an evolutionary approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 May 2014 13:03:18 GMT  (520kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5066v1", "22 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["erik cuevas", "alonso echavarria", "marte a ramirez-ortegon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.5066"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.5066.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An optimization algorithm inspired by the States of Matter that improves the balance between exploration and exploitation", "authors": ["Erik Cuevas", "Alonso Echavarr\u00eda", "Marte A.

States of matter", "text": "In the gas phase, molecules present sufficient kinetic energy, so that the effect of the intermolecular forces, taking into account the physical conditions, is only small (or zero for an ideal gas), while the typical distance between adjacent molecules is greater than the molecular size. A gas does not have a defined shape or volume, but occupies the entire container in which it is enclosed. Fig. 1a shows the movements performed by particles in a gas state. Movement experimented by the molecules represents the maximum permissible displacement between particles [50]. In a liquid state, intermolecular forces are more restrictive than those in the gas state. Molecules have enough energy to move relatively to each other, with a mobile structure still present. Therefore, the shape of a liquid is not defined, but determined by its container. Abb represents particle movement within a liquid state. Such movement is smaller than that of the gas state, but larger than the solid state."}, {"heading": "3.

The motion of such molecules is motivated by the analogy to the motion of thermal energy. In our approach, such behaviors are implemented by defining several operators such as the direction vector, the collision and the random positions operators, all of which emulate the behavior of the actual physical laws. The direction vector operator assigns each molecule a direction to guide the particle motion as the evolutionary process takes place. On the other hand, the collision operator imitates those collisions experimented by molecules as they interact with each other. A collision is taken into account when the distance between two molecules is a certain shorter distance."}, {"heading": "3.2 SMS algorithm", "text": "The total SMS algorithm consists of three phases corresponding to the three states of matter (max. 1): the gas, the liquid and the solid. < Each stage has its own behavior. In the first stage (gas state), exploration is intensified, while in the second stage (liquid state), a mild transition between exploration and exploitation is performed. Finally, in the third stage (solid state), solutions are refined by highlighting the exploitation process. 3.2.1 General Procedure The same operations are implemented in each stage, but depending on which state is referred to, they are used taking into account a different parameter configuration. The general procedure in each state is presented as a pseudo-code in Algorithm 1. Such a procedure consists of five steps and maps of the current population kP to a new population 1k + P.

To improve performance analysis, the PSO algorithm was also included in the comparisons using a Territorial Diversity Preservation Scheme (TPSO) [39]. TPSO is considered a newer PSO variant that includes a diversity maintenance scheme to improve the balance between exploration and exploitation. The maximum number of iterations for functions in Tables A1, A2 and A4 was set at 1000 and for functions in Table A3.

"The ability of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to find a global optimal solution depends on its capacity to find a good rate between exploitation of found-so-far elements and exploration of the search space. Inspired by natural phenomena, researchers have developed many successful evolutionary algorithms which, at original versions, define operators that mimic the way nature solves complex problems, with no actual consideration of the explorationexploitation balance. In this paper, a novel nature-inspired algorithm called the States of Matter Search (SMS) is introduced. The SMS algorithm is based on the simulation of the states of matter phenomenon. In SMS, individuals emulate molecules which interact to each other by using evolutionary operations which are based on the physical principles of the thermal-energy motion mechanism. The algorithm is devised by considering each state of matter at one different exploration\u2013exploitation ratio. The evolutionary process is divided into three phases which emulate the three states of matter: gas, liquid and solid. In each state, molecules (individuals) exhibit different movement capacities. Beginning from the gas state (pure exploration), the algorithm modifies the intensities of exploration and exploitation until the solid state (pure exploitation) is reached. As a result, the approach can substantially improve the balance between exploration\u2013exploitation, yet preserving the good search capabilities of an evolutionary approach. To illustrate the proficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, it is compared to other well-known evolutionary methods including novel variants that incorporate diversity preservation schemes. The comparison examines several standard benchmark functions which are commonly considered within the EA field. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a good performance in comparison to its counterparts as a consequence of its better exploration\u2013exploitation balance.", "creator": "PDFCreator Version 1.2.0"}}}
