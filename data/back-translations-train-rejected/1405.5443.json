This increased utilization and congestion has created the need for new and other ways to coordinate assets that use airspace. Currently, airspace management is the job of most human controllers. As the number of units that use airspace increases enormously - many of which are autonomous - the need for improved autonomy techniques becomes evident. The challenge in an environment full of UAVs is that the world is highly dynamic and the communication environment is uncertain, making coordination more difficult. Communication actions in such an environment are neither reliable nor cost-free.The work being discussed here is in the context of developing a novel application of network-aware AV to the problem of intelligent reasoning and reasoning."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "The integration of network characteristics into planning and decision-making was investigated in (Usbeck et al. 2012), but the results of the authors suggest that the effectiveness and performance of plan execution is increased with increased network awareness during the planning phase. UAV coordination approach in this current work combines network awareness during the reasoning process with a plan-conscious network layer. (In our work, we do not separate planning from the engagement of under-used UAVs and do not rely on ad-hoc, hard-wired behaviors. Our approach gives the planner more flexibility and finer control over the actions that occur in the plans and that allow for revisions to occur.) The UAV coordination approach in this current work combines network awareness during the reasoning process with a plan-conscious network layer."}, {"heading": "3 Motivating Scenario", "text": "In order to underline the need for networking and networking, it is necessary for UAVs to be able to capture images of three objectives; the simplest solution to this problem is to neglect the scope of the individual objectives, in the form of a plan linking the individual objectives."}, {"heading": "4 Technical Approach", "text": "In this section we describe the problem in more detail, discuss the design of the agent architecture and the thought modules, and demonstrate the sophistication of the resulting behavior of the agents in two scenarios.

The drones, relays, and home base are referred to as radio nodes (or network nodes). Two nodes are in radio contact when they are at a distance from each other, called radio range1, or when they can relay information to each other through intermediate radio nodes that are within radio range themselves. The drones will travel from home base to the targets to photograph the targets and transmit them to home base. A drone will automatically take an image when it reaches a target."}, {"heading": "4.2 Agent Architecture", "text": "In fact, it is in such a way that one sees oneself in a position to abide by the rules that applied in the past, as if they applied in the past, as if they applied in the past, and as if they applied in the present, as if they were in the present, as if they were in the present, as if they were living in the present, as if they were living in the present, as if they were living in the present, as if they were in the past, as if they were in the present, as if they were living in the present, as if they were living in the present, as if they were living in the present, as if they were living in the present, as if they were living in the future, as if they were in the past, as if they were in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the past, in the past, in the past, in the past, in the present, in the past, in the past, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the present, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future"}, {"heading": "4.3 Network-Aware Reasoning", "text": "The most important reasoning tasks (centralized mission planning, as well as anomalous detection, explanation and planning within each action step) are reduced to finding models of formalizations of the corresponding problems based on answers. Central to all reasoning tasks is the ability to represent the evolution of the environment over time. Such a development is designed into a transition diagram (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1993), a diagram whose nodes correspond to the states of the environment, and whose arcs describe state transitions based on the execution of actions. Let F be a collection of flows, expressions representing relevant properties of the domain that may change over time, and let A be a collection of actions. A fluid letter l is a flow f or its negation f. A state that is a complete and consistent set of fluent words.The transition diagram is formalized in ASP by rules that describe the direct effects of actions, and their indicators."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "This paper discussed a novel application of an ASP-based intelligent agent architecture to the problem of UAV coordination taking into account network communication. Our work demonstrates the benefits of such network-aware reasoning. In ongoing experimental evaluations, our approach led to a reduction of mission duration by up to 30% and total time between 50% and 100%. We expect the benefit of a realistic networking model to become even more apparent in more complex scenarios."}], "references": [{"title": "Comparison of CORE network emulation platforms", "author": ["J.
