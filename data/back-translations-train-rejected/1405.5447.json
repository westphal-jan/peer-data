In order to improve the quality of translations, it is important to exploit available resources efficiently. Employing different translation resources with different characteristics has many challenges. In this paper, we propose a method for exploiting available translation resources simultaneously. This method employs Learning to Rank(LTR) for exploiting different translation resources. To apply LTR methods for query translation, we define different translation relation based features in addition to context based features. We use the contextual information contained in translation resources for extracting context based features.The proposed method uses LTR to construct a translation ranking model based on defined features. The constructed model is used for ranking translation candidates of query words. To evaluate the proposed method we do English-Persian CLIR, in which we employ the translation ranking model to find translations of English queries and employ the translations to retrieve Persian documents. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms single resource based CLIR methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 May 2014 11:45:06 GMT  (920kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5447v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["hosein azarbonyad", "azadeh shakery", "heshaam faili"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.5447"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.5447.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning to Exploit Different Translation Resources for Cross Language Information Retrieval", "authors": ["Hosein Azarbonyad", "Azadeh Shakery"], "emails": ["h.azarbonyad@ut.ac.ir", "shakery@ut.ac.ir", "hfaili@ut.ac.ir"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords-Cross Language Information Retrieval, Learning to Rank, Translation Resource CombinationI. INTRODUCTION With the advent of different websites with different languages, the World Wide Web has changed into a multilingual environment. Because we consider the Web to be a multilingual environment, we need methods and search engines to retrieve documents in different languages. In fact, a query in a particular language can have different relevant documents in several languages. This challenge requires methods to retrieve documents in different languages, the language of the query. Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) addresses this problem. The main objective of CLIR is to find documents in a language other than the query. Since in the CLIR the language of the documents (target language) differs from the query language (source language), we need translation methods to translate documents either into the language of the query (document translation) or into the language of the query (query translation)."}, {"heading": null, "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to go in search of a solution that is capable of finding a solution, that is able to find a solution that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, and that is able to find a solution that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, and that is able to find a solution that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution."}, {"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most people who are able to understand and understand the language, understand the language, understand and understand the language, understand the language, understand the language, understand and understand the language, understand, understand, understand and understand the language, understand, understand and understand, understand, understand and understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand and understand, understand, understand and understand, understand, understand, understand and understand, understand, understand, understand and understand, understand, understand, understand and understand, understand, understand and understand, understand, understand and understand, understand and understand, understand, understand and understand, understand and understand, understand and understand, understand and understand, understand and understand, understand and understand, understand, understand and understand, understand and understand, understand and understand, understand and understand, understand and understand, understand and understand, understand and understand."}, {"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before there is a result in which there is a result."}, {"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move."}, {"heading": null, "text": "Figure 1: The steps of labeling the translation candidate function f (swi, twj), which calculates the score of a member of tw in relation to swi.

Cross Language Information Retrieval(CLIR) is the quality of translations being employed inCLIR. In order to improve the quality of translations, it is important toexploitavailable resources efficiently. Employing different translation resources with different characteristics has many challenges. In this paper, we propose a method for exploiting available translation resources simultaneously. This method employs Learning to Rank(LTR) for exploiting different translation resources. To apply LTR methods for query translation, we define different translation relation based features in addition to context based features. We use the contextual information contained in translation resources for extracting context based features.The proposed method uses LTR to construct a translation ranking model based on defined features. The constructed model is used for ranking translation candidates of query words. To evaluate the proposed method we do English-Persian CLIR, in which we employ the translation ranking model to find translations of English queries and employ the translations to retrieve Persian documents. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms single resource", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
