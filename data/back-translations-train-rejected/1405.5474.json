We use this structure to enhance the text model and obtain better results in standard NLP operations. First of all, to tackle the problem of graphical variation we define allographic classes of characters. Next, the relation of inclusion of a subcharacter in a characters, provides us with a directed graph of allographic classes. We provide this graph with two weights: semanticity (semantic relation between subcharacter and character) and phoneticity (phonetic relation) and calculate \"most semantic subcharacter paths\" for each character. Finally, adding the information contained in these paths to unigrams we claim to increase the efficiency of text mining methods. We evaluate our method on a text classification task on two corpora (Chinese and Japanese) of a total of 18 million characters and get an improvement of 3% on an already high baseline of 89.6% precision, obtained by a linear SVM classifier. Other possible applications and perspectives of the system are discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 May 2014 16:49:50 GMT  (2054kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5474v1", "17 pages, 5 figures, presented at CICLing 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 5 figures, presented at CICLing 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yannis haralambous"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.5474"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.5474.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "New Perspectives in Sinographic Language Processing Through the Use of Character Structure", "authors": ["Yannis Haralambous"], "emails": ["yannis.haralambous@telecom-bretagne.eu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The Chinese script is mainly used in the Chinese and Japanese languages. Chinese characters (or \"sinographs\") are notorious for their large number (more than 84 thousand were encoded in Unicode [1]) and their complexity (they can have from one stroke as they are to 64 strokes as they are;). Despite their complexity, the Chinese script is quite efficient, as semantic and phonetic information is stored in bar patterns that can be easily recognized by native readers. In this essay, we will deal with a certain type of bar pattern, namely those that also exist as distinct characters - we call them subsigns. We will examine the phonetic similarity (called phonetics) and the semantic relationship (called semantics) between a character and its signatures. After building a graph of sign inclusions, and attaching various types of information to it, we will introduce an improved NLP task model: together with individual characters, we will use graphical data that is included in their subline structure."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "Various attempts have been made to describe sinographs in a systematic way: [2] and [3] use generative grammars, [4] use a prologue-like language, [5] use the biological metaphor of gene theory, [6] describe sinographs as objects with properties (the chaon model), [7] define a formal language type called planar regular language, [8] and [9] describe the topology of sinographs in XML, [10] use projections of percussion boxes, and [11] use combinatories of IDS operators. [1] The OCR community has also shown a strong interest in the structure of sinographs [12]. Concerning the consideration of Chinese writing as a network, this has been done in several papers, such as [13, 14] (where edges represent components combined in the same sinograph) or [15], where components and sinographs form sequences."}, {"heading": "2 Definitions", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Strokes", "text": "A sinograph consists of a number of strokes, which are arranged according to certain patterns within an (imaginary) square. Strokes can be assigned to 36 calligraphic line classes. The latter were encoded in Unicode (table cjk Strokes). Furthermore, strokes are always drawn in a very specific order. [1] Ideographic description sequences do not describe sinographs per se, but provide operators with a basis for finding the graphical combination of existing sinographs in groups of two or three. IDS operators can be arbitrarily nested and were encoded in Unicode (tabular ideographic descriptions)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Components, Subcharacters, Radicals", "text": "Similar to etymological roots in Western languages, readers of sinographs recognize stroke patterns, so that the meaning of an unknown sinograph can be more or less effectively identified by the stroke patterns contained therein. Frequently occurring stroke patterns are referred to as components. In this essay, we are dealing only with components that also exist as isolated sinographs. Using the term \"signs\" in the sense of \"Unicode characters,\" we refer to such components as subsigns. In other words, subsigns are components with a Unicode identity. Traditionally, the classification of sinographs in dictionaries uses a number of several hundred signatures as radicals. Radicals are not discussed in this essay."}, {"heading": "2.3 Allographic Classes", "text": "An important characteristic of components is that they can change their shape when combined with other components (for example, \"i\" becomes \"i\" when combined as in \"i\") Some of these variant forms were encoded in Unicode. Some sinographs can also have variant forms. Especially, during the Chinese writing reform [23], about 1753 sinographs received simplified forms (for example, \"i\" was encoded in Unicode) which are encoded separately in Unicode. Since these formal variations do not affect semantic or phonetic properties (at least not at the level of statistical language processing), we merge characters and their variants into groups called allographic classes."}, {"heading": "2.4 Semanticity and Phoneticity", "text": "Subsigns can play a semantic role (if one of their meanings comes close to one of the meanings of the sinograph) and / or a phonetic role (if one of their readings is identical or in a particular language similar to one of the readings of the sinograph).In this essay we will deal with Mandarin and Japan.These two properties of subsigns with respect to signs can be quantified and are then called semantics and phonetics [24]."}, {"heading": "3 Resources", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Frequency Lists", "text": "A frequency list A generated from T is an M tuple of pairs (ci, fA (ci)), where the frequency fA (ci) of the character ci is defined as # ci # T, i.e. the number of occurrences of ci in T divided by the length of T.

It is noteworthy that these properties are low compared to typical scale-free networks such as the Web or proteins in the range of 2-3. Since higher levels of Unicode contain rare sinographs that are of little use for ordinary NLP tasks, we limit ourselves to the subgraph of the sinographs contained in Unicode's BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane)."}, {"heading": "4 Phoneticity", "text": "This year it has come to the point where we will be able to put ourselves at the top, \"he said in an interview with the German Press Agency.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top. \""}, {"heading": "4.1 The Least Phonetic Chain", "text": "Under the hypothesis that signatures with higher phoneticity have a lower semanticity statistically, and vice versa, we look at the signatures with the lowest phoneticity because they have an increased potential for higher semanticity.

We will use this construct in our text classification strategies.Edge labels are area values; between parentheses the multiplicity of the signature."}, {"heading": "5 Semanticity", "text": "We used three WordNets as semantic resources for sinographic languages: the Academia Sinica BOW [34] for traditional Chinese, the Chinese WordNet [35] for simplified Chinese, and the Japanese WordNet [36], all of which offer English WordNet synset IDs. The entries for individual sinographs contained therein are rather limited: 3.075 for traditional Chinese, 2.440 for simplified Chinese, and 4.941 for Japanese. From these, we get a first assignment of allographic classes to synset IDs. In total, 2,852 allographic classes are covered, of which 1,063 have a single syntax ID, 581 have two IDs (IDs from different WordNets are not merged), and so on.

By measuring the distance between WordNet nodes using semantic measures of similarity, such as [37-39] or simply reversing the shortest path length in the WordNet diagram. This method was sterile. 2. By using the following algorithm: Whenever there was a semantic relationship (hyponymy, meronymy, antonymy, etc.) between two WordNet synsets, and we have a sinograph that belongs to a word from 2 and one of its signatures in a word from 1, we added a unit of \"semantic weight\" to the inclusion. We counted these across the three WordNets and obtained 6,816 allographic class inclusions of different weights.Here is an example: 114662574 (Mineral # 1)."}, {"heading": "6 Evaluation", "text": "To evaluate an application of our chart to a common NLP task, we attempted a text classification on two corporations: 1.

Let's be an unknown sinograph (i.e., we know neither reading nor meaning), and its class. In our diagram, there is a Gu subgraph, which is generated by paths leading to u. As the graph is structured, our subgraph has no cycles. If we leave u and head for the sheets, there will be a first node ni for each path si, for which we have semantic annotations (e.g. a WordNet synset ID). In addition, we can weight the ni by using the product of semantic expectations (which are calculated similarly to phonetic expectations) of the edges of path uni and the distance from u on the path uni.We get a vector in the space of the WordNet synset IDs.

We use this structure to enhance the text model and obtain better results in standard NLP operations. First of all, to tackle the problem of graphical variation we define allographic classes of characters. Next, the relation of inclusion of a subcharacter in a characters, provides us with a directed graph of allographic classes. We provide this graph with two weights: semanticity (semantic relation between subcharacter and character) and phoneticity (phonetic relation) and calculate \u201cmost semantic subcharacter paths\u201d for each character. Finally, adding the information contained in these paths to unigrams we claim to increase the efficiency of text mining methods. We evaluate our method on a text classification task on two corpora (Chinese and Japanese) of a total of 18 million characters and get an improvement of 3% on an already high baseline of 89.6% precision, obtained by a linear SVM classifier. Other possible applications and perspectives of the system are discussed.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
