In this context, the classic vehicle routing problem minimizes distribution costs in order to serve customer orders placed. In other words, the class of inventory routing problems (IRP), an important extension of the vehicle routing problem, takes into account the aspects of supply chain management \"inventory management and transport processes.\" In other words, the supplier decides on each customer's supply volumes and data and the subsequent route planning. Advantages of this strategy are that the supplier is able to improve routing while the customer delegates the responsibility of inventory management to the supplier. For example, the increasing importance of the IRP is illustrated in [3]. While the majority of the literature on IRP applies individual criteria models [18], we consider a two-objective IRP with two separate objective functions that minimizes the \"total sum of inventory levels at the customer.\""}, {"heading": "2 Aspects of decision making", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Combining search and decision making", "text": "Essentially, the literature illustrates three methods for solving multi-objective problems that combine optimisation and decision-making: a priori, a posteriori and interactive articulation of preference information [6, 13]. Generally, a priori methods resolve preference information before the search. Sub-utility functions are formulated for the various objectives and combined into a global utility function. [16] If typical rationality axioms apply and the utility function of the decision-maker can be precisely formulated, then, for example, multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) provides an applicable way to solve multi-objective problems [16]. In terms of global utility functions, \"compensation problems\" must be taken into account. Also, the set of objective functions must be exhaustive [20]. In cases of uncertain preferences, such an approach can become problematic. Strictly speaking, this contrasts a priori methods for modelling preferences in many practical situations."}, {"heading": "2.2 Constitutive elements of multi-criteria decision making", "text": "The well-known definitions (minimization of objective functions gk) for IRP that are later considered bi-objective are: Definition 1 (dominance) An alternative xi-X dominates an alternative xj-X, iff-gk (xi) \u2264 gk (xj) \u0445k = 1,.., K and k-gk (xi) < gk (xj).Definition 2 (Pareto-optimality) An alternative xi-X is considered Pareto-optimality, iff-optimum, iff xj X | xj xi.Definition 3 (Weak efficiency) An alternative xj-X is weak-efficient (weak Pareto-optimality) when there is no other alternative xi-optimum, so that gk (xi) < gk (xj-optimality) for all k popularity,."}, {"heading": "2.3 Interactive integration of the decision maker", "text": "An interactive method could overcome the disadvantages of a-priori and a-posteriori methods by gradually defining the preferences of the decision-maker, which leads to an interaction of the search and decision-making process [19] with the aim of calculating and presenting only a preferred subset of solutions for the decision-maker. In this context, the decision-maker has the advantage of learning about the feasibility of problem-solving and of gaining realistic expectations. Conflicts between the results of the solutions can be shown and extreme solutions presented to the DM [11]. Of course, these \"basic\" preferential parameters are applied: 1) weighting vectors demonstrating the relative importance of each criterion, 2) reservation levels representing the minimum requirements for each criterion and / or 3) reference points expressing the aspiration levels or, in other words, the desirable levels of each criterion [19]. Multiple preferential parameters can be used simultaneously in interactive methods."}, {"heading": "3 Problem description of the investigated IRP", "text": "For an overview of the IRP, we can also refer to [3]. We observe a single IRP in a distribution network with a depot from which a number of n customers are delivered. In the depot, inventory costs and capacities are not taken into account (however, they are for each customer i). A homogeneous fleet of capable vehicles is used and the fleet size is unlimited. The delivery strategy is that customers are served if their current delivery level is insufficient. This implies that the demand for each customer i is either fully covered by the currently held inventory or the stock is zero. This concept ensures that the exact current demand is repaid. For example, if the customer's inventory level i is in the period t, t = t \u2212 1 and the customer's demand i in the period t is 8 (note that the inventory level and truck capacity are not exceeded)."}, {"heading": "4 Proposed methodology", "text": "In general, the number of periods in which the reference point search and the offline approach are each based on the ideas of Geiger and Sevaux [9], where the IRP's decisions are divided into two levels to develop a better understanding of the approach: 1. However, the determination of delivery volumes for each period is avoided; 2. Calculation of the routing method for each period, using the previously calculated delivery volumes as input. Due to the complexity of this underlying vehicle routing problem, a classical saving of heuristic [2] is used. Construction methods: the description of the reference point-based local search (\"RPGLS\") and the offline approach, we implement a n-dimensional vector approach = (1,.,.,.,.) This n-dimensional vector represents how many time periods the customer's demand i is covered (\"delivery period\"). Only the integral number of time frames and the number of the time frames are delivered."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental investigation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Benchmark data and eliciting of preferences", "text": "The proposed methodology has been tested on two reference points proposed by Sevaux and Geiger (2011) [17], available at http: / / logistik.hsu-hhh.de\\ IRP. In both cases, the time horizon is T = 30 and the number of customers varies from 50 (GS-01) to 75 (GS-02). In the datasets, the scenario \"a\" is chosen. Here, the average demand is constant over time. However, the actual demand can fluctuate by \u00b1 25% around the average over each period [9]. We simulated different decision makers for the interactive approach. After presenting DM as the first rough approximation, he leads the search by choosing a preferred search direction. For example, a DM that is for low inventories and therefore more frequent deliveries would take the reference point R1, and in contrast, a DM would prefer higher inventories and less frequent deliveries (see Table 1 for a reference point illustration)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Results and discussion", "text": "When we analyze the results of GS-01 and GS-02, both objective functions are normalized, as these preferred cases 01 GS-01 are better in terms of quality comparisons of different test cases. This procedure is performed to align the results of the two approaches, which are measured on their own on quite different scales (inventory levels versus covered distances), which brings us back to (1) where the values of wk are applied to compare the relative importance of the different objectives. It was our intuition to use the maximum and minimum values of the calculated results to determine the WJ values, thereby normalizing the two criteria. Once we know the best known results from the offline approach, a most preferred solution can be calculated with respect to each reference point Rj. Based on this solution, the distance between the currently found alternatives of the RPGLS and this alternative (called \"min Chebyshev\") is calculated."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We have examined the impact of the selection of different reference points on the obtained capabilities of RPGLS. Our applied procedure: Firstly, the DM is given a quick, rough approximation to the Pareto front, and then selects a reference point to guide the local search. In reviewing the above results, the combination of search and interactive decision-making is possible for the IRP under investigation. On the one hand, the results of the GS-01 and GS-02 instance are encouraging in terms of quality and time aspects. Obviously, RPGLS achieves an \"acceleration\" of the search by examining only preferred sub-regions. On the one hand, this behavior is particularly present when selecting reference points \"in the middle\" of the Pareto front. On the other hand, it is quite difficult to improve solutions at the extreme ends of the Pareto front. Here, the DM's interactive approach does not give any benefit. Despite this progress, open questions for the usual way in which future research results that we will consider as interactive points of reference must be helpful to us."}], "references": [{"title": "Readings in Multiple Criteria Decision Aid", "author": ["Carlos A.
