Even with many bilingual corpora, the language pair of English and French is also limited in certain areas, such as political speech. So, when Corpus is trained in a particular area for a machine translation system, it is difficult to translate the text in different fields. To solve this problem, we turned to a comparable non-parallel corpus. Comparable corpus contains two corpus in different languages that are not parallel in the strict sense, but often convey the same information. Like Xinhua News, the BBC, which often contain sentence pairs that can be used as the translations. Non-parallel corpus is also known as a comparable corpus formed by the texts of two languages with some similarities. How: news belong to different sites on the same day and we have the same topic in both Chinese and English."}, {"heading": "2 Sentence alignment of bilingual corpus", "text": "Before applying bilingual corpus to machine translation in 1994, we must determine the corresponding paragraphs, sentences or even phrases, individual words of the source and target languages that are mutual translations. This process is known as the \"alignment\" process. Generally, the unit for collecting bodies is the chapter, so the first step of processing bilingual corpora is to align sentences, and the short sentence of the source language corresponds to the short sentence of the sentence alignment, which we usually compare the length of sentences in two languages. The basic idea of this method is that the long sentence corresponds to the source language, and the short sentence of the source language corresponds to the short sentence of the target language. There are proportional relationships between the sentence length of two languages. Calculation of the length of the sentence has two methods: measuring the number of characters or the number of words. Both methods achieved good alignment results in the Canadian Hansards bilingual corpus. Peter F. Brown (1991) uses the word unit to calculate the length of sentences that is reached."}, {"heading": "3 semi-supervised machine learning methods", "text": "Machine learning is the core of research in the field of artificial intelligence, which generally refers to the fact that through the approach of induction and synthesis computers simulate human learning ability, construct their models and algorithms to acquire new knowledge or skills from the known sample, and reorganize existing learning structures to continuously improve their performance. Although the mechanism of human learning is not yet clear, by inducing the computational model the system can automatically make adaptive changes to complete the complex tasks that only humans can accomplish themselves. Machine learning includes supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In traditional, supervised machine learning, the learning algorithm trains the model on the described sample, inductive parameters from the sample set, and designates the unknown dataset based on the knowledge learned (by Trevor Hastie, 2005)."}, {"heading": "4 Related Research", "text": "ChrisCallison-Burch, et al (2004) use unattended learning using a sentence-oriented parallel text to obtain a word alignment model, and also use the unattended method to train another model with a small artificial word aligned corpus. They combine the two models as word alignment statistical data, reduce the alignment error rate, and improve the performance of the machine translation system. Alexander Fraser, et al (2006) use a semi-supervised learning method based on IBM Model 4: use the discriminatory step to improve the quality of word alignment in a small corpus aligned manually, apply the estimated step and maximize step alternately in a large-scale training corpus. This method improves the translation accuracy of the phrase-based statistical translation system. Co-training method is a poorly reviewed learning method. ChrisCallison-Burson method for creating a small-scale sentence translation machine in 2002 requires a small-scale translation."}, {"heading": "5 System framework", "text": "This year it's in our hands that there's a process, there's a process, there's a process, there's a process, \"he said.\" We've got to play by the rules, \"he said.\" We've got to play by the rules, \"he said.\" We've got to play by the rules. \"He added,\" We've got to play by the rules. \"He added,\" We've got to play by the rules. \"\" We've got to play by the rules, \"he said.\" We've got to play by the rules. \"We've got to play by the rules.\" \"We've got to play by the rules.\" We've got to play by the rules. \"We've got to play by the rules.\" We've got to play by the rules \"he said.\" We've got to play by the rules. \"We've got to play by the rules.\""}, {"heading": "6 System Implementation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 The method for candidate parallel sentence acquisition", "text": "Through the search engines of some portals, we can find large quantities of corresponding Chinese and English messages based on several designed keywords. However, without the corresponding relationship of web pages in URLs, when matching chapters, the messages cannot be considered directly as a non-parallel corpus. Referring to Dragos Stefan Munteanu (2005), we first segment the Chinese web pages and then convert each Chinese word through bilingual dictionaries into the corresponding English translation to generate English query documents.We use Lemur tools (http: / / www.lemurproject.org /) to retrieve the English documents and return the first 20 English documents corresponding to a Chinese document, which are returned as candidates for a non-parallel corpus for transductive learning."}, {"heading": "6.2 Scoring Steps", "text": "In accordance with the training model of the current step, we decipher the source-language texts in non-parallel. By comparing the acquired translations with the target language in the non-parallel corpus, the degrees of similarity are calculated as a score to decide whether a target-language sentence is the appropriate translation. Since the initial training data is low, the translation accuracy is not high, and the similarity between the translation and target translation is low, we synthetically considered the following factors: (1) the ratio between the translation length and the sentence length of the target language (2) the number of identical or similar words between the translation and the target-language sentence (3) the morphological changes in the English words (4) idioms (place or name) matched (5)."}, {"heading": "6.3 Selecting Step", "text": "By comparing with the translations of candidate parallel corpus, the selected English sentences must meet the following two conditions in order to form pairs of sentences with translations: (1) the score must be higher than the given threshold; (2) the score must be the highest of all matching sentences; the threshold setting has a direct impact on the quantity and quality of the translations. As the number of matching translations may change with the length of the sentence, we set a different threshold for different lengths of English sentences."}, {"heading": "6.4 non-parallel corpus example", "text": "From the Xinhua news pages, we receive a total of 994 Chinese-English texts.

Moreover, the translation sentence and the English sentence are all included in the corresponding text of the news. Therefore, we can determine that they are probably corresponding sentences.
