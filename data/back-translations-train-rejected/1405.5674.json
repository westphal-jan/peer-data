Introduction", "text": "The MotAMot project aims to computerize an underfunded language: Khmer. This language is spoken mainly in Cambodia. As V. Berment explains in his doctoral thesis (Berment, 2004), \"with the development of PCs and networks, the computer is now becoming a tool for writing and communicating in the same way as paper and printing before. Word processing, e-mail, and even more advanced systems such as dictation or speech synthesis are widely used tools. The idea is then necessary that suitable information technologies must be added to conventional means, without which the desired goals can no longer be achieved.\" The computerization of a language like Khmer occupies a central place in this broader context. The main goal of the project is the development of a multilingual lexical target system for Khmer. The lexical system was initialized primarily with data derived from the French of the Khmer dictionary."}, {"heading": "2. Presentation of the resource to be built", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Microstructure of the entries", "text": "The microstructure of the monolingual volumes is based on the explanatory and combinatorial lexicography. Each entry is based on the vocabulary. A vocabulary is either a group of words (word meaning) or an idiom. Each entry consists of a keyword and a pronunciation followed by a list of word meanings (encyclopaedias). Each vocabulary is described either by a lexical-semantic formula (Melcuk & Polgu\u00e8re, 2006; Polgu\u00e8re, 2006) or a free gloss. For terms it is possible to describe their domain. Then follows a translation link pointing to an axis (entry) of the pivot band. Following is a list of examples and idiomatic expressions. Finally, a generic field is used to store additional information from reused dictionaries. To cope with varying contribution or qualification levels, the editing interface adapts and displays an appropriate amount of information."}, {"heading": "2.2. Macrostructure of the lexical database", "text": "The macro structure consists of a monolingual tape for each language and a central rotary conveyor belt. However, in order not to confuse the users, they contribute through an interface with a classic view of a bilingual dictionary. Each bilingual link language A \u2794 Language B has been added via this interface (Step 1 in Figure 1). If a contributor wishes to establish a translation link between a vocable Va of language A and a vocable Vb of language B, he can eventually establish this link at various levels. An ideal solution is to combine a word with the meaning (lexie) La of the vocable Va with another word meaning Vb. In this case, the vocabulary Vb and the vocabulary Vokabel Vokabel Vokabel Vokabel."}, {"heading": "2.3. Levels for contributions and contributors", "text": "The levels range from 1 star for a draft (recovered data, the quality of which is unknown) to 5 stars certified by an expert (e.g.: a link translation validated by a sworn translator), as well as a qualification level (1 to 5 stars also), 1 star is the level of an unknown newcomer in the community, and 5 stars is the level of an acknowledged expert. If a Level 3 contributor then revises a Level 2 entry, the entry automatically rises to Level 3. Likewise, if the work of a contributor is systematically validated without corrections by other contributors to the next level, after a certain threshold (e.g. 10 contributions) it can be automatically switched to the next level. To go further, we plan to analyze the work of the contributors. For example, if a person makes a massive contribution in a particular area, the system automatically sends regular suggestions for contributions in the domain."}, {"heading": "3. Preparation of existing data", "text": "To encourage contributions, it is better to provide a skeletal dictionary that can be changed later than an empty dictionary. For each language concerned, a list of words in that language is restored to create an initial list of entries. It will always be possible to create a new article, but the creations will be subject to review."}, {"heading": "3.1. Conversion of a French-Khmer dictionary", "text": "in XML"}, {"heading": "3.1.1. Description of the dictionary", "text": "For the Khmer language, there is currently a French dictionary of Khmer (Richer et al., 2007), which began in the late 1990s and was completed in 2006 by a small group of computer scientists in the NPO \"Pays Perdu\" of the French ethnolinguist Denis Richer, based in Siem Reap (Cambodia). This first version of the dictionary was published in the spring of 2007 and contains 13,249 entries. Each entry consists of a French keyword, in some cases a part of the language and a list of words. Each word has a French glossary and a Khmer translation. The dictionary was originally encoded in Word format. An example of the original file can be seen in Figure 3."}, {"heading": "3.1.2. Conversion of the file into XML", "text": "We first converted the dictionary from the Word format to a lexical resource in XML format, according to the methodology described in Mangeot & Enguehard, 2013. Open Document Format has the great advantage that it is based on XML. Instead of a conversion, the content of the XML document was retrieved and then converted to get what we want. An ODF document is actually a ZIP archive that contains multiple files including the text content in XML. This content is stored in the file \"content.xml\" in the archive. To retrieve this file, just follow some clever manipulations. On MacOs, create an empty folder and then copy the.odt file inside it. Then open a terminal and run the \"unzip\" command to extract the file. On Windows, you need to modify the.odt extension.zip and then open the.odt file in the XL file and then extract the.xml file."}, {"heading": "3.1.3. Tagging each part of information", "text": "Each information is usually different from the other in the original file with a different style. Search / replace operations have been performed for each type of information.The original dictionary file has two columns, the French is on the left and the Khmer is on the right. Each entry has one or more meanings. Each meaning is written on a line and has a Khmer translation on the right column. Therefore, each line has been marked with \"sens\" (see Figure 4).On the original word file, female forms of adjectives are separated from masculine by a comma. The female form has been separated to uniquely identify the keyword of each entry. The original form of the entry is duplicated in the glossy field."}, {"heading": "3.2. Restructuring and links reification", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. Conversion into the Mot\u00c0Mot structure", "text": "The obtained XML data is then converted into the structure chosen for the Mot\u00c0Mot project. In files originating from word processors, the data structure is usually implied. New structure elements must be added in order to achieve a more standardized structure. In terms of standards, the Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) (Romary et al., 2004) became the ISO standard (Francopoulo et al., 2009) in November 2008. It is ideally suited to our objectives. As it is a meta model and not a format, the principle of the LMF model can be applied to the input structure without using the LMF syntax (Enguehard & Mangeot, 2013). The input tag corresponds to the LexicalEntry object; the header tag corresponds to the form object; the keyword tag corresponds to the Lemma object; the keyword tag corresponds to the Lemma object; the meaning tag corresponds to the meaning tag corresponds to the reflection object; the reflection object corresponds to the shine object; the reflection object in the illustration."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Link reification", "text": "Then we converted this unique volume into three volumes: a French, a pivot point and a Khmer by unlocking the translation links.

Conversion of the IPA in Khmer alphabet", "text": "The Khmer part is a simple phonetic transcription of Khmer translations, written in a special API font (SILSophia IPA93) created by the Summer Institute of Linguistics. We developed a transcription program from the phonetic form to the script of Khmer 1, based on a FST (Fite State Transducer): OpenFst2. This program is available online at: http: / / jibiki.univ-savoie.fr / khmer / The source code is also available for download from the same page. This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Zero, Public Domain."}, {"heading": "4.1. IPA normalisation", "text": "The first step is the normalization of the IPA notation. It consists of two different parts: The first part is a correction of errors in the IPA notation. Some IPA letters that do not exist 1 http: / / jibiki.univ-savoie.fr / khmer / 2 http: / / www.openfst.org / have been replaced by the correct ones in Khmer pronunciation; the second part is the normalization of combined letters. In Unicode, some letters can be written with diacritics by combining a basic character with different characters (Macron, ring below, etc.), but also in a global character. If a character exists, the combined letters are replaced by the corresponding global character."}, {"heading": "4.2. Intermediate notation", "text": "In this step, two operations are performed simultaneously: the first consists in grouping the series of letters of A letters, which correspond to a letter in Khmer. The longest matches are processed beforehand; the second consists in marking the letter of the syllable. In Khmer, each consonant can be written in two different ways, according to the composition of the syllable in which the consonant is contained; these two variants are regarded as two different letters with different Unicode codes. We designate the two variants A and B and mark each consonant with its type. To mark the letter of the consonant, several heuristics are used in the following order: In the original file, the Khmer words recorded in IPA are separated by the character \"-.\" This feature has been used in the conversion when word beginning and endings require special treatment. Some vowels that begin a word like \"and\" are two letters from \"to\". \""}, {"heading": "4.3. Khmer generation", "text": "The third step consists in generating the Khmer script from the intermediate notation with the two consonant types. The vowels are replaced by the same Khmer letters: the consonants are replaced by their type: kh + v + A and kh + v + B. The Khmer script system has many ambiguities, some letters (most of them word endings) are not pronounced, and the result is far from perfect. Nevertheless, it has been added to the entries and is then checked by Khmer native speakers."}, {"heading": "5. Availability on the Web with the Jibiki", "text": "The Jibiki platform is a generic platform for manipulating online lexical resources (Mangeot, 2001) with users and group management, consulting heterogeneous resources and editing generic dictionaries. This is a community website originally developed for the Papillon project (Mangeot et al., 2003). Jibiki differs from other development platforms of lexical resources such as TshwaneLex from tshwanedje.com, the Dictionary Publishing System from IDM or FieldWork from SIL in the following respects: - it is completely free and open source; - it allows searching and editing of any type of lexical XML resources without modifying the XML structure or tags (so far more than 100 resources have been successfully imported into a Jibiki platform); - it enables the manipulation of complex macro structures such as pivot structures or lexical networks; - it is available online via a simple web browser; - it is remotely programmable via API."}, {"heading": "5.1. Description of the platform", "text": "The platform is completely programmed in Java and is based on the \"Enhydra\" environment. All data is stored in XML format in a database (Postgres). This website essentially offers two services: a unified interface for simultaneous access to many heterogeneous resources (monolingual, bilingual dictionaries, multilingual databases, etc.) and a specific interface for editing the dictionaries available on the platform. Several lexical resource construction projects have successfully used this platform or are still using it (Mangeot & Chalvin 2006; S\u00e9rasset et al., 2006). The source code of this platform is published under the open source LGPL license and is available in the open forum of the LIG laboratory for free downloading3. An example of the platform has been specially adapted to the Mot\u00f4Mot project."}, {"heading": "5.2. Visualisation of Khmer text in browsers", "text": "Unfortunately, widely used web browsers based on the web kit engine such as Safari or Chrome, but also word processors such as the OpenOffice family, are still not able to display all Khmer letters correctly. Some letters have a dash circle that is actually an empty placeholder for a vowel. In the following example, the order must change. In the same system with the same configuration (MacOs X 10.6.8), Firefox can fill in the placeholder (Figure 9) but not Safari (Figure 8)."}, {"heading": "5.3. Volume Lookup", "text": "Two different search interfaces are available to the user: The volume search allows the user to look up a word or prefix of a certain volume, French or Khmer. Khmer entries can be searched from their keyword in IPA or Khmer font. In the left part of the results window, the volume header words are displayed alphabetically. An infinite scroll allows the user to search the entire volume range. In the right part of the window, the entries previously selected in the left part are displayed (see Figure 10)."}, {"heading": "5.4. Advanced lookup", "text": "Advanced search is available for complex multi-criterion queries. For example, it is possible to look up an entry with a specific part of the language created by a specific author. In the left part of the results window, the keywords of the matching entries are displayed alphabetically. An infinite scroll allows the user to search through all matching entries. In the right part, the entries previously selected in the left part are displayed."}, {"heading": "5.5. Online editing", "text": "The editing module is based on an HTML interface model that is instantiated with the entry to be edited (see Figure 11).The model can be automatically generated from a description of the structure of the entry using an XML schema. It can then be modified to improve the screen representation.The only information required for the publication of a dictionary article is the XML schema that represents the structure of that entry. Furthermore, it is possible to edit any type of dictionary provided it is encoded in XML. Figure 8 shows the interface for the French entry \"dictionnaire.\" The link to the swivel axis is specified in the reflexie field of the meaning block. If a contributor wishes to add a new link to a Khmer entry, he / she uses the curved arrow key on the left side of the reflexie field of the translation block. Then, he / she can select an axis in the Khmer entry and the corresponding word is displayed in the background."}, {"heading": "5.6. XML data available for download", "text": "The XML data of the dictionary (French, Khmer and Axies vo lumes) are downloaded by license from the \"Donn\u00e9es\" tab on the Mot\u00c0Mot website. Data export from the database is carried out regularly and the new versions are available for download."}, {"heading": "5.7. Remote access via a REST API", "text": "Once dictionaries have been uploaded to the Jibiki server, they can be accessed via a REST API4. Search commands are available at 4 http: / / jibiki.univ-savoie.fr / motamot / Api.po to retrieve indexed information: keyword, pronunciation, language part, domain, example, idiom, translation, etc. (see Figure 12). The API can also be used to edit entries previously registered on the website by the user."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "The website of the project is available at: http: / / jibiki.univ-savoie.fr / motamot / Users can look up and edit French and Khmer dictionary entries and download the resulting XML data, and the platform can be remotely accessed from other applications using a REST API, and the quality of the data can then be improved. In particular, the Khmer entries and keywords automatically generated by Khmer native speakers need to be revised. Of course, people can already volunteer, but it is very difficult to do so without a community manager to help and motivate the contributors. We are now looking for ways to start a second project focusing on data revision."}, {"heading": "7.
