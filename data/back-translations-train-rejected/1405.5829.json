In such cases, the node classification problem can be challenging, since the unreliability of the links may affect the final results of the classification process. If the information about link reliability is not used explicitly, the classification accuracy in the underlying network may be affected adversely. In this paper, we focus on situations that require the analysis of the uncertainty that is present in the graph structure. We study the novel problem of node classification in uncertain graphs, by treating uncertainty as a first-class citizen. We propose two techniques based on a Bayes model and automatic parameter selection, and show that the incorporation of uncertainty in the classification process as a first-class citizen is beneficial. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach using different real data sets, and study the behavior of the algorithms under different conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 May 2014 17:13:00 GMT  (98kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5829v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.LG", "authors": ["michele dallachiesa", "charu aggarwal", "themis palpanas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.5829"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.5829.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Node Classification in Uncertain Graphs", "authors": ["Michele Dallachiesa", "Charu Aggarwal", "Themis Palpanas"], "emails": ["dallachiesa@disi.unitn.it", "charu@us.ibm.com", "themis@mi.parisdescartes.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords Network classification, Structural classification, Label propagation"}, {"heading": "1.

COLLECTIVE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM", "text": "In this section, we formalize the problem of collective classification after introducing some definitions. An insecure network consists of nodes whose connections exist with some probability. Definition 3.1 (Undetermined Network) An insecure network is denoted by G = (N, A, P), with nodes set N, edges set A, and probabilities set P. Each edge (i, j) is denoted by a probability value pij-P. This is the probability that edge (i, j) in the network is undirected, although the method can easily be extended to the directed scenario. We can assume that the | N | \u00d7 | N | matrix P has entries denoted by pij and pij = pji. A node i-N can be associated with a label that represents its belonging to a class.To simplify the notation, we assume that nodes are labeled."}, {"heading": "4. ITERATIVE PROBABILISTIC LABELING", "text": "In this section, we will first introduce the iterative probabilistic labeling algorithm. To perform iterative probabilistic labeling, a Bayes approach is used that models the probabilities of the nodes of different classes based on the adjacency behavior of the nodes. Bayes approach can include the probabilities of edge uncertainty directly in the estimation process. We will continue with a second algorithm based on the first and iterative edge augmentation. Finally, we will describe a variant of the second algorithm that is a linear combination of two classifiers."}, {"heading": "4.1 Bayes Approach", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "4.2 Iterative Edge Augmentation", "text": "The above approach is not very effective if a large part of the edges are noisy. In particular, if many edges have a low probability, this can have a significant impact on the classification process. Figure 2 shows an example. We observe that ignoring the edges whose probability is lower than 0.5 is advantageous for the correct classification of the node. Therefore, we use an iterative augmentation process to reduce the effects of such edges by favoring the positive effects of the collective classification process. The idea is to activate only a subset of edges for use in the modeling process. Edges that are not used in the modeling process."}, {"heading": "4.3 Combining different classifiers", "text": "In this section, we propose a third algorithm, uBayes + RN. It uses an ensemble methodology to further improve robustness in scenarios where some deterministic classifiers can provide good results over some subsets of nodes, but not over all nodes. The RN classifier is defined as follows: uBayes + algorithm (Diagram: G Uncertainty Prob.: P, Initial Labeling: T0, Sampled nodes ratio: \u03b1, Train nodes ratio: \u03b2); start N \u2032 = Random sample of \u03b1 \u00b7 N | nodes from N; A \u2032 = Edges (i, j) in A with i, j \u00b2 N \u2032 in the edability; (T \u2032 hold, T \u2032 S) in the fictional process: \u03b2; start N \u2032 = infigurative sample of \u03b1 \u00b7 N | nodes process from N; A \u2032 = Edges (i, j) in the UDP (TDP)."}, {"heading": "5. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS", "text": "In this section, we discuss the complexity of the proposed algorithms. We start with uBayes, which requires O (| N | + | A |) (labeling requirements and conditional labeling probabilities) to calculate the initial statistics. Assuming that the cardinality of the set of immediate, unlabeled neighbors of the nodes in T (remember that T represents the amount of currently labeled nodes) is at most Nmax, and that the number of neighbors for a given node is at most Amax, any iteration can be broken down as follows. Compiling new, unlabeled nodes requires O (NmaxAmax). Compiling the edge propagation probabilities requires O (NmaxAmax). Compiling the node label probabilities requires O (NmaxAmax).Summary, any iteration requires O (Nmaxx), any iteration requires AmaxO (Nmax), any iteration requires AmaxO (Nmax)."}, {"heading": "6. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "In this section, we evaluate the proposed techniques under different settings, both in terms of accuracy and performance. We implemented all techniques in C + + using the Standard Template Library (STL) and Boost Libraries, and conducted the experiments on a Linux machine with an Intel Xeon 2.40 GHz processor and 16 GB of RAM. The reported times do not include the initial load time, which was constant across all methods, and the results were obtained from 5 independent iterations.For all experiments, we give the averages and 95% confidence intervals."}, {"heading": "6.1 Data Sets", "text": "In our experiments, we used two sets of data for which edge probabilities can be estimated, as described below. DBLP: The DBLP dataset is the most comprehensive citation network of curated datasets in computer science. In our experiments, we look at the subset of publications from 1980 to 2010. The dataset consists of 922, 673 nodes and 3, 389, 272 edges. Nodes represent authors and edges representing co-author relationships. The probability is that two authors co-authored a paper in a year that was randomly selected. For example, if a pair of authors was published in ten different years and they both published their edge relationships, the probability is that two authors co-authored a paper."}, {"heading": "Id Name Prior probability", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.2 Perturbation", "text": "The advantage of such data is the ability to test effectiveness with varying degrees of uncertainty and other sensitivity parameters, which gives a better idea of the inherent variations in performance. Disturbing data sets are generated either by adding noisy edges or by removing existing edges to and from the real datasets. Noise edges are new edges with low probability. The edge probability is sampled from a normal distribution N (0, \u03c3) in the interval (0, 1]. Parameter \u03c3 controls the probability standard deviation. The greater the average edge probability increases, the more the edges in the real datasets interfere. Parameter \u03c6 controls the ratio of noisy edges. In view of the set of edges A of a real dataset, the number of added noisy edges is set as an indicator."}, {"heading": "6.3 Evaluation Methodology", "text": "Accuracy is assessed by repeated random subsampling validation. We randomly partition the nodes into training and validation subsets designated by NT or NV, respectively. We use 2 / 3 of the labeled nodes for training, and the remaining 1 / 3 for validation. Even if 2 / 3 may seem like a large fraction, note that it refers to the labeled nodes in the basic truth (which is fairly limited).For each method, we calculate the confusion matrix M on the NV set, where Mij is the number of nodes designated as i in the basic truth labeled as j. Accuracy is defined as the ratio of true positives for all class labels: Accuracy = 1 | NV | Mii (3) If all nodes are labeled correctly, M is a diagonal matrix. The experiment is repeated several times to obtain statistically significant results."}, {"heading": "6.4 Classification Quality Results", "text": "In this section we report on the accuracy of our results under a variety of settings with real and disturbed datasets. The first experiment shows the accuracy by varying the ratio of noisy edges (?) and the algorithms uBayes, uBayes +, wvRN-20 and Sampling-20. The results for the DBLP and the patent datasets are shown in Figures 3 (a) and 3 (b). The sampling algorithms are the worst performers on both datasets, followed by wvRN-20 and wvRN-20. On the DBLP dataset, the accuracy of the wvRN-20 is slightly higher than that of wvRN. The uBayes + algorithms are the best performers with which we achieve higher accuracy on the DBLP when the ratio of noisy edges is above 200%."}, {"heading": "6.5 Efficiency Results", "text": "In this section, we evaluate runtime efficiency on a variety of settings with real and disturbed datasets. Figures 7 (a) and 7 (b) show the time needed by the algorithms to vary the ratio of smoky edges, for the DBLP and patent datasets. The sampling takes the same time as the sampling. The sampling is almost three times slower than the sampling. This is due to the automatic sampling of the algorithm. We observe that sampling is almost always worse than sampling."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Uncertain graphs are becoming increasingly popular in a wide range of data areas. This is due to the statistical methods used to infer many networks, such as protein interaction networks and other methods based on link predictions. Consequently, the problem of collective classification has become particularly relevant for determining node properties in such networks. In this paper, we formulate the collective classification problem for insecure graphs and describe effective and efficient solutions to this problem. To this end, we describe an aniterative probabilistic labeling method based on the Bayes model, which treats uncertainties at the edges of the graph as first class citizens. In the proposed approach, the uncertainties of the links are used directly in the labeling process. Furthermore, the methodology we describe allows automatic parameter selection. We have conducted an experimental evaluation of the proposed approach using diverse, real data sets. The results directly show significant advantages of such a classification over the unsafe use of such methods."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Part of this work was supported by the FP7-EU-IP project KAP (Funding Agreement No. 260111) and the work of the second author was funded by the Army Research Laboratory under Cooperation Agreement No. W911NF-09-2-0053."}, {"heading": "8.

erroneous, or derived from probabilistic techniques. In such cases, the node classification problem can be challenging, since the unreliability of the links may affect the final results of the classification process. If the information about link reliability is not used explicitly, the classification accuracy in the underlying network may be affected adversely. In this paper, we focus on situations that require the analysis of the uncertainty that is present in the graph structure. We study the novel problem of node classification in uncertain graphs, by treating uncertainty as a first-class citizen. We propose two techniques based on a Bayes model and automatic parameter selection, and show that the incorporation of uncertainty in the classification process as a first-class citizen is beneficial. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach using different real data sets, and study the behavior of the algorithms under different conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
