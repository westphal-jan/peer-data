We see this as strong evidence that the STV framework is indeed a good formalization of the intuitive notion of \"dynamic programming for # SAT.\" Next, we show that the STV framework cannot provide subexponential time algorithms for \u03b2-acyclic # SAT.

Most evidence for inclusion can be found in [Fag83, Dur12, GP04, PSS13, CDM14] and the references contained therein. The relationship between disjunct branches and MIM width and that between \u03b2-acyclicity and MIMwidth is illustrated in this paper. Known complexity results for the limitations of # SAT can be found in Table 1; for definitions of the appearing complexity classes, see e.g. [FG06]. In [Vat12], it is shown that the MIM width is limited by cliquewidth, so that almost all tractability results of Table 1 of [ST14] can be traced with the packaging results that we have in the following framework to show the missing STV for packaging results."}, {"heading": "5.1.1.

Conclusion", "text": "We have shown that \u03b2-acyclic # SAT can be solved in polynomial time, a question that remains open in [CDM14]. Our algorithm does not follow the dynamic programming approach that was used in all other structural tractability results that were previously known, and how we have seen this is no coincidence. Instead, \u03b2-acyclic # SAT lies outside the STV framework of [STV14], which explains all the old results in a unified manner. We conclude this paper with several open problems that we should explore in the future. First, our algorithm for # SAT is designed specifically for the case \u03b2-acyclic formulas, but we believe that the techniques developed in Section 4 may be extended to other classes of hypergraphs that we can characterize by eliminating ac\u03b2-ac\u03b2 classes in general. In this sense, it would be interesting to see if hypergraphics of limited \u03b2-acyclic-width ac\u03b2-ac\u03b2 classes that ac\u03b2-generalize ac\u03b2-ac\u03b2 classes that we believe that ac\u03b2-clic is a general ac\u03b2-ac\u03b2 class that we can expand to other classes that ac\u03b2-generalize ac\u03b2-ac\u03b2-acess."}], "references": [{"title": "A", "author": ["G.
