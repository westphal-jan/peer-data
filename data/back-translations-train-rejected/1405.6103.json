Providing up-to-date information is particularly difficult in the morning when there is little time between incoming field observations and the deadline for publication of the bulletin - not enough time for manual translation or manual post-processing. Therefore, the new Swiss avalanche bulletin (fig. 1) is generated by a fully automated translation system that we described in a previous publication [17]. Here, we present the evaluation results of this system after two winter months of operational use. Despite the great efforts made for machine translation approaches and despite their promising results, the quality of fully automated translations is still poor compared to manual translations. For publishing life-critical warnings when there is no time for proofreading or manual proofreading, the reliability of existing translation systems is clearly inadequate."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "The languages generated by our catalog system can be considered Controlled Natural Languages (CNLs) [7]. The first CNLs aimed at improving translation appeared around 1980, such as Multinational Customized English [14] and Perkins Approved Clear English [11]. Other languages were developed in the 1990s, including KANT Controlled English [9] and Caterpillar Technical English [5]. The goal was always to improve translation, either by facilitating the work of translators by providing more uniform input texts, or by producing automated translations of sufficient quality, which are transformed into final documents after manual proofreading and careful post-editing. Compliance with typical CNL rules has shown that they improve the quality and productivity of computer-assisted translation [1, 10]. Controlled language for crisis management has proven to be easier to translate and less time needed for post-processing."}, {"heading": "3 Catalogue-based translation system", "text": "In this section, we will give a summary of the methods we described in our previous essay [17]. In general, a catalog-based translation system is a collection of predefined phrases (or sentence templates) and therefore cannot be used to translate any sentence. Phrases in our system are created in the source language German, manually translated into the target languages French, Italian, and English, and stored in a database. The editing tool for creating phrases follows an approach similar to conceptual authoring [4, 13]: sentences are created by first selecting a general sentence pattern from a list, and then gradually specifying and expanding the various sentence components. Once a phrase is selected, it is immediately available in the target languages.The individual sentences are not static, but consist of a sequence of up to ten segments. For each segment, authors can select from a pull-down menu of predefined options. These options may also consist of a number of options that can be easily selected, with a number of subsegments."}, {"heading": "3.1 Creating the phrases in the source language", "text": "The sentences were prepared by an experienced avalanche forecaster, whose mother tongue is German and who knows all the target languages well. \"Numerous avalanche bulletins of the last 15 years have been consulted to cover as many situations as possible. No phrases were taken directly: their content was always generalised and the phrase structure was simplified as much as possible. The challenge was to find sentences that were universal enough to describe all possible hazardous situations and simple enough to be translated. No explicit simplified grammar was used in any language. As a sentence can only be used if it works in both the source language and in all target languages, the original German sentences had to follow the following rules: in each language adjectives can only be used if they refer to objects with the same gender and number in all options. Therefore, they are usually included in the same option as the noun. Prepositions often change with the noun and therefore have to be balanced out in the grammar.\""}, {"heading": "3.2 Translation of the catalogue", "text": "Although German, French, Italian and English are all Indo-European languages, differences in the order of words, gender, declension, etc. make segmented translation difficult, so a specific editing and visualization software had to be developed by a translation agency to prepare the phrase translations, and the translations themselves were carried out manually by professional translators who are familiar with the subject and use our text corpus. In addition to the ubiquitous problem of inflection, ensuring the correct order of words also proved difficult. Other problems were: clicks, apostrophes and omissions to avoid Hiatus, especially in French and Italian; the Italian impure \"s\" (\"i grandi accumuli,\" but \"gli spessi accumuli\"); the split pronunciation in French (\"ne... pas\").When translating the individual sentences and options, no logical functions, differentiation of a sentence or the revision of a sentence could be used in the beginning of a sentence, with the exception of a single sentence and the revision of a single sentence."}, {"heading": "3.3 Operational use", "text": "As before, the risk descriptions in German were proofread and discussed by at least two avalanche forecasters. After the content of the German text was found to be correct, the translated texts were easily proofread or proofread. In a systematic survey that we conducted, all forecasters rated their satisfaction with the catalogue as \"excellent.\" Six out of seven forecasters stated that at least \"almost always\" the differences between what they wanted to write and what they could write with the catalogues were within the uncertainty area regarding the current hazard situation. \"Major limitations\" never existed. In the case of missing sentences, the system allows for any text strings to be added in all four languages and used immediately. However, no such \"joker phrases\" were used in the first two winters of the deployment."}, {"heading": "4 Quality of the texts", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Method", "text": "In order to achieve this, we have a description phase from the first to the last minute."}, {"heading": "4.3 Results", "text": "The evaluators recognized the origin of a given text in 59% of the German descriptions (Tab. 3). In the target languages, the rate of correct detection was lower, with 55% in French and 52% in Italian and English. The detection rate was significantly better only for German and French than randomly. Table 4 shows answers to questions regarding the real origin of the hazard descriptions. Differences between old and new descriptions are small and vary from language to language. Therefore, our balanced data set only shows a significant decrease when all languages and all questions are considered together (p = 0.02), but not for individual questions. New and old descriptions. Better evaluations for the new descriptions are marked in green, lower evaluations in red. Significant differences are highlighted. * are calculated from the balanced data set. Correctly legible difference between all languages and all questions together (p = 0.02) (p = 0.02), but not for individual fractions (0.02)."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the measures in question are not only measures that have been taken in the past, but also measures that have been taken in the past."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "The catalogue-based system proved to be well suited for generating the Swiss avalanche bulletin. After two years of operational use, all forecasters declared that it was possible to accurately and efficiently describe the various avalanche situations within the limited time available. The system also proved to be well suited for the fully automatic and immediate translation of hazard descriptions from German into the target languages French, Italian and English. The translations do not need to be proofread or corrected, and they proved to be even better than the manual translations of the old avalanche bulletin. The hazard descriptions were translated with new, catalogue-based hazard descriptions. The recognition of the difference proved to be difficult; the average detection rate was only 55%. Based on four criteria, the quality of the hazard description was well evaluated, with some differences between languages."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank Martin B\u00e4chtold from www.ttn.ch and his translators for the courage to translate the catalogue of phrases and for maintaining a high standard of quality.
