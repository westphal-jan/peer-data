INTRODUCTION", "text": "Product quality assurance is considered one of the most important priorities in industrial production, as is the textile industry; the quality of the textile product is seriously affected by defects; failure to detect defects costs time, money and consumer satisfaction; therefore, early and accurate detection of fabric defects is an important phase of quality control; manual inspection is time-consuming and the level of accuracy is insufficient to meet the current demand of the highly competitive international market; therefore, the expected quality cannot be maintained with manual inspection; automated, i.e. computer-aided fabric defect inspection is the solution to the problems caused by manual inspection; the automated fabric defect inspection system has been attracting extensive attention from researchers in many countries for years; the automated fabric defect inspection system mainly involves two challenging problems, namely defect detection and defect inspection."}, {"heading": "2. LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Some efforts were made to examine automated, i.e. computer vision-based inspection systems [1, 2], where not many attempts were made to examine automated, i.e. computer vision-based, textile defect inspection systems [3-6]. All focused on error detection, none of which focused on error classification. Kumar [3] used about 150 references for his comprehensive examination of automated textile defect inspection systems. His investigation was limited exclusively to error detection methods. Likewise, the surveys by Mahajan et al. [4], Ngan et al. [5] and Shanbhag et al. [6] were only focused on error detection techniques. Furthermore, their collection and organization were not good enough."}, {"heading": "3. FABRIC DEFECTS", "text": "It has been reported in [7] that fabric defects cause about 85% of defects detected in the textile industry. Fabric prices fall by 45% -65% for high-quality second- or third-generation goods [8]. Therefore, it is of great importance that these defects are detected, detected and prevented. There are a large number of fabric defects, including color yarn, missing yarn, missing time and customer satisfaction. Therefore, early and accurate fabric defect detection is a (a) (b) (fabric) (d) (f). Poor fabric detection incurs additional costs in terms of money, time and customer satisfaction. Therefore, early and accurate fabric defect detection is a (b) (fabric) (d) (d) (f)."}, {"heading": "4. FABRIC DEFECT INSPECTION PROCESS", "text": "Developing an automated, i.e. computer vision-based system for substance defect inspection involves several steps, as shown in Figure 2. Each step has an impact on the performance of the subsequent steps. Weak design and implementation of one step complicate the subsequent steps, which leads to a tougher development of the system. Therefore, each step is of great importance in developing a fully automated system for the textile industry. An automated substance inspection system consists of the following steps, as shown in Figure 2. In this work, we mainly focus on only one step of developing a computer vision-based substance defect inspection system. This is the classification stage, as shown in Figure 2. A number of experiments have been undertaken for computer vision-based substance defect inspection [9-31]. Few of them have focused on classification, with the majority focusing on defect detection. Mainly three defect detection techniques [3, 11], namely statistical, spectral and motion-based techniques, have been used."}, {"heading": "5.

Support Vector Machine", "text": "Murino et al.

at each stage of production in textile industry has become a key factor to retaining the existence in the highly competitive global market. Problems of manual fabric defect inspection are lack of accuracy and high time consumption, where early and accurate fabric defect detection is a significant phase of quality control. Computer vision based, i.e. automated fabric defect inspection systems are thought by many researchers of different countries to be very useful to resolve these problems. There are two major challenges to be resolved to attain a successful automated fabric defect inspection system. They are defect detection and defect classification. In this work, we discuss different techniques used for automated fabric defect classification, then show a survey of classifiers used in automated fabric defect inspection systems, and finally, compare these classifiers by using performance metrics. This work is expected to be very useful for the researchers in the area of automated fabric defect inspection to understand and evaluate the many potential options in this field.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
