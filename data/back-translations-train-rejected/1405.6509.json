We study the problem of how multiple such judgments can be aggregated. We define the problem by adapting various classical social-choice-theoretic properties for the argumentation domain. We show that while argument-wise plurality voting satisfies many properties, it fails to guarantee the \\emph{collective rationality} of the outcome, and struggles with ties. We then present more general results, proving multiple impossibility results on the existence of \\emph{any} good aggregation operator. After characterising the sufficient and necessary conditions for satisfying collective rationality, we study whether restricting the domain of argument-wise plurality voting to classical semantics allows us to escape the impossibility result. We close by listing graph-theoretic restrictions under which argument-wise plurality rule does produce collectively rational outcomes. In addition to identifying fundamental barriers to collective argument evaluation, our results open up the door for a new research agenda for the argumentation and computational social choice communities.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 May 2014 09:13:38 GMT  (1618kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6509v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 19 Jun 2014 15:31:03 GMT  (1618kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6509v2", null], ["v3", "Sun, 19 Jul 2015 10:53:38 GMT  (1559kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6509v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["edmond awad", "richard booth", "fernando tohme", "iyad rahwan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.6509"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.6509.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Judgment Aggregation in Multi-Agent Argumentation", "authors": ["Edmond Awad", "Richard Booth", "Fernando Tohm\u00e9", "Iyad Rahwan"], "emails": ["irahwan@acm.org"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 5.65 09v3 [cs.AI] 1"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "An important milestone in the development of argumentation in AI is Dung's ground-breaking framework [15], known as the abstract argumentation framework (AAF), but arguments are seen as abstract entities (a proposition A), with a binary denial relationship about them. Denial relationship captures the fact that one argument should somehow be accepted or undermines another. This view of reasoning allows for high-level analysis, while abstraction takes place away from the internal structure of individual arguments. Dung's approach sets out arguments and a denial relationship, a rule defining which arguments should be accepted. Often, there are several reasonable ways in which an agent can evaluate a given argumentation structure (e.g. by accepting only conflict-free, self-defending arguments). Each possible assessment corresponds to a so-called extension or labeling [8, 9]."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "We begin with the abstract characterization of an argumentation system that is capable of discussing a whole range of arguments.

multiple plausible opinions about which arguments should be accepted, rejected, or deemed undecided. We study the problem of how multiple such judgments can be aggregated. We define the problem by adapting various classical social-choice-theoretic properties for the argumentation domain. We show that while argument-wise plurality voting satisfies many properties, it fails to guarantee the collective rationality of the outcome. We then present more general results, proving multiple impossibility results on the existence of any good aggregation operator. After characterising the sufficient and necessary conditions for satisfying collective rationality, we study whether restricting the domain of argument-wise plurality voting to classical semantics allows us to escape the impossibility result. We close by mentioning a couple of graph-theoretical restrictions under which the argument-wise plurality rule does produce collectively rational outcomes. In addition to identifying fundamental barriers to collective argument evaluation, our results contribute to research at the intersection of the argumentation and computational social choice fields. 1 ar X iv :1 40 5. 65 09 v3 [ cs .A I] 1 9 Ju l 2 01 5", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
