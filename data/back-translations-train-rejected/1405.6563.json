In an unsupervised context, i.e., no prior model of the moving object(s) is available, such a structure has to be learned from the data in a bottom-up fashion. In recent times, volumetric approaches in which the motion is captured from a number of cameras and a voxel-set representation of the body is built from the camera views, have gained ground due to attractive features such as inherent view-invariance and robustness to occlusions. Automatic, unsupervised segmentation of moving bodies along entire sequences, in a temporally-coherent and robust way, has the potential to provide a means of constructing a bottom-up model of the moving body, and track motion cues that may be later exploited for motion classification. Spectral methods such as locally linear embedding (LLE) can be useful in this context, as they preserve \"protrusions\", i.e., high-curvature regions of the 3D volume, of articulated shapes, while improving their separation in a lower dimensional space, making them in this way easier to cluster. In this paper we therefore propose a spectral approach to unsupervised and temporally-coherent body-protrusion segmentation along time sequences. Volumetric shapes are clustered in an embedding space, clusters are propagated in time to ensure coherence, and merged or split to accommodate changes in the body's topology. Experiments on both synthetic and real sequences of dense voxel-set data are shown. This supports the ability of the proposed method to cluster body-parts consistently over time in a totally unsupervised fashion, its robustness to sampling density and shape quality, and its potential for bottom-up model construction", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 May 2014 13:12:05 GMT  (3863kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6563v1", "31 pages, 26 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "31 pages, 26 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.GR cs.LG", "authors": ["fabio cuzzolin", "diana mateus", "radu horaud"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.6563"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.6563.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Robust Temporally Coherent Laplacian Protrusion Segmentation of 3D Articulated Bodies", "authors": ["Fabio Cuzzolin", "Diana Mateus", "Radu Horaud"], "emails": ["fabio.cuzzolin@brookes.ac.uk", "mateus@in.tum.de", "radu.horaud@inria.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords Unsupervised segmentation \u00b7 3D shape analysis \u00b7 3D shape tracking \u00b7 analysis of human movements \u00b7 spectral embedding"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction, Background and Contributions", "text": "This year, the time has come for an agreement to be reached, and it will only take a few days."}, {"heading": "2 Problem Formulation and Proposed Solution", "text": "The main task of this paper is to carry out unsupervised and time-related aggregations, and the proposed methodology should be able to produce an automatic segmentation of an unknown moving body. Such a body can be presented in different ways as a set of surface points that depend on a series of synchronized campaigns. (Look at how much the individual campaigns are affected by the individual campaigns?) The body is expected to be composed by a collection of interconnected rigid parts (a condition that could possibly be relaxed), in the sense that the segments produced are connected to actual segments of the moving body. Segmentation takes place in a completely unsupervised manner, i.e. neither with previously annotated data nor with human interventions.

The former affects both the stability of the embedded form over time and its lower dimensionality, on which the estimate of the number of clusters itself depends. Empirically, the embedded form exhibits remarkable stability for some values of k, but this is generally not the case for arbitrary such values. Figure 18-a) shows how the embedded form for two images (top, bottom) in the \"dancer\" sequence is k between 10 and 30. For higher values of k, some neighborhoods of points in a given body comprising regions of another body part, e.g. Figure 18-b)."}, {"heading": "4.6.2 Laplacian Methods, Selection of Eigenfunctions and Body-part Resolution", "text": "Spectral methods have long been used in the computer graphics community as a tool for analyzing and processing edge functions that represent surfaces of objects within virtual scenes. In general, they share a common framework in which an affinity matrix M, which reflects the structure of the input set of points, is defined and a peculiar decomposition of this matrix, which produces its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, is performed. They can be roughly divided into two categories: methods in which M reflects the structure of adjacence information (such as LLE or ISOMAP), and methods based on the Laplacian chart, an operator that generates eigenvalues and eigenvalues.

These, in turn, depend (among other factors) on the assumption that the Laplacian graph of the actual point cloud representing the shape represents a good approximation to the (unknown) Laplace-Beltrami operator.Figure 21 illustrates how the performance decreases while the number of voxels (considered as samples of an underlying continuous form) decreases. To allow for a fair comparison, we have kept the product s \u00b7 k roughly constant between the number of neighbors and the sampling factor s (since the original voxel sets contain up to 25,000 voxels, it is convenient to support them to limit the computing time).In Figure 21, the consistency value and the segmentation value for the \"natural\" segmentation number of the body segmentation are presented as being unrelated to the bulk of the segmented body."}, {"heading": "4.6.4 Robustness with Respect to the LLE Parameters", "text": "It is important to assess the sensitivity of the algorithm to the most important parameters (or, better, the indices of the selected persons)."}, {"heading": "5 An Application to Bottom-up Model/Pose Recovery", "text": "From our point of view, the unattended segmentation algorithm we propose can be considered a building block of a broader motion analysis system. We mentioned two possible applications of time-consistent unattended segmentation in the introduction: action detection and bottom-up body model recovery. However, as with image functions, we can assume that these tracks are generated by a graphical model, such as an HMM [29] (see Figure 26), or by a complex hierarchical, non-linear clustering."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we presented a novel dynamic, unattended spectral segmentation scheme, in which movable, articulated bodies are grouped in an embedding space and clusters are propagated in time to ensure temporal consistency. In particular, taking advantage of some desirable geometric properties of LLE, we can estimate the optimal number of clusters to merge / divide when topology transitions take place. We compared the performance of our algorithm with (time-consistent) EM clustering in 3D, k-mean clustering in ISOMAP space and truth marking provided by motion capture or synthetic generation on the ground. An extension of the proposed approach to widely separated, non-contiguous poses can be designed in a fairly straightforward manner, relying on methods that coincide with different postures of the same articulated object, hoping that they are stable by conserving their embedded images for each other [4.53]."}], "references": [{"title": "Beyond pairwise clustering", "author": ["S.

structure to the temporal series of observed data, in order to describe motion patterns in a compact way, and to discriminate between them. In an unsupervised context, i.e., no prior model of the moving object(s) is available, such a structure has to be learned from the data in a bottom-up fashion. In recent times, volumetric approaches in which the motion is captured from a number of cameras and a voxel-set representation of the body is built from the camera views, have gained ground due to attractive features such as inherent view-invariance and robustness to occlusions. Automatic, unsupervised segmentation of moving bodies along entire sequences, in a temporallycoherent and robust way, has the potential to provide a means of constructing a bottom-up model of the moving body, and track motion cues that may be later exploited for motion classification. Spectral methods such as locally linear embedding (LLE) can be useful in this context, as they preserve \u201cprotrusions\u201d, i.e., high-curvature regions of the 3D volume, of articulated shapes, while improving their separation in a lower dimensional space, making them in this way easier to cluster. In this paper we therefore propose a spectral approach to unsupervised and temporally-coherent body-protrusion segmentation along time sequences. Volumetric shapes are clustered in an embedding space, clusters are propagated in time to ensure coherence, and merged or split to accommodate changes in the body\u2019s topology. Experiments on both synthetic and real sequences of dense voxel-set data are shown. This supports the ability of the proposed method to cluster body-parts consistently over time in a totally unsupervised fashion, its robustness to sampling density and shape quality, and its potential for bottom-up model construction.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
