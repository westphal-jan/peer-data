INTRODUCTION", "text": "Twitter, a micro-blogging site, has become an integral part of the lives of millions of users, people use it to communicate with friends, family or acquaintances, and as the number of users grows, so does the demand for analytics of this data. Twitter does not store a user's gender, age, ethnicity or interests, and these attributes of a user could be useful both for the user experience and for consumption by brands in their social analytics. In this work, we address the task of gender classification of users by using observable information such as the tweet behavior, the linguistic content of the user's Twitter feed, and the celebrities that the user follows. \u2022 It uses some new linguistic content traits that have not been used by the state of the art, especially on Twitter data. \u2022 It describes entirely new compilations of popular (celebrity) neighborhood traits such as age, gender and work experience that show promising results. \u2022 It reports that the combination of the two may be better than the two most popular social media characteristics we use."}, {"heading": "2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "text": "Following the attributes of social media users is a growing area of interest. Recently, there have been many attempts to predict various hidden attributes of a user. Several recent works have focused on predicting ethnicity (Rao et al., 2011; Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011), age (Schler et al., 2006; Rosenthal and McKeown, 2011; Nguyen et al., 2011; Al Zamal et al., 2012), sex (Rao et al., 2010; Burger et al., 2011; Liu and Ruths, 2013; Al Zamal et al., 2012), interest (Lim and Datta, 2013), personality (Argamon et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2013), etc. Most of the datasets prepared in these approaches have been hand-commented, cherries selected or attributes are self-identified by the user."}, {"heading": "3. DATASETS", "text": "In order to collect the data sets, one had to choose the two contrasting names (e.g. \"male\" and \"female\") to use, and identify users to whom one or the other label could be reliably assigned. Although we used data sets that were already prepared by Zamal, we still had to manually check the collected accounts to confirm that the labeled mappings were correct."}, {"heading": "3.1 Gender Dataset", "text": "This work used the same data set created by Al Zamal et al. (2012) for gender prediction. Zamal's work used a technique proposed in Mislove et al. (2011) that used users with their full first and last names on Twitter; her first name was also one of the 100 most common first names recorded by the U.S. Social Security Administration for little boys / girls born in 2011. 131 male and 134 female users were collected from 192 users each, as some users closed their Twitter account or closed their timeline to public access."}, {"heading": "3.2 Popular neighborhood Dataset", "text": "Here, we define celebrities (popular users) as users with more than 10,000 followers, or verified by Twitter itself, as defined by Lim and Datta (2013). Thus, out of 108,619 unique users followed by 265 users, 5,546 popular users remained. Once we had the list of these prominent users, we extracted various features that we would discuss in Section 5."}, {"heading": "4. METHODOLOGY", "text": "Because the text in this area comes from short messages and the messages often contain different abbreviations and have misspellings, we implemented a process for automatic correction of words larger than 3 letters, as suggested by Prem Melville et al. (2013) This process used a combination of Philips \"metaphor algorithm and distance to spell-check (TextBrew); in addition to a standard English dictionary, we used Twitter short-handed dictionary, e.g.\" idk \"would be mapped to\" I don't know. \"As you can see on Twitter, many people use a lot of camel shell, especially when using hashtags, and we tried to clean such camel covers, for example,\" # BestDayEver \"would be classified as\" Best Day Ever \"after we cleaned tweets only for 12% accuracy."}, {"heading": "5. FEATURES", "text": "Previous work in this area has already examined some general lexicon features based on tweet text for e.g. K-top words used by each class. In this essay, we did not use these features, instead we used LIWC 2007 Dictionary to extract lexicon features. With LIWC-based lexicon features, we have achieved almost 3% more accuracy compared to modern lexicon features, as in Section 6. We will now discuss all the features used in this essay to predict the gender of Twitter users."}, {"heading": "5.1 Tweet behavior based features", "text": "Tweet behavior can be a good parameter to distinguish between male and female users. We have used almost all the features used by the state of the art. 5.1.1 Tweet frequency Suppose the number of tweets extracted for a user is N (in this article we used N = 1000) and the time difference in the days between the first and last tweet is C, then \"tweet frequency\" is defined as TF = NC (1). According to a study of 36 million Twitter users conducted by www.beevolve.com in 2012, it was found that average female users tend to tweet more often than male counterparts. 5.1.2 Hashtag frequency Let Th be the total number of hashtags used by a user, then \"hashtag frequency\" is defined as HF = Th C (2) 5.1.3 Average tweet length \"Average tweet length,\" Length Tweet length \"stands for the average length of TL."}, {"heading": "5.2 Linguistic content based features", "text": "In a study by www.beevolve.com (2012), female users speak more about family and fashion, while male Twitter users prefer technology, sports and entrepreneurship. We have examined a wide variety of linguistic attributes by using LIWC1 2007 dictionary as a detailed description.5.2.1 Count of I, we, you, he-she and they words According to David Bamman et al. (2014), female Twitter users tend to use a more personal writing style in which they refer more to themselves and he-them. 5.2.2 Parts of speech pronouns are generally associated with female authors (David Bamman et al., 2014), conjunction how and were associated with female authors. Other parts of speeches such as articles, determinants or prepositions show a low gender association."}, {"heading": "5.3 Popular neighborhood based features", "text": "Since we have already defined \"popular neighborhoods\" or \"celebrity users\" as those that are followed by one of the 265 users in our Dataset who either (1) has more than 10,000 followers or (2) are verified users. \u2022 Popular users (celebrities) use their real name on Twitter and it is possible to extract their properties from sites like Wikipedia and Freebase. This gives us the opportunity to use the principle of homophobic association (in Twitter, a user can be more selective than who follows it). In the following subsections we would discuss our intuition behind every \"popular\" neighborhood feature \"we have chosen, and how we extract these characteristics. 5.3.1 age of celebrity; < < < age; < age; < age; < age; < age; < age; age; age; < age; age; age; age; < age; age; age; > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > We have used 5 categories (each as a feature) for celebrity users."}, {"heading": "6. RESULTS", "text": "We would evaluate our results in terms of overall accuracy. A 10-fold cross-validation was performed to assess the performance of SVM-based classifiers in deriving a Twitter user's gender. We will discuss the results in the following three phases:"}, {"heading": "6.1 Using tweet behavior and linguistic features", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.2 Using popular neighborhood features", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.3 Using all the features combined", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE", "text": "In this paper, we have examined the extent to which characteristics present in the popular neighbors of a Twitter user can improve the conclusion of attributes that the user himself possesses. Our findings support several remarkable conclusions that we are discussing here."}, {"heading": "7.1 Usefulness of linguistic features", "text": "Liguistic characteristics such as the associativity of a certain category of words to the gender of a user, as proposed by David Bamman et al. (2014), led to satisfactory results."}, {"heading": "7.2 Popular neighborhood is useful and feature rich", "text": "Pennacchiotti et. al (2011), discussed in their paper that users who follow more celebrities tend to achieve better results in their homophilic (network-based) approach. We have confirmed in this paper that popular neighborhoods can be used to extract various rich and precise traits from pre-existing knowledge bases. We observed that the gender of a celebrity can be a good trait, and substantiated the study conducted by Bill Heil et al. (2009), which suggests that the propensity of men to follow male traits is twice as high as that of women. Information about the work domain of popular users can be useful to determine users \"interest, which in turn can be useful in gender classification. In this paper, we have used no other homophobic traits such as linguistic traits of the popular neighborhood, it would be interesting to see combined results of homophobic and famous traits that can be used in this essay as well as other political traits."}, {"heading": "8.
