We report on experiments with a workflow to incrementally encode a planning instance into a sequence of QBFs. To solve this sequence of incrementally constructed QBFs, we use our general-purpose incremental QBF solver DepQBF. Since the generated QBFs have many clauses and variables in common, our approach avoids redundancy both in the encoding phase and in the solving phase. Experimental results show that incremental QBF solving outperforms non-incremental QBF solving. Our results are the first empirical study of incremental QBF solving in the context of planning. Based on our case study, we argue that incremental QBF solving also has the potential to improve QBF-based workflows in other application domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 May 2014 14:23:50 GMT  (64kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7253v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Oct 2014 12:04:01 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7253v2", "revision (camera-ready, to appear in the proceedings of AISC 2014, volume 8884 of LNAI, Springer)"], ["v3", "Mon, 4 Apr 2016 11:06:57 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7253v3", "added reference to extended journal article; revision (camera-ready, to appear in the proceedings of AISC 2014, volume 8884 of LNAI, Springer)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["uwe egly", "martin kronegger", "florian lonsing", "andreas pfandler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7253"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.7253.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Conformant Planning as a Case Study of Incremental QBF Solving", "authors": ["Uwe Egly", "Martin Kronegger", "Florian Lonsing", "Andreas Pfandler"], "emails": ["firstname.lastname@tuwien.ac.at"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

The task is to find a sequence of measures, i.e., a plan that leads from the initial state to a state in which the target is fulfilled. The plan must meet the target for all possible values of unknown variables, i.e. it must be failsafe. This problem can be nicely encoded in QBFs, e.g. by building on the codes of cattle [33]. Conformal planning occurs naturally, e.g. in repair and therapy planning, where a plan must be successful even if some obstacles arise. The length of a plan is the number of measures in the plan. Since one usually looks for short plans, the following strategy is applied."}, {"heading": "4 QBF Planning Tool", "text": "This year it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Evaluation", "text": "This year it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "5.1 Preprocessing", "text": "Implementation of (inc) DepQBF does not include pre-processing [5,14]. In general, pre-processing could be very beneficial for the performance of QBF-based workflows. Efficient combination of pre-processing and incremental solving is part of ongoing research in SAT [21,30] and QBF [16,18,28,34]. To assess the potential impact of pre-processing in our workflow, we conducted the following experiment with DepQBF for all 288 planning instances with a time limit of 900 seconds and collected all QBFs generated this way. As for the results in Table 1, we executed DepQBF and incDepQBF on these QBFs within our workflow. Additionally, we executed the QBF solver Nenqfex [24] because it was well based on QBFF accumulated from the dungeon bench.5 Nenfex batteries."}, {"heading": "5.2 Comparison to Heuristic Approaches", "text": "This year, it will be in a position to achieve the objectives I have mentioned."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We have presented a case study on the incremental QBF solution, which is based on a workflow for step-by-step encoding of planning problems in sequences of QBFs, thereby focusing on a universally valid QBF solver. The incremental approach avoids redundancy. First, parts of the QBF encoding of shorter plan lengths can be reused in the encoding of longer plan lengths. Second, the incremental QBF solver benefits from information learned from previously resolved QBFs. Compared to heuristic approaches, the QBF-based approach has the advantage of always finding the shortest plan and enabling the non-existence of a plan to be verified by Q-Resolution.6 Experiments with T0 were not performed on AMD Opteron 6176 SE, 2.3 GHz, 64-bit Linux with variants of the DepQBF solution approach."}], "references": [{"title": "Improving Glucose for Incremental SAT Solving with Assumptions: Application to MUS Extraction", "author": ["G.

quantified Boolean formula (QBF) solving. We report on experiments with a workflow to incrementally encode a planning instance into a sequence of QBFs. To solve this sequence of successively constructed QBFs, we use our general-purpose incremental QBF solver DepQBF. Since the generated QBFs have many clauses and variables in common, our approach avoids redundancy both in the encoding phase and in the solving phase. Experimental results show that incremental QBF solving outperforms non-incremental QBF solving. Our results are the first empirical study of incremental QBF solving in the context of planning and motivate its use in other application domains.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
