We also say that S's is a cautious reasoning, to decide whether an individual algorithm of consistency is an algorithm of consistency, an algorithm of consistency of M, an algorithm of consistency of M, an algorithm of consistency of M."}, {"heading": "4 Definite cost-aware MCS", "text": "The characteristics of the complexity of reasoning with general cost-conscious multi-context systems as introduced in the previous section are rather pessimistic. However, even valiant reasoning leads to a general cost complexity that is exponential in the size of the information flow structure of the system. For practical reasons, this can become prohibitive as the size of the system is scalable. However, often, information flows of the implemented systems are more simply structured, both in terms of the individual context and the underlying information flow. definite multi-context systems, an adaptation of the notion of reducible MCSs (Brewka & Eiter, 2007), provide a suitable model for such contexts. Let L = (KB, ACC, Cost) is a logical suite. L is monotonically iff1. ACC (kb) is a singleton set for each kb."}, {"heading": "5 Acyclic definite MCS", "text": "Now we turn our attention to multi-contextual systems that do not contain information flow constructions. (...) Although relatively simple, the class of acyclic MCSs is practically significant. (...) The hierarchical structure of such systems is dictated by the fact that such systems capture the knowledge of human experts in a particular domain. Typically, the structure of domain knowledge is articulated by such experts to be relatively simple and hierarchical, since such structures are easier to understand and manipulate. (...) Let M = (C1,., Cn) be a definite MCS with contexts C (M) = {C1, Cn}."}, {"heading": "6 Incremental reasoning in definite MCS", "text": "The discourses in previous sections followed the structure of the standard results from logic programming, which is reflected in multi-context systems. In general, the cost-complexity of the results depends on the known results of the computational time-complexity of the computation of such programs. In this section, we build on the concepts presented above and present an incremental approach to the computation of cost-conscious multi-context systems, which specifically focuses on reducing the cost-complexity of such computations. By using the structure of a given MCS in relation to a given query, the actual cost-complexity of solving the argumentation problem can often be improved. Before introducing an actual algorithm that reduces the number of context evaluations, let us first introduce an idea of a fragmentation context, which is complementary to context support (definition 19), but instead of taking into account the context and rules that are necessary for a context."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion and final remarks", "text": "The motivating premise underlying the presented work is that MCSs are a suitable model for designing, implementing and analyzing knowledge-intensive systems with heterogeneous components used. Here, we expand the generic model of multi-context systems with an idea of costs aimed at executing semantic operators of individual contexts. The idea is to facilitate the scalability of the system in terms of costs incurred, whether by computation costs, bandwidth or even financial expenditure. Our focus on cost-complexity rather than the computation-complexity of algorithms also represents a novel view of the design and use of information aggregation and argumentation systems. We conducted a series of worst-case complexity outcomes for general, defined and layered MCSs. Some of these outcomes could be further improved by taking inspiration from e.g. Bairaket al., 2010, where the authors may fragmented their MCSs results into their composition."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the Dutch program COMMIT.
