The goal of the designated entity recognition is the identification and classification of each word / term in a document into some predefined categories such as person name, location name, organization name, other NLP applications (date, time, percentage and monetary expressions etc.) and \"none-of-the-above.\" NER is an important task with applications in information extraction, questionnaire, machine translation, summary and other NLP applications. This paper presents an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) based on NER system for Indian languages developed for the ICON 2013 NLP tool competition, the goal of which is to perform NE recognition in a variety of ways: artifact, entry, facilities, location, locomotive, materials, organization, person, plants, number, distance, money, quantity, date, period, and yearly contest."}, {"heading": "2 Training Data", "text": "The system converts the data of the SSF format into the IOB format prior to the training, and the data converted to the IOB format is used for the training. IOB format uses a B-XXX tag that specifies the first word of a unit of type XXX and I-XXX that is used for the following words of a unit. The tag \"O\" indicates that the word is outside of a NE (i.e. not part of a designated unit). An additional tag EXXX (which is not part of the IOB format) is added to the tag set to represent the last word of a unit of type XXX.At the time of system development, we observed that the data (training, development and testing) provided by the organizers of the ICON 2013 NLP tool competition contain several error types, such as ambiguous POS tags (XC:?, QO:? etc.), errors in the NE tagging. These errors in the training models that were created based on the training results of the NP, are not the company's training results."}, {"heading": "3 HMM based Named Entity Tagging", "text": "The question of how it came to be is not only a question of probability, but also a question of probability.

We also observed that the word sequence associated with this type of tag sequence is not really a named entity. If we consider this an error of the model, we replace such a sequence of I-XXXs in the output with a sequence of \"o.\" After performing this post-processing on the output of the HMM model, the final output file is produced.
