Basic Understanding of the concept", "text": "It is necessary to understand the basic terms and definitions that would be used in the context of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. According to [6], opinion can be defined by two components, namely the target g and the sentiment s on the target (g, s). This is a very basic definition of opinion. Here, the target g can be a unit about which the opinion is given, or it can be an aspect of unity. It is very crucial to understand the concept of unity and the aspect. For example, \"The processing speed of the laptop is really good.\" Here, the laptop is the entity or product in the analysis [8]. The processing speed of the laptop is the aspect of the unit about which the opinion is expressed. \"s\" is the value of the sentiment that is expressed. s \"can be positive, negative, neutral or a numerical value. As the problem becomes complex, the definition of opinion is worked out. (s, h, h, opinion has four components before it."}, {"heading": "II. LITERATURE SURVEY", "text": "The basic assumption in this case was that each document expresses the opinion about only one unit expressed by only one opinion leader. [14] Sensations can be classified using monitored learning techniques and unsupervised learning techniques. Monitored learning techniques include text classification based on a classifier [6]. Monitored learning techniques take into account features such as \"terms and their frequency,\" \"parts of speech,\" \"sentiment words and phrases,\" \"sentiment shifters,\" etc. [15]. Unsupervised learning techniques use fixed syntactical patterns that occur in an opinion. This technique uses the POS marker that identifies nouns, adjectives, etc. in a sentence. Based on knowledge and arrangement of these words, we identify the unit, the aspect and the opinion [15]. Another approach under unsupervised learning techniques is to preserve the dictionary and the sentence, with the adjectives shifting the opinion to one level, the opinion, etc. [The] the knowledge and the aspect."}, {"heading": "III.
