In this paper we review these two processes and we give some real world examples with emphasis to the field of Medicine, where one can find some of the most common and useful CBR applications. We also underline the differences between CBR and the classical rule-induction algorithms, we discuss the criticism for CBR methods and we focus on the future trends of research in the area of CBR.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 May 2014 14:38:52 GMT  (1695kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7567v1", "47 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 124 references"]], "COMMENTS": "47 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 124 references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael gr voskoglou", "abdel-badeeh m salem"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7567"}, "pdf": {"name": "1405.7567.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Analogy-Based and Case-Based Reasoning: Two sides of the same coin", "authors": ["Michael Gr.

In contrast, if the source is a structural but not superficial problem (in this case the source is called Holyoaks terminology, a remote analogy of the target problem), spontaneous positive transfer should be more likely in experts than in beginners, if the source is a distracting problem, the spontaneous negative transfer should be stronger for beginners than for experts.

If-then rules allow the coding of knowledge linking symptoms to diseases, while case-based reasoning allows the disease to be found by comparing the patient's symptoms with those in a case-based knowledge base; c) analysis of treatment options - rules-based knowledge allows for so-called what-if analysis: What is likely if we apply a particular treatment? d) Maintaining medical history - is simple with case-based expert systems, whereby the cases of individual patients can be stored for both statistical purposes and case-based considerations."}, {"heading": "4.5 Conclusions", "text": "CBR is a suitable method for all medical fields and tasks for the following reasons: cognitive appropriateness, explicit experience, duality of objective and subjective knowledge, automatic acquisition of subjective Voskoglou & Salem knowledge, and system integration.
