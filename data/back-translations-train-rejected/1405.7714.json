A lot of work in the social election requires voters to declare a complete sequence of all candidates. However, in practice, electoral systems allow voters to determine a sequence of a part of the candidates. For example, if all candidates are eliminated in a partial ballot, this vote is ignored for the Maltese Parliament, for the Legislative Assembly of the main Australian territory, and for the President of Ireland. As a second example, voters will classify as many or as few candidates as they want. Unplaced candidates are considered equivalent when the tournament graph is used to calculate the winner. As a third example, the Irish Green Party is used to elect its leader. Voters can classify as many or as few candidates as they like."}, {"heading": "2 BACKGROUND", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to feel how they want to, and that they will be able to see themselves able to hold their own."}, {"heading": "3 PARTIAL VOTES", "text": "As we have already noted, it has been observed that members of the French Academy cast abbreviated votes in an attempt to manipulate the Borda count. As a second example, in the 1992 general election for Dublin North, 12 candidates stood, but the 43,941 voters ranked only in the median of 4 candidates and an average of 4.98 candidates, with a standard deviation of 2.88 candidates. In fact, only 8.3% of voters cast a full vote. Similarly, in the 1992 general election for Dublin West, we ranked 9 candidates, but the 29,988 voters again ranked only in the median of 4 candidates and an average of 4.42 candidates, with a standard deviation of 2.33 candidates. In this case, 12.7% of voters cast a full vote. We consider a partial vote that ranks only k out of the m-candidates. There are a number of different ways in which the election rules can be changed to deal with partial votes. We look at three election rules (Borda count, STV and Copeland), which we consider to be the most likely to eliminate partial, in order to partially vote."}, {"heading": "4 SCORING RULES", "text": "The first method we are investigating to deal with a partial vote is to shift the scoring vector and evaluate candidates without a ranking accordingly. Three possible schemes can be found in the literature to deal with this if voters rank only k of the m candidates (k < m): Rounded up: A candidate who ranks fourth (i \u2264 k) gets a score of si, unranked candidates get a score of sm \u2212 (k \u2212 i) \u2212 1, while unranked candidates get a score of sm. Modified Borda counting is an example of such rounding off. For example: In the modified Borda counting, a partial vote results in only one candidate ranking fourth, a score of sm \u2212 (1 \u2212 1) -1 = sm \u2212 1 and 0 for each other candidate."}, {"heading": "4.1 Borda and unweighted votes", "text": "Partial voting increases the situations in which an election can be manipulated using the Borda count. Suppose, for example, that we have three candidates (a, b and p) and a manipulator who wants to win p. For each of a > b > p and b > a > p, one vote has been cast. If the vote is complete, a manipulator cannot win p. Partial voting can also change the calculation complexity of calculating a manipulation. If two voters can manipulate the Borda count, the calculation can be NP-hart [8, 9]. On the other hand, the manipulator can cast one vote for only p that wins by a tie. Partial voting can also change the calculation complexity of calculating a manipulation."}, {"heading": "4.2 Borda and weighted votes", "text": "We now turn to weighted votes. By complete votes, we look at a coalition manipulation of Borda votes with only 3 candidates > > B > Weight reduction is NP-hard. [7] With partial votes and rounding up, the calculation of a coalition manipulation of Borda votes with weighted and partial votes is necessary \u2191 Proof: The coalition simply elects its preferred candidates and no one else. Proof: The coalition simply manipulates its preferred candidates and no other else.On the other hand, if we treat partial votes by rounding off or averting the remaining results, the calculation of a coalition remains mathematically intractable. Proposition 4 Calculation of a coalition manipulation of the modified Borda number of votes and partial votes and 3 candidates is NPhard.Proof: reduction from the number partition problem. We have a bag of integers, ki summed up to 2K and want to decide whether we can divide it into two partitions."}, {"heading": "5 SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE", "text": "For partial voting rules like STV, a method analogous to rounding up partial voting rules in many real-world environments is used. We simply ignore a partial vote once all the candidates in the vote have been eliminated. Unlike Borda counting, a partial vote does not allow further manipulation in STV elections. Proposal 6 Under STV, we can complete any of their votes without changing the election result. We simply add p to the end of the partial vote (if it does not already contain p), then we add the remaining candidates in any order. Such a completion does not change the result. If the partial vote contains p, then completion is never taken into account. If partial voting is not possible, then we have just added another problem."}, {"heading": "6 TOURNAMENT GRAPH RULES", "text": "Suppose we have 4 candidates: a, b, c and p. One vote was cast for each of > b > c > p, b > c > c > a > p and p > c > b. We have a manipulator who wants to win p. If the manipulator casts a partial vote that puts only p in first place, then each candidate has a Copeland score of 0, and p wins in a tie. Consequently, there is successful manipulation in partial votes. On the other hand, we assume that the manipulator must give a complete score. Now, a, b and c are symmetrical. (Provided p is ranked first by the manipulator, and therefore, in this case, we cannot beat a > b > the votes with one of the other."}, {"heading": "6.1 Copeland and unweighted votes", "text": "For full votes, a simple greedy method calculates a strategic vote for a single agent to manipulate the outcome of the Copeland method in polynomial time if possible [11]. We can adapt this method to construct a strategic partial vote. Our adaptation adds an additional hold condition that ends the process early with a successful partial vote. We continue to assume that we will break ties in favor of the manipulator. However, it is easy to loosen this assumption since we have a (possibly partial) vote with the desired result. Alternatively, we must lower the Copeland values of one or more \"dangerous\" candidates by voting for a \"harmless\" candidate. To do so, we find that Copeland has a candidate who can be placed incorrectly in the next position."}, {"heading": "6.2 Copeland and weighted votes", "text": "In fact, it is such that we are able to claim that we are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put ourselves in a position to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put ourselves in a position to put ourselves in a position to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to live in a position to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to live in a world, to be able to live ourselves, to live in a world, to live in a world, to live in a world, to live in a world, to live in a world, to live in a world we live in a world, in a world in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live, in which we live in which we live, in which we live in a world, in which we live in which we live, we live in which we live in a world, we live in which we live in a world, in which we live in which we live, we live in which we live in the world, we live in which we live in the world, we live in which we live in the world, we live in which we live in the world, we live in which we live in the world, we live in which we live in which we live in the world, we live in which we live in the world, we live in which we live in the world, we live in which we live in the world, in which we live in the world, we live in the world, we live in which we live in which we live in the world, we live in which we live in the world, in which we live in the world, we live in which we live in the world, we live in which we live in the world, we live in which we live in the world, we live in which we live, we live in the world, we live in which we live in which we live in the world, we live in the world, we live in which we live,"}, {"heading": "7 INTRODUCING INTRACTABILITY", "text": "We have seen that partial votes have a number of effects on the arithmetic complexity of calculating a manipulation. 1. partial votes do not change when strategic votes are possible, and therefore the arithmetic costs of calculating a strategic vote (e.g. STV) do not change. 2. partial votes allow for more strategic votes, but at worst, the complexity of calculating a strategic vote does not change (e.g. the modified Borda counting). 3. partial votes allow for more strategic votes and at worst, the complexity of calculating a strategic vote (e.g. Borda) decreases. We will now demonstrate the fourth and final possibility: partial votes allow for more strategic voting and at worst, the complexity of calculating a strategic vote increases. This occurs when a strategic but complete vote takes polynomic time to calculate, while a strategic but partial vote is difficult to calculate. In fact, our evidence is that there is a subclass of votes with full manipulation in the elections."}, {"heading": "8 PARTIAL VOTING IN PRACTICE", "text": "We have analysed the following data sets from the PrefLib [21]: Irish Election, Debian Project, Electoral Reform Society (ERS), Glasgow City Council, F1 and Skiing and Sushi. In many elections, more than half of the votes contain less than half of the candidates. Therefore, the manipulators have to deal with partial votes. For each set, we have selected several cases and calculated 100 elections with a time interval of 1000 sec. Table 2 summarises our results. We divide the instances into two groups. The first group contains instances with up to 20 candidates. The second group contains instances with more than 54 candidates. Based on the size of the candidate list, we vary the length of the manipulators into two groups. The first group contains instances with up to 20 candidates. The second group contains instances with more than 54 candidates."}, {"heading": "9 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have examined three of the most common methods used to modify the electoral rules to deal with such partial results. These methods modify scoring rules, elimination rules and rules based on the tournament chart. We argued that partial voting cannot change the situations in which strategic voting is possible (e.g. with STV). However, with Borda counting and Copeland's method, partial voting increases the situations in which strategic voting is possible. As a result, the arithmetic complexity of calculating a manipulation may change. For example, the complexity of the Borda counting may decrease or remain the same depending on how we achieve partial results. We were even able to highlight a situation in which the arithmetic complexity of calculating a manipulation increases when we allow partial results. At worst, our results may not reflect the difficulty of manipulating in practice."}], "references": [{"title": "The original Borda count and partial voting", "author": ["P.
