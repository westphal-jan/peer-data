There is no class dual of a sublinear function with probability. The proof is based on material presented in [1] B. Jain. Flip-Flop Sublinear Models for Graphs, S + SSPR 2014. The content of [1] is not included in this essay. Section 1 introduces the formalism necessary to derive the proof. Section 2 provides auxiliary results. Finally, the proof of theorem 1 is presented in Section 3."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "Let G be a permutation group and XG be the quotient of the group action G on the matrix space X = Rn \u00b7 n, where n is a number not smaller than the number of vertices of the largest graphs. With \u03c0 we denote the natural projection from X to XG. For details, we refer to [1,2]. The stabilizer of w-X is a subgroup defined by Gw = {\u03b3-G: \u03b3w = w}. If Gw is the trivial group, then every element of the orbit [w] has a trivial stabilizer. A diagram X should be regular if it is a representation of x-X with trivial stabilizer Gx.Support that f (X) = W \u00b7 X + b is a sublinear function. A cross section with base point w-X is an injective map: XG \u2192 X-X-X = constellation (W)."}, {"heading": "3 Auxiliary Results", "text": "Let us assume, therefore, that the figure is a permutation group that is depicted orthogonally.
