Unsafe data in these areas could be caused by complexity and difficulties in classical mathematical modeling. To avoid difficulties in dealing with uncertainties, many tools have been studied by researchers. Some of these tools are neutral propositions [18], neutral propositions [16], and intuitionist neutral propositions [1]. Fuzzy sets and intuitionist fuzzy sets are characterized by membership functions, membership, and non-membership functions. In some real life problems for correctly describing an object in an uncertain and ambiguous environment, we must deal with the ambiguous and incomplete information."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we will consider the terms of the Neutrosophical Sets [15] and the Soft Sets [9].
