Decision support systems are a suitable solution for such issues, they are indeed able to help emergency managers to prevent and to manage crisis in emergency situations. However, they should be enough flexible and adaptive in order to be reliable to solve complex problems that are plunged in dynamic and unpredictable environments. The approach we propose in this paper addresses this challenge. We expose here a modelling of information for an emergency environment and an architecture of a multiagent decision support system that deals with these information in order to prevent and to manage the occur of a crisis in emergency situations. We focus on the first level of the system mechanism which intends to perceive and to reflect the evolution of the current situation.

Each of them carries an FSF and has the role of controlling its development over time. We introduce the concept of the factual agent in the representation of RCRSS in second cycles. A second in the simulation represents a minute at the real world situation level, on the one hand to reflect the dynamic change of the situation and on the other hand to give rise to subgroups of agents. These subgroups can be representative for some situations that are similar to others in the past. Therefore, the end goal of the system is to recognize and evaluate these subsets. Figure 3: Internal structure of a factual agent A factual agent has specific indicators to reflect its dynamics. These indicators offer a synthetic view of the most important facts of the situation. Therefore, they must as far as possible reflect the perceived reality."}, {"heading": "Interactions", "text": "Factual agents are constantly interacting and comparing the FSFs they carry with each other. A factual agent can have close agents (positive proximity between FSFs) and opposite agents (negative proximity between FSFs) and agents with whom he is neutral (proximity equal to 0). He stores his close agents and opposing agents in an Acquaintances Network (AN) that is dynamically updated. We distinguish there types of messages that are presented in the table below. FIPA Performative Messageform FSFMessageform AidMessageform AgressionMessage- FSFMessage are messages that include an FSF and are sent by the agents, either when a new agent is created and wants to report its creation to all the other agents, or when and agent updates its own FSF and wants RCRSS functions to be implemented in seconds. One second in the simulation represents one minute in the real world to communicate this change."}, {"heading": "IMPLEMENTATION \u00a0 AND \u00a0 EXPERIMENTATION \u00a0 OF \u00a0 THE\u00a0", "text": "In fact, you have to be able to manoeuvre yourself into a situation where you are able to put yourself at the centre, where you are able to put yourself in the position you are in."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a part of an agent-based system that should take over the function of RCRSS in second cycles. A second in the simulation represents a minute in the real world and helps emergency managers to identify risks and manage crisis situations. The main objective of our approach is to create a system independent of the subject of the study, which must be able to autonomously adapt its behavior to environmental change. We have described an original idea here by using an agent organization that allows the system to perceive facts that have occurred and to create its own representation of the situation. The ultimate goal of the system is to recognize situations and inform users of their potential consequences. We have shown that the actual agents are able to react and change their behavior according to the detected danger. Our current work concerns the creation of fact-agent clusters using the assessment agents and the way they are stored and managed in the base. Therefore, rigorous comparison of clusters and their formation measures should be introduced to enable."}, {"heading": "REFERECNES", "text": "Australian Standard. 2004.
