(Although the properties in Definition 4 have an inspiring root from the axioms of Shapley Value. (If) A direct translation of Shapley's additivity has little sense of inconsistency measures. (If) One of the main limitations of the original additivity lies in the fact that the interactions of subgames are not taken into account. (J\u00e4ger and Konieczny 2006b) argue that a direct translation of Shapley's additivity has little sense of inconsistency measures.

In fact, MUS decomposition defines a fragmentation5. The union of fragmented graphs is the graph with the union of vertex and edge sets from individual graphs as their vertexes and edges. However, it is insufficient for this purpose. Again, consider K = {a1, \u00ac a1, a1, \u00ac a2, \u00b7 \u00b7, an \u2212 1, an \u2212 1, an, an, an}. MUS decomposition cannot divide K into smaller parts because its MUS graph contains only one coherent component. A solution to this problem is a finer-grained analysis of a MUS graph by taking into account its internal structure. To this end, we propose a partial and distributable MUS composition based on a new inconsistency."}, {"heading": "5.1 (Maximal) Partial MUS-decomposition", "text": "We modify I\u03b4D to take into account interactions between the MUS.

Such defined inconsistency measures (e.g. I \u2032 M and ID) are presented with desired properties. Distributable MUS decomposition allows inconsistencies to be resolved in parallel, which is a rarely considered methodology for handling large knowledge bases with important information. Complexity and practical algorithms are examined based on the progress of the MUS enumeration. We will investigate the lower complexity of the measure and examine future applications of the proposed methodology."}], "references": [{"title": "C", "author": ["J. Argelich", "X.
