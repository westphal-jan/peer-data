Game developers are always in constant search for techniques that can automatically create computer games minimizing the developer's task. In this work we present an evolutionary strategy based solution towards the automatic generation of two player board games. To guide the evolutionary process towards games, which are entertaining, we propose a set of metrics. These metrics are based upon different theories of entertainment in computer games. This work also compares the entertainment value of the evolved games with the existing popular board based games. Further to verify the entertainment value of the evolved games with the entertainment value of the human user a human user survey is conducted. In addition to the user survey we check the learnability of the evolved games using an artificial neural network based controller. The proposed metrics and the evolutionary process can be employed for generating new and entertaining board games, provided an initial search space is given to the evolutionary algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 1 Jun 2014 16:04:04 GMT  (879kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0175v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["zahid halim"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.0175"}, "pdf": {"name": "1406.0175.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "EVOLUTIONARY SEARCH IN THE SPACE OF RULES FOR CREATION OF NEW TWO-PLAYER BOARD GAMES", "authors": ["Zahid Halim", "Ghulam Ishaq Khan"], "emails": ["zahid.halim@giki.edu.pk", "rauf.baig@nu.edu.pk", "kashif.zafar@nu.edu.pk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "1EVOLUTIONARY SEARCH IN THE SPACE OF RULES FOR CREATION OF NEWTWO-PLAYER BOARD GAMESZahid Halimi Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Topi, Pakistanzahid.halim @ giki.edu.pkRauf BaigAl Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabiarauf.baig @ nu.edu.pkKashif ZafarDepartment of Computer Science, National University of Computer and Emerging Science, Lahore, Pakistankashif.zafar @ nu.edu.pkGames have always been a popular test bed for artificial intelligence techniques.

Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "2. Search Space", "text": "There is only one way to do this, which is to study the rules of some famous games and generalize them. Two famous board and chess numbers have been chosen for this purpose. Below is a discussion of the different characteristics of these two games, which we will, however, select for our search. Size of the game room is also a grid of 8x8 playing fields consisting of a grid of 8x8 playing fields that are alternately white and black. White squares are never used in chess pieces, but in the case of chess both are used. Size of the playing field in our search room is also a grid of 8x8 playing fields that can be used alternately white and all squares. In principle, this should be one of the dimensions of the search and one of the two ways it is never used, as it is used in Checkers or all the squares."}, {"heading": "2.9 Structure of the chromosome", "text": "1. The chromosome consists of a total of 50 genes. The first 24 genes can contain values from 0 to 6, with 1 representing a piece of type 1, 2 representing a piece of type 2, and so on. Zero is not interpreted as a piece. The figure type represented by gene 1 is placed in cell 1 of the game board; piece type represented by gene 2 is placed in cell 2 of the game board, and so on. Gen 25 to 30 represents motion logic for each character type, with 1 for diagonal forward and backward, 2 for diagonal forward and diagonal, 3 for all directions, 4 for L-shaped motion, 5 for straight and backward, and 6 for straight. Genes 31 to 36 are used for step size of each type, where 0 is used for single step size and 1 for multiple step size. Genes 37 to 42 are used for step size of each type, where 0 is used for step of each type, with 0 being used for step of the step of the game, and 1 for step of the step of the game."}, {"heading": "3. Fitness Function and Evolutionary Algorithm", "text": "Evolutionary algorithms need a mechanism to evaluate the fitness of individuals in the population. Our goal is to develop new games that are entertaining to play. Therefore, the fitness function must have properties that can somehow quantify the entertainment value of a game. In fact, we are looking for an answer to the question: \"What are the factors that make one board game more interesting than another?\" To answer this question, a look at the psychology literature might be helpful. Some theories that are of interest are described in the following paragraphs."}, {"heading": "3.1. Theories on Entertainment", "text": "In this state, the person is fully focused on the task they are performing and has a sense of full control. The state of flow can only be achieved if the task is neither too easy nor too difficult. In other words, the task should represent the right amount of challenge. Evolutionary search in the space of rules for creating new two-player board games 7 In addition to the right amount of challenges, Malone [10] suggests two other factors that make games engaging: imagination and curiosity. If a game has the ability to evoke the imagination of the player and make him feel that he is something exotic, then this game is more enjoyable than a game that does not."}, {"heading": "3.2. Quantification of Entertainment", "text": "In addition to the debate about the completeness or accuracy of the theories mentioned above, which Iida proposed in 2003, we are faced with the problem of transforming them into something limited to the problem at hand, i.e. two player board games. The three possible methods of collecting data are as follows: (a) An obvious method of quantification may be to have an overview of the average duration of play. If the number of participants in the survey is large enough, then some meaningful information about the games that are being compared can be used. (b) Statistics obtained from the games can be used. (c) Physiological signals from human players during games can be used. If we use an evolutionary algorithm for evolutionary games, then the number of game ratings is usually in the order of thousands. There is a population of games in each of the several generations that need to be evaluated and compared. This large magnitude excludes the reliability of the human game and we cannot use an option (a)."}, {"heading": "3.3. Proposed Fitness Function", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take one year to move on to the next round."}, {"heading": "3.3.3. Game Liveliness:", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Dynamism exhibited by the pieces:", "text": "This aspect assumes that a game whose rules encourage greater dynamics of movement in its pieces would be more entertaining than a game in which many pieces remain stuck in their cells for the entire duration of the game. Dynamics are captured by the following fitness function, which is given in Equation (3). Dynamics are averaged by calculating 20 games for the same chromosome. This fitness function is of higher value if the pieces exhibit more dynamic behavior. Usability of the playing field is interesting if the playing surface is used to the maximum during the game. If most moving pieces remain in a particular region of the playing field, the resulting game may seem strange."}, {"heading": "FF = w1D + w2I + w3Dyn + w4U (5)", "text": "In our experiments, we hold the value of these constants at 1. Multiplying with a corresponding weight allows us to control the relative influence of one aspect. Calculation of rank-based fitness eliminates the problem that one factor has higher possible values than another."}, {"heading": "4. Software Agents for Playing the Games", "text": "Since the evolutionary algorithm develops a population of games and the fitness of each game must be determined in each generation, we can have several thousand such fitness evaluations in total. Fitness evaluation means playing the game several times, which is not possible manually. We need software game agents. The smarter the agent, the better the accuracy of the fitness evaluation. We have developed two types of such agents: Random Agents. Agents that use Min-Max with rules-based evaluation function."}, {"heading": "4.1. Random Agent", "text": "The agent follows the following algorithm listed in Fig. 3: The agent first generates all legal moves and stores them in a queue; the queue is shuffled as soon as all moves are stored in it; shuffling is important because we need an average of 20 games to calculate the individual metrics; if the queue is not shuffled, the same sequence of moves is used to play the game every time the game is played, and fitness values remain the same in each sequence of games; if the duty to capture the bit is \"turned on\" in a chromosome that is being evaluated, the agent first tries to find a move that captures the opponent's figure; if no such move is found, he randomly selects a move from the queue."}, {"heading": "4.2. Agent using Min-Max with rule based evaluation function", "text": "Intelligent Agent generates all possible single-layer boards with a minimum max. algorithm. Each resulting board is evaluated on the basis of a rules-based evaluation function and the board with the highest evaluation depth is selected as the next move. Evaluation function allocates priorities (weights) to the type of piece, depending on whether its disappearance would result in the end of the game, the flexibility of movement and the capture of logic. Once the priority of a board is calculated, we multiply each board by its corresponding weight and calculate the weighted sum for ourselves and the opponent. The board evaluation is the self-weighted sum minus the weighted sum of the opponents. Fig. 4 lists the algorithm for the evaluation function we use. Since we use min-max of a single-layer sequence, we had to integrate a mechanism into the evaluation function to use the random effect minus the weighted sum of the opponents minus the weighted sum of the weighted sum of the evaluation function."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "The results of this experiment are presented in Table 8-11 (Appendix I). On the basis of these results, we will first compare the metric values for the developed games in Section 5.1 of this essay. Then, we will develop new board games with 1 + 1 Evolutionary Strategy (ES). Once we receive a series of developed games, we will first select a minimum number of games for analysis using Equation (7). To analyze and study the entertainment value of the developed games, we will pursue a triple strategy, i.e. by conducting a learning skills experiment with a controller, conducting a human user survey, and finally comparing the individual metric values of the developed games with the popular games Chess and Checkers."}, {"heading": "5.1. Evolution of New Games", "text": "To create new and entertaining board games, we use 1 + 1 EvolutionaryStrategy (ES). First, a population of 10 chromosomes is randomly initialized with permissible values, and the evolutionary algorithm is executed for 100 iterations. Mutation is the only genetic operator that is used with a mutation probability of 30 percent. In each iteration of the ES, one parent generates a child and a fitness difference is calculated between them. If this is greater than 4 (i.e. the child is at least half better than its parent), it is moved to the next population. We use the formula given in Equation (6) to calculate the fitness difference."}, {"heading": "5.2. Games for Analysis", "text": "The evolutionary process gives 8 games developed against entertainment, based on duration, intelligence, dynamics and ease of use. To further analyze these games, we select a set of different games. The diversity (from each other) of these games is calculated based on their fitness values and listed in Table 2 for an experiment. We calculate the diversity based on each of the four metrics for all games with Equation (7). The evolutionary search in the space of rules for creating new board games for two people 17- (7) The selection of a threshold of 0.6 Table 3 shows the diversity number of games developed. The diversity number indicates that a game differs from many other games based on all four metrics of entertainment. We select these three for further analysis. From this point on, we will refer to them as Game 1, 2 and 3. The rules of these games are listed in Figure 8 - Figure 10 (Appendix I)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Comparison of Evolved Games with Other Board Based Games", "text": "It would be quite instructive to compare the performance of the proposed technique with other heuristic solvers used in the manufacture of board games. [21] Other techniques such as [21] could ultimately result in a different board game, so that two games are only comparable, not the techniques. However, chess has a history of 1500 years [34] and the monopoly dates back to 1903. It would be more appropriate to consider the performance of developed games and chess and checkers based on individual entertainment metrics (previously proposed in this paper) as a yardstick. Table 4 lists the effects and values of each controller on the individual entertainment metrics. The results in Table 4 suggest that the entertainment value of popular chess and checkers games is comparable to that developed based on the proposed entertainment metrics. Table 4 shows the average value of duration, dynamics, intelligence and usability that is recorded 100 times each of the games listed."}, {"heading": "5.4. Learnability of Evolved Games", "text": "The entertainment value of the games developed must be verified against some other than the proposed entertainment metrics. To this end, we use the theory of artificial curiosity [7]. We must see how quickly a player learns a developed game. In order to observe the learning ability of the games developed, we must first ask a person to play a game several times and see how quickly he learns and how he performs the same task with software based on a particular player."}, {"heading": "5.5. User Survey on Entertainment Value of Evolved Games", "text": "In order to confirm the results of the human user survey, we must conduct a human user survey. To this end, we select a group of 10 people. Topics are selected so that they have at least some degree of interest in computer games. Each individual received 4 games, while playing each game 3 times, with the game rules already explained to the subjects and also displayed on the software they use, resulting in a total of 12 games played by each subject. Demographics of the subjects are summarized in Table 5; the age of the subjects, gender and similarity of the subjects to board games 1 are rated as the lowest and 10 as the highest. Learning skills rules are rated in Fig. 8 - Fig. 11. Game 4 is the randomly initialized (but legal value), while the remaining three games are developed for entertainment. Each subject was asked to rate the game they play as 1-popular and 10-highest."}, {"heading": "5.6. Hypothesis testing", "text": "To test whether the given hypothesis that the games developed are entertaining or not is true, we perform a hypothesis test. To this end, we first formulate the null hypothesis, which is as follows: H0: The correlation between the human value of entertainment and the entertainment contained in the games developed. To create a statistical test, we calculate a correlation coefficient c (z ') using Equation (8). So that for two games A and B it can be determined that A is more entertaining than B or otherwise, calculated as follows."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "The idea of evolving the game rules to produce new and entertaining games is intriguing.In this thesis we have introduced the automatic search for entertaining and new board games. To this end, we first define a search space that is extracted using the popular board and checkers games. This search space is provided to the evolutionary algorithm in the form of the chromosome population.To direct the evolutionary algorithm towards entertaining games, we propose a series of metrics that are extracted on the basis of different entertainment theories. The metrics include game duration, the intelligence required for the game, the dynamics exhibited by the game pieces, and the ease of use of the game.The results of our evolutionary search in the area of rules for creating new board games for two players 23 experiments are verified on the basis of the entertainment value of the human user, by conducting a human user survey, and an experiment on the learning type of the game, which may be more interesting than the entertainment function developed by controllers (the idea of using the entertainment function)."}], "references": [{"title": "World championship caliber checkers program", "author": ["J.

Game developers are always in constant search for techniques that can automatically create computer games minimizing the developer's task. In this work we present an evolutionary strategy based solution towards the automatic generation of two player board games. To guide the evolutionary process towards games, which are entertaining, we propose a set of metrics. These metrics are based upon different theories of entertainment in computer games. This work also compares the entertainment value of the evolved games with the existing popular board based games. Further to verify the entertainment value of the evolved games with the entertainment value of the human user a human user survey is conducted. In addition to the user survey we check the learnability of the evolved games using an artificial neural network based controller. The proposed metrics and the evolutionary process can be employed for generating new and entertaining board games, provided an initial search space is given to the evolutionary algorithm.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
