DECISION ALGORITM FOR TRAFFIC CONTROL AGENTS", "text": "In this section, the main features and assumptions of the decision-making algorithm for control agents in a self-organizing traffic light system are evaluated.The goal of the system under consideration is to minimize delays in a road network by controlling traffic signals at intersections. System components are agents that detect incoming traffic, make decisions and take control actions independently for each intersection in the network.Pseudo-code of a decision-making algorithm for traffic controllers is then transformed into algorithm 1. Input data from the algorithm consists of parameters that describe incoming traffic flows. This data is collected by vehicle detectors on sections of the road that are inserted into the intersection. Output of the algorithm is a control decision that determines which traffic flow should receive a green signal. Successive control decisions are made in constant time increments. To make the control decision, the agent uses a traffic model to approximate the current traffic status and predict its future development."}, {"heading": "4. PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "In this section, details of the proposed self-organizing traffic light control for an urban road network are presented. A major innovation of the introduced method is that the control decisions are based on predictions derived from interval microscopic traffic models. Itallows analyzes the delays with their uncertainties for individual vehicles in heterogeneous traffic flows."}, {"heading": "4.1. Interval microscopic model", "text": "The interval microscopic model of traffic flow combines cellular automation approach (Maerivoet and De Moor, 2005) with an interval-based representation of vehicle parameters. Due to the microscopic level of detail, the model can directly map parameters of individual vehicles. However, it means that the results of vehicle recognition can be directly taken into account in the decision making process. Cellular automats are used to simulate future evolution of traffic flows. Interval-based representation allows the model to take into account uncertainty related to vehicle parameters and driving behavior. According to this method, traffic flows are modeled in discrete time and space situations. A traffic lane is divided into segments of equal length, which are represented by cells in cellular automation. Traffic flows at an interface correspond to ordered vehicles. Each vehicle (i) in a traffic lane is described by its current position Xi (t) and Velocity Vi."}, {"heading": "4.2. Simulation-based prediction", "text": "In the proposed traffic control, the traffic model is based on a real prediction of traffic situations.

Selection of control action", "text": "control decision, i.e. the selection of the most appropriate (optimal) control action * is based on the predicted delay (cost). Intuitively, the agent should look for a minimum element in {C ()}, = 1,..., m. However, this basic definition requires a definition of a job relationship for intervals. (7) Moore also defines the equality of two intervals as babaBA andiff. (8) The first definition of the job relationship between two intervals A and B was taken from Moore's work (Moore, 1979). This basic definition is formulated as follows: baBA iff. (7) Moore also defines the equality of two intervals as babaBA andiff. (8) Upper definition of the job relationship \"<\" applies only to non-overlapping intervals. Therefore, the second definition of the relationship was adopted \"in the case of overlapping intervals.\""}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "The main objective of the experimental evaluation is to compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of existing self-organizing traffic control methods.The experiments were conducted in a simulation environment using a model of the urban road network based on stochastic cellular automatics.In order to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach, a comparative analysis was carried out taking into account previous self-organizing traffic control methods introduced by Helbing et al. (2005) and Gershenson (2005).To verify the effect of the simulation-based prediction method and the interval microscopic model.In addition, the impact of more detailed (microscopic) input data on the performance of self-organizing traffic control was investigated, considering the use of two different vehicle identification systems, i.e. vehicles traveling on the road or vehicles that can only be captured when a traffic network (and traffic microscope) data is collected."}, {"heading": "5.1.

SOTL", "text": "The SOTL algorithm (originally SOTL Train in (Gershenson, 2005) uses a very simple traffic model that takes into account the current number of vehicles approaching a given traffic light at an intersection. Each traffic light (i) has a counter i, which is set to zero at red and then increases at each step by the number of vehicles approaching that red signal. To prevent the traffic light from switching too often, the following minimum green time restriction is used: a green signal i will not be converted to red if i < min, where i is the time since the signal i turned green, min = 5. Another limitation in the SOTL algorithm is the size of the boards. According to this restriction, a green signal i cannot be converted to red if i is the time the signal i turned green, min = 5."}, {"heading": "5.1.2. SOC", "text": "The second algorithm considered for the self-organizing traffic control system (SOC) was proposed in (Helbing et al., 2005).

SOC_2", "text": "The SOC _ 2 algorithm uses the interval microscopic traffic model to predict the cost of certain control measures. This algorithm applies the simulation-based prediction method introduced in Section 4.2. The predicted costs correspond to vehicle delays at an intersection and are presented in intervals. To select the control measures to be carried out, the SOC _ 2 algorithm finds a minimal element in a set of values corresponding to the centers of the cost intervals."}, {"heading": "5.1.4. SOC_M", "text": "In the SOC _ M algorithm, the interval microscopic model is used to predict the green time required for vehicles to leave the intersection G\u03b1 and the number of waiting vehicles N\u03b1 (both of which are intervals in this case).The costs of control measures, i.e. the delay, are calculated in accordance with Equation (12).These calculations, however, are carried out using interval arithmetic, since the simulation results (G\u03b1, N\u03b1) are processed in the form of intervals. Finally, the evaluated cost intervals are analysed in order to make the control decision. This decision is made using the method presented in Section 4.3."}, {"heading": "5.1.5. SOC_2M", "text": "The most recently considered algorithm (SOC _ 2M) includes all the new elements of the proposed approach discussed in Section 4. According to this algorithm, the delays (cost of control measures) are evaluated directly during the traffic simulation in the interval microscopic model. Cost intervals are not converted into numerical values, so the selection of control measures is based on the interval order approach."}, {"heading": "5.2. Road network model", "text": "The simulation experiments were carried out using an enhanced version of the urban traffic model based on stochastic cellular automata (BBSS) originally presented in (Brockfeld et al., 2001). Topology of the simulated network is a square grid of 8 bidirectional roads with 16 signalled intersections. Connections between the intersections consist of 40 cells corresponding to a maximum distance of 300 m. At each intersection there are two alternative control measures: the green signal can be given to vehicles coming from the north and south or those coming from the west and east. A snapshot of the simulation scenario is shown in Figure 3.The urban road network in the BBSS model has square grid geometry. All roads are unidirectional. The dynamics of vehicles on the roads are simulated by using stochastic cellular automats with two parameters: maximum velocity vmax and randomized time parameters p."}, {"heading": "5.3.
