Also, it lacks the capability of sentence generation which is intuitive to humans. Here we present a novel method to summarize text documents taking the process to semantic levels with the use of WordNet and other resources, and using a technique for sentence generation. We involve semantic role labeling to get the semantic representation of text and use of segmentation to form clusters of the related pieces of text. Picking out the centroids and sentence generation completes the task. We evaluate our system against human composed summaries and also present an evaluation done by humans to measure the quality attributes of our summaries.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Jun 2014 20:22:30 GMT  (280kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1203v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["divyanshu bhartiya", "ashudeep singh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.1203"}, "pdf": {"name": "1406.1203.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Semantic Approach to Summarization", "authors": ["Divyanshu Bhartiya", "Ashudeep Singh", "Harish Karnick"], "emails": ["divbhar@iitk.ac.in", "ashudeep@iitk.ac.in", "hk@cse.iitk.ac.in"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "A. Pronominal Resolution", "text": "Pronominal resolution or anaphora resolution is an important task before we go deep into the process of summarizing. Anaphora resolution is the task of identifying the subject (noun) for a reference (pronoun). When people make pronominal resolution, they keep in mind the central idea and theme of the current information that is being transmitted. People do not need to go back to the document structure or write down the dots to make the resolution. People are able to do this intuitively and by refreshing their memory they can accomplish this task. Pronominal resolution is necessary to avoid reference structures.John helped Mary.
