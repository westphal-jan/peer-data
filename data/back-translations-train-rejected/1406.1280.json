Grapheme to phoneme (G2P) conversion modules, in literature, are usually rule based and work best for non-proper names in a particular language. Proper names are foreign to a G2P module. We follow an optimization approach to enable automatic construction of proper names pronunciation lexicon. The idea is to construct a small orthogonal set of words (basis) which can span the set of names in a given database. We propose two algorithms for the construction of this basis. The transcription lexicon of all the proper names in a database can be produced by the manual transcription of only the small set of basis words. We first construct a cost function and show that the minimization of the cost function results in a basis. We derive conditions for convergence of this cost function and validate them experimentally on a very large proper name database. Experiments show the transcription can be achieved by transcribing a set of small number of basis words. The algorithms proposed are generic and independent of language; however performance is better if the proper names have same origin, namely, same language or geographical region.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Jun 2014 07:07:44 GMT  (90kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1280v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sunil kumar kopparapu", "m laxminarayana"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.1280"}, "pdf": {"name": "1406.1280.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Basis Identification for Automatic Creation of Pronunciation Lexicon for Proper Names", "authors": ["Sunil Kumar Kopparapu", "Laxmi Narayana"], "emails": ["SunilKumar.Kopparapu@TCS.Com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "II.

Transcription of the optimal basis and the development of Pronunciation Lexicon", "text": "The base words are written in Devanagari12 (Hindi) script. By means of a reference table mapping Devanagari graphs to phonetic symbols, the Devanagari script of the base words is converted to the DARPA format accepted by the Festival TTS [14] and the SAPI format supported by Microsoft. For consistency, we had three people transcribe the base words separately and discuss them with each other in order to find a single set of transcriptions for all base words. One or more of these base transcriptions are linked to generate the transcriptions of proper names in the name database. Table II shows some base words and their corresponding transcriptions in the DARPA and SAPI formats, while Table III shows some proper names from the name database, their construction based on and the phonetic transcriptions obtained using the proposed algorithms."}, {"heading": "D. Accuracy of the system", "text": "The next step is to ensure that the generated transcriptions, obtained by manually transcribing the multiple person, are correct. Phonetic transcription of a proper name formed with two or more base words will vary if a base word has multiple possible pronunciations, resulting in a slight variation in the pronunciation of the names, minimizing the number of base elements that have multiple pronunciations, the greater the possibility of variation in their pronunciation. The cost function tries to maximize the length of the word that goes into the base, minimizing the number of base elements with multiple pronunciations. However, the optimization process results in multiple pronunciations that are used to generate transcriptions of the names in the name database."}, {"heading": "E. Comparison with Festival TTS G2P rule base", "text": "Column 6 in Table III shows the phonetic transcriptions of names generated from the vocabulary (OOV) using the G2P rule base for the words used in the Festival TTS Engine13. Results show that the transcriptions generated with the proposed method are more accurate than those generated with the Festival TTS rule base. Proper names are also synthesized using these two types of transcriptions, with the results that (a) a transcription obtained using the method discussed in this paper and (b) the transcriptions produced using the G2P rule base used in Festival TTS proved to be perceptibly better. Perception testing was conducted by asking two people who were not involved in the basic transcription process to listen to the synthesized proper names and evaluate the better of the two names for each name (they had no idea what transcriptions were used in the synthesization process)."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "Research on automatic G2P transcription has shown promising results for the phonetic transcription of regular texts where G2P transcriptions follow certain rules. Generating phonetic proper name transcriptions where the G2P converter cannot be applied directly requires human effort. In this paper, an optimization approach for the automatic generation of proper name pronunciations was proposed. We construct a cost function first and the transcription problem is reduced to a minimization of the constructed cost function. Two algorithms for identifying the basis and deriving the conditions for the convergence of the cost function were proposed. Experimental results on real databases of proper names confirm the derived convergence conditions and thus show that the developed optimization framework contributes to reducing the day-to-day task of transcribing proper names. The formulated framework work is general, and therefore not limited to data bases of proper names, although the intrinsic naming was carried out on an intrinsic database."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX A", "text": "BASISIn linear algebra, a base B of vector space V is by definition a set of linear independent vectors that spans V completely.

For words whose Bi is not empty, the elements of Bi are sorted in descending order of their lengths. A name bik of Bi is considered at a time and its position is fixed in the word bi. The rest of bi is filled with bik in the order in which they appear in Bi.
