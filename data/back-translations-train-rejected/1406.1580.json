Introduction", "text": "Information Retrieval (IR) is the science of searching for information within relational databases, documents, text, multimedia files and the World Wide Web 1998. IR applications are diverse; they include, but are not limited to, extraction of information from large documents, search in digital libraries, information filtering, spam filtering, object extraction from images, automatic summary, document classification and clustering, and web search. The user first submits a query, which is executed via the retrieval system. The latter consults a database of the document collection and returns the associated document to keep pace with the exponential growth of online data. Figure below shows the architecture of a general IR system. The user first submits a query, which is executed via the retrieval system."}, {"heading": "2. Classification Methods", "text": "This paper deals with methods for classifying texts in natural language, i.e. methods that predict the category of the query in the light of a series of training materials with known categories and a new document normally referred to as a query."}, {"heading": "2.1. Naive Bayes", "text": "The naivety of classification has found its way into many applications today due to its simple principle, but nevertheless strong accuracy [2]. Bayesian classifiers are based on a statistical principle. This probability is calculated from the presence of a word in a text document, in which all these probabilities are calculated, namely from the sum of probabilities for each category within the document."}, {"heading": "2.2. Term Graph Model", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it only takes one year to get to the next round."}, {"heading": "2.3. k-Nearest Neighbors", "text": "The original application of k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to text categorization was reported in [4]. The basic idea is to determine the category of a given query not only on the basis of the document closest to it in the document space, but on the basis of the categories of k documents closest to it. Against this background, the vector method can be considered an instance on the KNN method, where k = 1. This work uses a vector-based, distance-weighted matching function, such as Yang, by calculating the similarity of the document to the vector method. Subsequently, it uses a voting strategy to find the query class: Each retrieved document contributes a voice for its class, weighted according to its similarity to the query. The query evaluates the possible classifications according to the votes received in the previous step. Algorithm: 1) Make a vector for each document in the test set.2) Propose a vector for each of the vector of the class 3) for the possible classification of the respective vendors."}, {"heading": "3. Experimental Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. Dataset", "text": "The dataset used for this work is in the form of sgml files [3]. We used the Reuters-21578 dataset, which is available at [1]. There are 21578 documents; according to the ModApte split: 9603 training documents, 3299 test documents and 8676 unused documents. They have been manually labeled by Reuters staff. Labels belong to 5 different categories such as \"people,\" \"places,\" \"exchange,\" \"organization\" and \"topics.\" The total number of categories is 672, but many of them are very rare. The dataset is divided into 22 files with 1000 documents delimited by SGML tags."}, {"heading": "3.2. Implementation", "text": "For the classification of documents in Reuter-21578, we first pre-processed the data using various techniques: a. Word Bags b. Stop Word Removal c. TF-IDF d. Fallfolding e. Normalization. After pre-processing, we then applied the KNN, Term Graph and Na\u00efve Bayes algorithms to classify the documents in the training into five categories (exchange, organization, persons, places and topics). We applied our classification model to the test documents and calculated the accuracy by comparing it with the standard answers for the test documents. To compare the above algorithms, we used the following metric: Accuracy, defined as a percentage of correctly classified documents, is usually used to evaluate TC tasks with only one label. Subsequently, we created an application in which the user can enter some keywords and based on an algorithm that has a higher accuracy, we show the relevant document to the user."}, {"heading": "3.3. Results", "text": "We compared the accuracy of Na\u00efve Bayes, Term Graph and KNN for the text and document classification of our articles by Reuter 21578. As shown in the graph of Fig. 4, we found that KNN shows the best result with the accuracy given in Table 1. From the above results, we can say that KNN-based learning methods are more suitable than naive Bayes and Term Graph classification techniques for extracting text or documents. The accuracy given for KNN is much higher than naive methods, as shown in Table 1 for each category of the data set."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusion", "text": "We conclude that KNN has the maximum accuracy compared to Naive Bayes and Term-Graph 11. The disadvantage for KNN is that its temporal complexity is high but has better accuracy than others. We have implemented Term-Graph using other methods instead of the traditional Term-Graph used with AFOPT. This hybrid shows a better result than the traditional combination. Finally, we have a retrieval application using Vector Space Model to give the result of the query by showing the relevant document. In the future, we will focus more on Reducing Complexity, Increasing Accuracy and Text Summarization.5 References."}], "references": [{"title": "A Survey of Na\u00efve Bayes Machine Learning approach in Text Document Classification", "author": ["K.A.
