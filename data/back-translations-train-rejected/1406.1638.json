Each basic geometric relationship in Table 1 corresponds to an algebraic equality in the coordinates of the points and radii involved in the circles. Generally, a geometric relationship can be judged to be true if and only if its corresponding equality applies. Take incident (C, line A, B) as an example and let the coordinates of A, B, and C be (x1, y1, y1), and (x2, y2), and (x3, y3), respectively."}, {"heading": "3 Automated Generation of Geometric Theorems", "text": "It is noteworthy that geometric objects and their relationships derived from a single diagram image allow for explicit expression of certain non-trivial properties implicated in the diagram. Such properties generally apply to diagram families and can be specified as propositions. A geometric proposition is a true proposition about the implication of a geometric relationship (referred to as the conclusion of the theorem) in all diagrams that fulfill the same set of geometric relationships (referred to as the hypothesis of the theorem). Surprisingly, geometric theorems can be generated automatically and effectively from the information obtained from diagram images in three steps: generating candidate sets, excluding false candidates and proving the theorems obtained."}, {"heading": "3.1 Generating Candidates", "text": "It can be easily generated by selecting one (or more) geometric relation (s) as a conclusion and assuming some relationships other than the hypothesis. Since there are geometric objects and relationships that are irrelevant to the properties of the diagram, it is necessary to remove such objects and relationships for the efficiency of the theorem. It is necessary to determine such objects and relationships for the intersection of two lines or an intersection of two circles and a circle. A point of interest is referred to as a point of attraction if it is an end point of a segment, or the starting point of a half line or the intersection of two lines, or an intersection of two circles and a circle. Or the tangent point of two circles or a circle, or an isolated point. Points of attraction play an important role in the formation of the diagram problem. A point of attraction is referred to as a characteristic point when used in the expressions of properties or specifications of the J positions."}, {"heading": "3.2 Ruling out False Candidates", "text": "To verify the truth of a candidate position, we use algebraic methods that have been successfully applied to automated geometric theorems.

(A counter-example of a proposal is a diagram that is subject to the hypothesis of the proposal, but not the conclusion of the proposal.) If a counter-example can be found, then the proposal does not have to be a theorem.

These algorithms save a certain amount of memory space by first randomly computing a candidate line or circle, and then performing a proof-gathering process to further determine whether the line or circle actually exists. Note that most shape-detection methods are used to extract rough shapes of object edges from general images, and their accuracy need not be very high. To detect geometric objects, it is crucial to use OpenCV with numerical data (such as coordinates of points) to ensure that the accuracy of detection results is high enough for geometric relationships implied in diagram images to be correctly determined by numerical calculations."}, {"heading": "5.2 Geometric Theorem Discovery", "text": "The reader can use [6, 8, 9, 17, 20, 21, 24] and the references contained therein for extensive studies of algebraic methods (based on character sets, triangular decomposition, and Gr\u00c3 \u00b6 bner fundamentals) for automatic testing and discovery of geometric theorems. As examples, we cite the open web-based tool [3] developed for the automatic discovery of theorems and relationships in elementary Euclidean geometry, and the deductive database approach [7] proposed for the search for all properties implicit in given geometric configurations. Compared to the existing work, the ability to discover non-trivial theorems or deductive relationships to geometric relationships that arise automatically from given images of diagrams reflects the novelty of our approach."}, {"heading": "5.3 Other Related Work", "text": "In addition to coordinate-based algebraic methods, other methods of automated theory testing can be included in our approach to verifying the accuracy of candidate proposals, such as the area method, the full angle method, the bracket algebra method, methods based on Clifford algebra, axiom-based deductive methods and diagrammatic argumentation methods (see [2, 6, 21] and references to them) Some dynamic geometry software systems have implemented special methods (e.g. randomized testing methods in Cinderella [14]) to prove theorems for constructed diagrams or interfaces to geometric theory proofs for generating evidence in diagrams [23, 26] and knowledge in repositories of geometric constructions and proofs [19]. A web-based library of problems in geometry is created for testing and evaluating proofs and tools of automated theorems."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "The approach proposed in this paper opens up a completely new avenue for the discovery and reasoning of geometric knowledge: the retrieval of characteristic information (geometric objects and their relationships) from simple and inaccurate data (diagram images), the generation of potential knowledge (candidate proposals) from the information retrieved, and the discovery of profound knowledge (geometric theorems) and their validation by automated reasoning (evidence of geometric theorems).The success of our approach demonstrates the feasibility of automatically acquiring formalized geometric knowledge in quantity from a large scale of diagram images available in electronic documents and resources, and the efficient management of this knowledge in a retrievable structure with diagrams instead of ambiguous statements in natural languages. Our work is still ongoing. Further experiments are being conducted, and further techniques and strategies are being developed to recover the accuracy of retrieving geometric information from images and to derive static relationships from it to suitable candidates, in order to improve the efficiency of the specifications."}], "references": [{"title": "A formal system for Euclid\u2019s Elements", "author": ["J.
