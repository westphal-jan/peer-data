Introduction", "text": "As first proposed by Dempster [1], and then developed by Shafer [2], the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, also referred to as the Dempster-Shafer theory or theory of evidence, has attracted much attention for a long time and continuously growing interests. Even as a theory of reasoning in the uncertain environment, Dempster-Shafer theory has an advantage, the \"uncertainty\" by mapping the probability to the subranges of the proposition, which consists of multiple objects so that it is widely used in many areas [3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 12."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence", "text": "The Dempster-Shafer theory of proof [1, 2], also called the Dempster-Shafer theory or theory of proof, is used to deal with uncertain information. As an effective theory of proof, the Dempster-Shafer theory has the advantage of directly expressing various uncertainties; this theory requires weaker conditions than Bayesian probability theory, which is why it is often considered an extension of Bayesian theory. To complete the explanation, some basic concepts are introduced as the following. Definition 1. Let us be a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive elements cited by the Boundary Theory. (E1, E2, \u00b7, \u00b7, Ei, \u00b7, EN} (1) The Boundary Theory is referred to as a distinction framework."}, {"heading": "2.2. Pignistic probability transformation", "text": "In the transferable belief model (TBM) [40] pignistic probabilities are used for decision-making; the definition of pignistic probability transformation is shown as follows. Definition 4. Letm is a BPA within the framework of discrimination; its associated pignistic probability function BetPm: \u0432 \u2192 [0, 1] is defined as: BetPm (\u03c9) = \u2211 A P (\u044b), \u03c9 \u03c4A1 | A | m (A) 1 \u2212 m (\u03c6), m (\u03c6) 6 = 1 (7), where | W | is the cardinality of subset A. The process of pignistic probability transformation (PPT) consists in transferring the fundamental probability allocation to the probability distribution. Therefore, the pignistic betting distance can easily be determined by PPT."}, {"heading": "3. Multiscale probability transformation of basic probability as-", "text": "The main idea of the pignistic probability transformation is to transform the multi-element subsets into individual subsets. Although the pignistic probability transformation is generally used, it is not reasonable in Example 1. Suppose there is a framework for distinguishing one, b, c, which is given to BPAis as a consequence.m ({a}) = 0.2, m ({b}) = 0.7, m ({b}) = 0.05. In the pignistic probability transformation, for m ({a, c} = 0.05, the result is a = 0.05, b = 0.05. Actually, it is not reasonable, m ({a, c} = 0.05."}, {"heading": "4. Case study", "text": "In this section, an illustrative example is given to show the effect of the multiscale function when the value of q changes. Example 3.

Based on the pignistic probability transformation, the results of the pignistic probability function are presented as follows: BetPump (a) = 0.55, BetPm (b) = 0.25, BetPil (c) = 0.20."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "This paper proposes a multi-scale probability transformation of the basic probability mapping, based on the belief function and the plausibility function, which is a generalization of the pignistic probability transformation. In the multi-scale probability transformation, a factor q is proposed to design the multi-scale probability transformation in such a way that the multi-scale probability transformation has the ability to emphasize the share of each element in the differentiation frame. If the value of q is equal to 0, the multi-scale probability transformation can be degenerated as the pignistic probability transformation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-scale probability transformation, an illustrative case is provided."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The work is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 61174022), the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (grant number 20131102130002), the R & D Program of China (2012BAH07B01), the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) (grant number 2013AA013801), the open grant project of the State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University (grant number BUAA-VR-14KF-02)."}], "references": [{"title": "Upper and lower probabilities induced by a multivalued mapping", "author": ["A.P.
