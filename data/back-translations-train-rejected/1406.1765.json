To ensure that these guidelines are close enough to actual practice and therefore truly applicable, we have decided to make a diagnosis of the way the specifications are designed at the CNES and then compare this process with the recommendations of one of these guides. The aim is to assess the conformity of the requirements with the recommendations and see if they can be brought closer to reality. We will first briefly describe our corpus of requirements and the tools we use, and then the linguistic phenomena selected for study in the controlled natural language that we use as a reference."}, {"heading": "2.1 Description of the corpus", "text": "A subset of the specifications of an Earth observation satellite called the Pleiades, launched in 2011, was given to the CNES. From these specifications, we extracted the requirements, i.e. only those parts that play the role of contractual obligations between the CNES and its subcontractors. Requirements should not contain unnecessary information such as examples or comments. Requirements should be autonomous; they should therefore not be linked to the text segments that precede or follow them. In the specifications given to us, the requirements were easily identifiable because they were framed by certain keywords.The requirements were all written in natural language, but some also included tables or charts (which were removed as they could not be analysed automatically).Theoretically, they should also be fully understandable without these numbers - but in practice this is not always the case."}, {"heading": "2.2 Tools and resources", "text": "Syntactical analysis was carried out using Talismane [18], an open source parser developed in our laboratory, while the open source corpus processor Unitex [19] was used for sentence chunking. Short handmade Perl scripts were written for other purposes (requirement extraction, long sentence detection, etc.) We also compared our corpus to two other corpus (reduced to exactly the same size): (1) a manual written by CNES experts on techniques and technologies used for the construction and operation of spacecraft intended for half-experts, and (2) some articles in the French daily Le Monde."}, {"heading": "2.3 INCOSE recommendations", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to a different world in which they are able to escape than to another world in which they are able to escape."}, {"heading": "3 First results", "text": "In subsection 3.1 we present our results regarding the frequency of conjunctions, pronouns and long sentences in our corpus. In subsection 3.2 we propose a selection of examples that break the two rules of INCOSE and try to classify them according to their necessity (mandatory, useful or undesirable).2 \"The controller will retrieve the driver for the day,\" must be withheld from him. \"The controller will send the driver his itinary (sic) requirements for the day.\" Thanks to the syntactical analysis we were able to retrieve all occurrences of the so-called combinators (since no exhaustive list was given), we searched for all coordinating and subordinating conjunctions."}, {"heading": "3.2 Qualitative analysis (analysis of examples)", "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions and future work", "text": "We analyzed a corpus made up of real requirements written and used by CNES engineers to design a space system. We showed that their texts, even if they did not explicitly follow guidelines, had some interesting features, such as shorter sentences than in other text genres. We also examined two rules (relating to conjunctions and pronouns) of INCOSE, a guide to writing requirements. Using several examples from our corpus, we looked at cases where these rules were justified and others where they were not applicable (at least when applied verbatim) and should be refined. In fact, we believe that INCOSE, like the underlying guidelines, lacks adequate linguistic foundations and is not close enough to the real practices of engineers. For example, the recommended absence of pronouns from requirements - which sometimes implies cumbersome heavy repetitions - hardly seems to be compatible with its ideal of \"precision.\""}], "references": [{"title": "Variations in Terminology", "author": ["A.
