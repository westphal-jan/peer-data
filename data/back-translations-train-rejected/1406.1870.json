It has been documented for over a hundred and seventy years, with the first booklet Incwadi Yokuqala Yabafundayo produced in 1837. It is a Bantu language that belongs to the Nguni subgroup of languages consisting of isiXhosa, isiNdebele, siSwati and isiZulu. Bantu languages have characteristically agglutinating morphology that makes them rich and complex in structure, and one of the distinguishing features of isiZulu is the system of noun classes. Each noun in isiZulu belongs to a noun class. It is the noun class that controls the concordance of all words in a sentence, the structure of which is usually a verb object (SVO), although variations exist."}, {"heading": "3 Summary of the relevant grammar rules", "text": "The most important variables influencing the verbalization in isiZulu are the noun class of the OWL class and the category of the OWL class, whether the OWL class is an atomic class or a class."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental evaluation of the verbalisation patterns", "text": "The aim of the experiment is to show how understanding the basic structure of isiZulu can illuminate verbalization in isiZulu. Although there are different ways to verbalize something in isiZulu, and these options include sophisticated algorithms, the experiment was about identifying possible preferences for verbalizing subsumption, discrepancies, and quantifiers in isiZulu from the participants. The experiment also sought to determine whether variations in verbalizations were important for different participants, especially between linguists and non-linguists."}, {"heading": "4.1 Survey design", "text": "The experiment was as follows: 1) motto a set of sentences that test the patterns introduced in Section 3, include a few checks, add an \"either\" and \"neither\" option, and add auxiliary questions where the participant is a linguist or not, optional comments and optional contact email. Sentences are generated by manual application of the patterns. Question 1 gives the participant a choice between: a) Ikhambi ngumuthi; subsumption singular b) Amakhambi yimithi; subsumption plural c) Wonke amakhambi ngumuthi; using \"for all,\" and plural d) Yomithathu; either one of them e) Awukho; neitherQuestion 2 asks the same as in Question 1, but then using the giraffes."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results and discussion", "text": "Questioners 5 were invited to participate in the survey, among them students, academics (linguists) and non-linguists, such as administrators. In the short timeframe, this resulted in 12 completed responses, 5 of which are self-identified as linguists and 7 as non-linguists. Results are presented in Table 3 and the (anonymized) Excel file is available at http: / / www.meteck.org / files / CNLsurvey.xls, which also has a copy of the questions and the full answer options; here is question \"1. isa\" as described above in the materials and methods, and \"sing.\" corresponds to the first option Ikhambi ngumuthi, \"pl.,\" to Amakhambi yimithi and so on, and also to question 4 \"sing.\" The Ihebhivo alilona ikhanivo option, listed above as answer option a. The survey results show clear preferences of linguists, although this option is mixed, as 1 is a question."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "For languages with isolating morphology, such as English, verbalization templates are a good way to experiment with the development of controlled natural anguage, or they may even be sufficient for a use scenario, while this approach breaks down for languages with richer (agglutinating) morphology. So far, we have not found a single case where a simple template without grammar encryption support is sufficient. The survey showed some general preferences, such as the -dwa option cf -phi, and dislikes (futhi / kAnyone), and some notable differences in preference between linguists and non-linguists, such as the clear preference for subsumption and the unanimous preference for -dwa among linguists, and overall linguists agreed on their preference compared to non-linguists."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "The verbalization of formally represented knowledge in isiZulu requires a grammar machine, even for relatively simple linguistic constructs, which is mainly due to the noun classes, the agglutinative character of isiZulu, and the contextual knowledge of the position of the symbol in the axiom. Outstanding features of isiZulu that present a challenge are: i) the system of noun classes, ii) the system of complex agreement, iii) phonological copulatives, and iv) verb conjugation. We developed a number of possible verbalization patterns for simple subsumption, disjunctive classes, quantification, and conjunction. The collection of verbalization pattern preference revealed a clear preference for the -dwa option and a greater variation of preferences by non-linguists. Algorithms were developed for verbalizations that are extended to further major axioms and verb conjugations."}], "references": [{"title": "Several required OWL features for indigenous knowledge management systems", "author": ["R.
