A bundle bid generation problem", "text": "The problem of Bundle Bidding (BGP) must be solved by each carrier participating in a Combinatorial Transport Auction. A carrier c must decide what subsets of transport requirements he offers and what price he charges. Carrier c aims to maximize his revenue from the auction, i.e. the sum of the prices of his bundled bids accepted by the auctioneer. What complicates BGP is the distribution of the problem. On the one hand, there are competing carriers making competing bundle bids, the composition and prices of which carrier c is unaware of, i.e. there is asymmetric information. On the other hand, the decision-making power to accept which bids as winners lies not with carrier c, but with the auctioneer, i.e. there are several decision-makers with distributed decision-making power."}, {"heading": "2.1.

The problem in calculating an offer price p for an elementary group of requests is to find the driving salesman tour for S with minimal cost."}, {"heading": "4. Heuristic bidding strategies based on promising sets of elementary transport requests", "text": "Although intelligent systems to support transport decisions are proliferating, the optimal bidding strategy remains a mathematical challenge as the number of tendered requests increases. Therefore, we propose two additional heuristic bidding strategies: they are called pair synergy-based request clustering (PSC) and capacified p-median request clustering (PMC), both of which attempt to identify a subset of elementary bids that are promising. Section 4.1 describes the common elements of both bidding strategies, while Section 4.2 describes PSC and Section 4.3 describes CPMC.

General procedure", "text": "The basic idea of heuristic request combinations is to generate only those elementary request combinations that are supersets of promising request combinations (see algorithm 2 for an overview).The offer price calculation is identical to EBBS, but the generation of bundled offers for heuristic strategies differs. A number of promising element request combinations (P-E) is identified by first invoking the process cluster. \u2022 The result of generateAllElementaryRequestCombinations is a set of requests that is a superset of S (T-S, T-E). \u2022 The set union of all generated request combinations is called R-ElementaryRequestCombinations."}, {"heading": "4.2.

The second way to identify promising request combinations is a requirement to the facility locations. The second way to identify promising request combinations is a requirement to the facility locations, which includes decisions about the location of facilities in a network. A known problem of this class is the capitalized p-median problem (PMP), which is called the median. Each point must be assigned to a median so that the capacity of the median is not exceeded by the sum of the allocated points, and each point has a demand. The goal is to find a subset of p-points that are called medians."}, {"heading": "4.4. Random request clustering for evaluation purposes (R1 and R2)", "text": "For evaluation purposes, we propose two random bidding strategies, referred to as R1 and R2. R1 generates | R | Random bids. A random bid (pb, cb, Rb) is a bid where Rb'R is randomly generated but the calculated price pb is deterministically calculated as described in Section 3.5.2. Starting from Rb = \u2205 R, a r \u00b2 R request is selected with the probability of 1 | R |. Add r to Rb if the capacity limit of the vehicle is sufficient to meet Rb \u00b2, update R: = R\\ {r} and update Rb: = Rb \u00b2. Expand expand Rb until the capacity of the vehicle is exhausted, i.e. dr + companies \"s\" Rb \"ds > cap. Calculate the price pb for Rb according to Section 3.5.2.

Evaluation framework and test setup", "text": "Heuristic evaluation usually involves solving a series of test cases and measuring performance in the light of the objective functional values of the calculated solutions. A solution to a bid strategy is a series of pooled bids. However, an objective function that can directly measure the quality of the generated bids is not available. Therefore, we choose an indirect approach that takes into account the independent decision-making authorities of bidders and auctioneers. The test bodies (see next section) include the defined strategies for disseminating information. In turn, the evaluation of the generated bids is aligned according to this auction process. In Figure 1, they are defined by the white boxes, Carrier c corresponds to Carrier 1 and Br would be defined as B2."}, {"heading": "5.2.

Elementary bundle bidding strategy (EBBS)", "text": "For each of the 240 audit instances, we allowed a maximum calculation time of 24 hours. Within the given period, the exact bid strategy EBBS could solve 209 out of 240 cases. Of these 209 cases, the bidder could not win any business at all in 35 cases, i.e. f b = 0. This means that, according to the assumptions of section 3.1, a truthful bid strategy cannot win any of the advertised requests in these 35 cases, because the competition from competing bids is too strong. Furthermore, none of the proposed heuristic strategies will lead to winning bids for these instances, since the bids generated by the heuristic strategies are always a subset of the bids generated by EBBS. Therefore, we compare the bidding strategies against these 174 instances. As expected, the calculation time of EBBS in Table 5 in the Annex will show an increasing number of possible elementary bids per instance."}, {"heading": "5.3.2. Comparing effectiveness of the bidding strategies", "text": "The effectiveness of a bid strategy? is measured at least in the categories indicated in Table 3. > Table 3 shows the aggregated results for each of the four heuristic strategies. Two effects become clear. However, unlike PSC and CPMC, the random bid strategy R1 is unable to exploit the potential sales volume to a significant extent for the vast majority of cases. Therefore, the performance of PSC and CPMC is more than simply random. Taking R2 into account, it also becomes apparent that the generation of random clusters of promising requests, which are used as nucleus to construct elementary bids (cf. Algorithm 2) is less effective than a systematic approach to identify promising request clusters such as those used by PSC and CPMC, and is a crucial element in designing successful bid strategies."}, {"heading": "5.3.3. Comparing efficiency of the bidding strategies", "text": "The EBBS, PSC, CPMC strategies differ significantly in terms of computing time. For all 209 solved cases (including the 35 cases with f b = 0), the mean runtime for EBBS, PSC, CPMC is 152 seconds, 9 seconds, and 3 seconds, respectively. However, the average runtime for EBBS, PSC, CPMC is 153 minutes, 20 minutes, and 0.75 minutes, respectively. The average success rate for CPMC is an order of magnitude faster than PSC, and PSC is an order of magnitude faster than EBBS. This effect can almost exclusively be attributed to differences in the number of bundled offers generated, the average success rate for CPMS3 = 0.035 percent, for PSC 3 = 0.081 percent, and for CPMC 3 = 5.72 percent. Therefore, heuristic strategies are a serious alternative to EBBS when the trade-off between used sales volume and runtime is taken into account."}, {"heading": "5.3.4. Effects on auctioneer\u2019s total procurement costs", "text": "Table 4 shows that the maximum increase in procurement costs is about 11 percent if the auctioneer uses the PSC strategy, while the other CPMC, R1 and R2 strategies offer a worse worst-case performance, as the cost increase for each strategy is about 25 percent. PSC strategy is more competitive for the auctioneer than CPMC strategy, which is based on the mean and median value of Table 4. As the table shows, the auctioneer is likely to be able to significantly reduce his procurement costs if he provides advanced data and decision support tools to support the auctioneer bidding process."}, {"heading": "6.

In order to win any revenue in the auction, the bid of our carrier has to offer the lowest total costs for R compared to all possible combinations of bundle bids which also cover R. This seems highly unlikely for larger transport auctions. The second strategy generates several bids which inhibit the same expressiveness as the single bid of the first strategy. If all bids of the second strategy are accepted by the auctioneer, the assigned requests and the won revenue are identical. With this in mind, the third strategy will be at least as successful as the first and the second strategy. On the one hand, simply because the set of the generated bids are supersets of the bids generated by the fist and the second strategy. On the other hand, because it generates more bids which offer a higher chance to be a good match with bids of rivaling carriers. Of course, the computational effort for solving 2|R| \u2212 1 vehicle routing problems is prohibitive high considering the number of requests in many real world auctions. In the following, we develop an approach which guarantees the same results as the brute force strategy but generates significantly less bids. 3.2. Relations between the valuations of sets of requests Some terminology with respect to the relationships between costs for performing sets of requests are introduced. First, performing an additional request always increases (or at least does not decrease) the total costs of a carrier. Let A and B be two sets of requests (A, B \u2286 R). If A \u2286 B it follows that p(A) \u2264 p(B). This relationship is denoted as free disposal. The term originates from the point of view of an auctioneer that does not have to pay a fee for disposing purchased items wherefore the auctioneer\u2019s utility of receiving additional items given the same price (ceteris paribus) never decreases. Due to the pricing function p, free disposal is a guaranteed characteristic of the scenario at hand. Second, Nisan (2000) introduced subadditive, superadditive, and additive valuations between disjoint sets of items in combinatorial auctions.", "startOffset": 25, "endOffset": 2079}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "The idea is: if two requests i and j (i, j \u2208 R) do not provide high synergies, then it is no-good to consider supersets of {i, j}.

Generation of benchmark instances The bidding strategies are compared by means of benchmark instances. An instance consists of a set R of requests tendered by the auctioneer and a set Br of bundle bids of the rivals of carrier c. Furthermore, the vehicle capacity cap is given. All in all, 240 instances have been generated in which between 15 and 40 requests are tendered and up to 5000 bids of rivaling carriers are present. The set of requests is implicitly defined by a depot node d and a set V of customer nodes, each with a required load li (i \u2208 V). The warehouse node w and the depot node d are set equal, as explained below. The distance between two nodes is calculated as the Euclidean distance (L2-norm) rounded to the nearest integer value.

The exact bidding strategy is based on the concept of elementary request combinations. We show that it is sufficient and necessary for a carrier to bid on each elementary request combination in order to guarantee the same result as bidding on each element of the powerset of the set of tendered requests. Both heuristic bidding strategies identify promising request combinations. For this, pairwise synergies based on saving values as well as the capacitated p-median problem are used. The bidding strategies are evaluated by a computational study that simulates an auction. It is based on 174 benchmark instances and therefore easily extendable by other researchers. On average, the two heuristic strategies achieve 91 percent and 81 percent of the available sales potential while generating 36 and only 4 percent of the bundle bids of the exact strategy. Therefore, the proposed bidding strategies help a carrier to increase her chance to win and at the same time reduce the computational burden to participate in a combinatorial transport auction.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
