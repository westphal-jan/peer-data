As a result, research in biomedical information extraction is becoming increasingly important, and relationship extraction is one of the most important. It is not only practical, but it is also the foundation of the relationship database and biological knowledge network, and it also plays a key role in predicting therelations and drug production. Now, relationship extraction has already become a hotspot, but there are also some problems. For example, the result is not good enough, and some important information such as direction and type are ignored. This paper has researched two aspects: improving the outcome and more accurate representation of more information about relationships, for example direction. In the direction of the characters of biomedical literature, we have designed some new features and extracted relationships with the good machine learning model SVM, and the experiments have shown that the results were good."}, {"heading": "2 Extracting Protein-Protein Interaction", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Problem definition", "text": "If two protein names and an interaction word occur simultaneously in a sentence, we can transmit the mission by concluding that there is a PPI between the two proteins. First, the sentences were filtered by the simple rule that two protein names occur side by side in a sentence. Second, we used a trained SVM model to solve this classification problem. After relation extraction, we decided on the direction of the relationship as it is important for building a biological network."}, {"heading": "2.2 Feature design", "text": "The basis of the basic features consisted of context features, sub-tree features and sentence features, each feature being designed for different situations.Tab.1 Basic information of logical features Meaning (1) Distance # of words between two proteins (2) proNumBT # of proteins between two proteins (3) VerbBT Whether the verb between (4) puncNum # of punctuation between two proteins exists Tab.2 Basic information of dependence Features Meaning (1) P1DW The word protein 1 depends on dependence (2) DT1 The word protein 1 depends on s (3) puncNum # of punctuation between two proteins Tab.2 Basic information of dependence Features Meanings instance (1) P1DW The word protein 1 depends on dependence (3) P1DW protein (4) The word proteins depend on two (2) WOS proteins WOS clause 1 The WOS clause 1 The WOS clause 1 The WOS clause 1 The word protein 1W (2) The WOS clause 1 The WOS clause 1W (2) The basic features (1) The basic features (1) WOS protein WOS clause 1 WOS clause 1 The WOS 1 WOS 1"}, {"heading": "3 Experiment", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Corpus and preprocessing", "text": "We use the standard corpus LLL05 corpus (J.
