In [14, 17] non-monotonous extensions of DLs based on the T operator were proposed. In these extensions, which focus on the basic DL ALC, the semantics of T are based on a preferred logic P. Moreover, and more importantly, the concept of the minimal model used here is completely independent of language and is determined only by the relational structure of models. [6] Develop a concept of rational closure for DLs. You propose a construction to calculate the rational closure of an ALC knowledge base that is not directly based on Lehmann and Magidor definition of rational closure, but similar to the construction of rational closure proposed by Freund [12] on a propositional level. In a later paper, she introduces an approach based on the combination of rational closure and breakable inheritances."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions", "text": "In this work, we have proposed an extension of the rational closure by Lehmann and Magidor to describe the SHIQ logic, taking into account the semantic characteristic of reason proposed in propositional logic, to SHIQ, which does not enjoy the endless model.
