Therefore, changing or modifying business rules necessarily requires the intervention of software engineers, as they are inaccessible to business experts (e.g., health professionals, financial professionals, etc.) who understand the real problem area and are responsible for finding solutions. As a result, companies cannot keep up with the changing business environment. The Business Rules Approach (BRA) has evolved over the years to address the deficiency described above [5]. It claims that all business rules should be based on Xiv."}, {"heading": "2 Business Rules and Controlled Natural Languages", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Business Rules", "text": "In the literature, we find numerous definitions of business rules. However, the most commonly used definition is given by the Business Rule Group (BRG) [2] as follows: \"A business rule is a statement that defines or restricts an aspect of the business, intended to assert the business structure or control or influence the conduct of the business.\" For example, a loan must be approved if its value is less than 10,000 Euros. One challenge with the BRA is to find the characteristics of a good business rule. In connection with the BRA [1] [4], some workers have proposed a number of characteristics that are considered good for a business rule. Among them, we can cite that a business rule is atomic, declarative, enterprise-related, uniform, unambiguous, etc. In connection with the BRA [1] [5], many formal languages have been proposed by many vendors for modelling business rules. These languages have a well-defined syntax, a clear secondary mania, and are the rules that support automated thinking for most of the rules of the 7."}, {"heading": "2.2 Controlled Natural Languages", "text": "CNLs are constructed subsets of natural languages whose grammars and vocabulary have been systematically restricted to reduce both the ambiguity and complexity of complete NLs (e.g. English, French, etc.). [8] In general, CNLs fall into two broad categories: human-oriented CNLs and machine-oriented CNLs. Human-oriented CNLs are designed to improve communication between people for specific purposes and improve the legibility and intelligibility of technical documentation. They have no formal semantics and are usually defined by informal guidelines [9]. Machine-oriented CNLs are designed to improve communication between people and computers. They are completely unambiguous and can be defined by formal grammars with a direct correlation to formal logic [9]. Machine-oriented CNLs can be used in various domains and applications such as CNL to represent knowledge [10], Processable English, [11] for the translation of CNL, [14] for CNL translation, etc."}, {"heading": "3 Related Work", "text": "The idea of verbalizing rules that already exist in a formal representation [16] [17] has led to the domain of business rules becoming an interesting application of CNLs. Since business rules must be approved and followed by people with no particular background in formal or logical representation, it is important to have an intuitive representation that CNLs can offer. There are some CNLs that have been defined for this particular problem area. In the business context, the Object Management Group (OMG) 3 has published a standard called SBVR [20], which provides a means of describing the meaning of rules expressed in the natural language that business people use. However, SBVR itself is not a CNL, so it is up to each SBVR implementation of language or notation to specify its formal mechanisms [19]. SBVR claims to be limited to semantics, with the key functionality of NLs being syntax."}, {"heading": "4 RuleCNL: A Controlled Natural Language for Business Rules Specifications", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Introduction", "text": "In this section, we present our rule CNL for formulating business rules. As mentioned in the introduction, its methodology is based on aligning the definitions of business rules with the business vocabulary, making business rules semantically linked to the business area and easy for domain experts to understand. It is derived from the BRA's basic idea, advocated by the BRG, as follows: \"Rules build on facts, and facts build on concepts expressed in terms.\" [3] To overcome the limitations highlighted in the previous section, we defined a formal grammar and thus a parser that can be used to syntax rule analysis; the writing process of a business rule is fully supported by the consistency check imposed by the methodology; its semantics are defined by automatic assignments to the SBVR semantics, enabling a language-independent description of the semantic structure of rule statements and based on a solid theoretical foundation."}, {"heading": "4.2 RuleCNL Vocabulary", "text": "The term \"domain\" stands for the conceptual model of the business domain, which defines a coherent set of related concepts (domain terms and their relationships) that a particular company uses in its speech or writing in the course of doing business. It is defined in a structured manner by a business user and represents the knowledge that the company knows about itself. RuleCNL is domain independent and the vocabulary consists of: - Domain Term: means a significant business entity that can be represented by a common noun or a noun phrase. (e.g. the customer, the gold customer, the bank account, etc.) A domain term is always defined in a singular form and without any article or definition."}, {"heading": "4.3 RuleCNL Grammar", "text": "In fact, most of the people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to play, to play, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to play, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance"}, {"heading": "4.4 Formalization of the Grammar", "text": "To create a RuleCNL parser, we have formalized our grammar rules with the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF), a notation used to indicate context-free grammars. RuleCNL grammar consists of a set of paraphrasing rules that are used to limit the syntax of rule statements. An excerpt from the general rule pattern is in Fig. 3. The vertical bar (|) is the disjunction and the comma sign (,) is the conjunction. The symbol () + means that at least one rule element enclosed in brackets must appear at this point."}, {"heading": "4.5 RuleCNL Semantics", "text": "The semantics of RuleCNL are defined by automatically mapping RuleCNL rules to the semantic description of the SBVR. SF is part of the SBVR specification [20], which provides a means of describing the meaning expressed in NL of rules used by businessmen. SF is an abstract and language-independent syntax to represent the meaning of a rule in a set of logical structures so that it can be processed by machine. The full SBVR-SF is not represented in this essay, but can be found in [20]. Figure 4 shows the resulting SF in the XML form generated by the RuleCNL tool using the example of rule 1 under rule 1: It is mandatory that the customer \"John\" maps at least one orderDomain term to noun concepts, determiners to quantification, domain names to individual concepts, domain verbs to fact types, coordinators to test subjects, etc."}, {"heading": "5 RuleCNL Tool", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Implementation", "text": "An important feature of a reliable CNL is its tool support, since one of the biggest problems (if not the biggest problem) with CNLs is the usability of a new CNL by the end user [9]. In reality, the limited expressiveness due to the constraints of the vocabulary and grammar of the CNLs leads to the difficulty of writing statements that correspond to the imposed constraint. Writing syntactically correct statements without tool support is much more complicated because the user has to learn syntax constraints, which in many cases are not trivial to explain. Therefore, we have developed editors that make the writing process and usability of RuleCNL as effortless as possible. There are two editors: a Vocabulary Editor (fig. 5) and a Reader (fig. 6). The Vocabulary Editor supports the user in specifying his vocabulary. It has two customized and dynamic approaches to the use of vocabulary (a notary and a)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Evaluation", "text": "An ideal CNL should be easy to learn and expressive enough to describe the domain problem. Therefore, we evaluated RuleCNL for its expressiveness and intelligibility. For the experiment, we gathered about 50 business rules from real-life case studies of two companies written in English and French, the first in banking and insurance, while the second is a semi-state company. Assessment was conducted by four end users who were divided into two groups: Group 1 consists of two economists without background in formal notations of business rules, and Group 2 consists of two business users with a background in information technology. Our goal was twofold and was to find out how many business rules RuleCNL could formalize in a natural way and how easily users could understand formalization. Thus, valuation metrics are the expressiveness and understanding of RuleCNL rules in a formal way."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "The ultimate goal of bridging the gap between natural and formal languages has presented interesting research problems in the field of CNL. In this article, we introduce RuleCNL, a CNL for specifying business rules. RuleCNL's goal is to help business professionals formalize their business rules in a computer-friendly manner. RuleCNL syntax is defined by formal grammar and its semantics are defined by automatic mapping of RuleCNL rules to semantic formulations of the SBVR. RuleCNL provides editors to help end-users with the writing process. RuleCNL and its tool have been evaluated with satisfactory results by business experts. We are currently improving the tool and expanding the evaluation to include many other companies. Future work will consist of getting from the SBVR SF to some production rules for control motors or software components."}], "references": [{"title": "Business Rules Applied: Building Better Systems Using the Business Rules Approach", "author": ["V.H.
