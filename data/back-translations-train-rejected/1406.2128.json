Preliminaries", "text": "Some basic theories are presented in this section, including Physarum type algorithm for shortest path selection, user equilibrium in the transport network and basic concepts of Fuzzy set.2.1. Physarum type algorithm for shortest path selection. The shortest path selection process of Physarum polycephalum is based on the morphogenesis of the tube structure [18, 25]: on the one hand, the high rate of protoplasmic flow stimulates an increase in tube diameter, whereas pipes tend to decrease at a low flow rate. Therefore, the tube thickness adapts to the flow rate. On the other hand, the decrease in tube thickness in the organism is accelerated. Thus, the tube structure develops according to an equilibrium of these mutual antagonistic processes. Based on the observed phenomena of tube structure development, a simple Physarum polycephalum model is proposed, which is mathematically simplified and tractable."}, {"heading": "2.2.

On this basis, anyone can make the decision that does not conflict with each other. However, in reality, due to some ambiguous events or local information, we can make the decision for the transport network in relation to the fluffy information of the transport network. In general, the fluffy information can be divided into three types: inaccurate travel costs, uncertain network topology and inaccurate travel demand. In this paper, we look at the user balance problem in relation to fluffy travel costs or fluffy user balances. According to Section 2.2, the fluffy user balance can be expressed as follows: min Z (w) = a (w) dw) dw, (20) s.t."}, {"heading": "4.
