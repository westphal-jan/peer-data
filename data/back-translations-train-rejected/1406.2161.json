It takes a tableau branch as an argument and indicates whether b is in agreement. When it is invoked with the original tableau rule for (V, 0), it returns whether V | = 0. Running mcTableau primarily explores a tree whose nodes are tableau branches and each child is created by applying a tableau rule to its parents. Rules are applied in a specific order and after applying a rule, the witness is marked as \"not applicable,\" thus avoiding an infinite loop.

We also define analytical tableaux methods for verifying formulas in the starless fragment and in the complete DL-PA. The complexity of these methods corresponds to the complexity class of their respective problems. Subsequently, we compare these methods with similar approaches and discuss possible improvements and extensions. The methods presented in this thesis were inspired by other methods already proposed in the literature. For example, De Giacomo and Massacci [3] (see also [12]) inspired the technique for the Kleene star. As already mentioned, the naive strategy would create tableau branches with exponential size in the input formula. The idea of remembering the tree and conducting equality tests stems from this work. Assigning propositional variables to formulas. DL-PA can be extended with assignments based on formulas in L, instead of the simpler formula."}, {"heading": "A Rules in Numerator-Denominator Form", "text": "For the convenience of the reader, we present here the tableau rules in the more traditional form of the counter and denominator."}, {"heading": "B Proofs", "text": "(Consistency).
