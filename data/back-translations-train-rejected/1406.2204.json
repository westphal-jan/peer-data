Thus, Funk et al. \"s evaluation of CLOnE language for semantic web-ontology [4] gave participants phrases such as,\" Create a Journal of Periodical subclass. \"Graphic terms.\" Hallett, Power, and Scott [6] gave their participants artificial texts for the task of constructing SQL queries, such as, \"How many patients receiving surgery for malignant neoplasms of the central part of the chest did not have curative radiation therapy.\""}, {"heading": "3 Tools, Materials and Method", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 OWL Simplified English", "text": "OWL Simplified English (OSE), [15], is a relatively formless language in which each sentence expresses an OWL statement and entity names (for individuals, classes, and properties) are recognized by their relationship to a handful of common English keywords such as \"the,\" is, \"has,\" and \"a,\" with minimal classification of content words. It is up to the author to decide whether to create text that would be recognizable or intelligible as natural English. Thus, \"A because is an of.\" in the sentence \"A dog is an animal.\" would also be a valid OSE sentence, meaning that the class \"because\" is interpreted as a class name. \"3OSE\" is relatively unlimited when limited with other CNs that require vocabulary. \""}, {"heading": "3.2 SWAT Editing Tool", "text": "The editing tool4 used in this study was developed for the SWAT project5, as described in Power [16]. It implements OSE [15] and dynamically builds OWL statements as the user types OSE sentences. Its predictive interface provides sentence patterns (as full sentences or subsentences) and feedback on the OWL statement under construction. As the user types, text is analyzed character by character and automatically colored brown for class names, purple for individuals, blue for properties, and green for literals. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the editor set up for the study, with the source text inserted as a comment at the top of the editing pane (which was larger than here), a context-sensitive list of allowed sentence or continuation patterns (RHS), and a context-sensitive message range for dynamic feedback. In the editing area, a sentence \"One acid is an end substance,\" which is accepted as a grammatical state in English WSE, nevertheless."}, {"heading": "3.3 Materials", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to abide by the rules they have imposed on themselves.

Of course, newcomers had difficulties and needed more guidance, such as examples of syntactically correct sentences. Alternative interfaces such as WYSIWYM [14] have some success with newcomers at the expense of the freedom to type text as in a conventional editor. Dialog systems currently under development, such as the WhatIf! project [13], could provide a way forward. If a system had the ability to respond with intelligent and appropriate questions and comments about the possibly unintended effects of input knowledge, it could even allow newcomers to gain an insight into formal semantics and thus construct logically consistent KBs."}], "references": [{"title": "Sydney OWL Syntax - towards a Controlled Natural Language Syntax for OWL 1.1", "author": ["A.
