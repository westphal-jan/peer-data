Randsdell Hall, the Augenstein Alumni Center, and the Downing Student Union. Part of the rebuilding process is the regular and temporary removal of sidewalk lengths across the campus, giving workers access to pipes like water, electricity, and so on under the concrete. To minimize disruption, these relocations are scheduled for the less busy summer and winter semesters, and it was during one such summer that I paid my rent by working on campus. Every morning, I cycled from my apartment near the southwest edge of campus to the northeast beach, where I worked as a web application developer for the Kentucky Mesonet.ar Xiv: 140 6.22 34v1 [cs.SE] 9 JQuickly, although I was frustrated walking around these broken sidewalks, finally asked, \"What is the most reliable way on campus?\""}, {"heading": "2 Review", "text": "This problem has obvious and well-researched implications for computer and information networks, but it also has implications for design processes introduced in Section 5. We note here the research on related graph theory and fault tolerance problems and their differences with our problem. Thomas Wolle looks at an undirected graph with risk probabilities associated with each edge, and calculates for multiple errors \"for a large number of different properties whether Y holds.\" [11] Akiyuki Yano and Tadashi Wadayama look at undirected acyclic graphs, where risk is associated with each edge, but these risks are functions of a hidden random variable [1]. Panagiotis Papadimitratos et al and Weidong Cui et al seek multiple paths through a network, so that the correlation of errors between graph paths is minimized."}, {"heading": "3 Definitions", "text": "Our solution is based on the concept of \"risk accumulation\" backwards from the vertex of the target point. Once the vertex of the source is reached, the scout greedily selects the edge with the least accumulated risk at each step. If a failed edge is found, the scout updates his knowledge of the network, gathers anew, and continues it. To model this behavior, the scout's current knowledge of the network should be graph G = (V, J) with a series of probabilities of risk associated with edge group J. Let Ri define the risk of edge i and edge i its accumulated risk. Our principle theory then is to determine the correct definition of R so that a greedy scout behaves optimally."}, {"heading": "3.1 Eagle-Eye Model", "text": "We refer to our first definition of R as the \"eagle-eyed\" model. This model, whose risks and accumulated risks are each referred to as E and E, is based on intuition and is expressed in Equation 1, where N (i) is the number of outgoing neighbors of i.E, i = egg, i = N (i) E and j (1). Let's imagine the chance that a path through edge i does not fail. Both must be successful and a successful path must exist through at least one of its neighbors. Equation 1 is simply the logical inversion of this statement, which expresses risk instead of success. Figure 1 gives an example. However, this model can \"see too far\" on the sidewalk. Let's imagine that an edge i leads to an infinite number of neighbors, each of whom has a high but less certain probability of failure."}, {"heading": "3.2 Bat-Eye Model", "text": "The \"bat-eye\" model takes into account the limited range of vision of the scout as he navigates through the network, and the order in which he tries to cross edges. That is, the neighbors of i are in some ways sorted from the least to the greatest accumulated risk. This model, whose risks and accumulated risks are each designated by B and B. This model, whose risks and accumulated risks are each defined by Equation 3. C (i; j) is the probability that neighbor j is selected from i and A (j), is the accumulated risk that remains after edge j, respectively defined in Equations 4 and 5. Since C (i; j) requires knowledge of the edges of order, the scout will try to specify N (i; j) the neighbors of i that are attempted before edge j. Unlike Bi (Bi; j), the neighbors of i are tried, i = Bi (Bj) that this active edge (i) is not weighted (Bj), the first (Bj) that (Bj) is selective."}, {"heading": "4 Validation", "text": "If the combined risk of all the paths that pass through each edge is known, why should the Boy Scout not choose what minimizes that risk? Equation 3 determines this combined risk and can be divided into three terms: the first, Bi, represents the probability that I myself will fail; the second, Bj, the probability that all neighbors of i will fail; and the third, Bi (i; j) A (j), a sum of fragmented probabilities, each the chance that a given neighbor will be selected and the risk that remains after that edge."}, {"heading": "5 Implications", "text": "We now turn our attention to the probable scenario in which R is unknown. Unless there is specific information about the distribution of lengths and risks in the network, we can only assume that all edges are equally long and the same risk is 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1. If Ri is left as a variable in both models, this has an interesting result: a polynomial is associated with each edge [6]. For the sake of simplicity, it should be noted that P (\u03b1; i) denotes the polynomial for edge i if R = {\u03b1,...}. The consequence of these polynomials in development applications is a \"risk aroxon,\" in which there is no universally safe path. That is, since the value of \u03b1 is aligned from zero to one, the path that a greedy pathfinder would follow changes. In the example of Figure 2, it is more reliable to take the longer but denser path; however, above this value it is best to run on the shorter path because \"the best examples are for it to be intuitive.\""}, {"heading": "5.1 Baking Cakes", "text": "An accessible example of this paradox might be to follow the instructions for making a cake. Instead of linking risks to each edge, risks are linked to the experience of each cook. Therefore, an experienced cook would have a low \u03b1, while a beginner would have a high \u03b1. And instead of a simple recipe, there are alternative steps throughout the process that ultimately lead to the same cake. It may seem that the less experienced cook wants to take the conceptual path with more \"back-up\" plans, but in a scenario structured like Figure 2 with a success rate of one-third or less, these back-up plans are not enough to compensate for the increased number of steps."}, {"heading": "5.2 Software Engineering", "text": "A hypothetical software company has developed a design process structured as a graph that has the \"risk paradox.\" This company has contracts with customers who expect reliably delivered products, and the employees of that company have a wide range of experience levels. A developer intern has been assigned a particularly difficult individual project - perhaps as a skill test. What path through the development process should he or she take? Should this newcomer deal with the \"most reliable shortest route\" [5]? Should the start-up \"just run around\" until it has gathered the necessary experience to work as a team? How should the project manager take the skill level into account when planning the task sequence? Because this paradox - and this problem - has little applicability in processes that are simple or have minimal ramifications, perhaps we will benefit by including explorative phases in our considerations, such as the initial conversations with the customer, and how the requirements following the meeting may be fixed or unclear."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "Herbert Simon proposed a curriculum for \"design science,\" starting with the philosophical definition of the \"artifact,\" and ending with a human model that defines all human activity as navigating through conceptual space. [10] From this point of view, where design is progressing by exploring possible next steps and implementing them in order and in search of a satisfactory end goal, our pathfinding problem is particularly powerful and forms the basis for a framework of \"reliable design.\" Our research in this area is still in its infancy. It has been thoroughly researched in communication networks [3]. We then deal with physical systems very similar to our \"broken sidewalk\" - if not literally sidewalks - where their condition has deteriorated in cities to such an extent that \"even if the sidewalks miraculously stopped, it would take 69 years to repair all existing damage.\" Secondly, we will consider two-way concepts, perhaps, in a process that we can consider and consider."}], "references": [{"title": "Reachability under uncertainty", "author": ["Allen Chang", "Eyal Amir"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.5253,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Path finding under uncertainty", "author": ["Anthony Chen", "Zhaowang Ji"], "venue": "Journal of advanced transportation,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Reliable shortest path problems in networks under uncertainty: models, algorithms and applications", "author": ["Biyu Chen"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Backup path allocation based on a correlated link failure probability model in overlay networks", "author": ["Weidong Cui", "Ion Stoica", "Randy H Katz"], "venue": "In Network Protocols,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Solution to assignment", "author": ["S.
