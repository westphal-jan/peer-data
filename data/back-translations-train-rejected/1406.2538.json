[1] The central idea of framesemantics is that word meanings must be described in relation to semantic frames. Therefore, the frame and the lexical unit are the key components of FrameNet. A lexical unit is the combination of a problem with a meaning - each new meaning of a word represents a new lexical unit. In FrameNet, each lexical unit refers to a semantic framework it purports to evoke. FrameNet's framework descriptions are coarse-grained and generalize lexical variation. Although FrameNet addresses all parts of the speech as a frame evoking lexical units, its focus focuses on verbs for which the best coverage is provided. The semantic framework describes a particular situation and the participants in that situation, which are likely to be mentioned in the sentences in which the target lexical elements are presented as small (in English) frames."}, {"heading": "A [Durationone-year] STINT", "text": "Target [Positionas Assistant Lecturer] [Emploloyerat University College London] was followed by a research year in the United States.

Essentially, the goal of such information extraction is to populate the ontology shown in Fig.4 with instance data from the source code. To this end, frame semantic parser (produces instances for the blue boxes in Fig. 4) must be combined with Cross Document Coreference (CDC) techniques to automatically determine which mentions in the text refer to the same real entity (instances for the yellow boxes in Fig. 4). We have implemented such an integrated information extraction system and populated it with data from about 1 million newswire articles. From a practical standpoint, it turned out that the bottleneck of the approach is named entity detection and linking of accuracy - even at an estimated 80% accuracy CDC-like entries - they merge with different entries."}, {"heading": "5 FrameNet Controlled Natural Language (FN-CNL)", "text": "FN-CNL was inspired by the PAO-CNL approach described in [6]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, FNCNL is a verbalization of the content of the knowledge base (in whole or in part) using a FrameNet verbalization framework, such as [11]. We implemented FN-CNL verbalization for 26 frames in the Latvian FrameNet and also tested that frame semantic parsing on this FN-CNL output achieves almost 100% accuracy (which can be further improved by manually editing human editable C6.0 frames). FN-CNL verbalization examples can potentially be used for learning unique FN-CNL examples by human writers. In general, FN-CNL is not limited to 26 frames of the Latvian FrameNet - FN-CNL, which are presented as the first multilinguistic FN manual."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We have illustrated the mutually enriching relationship between information extraction and CNL domains, and described a complete framework for extracting information from natural languages based on FN-CNL and AKR.
