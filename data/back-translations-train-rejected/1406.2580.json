We used MSRM (Maximal Similarity based on Region Merging) method for segmenting the flower object from the background and extracting the shape feature such as the distance from the edge to the centroid point of the flower, aspect ratio, roundness, moment invariant, fractal dimension and also extract color feature. We used HSV color feature with ignoring the V value. To retrieve the image, we used Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. Orchid is a unique flower. It has a part of flower called lip (labellum) that distinguishes it from other flowers even from other types of orchids. Thus, in this paper, we proposed to do feature extraction not only on flower region but also on lip (labellum) region. The result shows that our proposed method can increase the accuracy value of content based flower image retrieval for orchid species up to $\\pm$ 14%. The most dominant feature is Centroid Contour Distance, Moment Invariant and HSV Color. The system accuracy is 85,33% in validation phase and 79,33% in testing phase.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Jun 2014 15:11:27 GMT  (333kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2580v1", "Proceeding of International Conference on Computer, Control, Informatics and its Applications 2013, pp. 53-57"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceeding of International Conference on Computer, Control, Informatics and its Applications 2013, pp. 53-57", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["d h apriyanti", "a a arymurthy", "l t handoko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.2580"}, "pdf": {"name": "1406.2580.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Identification of Orchid Species Using Content-Based Flower Image Retrieval", "authors": ["Diah Harnoni Apriyanti", "Aniati Murni Arymurthy", "Laksana Tri Handoko"], "emails": ["diah007@lipi.go.id", "aniati@cs.ui.ac.id", "laks001@lipi.go.id"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords - flower image retrieval; orchid; centroid contour distance; HSV color; Support Vector MachineI. INTRODUCTION Manual identification of the plant needs skill, more information, more thoroughness, and also more time. We rely so much on experts to find out what the name of the plant is. At the moment there is a limited number of taxonomists in Indonesia [1].Orchid is one of the largest families in the class of flowers. Not only with leaf, stem, and root, but in general we can also use the flower as a parameter in the identification of orchid species. Indonesia is believed to have a high variety of orchids, as there are so many species of orchids that are not yet revealed in the world of science."}, {"heading": "A. Data", "text": "We use 300 images of orchids, consist of 10 genera. Each genus consists of 3 species, and each species consists of 10 flower images taken from the front. We get the data from various sources such as personal collection photos, photos of colleagues and photos from the Internet with different sizes, resolution, distance and light intensity. We used 5-cross validation for the training phase to divide 300 images into 2 data sets, training sets and validation sets. We also use 30 images of orchids for testing. These 30 images are new images that have never been used for the training / validation phase."}, {"heading": "B. Pre-Processing", "text": "The size of the flower images is no more than 600x500 pixels to adjust with the MSRM segmentation software [11] and the image resolution is 96 dpi (default result of the imresize () function in Matlab).We made a small change in the output of the MSRM source code. If the output of the MSRM is a white segmented object with a black background, our output is a color segmented object with a black background. Segmentation was performed twice, on flower region and lip region. After segmentation, we performed morphological operations such as erosion, expansion, filling holes and 8-connected components to refine the image."}, {"heading": "C. Feature Extraction", "text": "We did not perform the function of extraction on the flower region and the lip region, so we were only slightly modified when we had two points there. Various data prompted us to use the color and shape characteristics, which are invariable on scale, rotation, transmission, light intensity, etc. Form characteristics we used are distance from the center to the edge of the flower / lip region, aspect color ratio, roundness, moment invariant and fractal dimension, while color characteristics are the flower shape of the flower with disregard for the V value. There are three characteristics used in the name of distance from the center to the edge, which are CCD (Centroid Contour Distance), and SF2.We chose CCD because it represents the flower shape by curve shape and is invariant on scale and rotation. [4] To be invariant, we can start from the rotation we have from the lip region with the center of the white point in the lip region."}, {"heading": "E.
