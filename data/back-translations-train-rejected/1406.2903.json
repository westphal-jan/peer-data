This process depends heavily on the existence of ontologies that describe the area of interest. Formal data representation can be a significant deterrent for laymen or small organizations that develop ontologies and then want to benefit from the introduction of semantic technologies. Controlled natural languages are defined as \"subgroups of natural languages whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted to reduce or eliminate both ambiguity and complexity\" [Schwitter and Tilbrook, 2004]. The aim of this paper is to provide a snapshot of the state of the art, the snippets of which have been limited to reduce or eliminate the ambiguity and complexity of knowledge."}, {"heading": "2 Main CNLs for the Semantic Web", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Attempto Controlled English ACE", "text": "In fact, it is that it will be able to put itself at the top, at a time when it is not as far as in the past, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We are able to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said."}, {"heading": "2.2 Grammatical Framework GF", "text": "In fact, it is as if it were a matter of a kind, as it is in the USA, in Europe, in the USA, in Europe, in Europe, in the USA, in the USA, in Europe, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA, in the USA,"}, {"heading": "2.3 Other CNLs", "text": "It is essentially an extension of the Controlled Language for Ontology Editing CLONE [Funk et al., 2007], but it is much more powerful in terms of grammar expressivity and ontology authoring skills. Like CLONE, Rabbit is implemented with the GATE framework [Cunningham, 2002]. Rabbit was developed by the National Cartography Agency in the UK - Ordnance Survey. Rabbit can be converted to OWL5 to provide natural language support for ontology authoring. OWL development is not the primary goal of Rabbit. It is primarily a vehicle for collecting, displaying and communicating knowledge in a form that is easily understood by domain experts. There are three broad types of sentences in Rabbit explanations, axioms and import statements. Interestingly, a particular class or concept can be based on a specific ontology in Rabbit i.e."}, {"heading": "3 Generation driven CNLs", "text": "What you see is what you mean - WYSIWYM In terms of the ontology-driven generation of CNLs, or conceptual authorization, a well-known implementation that includes the use of NLG to support the knowledge generation process is WYSIWYM.
