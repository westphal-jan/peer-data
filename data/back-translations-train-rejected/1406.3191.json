Nowadays, due to the enormous amount of data available, there is great interest in spatio-temporal data analysis. Among various analytical tasks that can be performed on spatio-temporal data, hotspot analysis is recognized as an important tool in security informatics and bio-monitoring. For example, when using hotspots in the event of crime, a result such as the City Center between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. would be a spatio-temporal hotspot. Results such as the City Center or City Park would be strict spatial hotspots, and 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. and 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. are samples of temporal hotspots. The goal of hotspot analysis is to identify spatio-temporal regions based on data that show significant differences compared to the rest of the data.In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal hotspot analysis approach based on sensors or decomposition [6] and eigenvector elements that match. This approach can be used to solve two types of problems."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "In this context, the approaches based on clusters have their own limitations and strengths. Their prominent advantage is that they provide an exact form of clusters that are opposed to the scan statistics-based methods, where clusters necessarily have a regular shape and are not realistic. On the other hand, dealing with complex data for cluster-based techniques is not easy. Scan statistics approaches are based on Kulldorff's original work [8] and its variant extensions, and are developed to detect anomalous patterns from spatial empirical datasets. Table 1 shows a comparison between our approach and space-time scan statistics (ST-scan)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Space-time Scan Statistics (ST-Scan)", "text": "There are several variants of ST-Scan approaches. The introduction and comparison of the work with all these dozens of variants is outside the scope of this work. Therefore, we limit ourselves to the introduction of the ST-Scan method [8]. ST-Scan exhaustively moves a varying radius and height cylinder across the spatio-temporal space, the height of this cylinder corresponding to the time dimension and the surface covering the space dimension. Subsequently, it calculates a score F (S) based on the following probability ratio statistics [11] (equation 1) for each spatio-temporal cylinder: F (S) = (CB) C (Ctotal \u2212 C Btotal \u2212 B) Ctotal \u2212 C (1), where C is the total number and B is the baseline in S and Ctotal and Btotal are also the total number and the baseline of the search area. Subsequently, all possible cylinders are sorted based on the highest to lowest score and a marginal omization test is carried out to maintain the current importance."}, {"heading": "3 Detection of Spatial and Temporal hotspots", "text": "Here we present our proposed algorithm for the detection of spatial and temporal hotspots. As well as ST-Scan, our algorithm obtains three sets of data: population data, case data and geographical data. Results of the algorithm are spatially probable clusters, spatial hotspot clusters and temporal hotspot intervals. The algorithm consists of three main parts each. The first part is tensor decomposition (lines 1-2). The second part is eigenvector elements that match in lines 4-6 (spatial) and lines 7-9 (temporal) and the rest of the algorithm is assigned to spatial (lines 10-29) and temporal (lines 30-44). The required geographical data differ a bit from ST-Scan. In ST-Scan geographical data include the coordinates of each region."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "We used our algorithm on a real dataset and tried to compare its performance to ST-Scan as the basic method for assessing algorithm performance. We used MATLAB on a personal PC with Intel Core 2 Duo CPU and 3GB Ram. During the experiments, three MATLAB toolboxes were also used: Tensor Toolbox [1], ITA Toolbox [15] and Mapping Toolbox [10] for displaying the results on the map. In the following, we present the used dataset and get results."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data Set", "text": "The original data source is the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute of New Mexico, which was collected by the New Mexico Tumor Registry between 1973 and 1991 for 32 sub-regions of New Mexico State, United States. There are 1175 reported cases of malignant neoplasms of the brain and nervous system. Each data set includes the region of residence, the year of diagnosis, the age group in the 5-year interval (19 groups), race (white, black, others), and gender. Similar attributes are also available for populations. The data set is publicly available under [7]. We also used the spatial extension of PostgreSQL [13] in the New Mexico State Formfile to extract the neighborhood matrix. Finally, we converted the data sets into the tensor format. We made three tensors in different order: 2D {D1 space cell = 2 years, D2 sex cell = 5 years (population = 5 years), where we = 5 sex attributes."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results", "text": "In the following subsections we discuss the results obtained for each research question. 1. What is the benefit of a higher order data modeling? How can we choose the sequence? 2. What validity do the detected hotspots have? 3. How does our approach not score significant regions? 4. How does our approach deal with the temporal trends in population data? We applied our algorithm to the generated 2D, 3D and 5D tensors and then compared the hotspot clusters of first and second priority with the ST scan results presented in [8] (which are already obtained via the SatScan software). Results for the first priority clusters are shown in Figure 3.a and for the second priority clusters in Figure 3.b. We used standard metrics such as F1 (F-measure), precision, and recall, as well as for comparing the results of the algorithm with ST-Scan. This result is shown in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Validation of hotspots by comparing with ST-Scan results.", "text": "Looking at Table 3, it is easy to see that the way in which our algorithm has detected the important spatial regions \"Bernalillo and Chaves\" and two important temporal hotspot centers: 85 and 89. As you can see, this result is similar to ST-Scan. ST-Scan delivers three further clusters \"Chaves,\" \"Curry and Roosevelt\" and \"Los Alamos.\" Among these clusters, SST-Hotspot has successfully detected \"Chaves.\" However, \"Curry and Roosevelt\" are neighbors of Chaves and Los Alamos is almost close to Bernalillo. In other words, SST-Hotspot has detected the center of the events both spatially and temporally effectively. Looking at the obtained result from ST-Scan (upper left figure in Figure 3.a and Figure 3.b), we find two large affected zones with the center of Bernalillo and Chaves. Both centers are detected by SST-Hotspot, as expected, the most significant parts of the space appeared."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Effects of different tensor ordering.", "text": "The solution provided in [8] was to increase the incidence rates 1.2 percent per year based on the available growth rate of population data. On the basis of this adjustment, the only reported cluster of SatScan software is \"Los Alamos and SantaFe\" in the years \"86-89.\" Our algorithm SSTHotspot on 3D order was also able to detect this hotspot. For example, in our 3D ordering experiments and in the S1 list, we received DS (Los Alamos) = 0.005 and DS (Santa Fe) = 0.004, where the standard deviation of the DS vector was equal to Std (DS) = 0.004. There were only these two regions in the S1 list that their distances together were lower than the standard deviation of the DS vector (| 0.004-0.005 | = 0.004 < 0.004) and were therefore shown as the most likely hotspot in the 16 algorithm."}, {"heading": "4.2.3 Pruning functionality evaluation.", "text": "As we have already mentioned, our algorithm has two functions: First, it can be used as a method for spatial and temporal detection of hotspots from multidimensional data, and second, it can be used as a pre-processing step in the ST scan process to reduce the search space. It can prune thousands of non-significant spatial or temporal regions in ST-Scan. This means that more coverage is required and therefore the recall measure would be more significant for us. Because if it is used in ST-Scan, it should cover more candidate regions to be tested in the ST scan process. Therefore, accuracy does not make a scene, because the final decision on the anomaly of the regions should be made by ST-Scan test. However, if SST-Hotspot is applied independently, F measurement must be taken into account instead. The best F measurement obtained for the first priority list of the 3D model does not make a scene, because the final decision on the anomaly of the regions should be made by Scan-ST scan."}, {"heading": "4.2.4 Trends handling ability.", "text": "When we configure ST-Scan to time trend justification, only one cluster is detected: Los Alamos and Santa Fe in the years 86-89. ST-Scan actually increases the case numbers by 1.2 percent annually due to the growing trend in the population. Therefore, its output is different than if this time trend justification is not performed. Our algorithm based on 3D data could also detect this spatial hotspot Los Alamos and Santa Fe at the same time, but this was not detected in 2D and 5D data. An obvious reason for this is that this cluster is determined in ST-Scan results based on adjusted numbers for age, gender and race. So 2D data that ignore all other attributes will definitely not detect this. 5D data is also, as already mentioned, unable to detect that due to large fit differences between its population and its case models. The reason why 3D model could detect this fact is that it takes into account the correlation between all the time variables."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future works", "text": "The experimental results show the effectiveness of these techniques. Our approach is not a substitute for ST-Scan and its variants can be considered rather as a helpful method for reducing the search space in the ST-Scan process, although this method could be adapted independently to monitor spatially and temporally different data. We have also shown that multi-path data analysis improves the quality of detection as already expected. A major drawback of our approach is its inability to automatically connect the separate spatial and temporal hotspots to identify spatially and temporally different hotspots. Another problem is that the current version is retrospective. Adapting the algorithm for online detection would be another feature research guideline.
