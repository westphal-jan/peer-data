Introduction", "text": "Twitter 1 is a popular microblogging web service that allows users to share and view short messages online, and also features a number of social networking features. Launched in 2006, Twitter today has over 645 million active registered users, generating an average of 58 million messages or tweets per day (Statistics Brain, 2014). With over 9,000 tweets sent per second from around the world, the Twitter data stream has the potential to provide previously unimaginable insights into individuals \"views on a wide range of topics (Mullen, 2012). Mood analysis refers to the use of technology to identify, extract and process subjective information from source material, including attitudes, emotions and opinions. Often referred to as opinion forming, Sentiment Analysis natural1 https: / / www.twitter.com uses language processing, machine learning and statistical analysis in its processing of starting materials. Starting materials can be any human language constructs, ranging from product ratings to election analytics, to huge bloggers\" feelings."}, {"heading": "2. Research Description", "text": "Much innovative Twitter sentiment analysis exists, including research in areas such as political elections (Bakliwal, et al., 2013), product ratings (Mukherjee & Bhattacharyya), and the fluctuating mood of Twitter users over time (Mislove, I., Lehman, S., Ahn, Y., Onnela, J. & Rosenquist, N., 2010), but there seems to be very little research in the area on which this work will focus. As a first step in this research project, the Twitter Tweet Application Programming Interface (API) 2 will be used to tap into the Twitter stream and collect user tweets in real time for later processing. Next, a well-known Sentiment Analysis Dictionary 3 will be used as the starting point for creating a custom sentiment dictionary based on the content of our captured tweets."}, {"heading": "3. Data Description & Processing", "text": "To capture tweets, you first need to register an Application 5 with Twitter to get the data needed to authenticate on Twitter through its API. Once an Application has been registered and authentication information has been obtained, this data is written in a custom Tweet Sentiment 6 to capture tweets from the live stream. Tweet data is then stored in JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, format and saved to file.Tweets were captured for 4 one-hour sessions per week, over the course of 3 weeks. The times of the week selected to collect the data were based on previous research throughout the period of the4 http: / / www.cs.waikato.ac.acs / weka 5 https: / apps.twitter.com 6 https: / github.com / mmmayo13 / tweet-sentimentscore.com."}, {"heading": "4. Experiments & Discussion", "text": "The researcher coached a simple k-means clustering model in Weka. By accepting all default values, which included the construction of 2 clusters with all attributes, the record was split 67 / 33 percent, and 9950 / 4813 by number of instances. In Table 1 below, cluster 0 matches shorter tweets, with a centroid of about 41 characters long, which has a centroid sentiment score of about 1.2. Cluster 1 matches longer tweets, with a centroid of about 104 characters long, while Tweet 0 matches shorter tweets, with a centroid of about 3.8 characters long, which is evident in the form of Figure 1, it appears that the sentiment scores are initially centered narrowly on the centroid length of the cluster, and as tweet length increases the likelihood of a particular tweet, the centroid score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score, it is initially centered narrowly on the centroid length of the cluster, and as tweet length increases the likelihood of a particular tweet being a entier score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score score."}, {"heading": "5.
