[1] Compared to well-known industrial examples such as CFE / CTE or ASD-STE100 [2], [13], [cf. 3], KBA did not create a stand-alone project in a controlled language, but wanted to redefine the authoring process for technical documentation. Language standardisation was necessary to support this goal. I will explain this background in the first paragraph. In the following section, I will take a closer look at the results of various projects that have produced different language rules. These rules and style guidelines will illustrate how KBA unintentionally laid the foundations for a de facto controlled language. After showing some future instructions for the project, I will discuss its results within the current theoretical framework."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "In fact, most people are able to decide for themselves what they want."}, {"heading": "3 Language Constraints at KBA", "text": "KBA opted for a modular approach to the development of technical documentation, which means that the documents are constructed by combining different text modules and blocks, which can already be stored in a database, but could be written by different authors at a different time and for different products.The reuse principle requires not only homogeneous layout and typography, but also explicit linguistic rules for all the authors involved to maintain or achieve a single language. Therefore, standardised terminology not only improves (machine-assisted) readability of the manuals for the target audience, but also supports the implementation of reuse technology; for example, the vocabulary is used to index modules and blocks. Therefore, standardised terminology improves (machine-assisted) retrievability. In summary, it was the variability of the products and the desire to make the process of technical writing more efficient, which led to the development of the style / syntax and explicit rules."}, {"heading": "3.1 Lexical Level", "text": "This year, it will be able to establish itself in the region in order to pave the way to the region."}, {"heading": "3.2 Syntactic and Stylistic Level", "text": "Unlike other countries in the world where people are able to survive on their own, the world is able to survive on its own. < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < <"}, {"heading": "4 Prospects", "text": "The four critical projects that led to the linguistic rules - CMS, Terminology, Writers \"Manual and Translation - have been completed, but the maintenance and further development of the rules is an ongoing process. Further tasks such as the productive use of a CLC are yet to be completed. More importantly, the development described is normative only for the Technical Documentation Department, but apparently other departments can benefit from the use of linguistic constraints. Some applications could involve CAD models, ERM (mainly terminology) and press software (both terminology and syntax / style). Some ways to implement a controlled language for these applications have already been explored, but remain a challenge for the future. Overall, the main objective of the modular approach and reuse still needs to be evaluated. KBA will pursue the reuse of the REx method [16]. The resulting data could then be used for further interpretation of the linguistic contribution to (improved) reuse. 1110: http: / acroxE-February 11, 2014 (Ziexgler)"}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "Against the background of the fact that this is a country in which most people live in poverty, in which most of them live in poverty, in which most of them live in poverty, in which most of them live in poverty, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, they, in which they live."}, {"heading": "6 Concluding Remarks", "text": "The case of KBA shows that the concept of controlled language needs to be rethought, it can result from conscious decisions that do not necessarily need to be called and conceived as a design of controlled language. Indeed, the distinction between controlled languages and style guides is vague [12, p. 124] and needs to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and perhaps only at a certain point in time, which also suggests that there may be more companies that have language codes that are not affected by the discourse of controlled languages. Furthermore, a new type of controlled language - to improve the authoring process for technical documentation - needs to be considered. From a practical point of view, the case of KBA shows that technological development has made controlled language easier and more affordable. There is no longer a need for tailor-made software solutions to implement the specifications of a controlled language. There is a range of standard software that can be adapted to specific needs, making the development and implementation of a controlled language easier and more affordable for companies, and opening up to medium-sized businesses."}], "references": [{"title": "Einf\u00fchrung in die Terminologiearbeit", "author": ["R.
