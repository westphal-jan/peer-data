Opinion Mining or Sentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing and Information Extraction task that identifies the users views or opinions explained in the form of positive, negative or neutral comments and quotes underlying the text. Aspect based opinion mining is one of the level of Opinion mining that determines the aspect of the given reviews and classify the review for each feature.

Semantic orientation is a task to determine whether a sentence has either positive, negative or neutral orientation. [6] [14] Opinion Mining is performed on three levels [3]: Document level: At this level, the entire document / sentence is classified as positive, negative or neutral for each feature in the document / sentence. Document level and sentence level classify only the entire document or sentence as positive, negative or neutral. Aspect level: At this level, the entire document / sentence is classified as positive, negative or neutral for each feature in the document / sentence. Document level and sentence level only classify the entire aspect in the document / sentence, i.e. if the polarity of the document is positive / negative, this does not mean that the document has a positive / negative opinion for each aspect."}, {"heading": "2. EXISTING RESEARCH WORK", "text": "Some of the existing research in aspect-based opinion forming is mentioned below: By using a distance-based approach, words and phrases are removed from the opinion after aspects have been extracted. To calculate the polarity of each extracted opinion word, WordNet was used. 10 \"syntactic dependency templates\" were used by A.-M. Popescu et al. [1] via a dependency tree to correlate identified product features with the opinion words. Relaxation labeling technique to determine the semantic orientation of potential opinion words in the given review. The negative words were also handled by them. Sentiment lexicon was proposed by N. Godbole et al al. [12] by using a word net, and sensations were associated with each entity and it was assumed that one found in the same sentence as an entity. A propagation-based method was suggested by Qiu et al."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED SYSTEM", "text": "The proposed system is based on unattended technology [4]. Dictionary-based approach of unattended technology is used to determine the orientation of sentences. WordNet [7] is used as a dictionary to determine the opinion words and their synonyms and antagonyms. The proposed work is closely related to the work of Minqing Hu and Bing Liu on mining and the summary of customer reviews [11]. Figure 1. Gives an overview of the proposed system \"Aspect based Sentiment Orientation System\" [15] [16]. The reviews of mobile phones are considered to be input into the system, all reviews are collected from the Amazon website (www.amazon.in), which is used as input into the system. All characteristics of the product on which reviews are submitted would be identified and the orientation of the set for each feature would be determined. The polarity of the given sentence is determined on the basis of the majority of opinions, which will be positive, at the end, the system will be made more simple for these features and the orientation of the sentence would be based on the negative ones."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data Collection", "text": "In order to determine the polarity of sentences based on aspects, large amounts of reviews are collected from the Web. There are many websites on the Internet where the large number of customer reviews is available. Ratings are collected on the Amazon website (www.amazon.com)."}, {"heading": "3.2 POS Tagging", "text": "After collecting the ratings, they are sent to the POS tagging module, where the POS tagger marks all the words of the sentences on the corresponding part of the speech tag [5] [8]. POS tagging is an important phase of opinion formation, it is necessary to determine the characteristics and opinion words from the ratings. POS tagging can be done manually or with the help of the POS tagger. Manual POS tagging of the ratings takes a lot of time. Here, the POS tagger is used to mark all the words of the reviews."}, {"heading": "3.3 Feature Extraction", "text": "All features are extracted from reviews and stored in a database, then the corresponding opinions are extracted from those reviews."}, {"heading": "3.4 Extracting Opinion Words & Seed List Preparation", "text": "If the word is not found in the seed list, the synonyms are determined using WordNet. Each synonym is matched with words in the seed list, if any synonym matches the words in the seed list, if any synonym matches the extracted word, then the extracted opinion word is stored with the same polarity in the seed list. If none of the synonyms matches, then the antagonym from WordNet is determined and the same process is repeated, if any antagonym matches, then the extracted opinion word is stored with the opposite polarity in the seed list. Thus, the seed list continues to grow. It grows every time the synonyms or antagonyms words are found in WordNet with the seed list."}, {"heading": "3.5 Polarity Detection & Classification", "text": "Using the seed list, the polarity of sentences is determined for each characteristic. Polarity is determined on the basis of the majority of opinions, if the number of positive words is higher, then the polarity of the sentence is positive, otherwise the polarity is negative, and if the number of positive and negative words is equal, then the sentence shows neutral polarity. Negation is also treated in the system, if the opinion word is preceded by the negative \"not,\" then the polarity of this sentence is reversed. For example, the sentence \"The touch screen of this mobile phone is not good\" shows the negative polarity, because the opinion word is preceded by \"good\" by \"not.\" At the end, a remarkable summary is created. Figure 2 shows how the remarkable summary of the sentence by the system.System does not deal with the repetition of the same information. For example, if the same review is repeated twice, the system classifies the rating twice as positive, negative or neutral."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "Customer reviews of mobile phones are used for experimental purposes and are collected by Amazon.com (www.amazon.in). The collected reviews of mobile phones are applied to the system, showing the orientation of each sentence, i.e. whether a sentence is positive, negative or neutral for each feature that contains reviews, the final results are presented in graphical charts, the results of the current system are compared with human decisions that help in the evaluation of the current system. All reviews are first read manually and their respective opinions are determined, the results are then compared with the results of the \"Aspect-based sensation orientation system\" in the phone domain. Three assessment measures are used to compare systems: - Precision Recall AccuracyBased on these rating measures, the results show that the \"Aspect-based sensation orientation system\" is well performed in the phone domain. The experiments were carried out using 50 sets of phone ratings. Figure 3 shows the system performance and the orientation system performance. \""}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The aim of this paper is to determine the polarity of mobile phone customer reviews at the aspect level. It performs aspect-based opinion mining based on the given ratings, and the functionality generated by the system will help the user make decisions. Experimental results indicate that the \"aspect-based sentiment orientation system\" works well and has reached the accuracy of 67%. Aspect-based opinion mining is necessary because nowadays everyone is busy and does not have time to read all the positive or negative reviews if someone wants to know anything about any feature of the product. aspect-based opinion mining has proven to be helpful in these situations compared to simple opinion-mining. In future work, efforts would be made to make some improvements to this technique so that they can identify the repeated reviews and classify those reviews only once."}], "references": [{"title": "Extracting product features and opinions from reviews,\" presented at the Proceedings of the conference on Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada", "author": ["O.A.-M.
