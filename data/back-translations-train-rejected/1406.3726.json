Weather consists of several attributes: temperature, cloud cover, wind speed / direction, which are discrete random variables. One of our goals is to predict the weather based on previous weather data. In addition, we are interested in finding correlations (dependencies to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset) between these variables, predicting missing data, predicting deviations in weather forecasts (for work scheduling within the Green Control Center), finding clusters within the data (which consist of closely related variables such as PCAs that can be used to remove redundant variables), classification, finding regression models (non-linear ones using SVMs), training artificial neural networks based on historical data so that they can be used for prediction in the future."}, {"heading": "2 Machine learning techniques", "text": "We analyze the following machine learning techniques: \u2022 Bayesian Inference \u2022 Neural Networks \u2022 Support of Vector Machines \u2022 Cluster Technology: PCA"}, {"heading": "2.1 Bayesian learning", "text": "Bayesian learning is based on using previous information to predict the future.

K-mean clustering is a commonly used example where data points must be grouped into K-clusters to minimize the mean distance between clusters. These techniques can be used to identify patterns in a weather chart, such as a temperature / cloud coverage chart, where a region with higher point density can be identified (which can be used to infer if the temperature has a certain value, then it is more likely that the cloud cover has a certain value). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is such a technique that is based on generating linear uncorrelated variables (main components) from a dataset of several correlated variables."}, {"heading": "2.3 Binary Decision Trees", "text": "This can be used to plan jobs based on the difference between predicted and actual weather conditions. You can calculate different schedules based on the different weather forecast / forecast and store them in a binary decision tree. Later, depending on the deviation from the actual weather data, you can use the rules stored in the nodes of the decision tree to select one of the schedules."}, {"heading": "2.4 Support Vector Machines", "text": "SVM is a supervised machine learning technique that is used for binary classification of input into different groups after training of the model with previous data. SVM works in several dimensions, which are represented by different variables. SVM works by building a model that is used for classification. It is based on a core method used for classification / regression, which reduces dimensionality or clustering. Furthermore, they can also be used for nonlinear regression and to avoid over- / underfitting. This is important because it is not possible to find a linear fit for many of the observed data in the real world. In simple linear regression techniques such as minimizing the smallest square error, the decision to select a regression function for the input data is based on the adjustment of a line that allows the total square error for the entire dataset to be minimized linear, but it is also easier to apply the SVM to a set of two objects, although the technique is very similar in terms."}, {"heading": "2.5 Artificial Neural Networks", "text": "This technique is based on the simulation of a biological neural network consisting of artificial neurons. By training the artificial neurons over a certain period of time (with historical data), one can predict future results. It is based on studying how the neurons connect (represented by connection weights) and pass information to each other for different inputs. Neurons collect the inputs of neighbouring neurons and decide on the extent of this input whether to shoot or not. There may be several layers in an ANN, e.g. input, hiding layer and output layer. Additionally, we suggest the following techniques: Gibbs sampling, Ridge regression, midrange value, RBF core."}, {"heading": "3 Conclusion", "text": "s conclusions can be used to predict the values of missing variables. Clustering techniques can be used to identify similarities between points in a data set and eliminate redundancies. Binary decision trees can be used for dynamic planning (based on rules stored on nodes) within the green control center. SVMs and ANNs need to be further analyzed if they can be useful for weather forecasting."}], "references": [{"title": "Guttirez, Bayesian networks for probabilistic weather prediction", "author": ["Antonio S.
