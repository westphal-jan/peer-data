INTRODUCTION:", "text": "Set theory as a branch of human endeavors was developed by the efforts of many mathematicians [Kam]. Such a theory found many applications in science, technology and other fields. In an effort to capture uncertainties in human thinking, Zadeh formulated and studied the theory of fuzzy sets. The theory of fuzzy sets found application in many areas of science and technology. Pawlak, a computer scientist, proposed and studied the concept of coarse set in an effort to capture other aspects of uncertainty that occur in applications such as database design. The theory of coarse sets supplemented the theory of fuzzy sets. In his research efforts related to the fusion problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), the author discovered the idea of \"graduated set\" (discussed in Section 2) as a generalization of the idea of coarse set. In understanding the details of coarse set theory, the idea of \"granular sets\" is observed as biological sets: in biological systems biomicroscopic parts are observed as closely as in systems microscopic resolution."}, {"heading": "2. Wireless Sensor Fusion: Theory of Graded Sets:", "text": "In the theory of coarse sets, a set A is approximated by a tuple of sets ([4]). Detailed theory of coarse sets has been developed and applied in various areas of human endeavour. The author conceived the following generalization of a coarse set, which is called a \"step set.\" Definition of a step set: A = (1, 2,...,) in which the sets meet the condition that it is a finite collection of nested sets, i.e. + 1 \u2212 1. Such a set potentially arises in many applications. One such application is the sensor fusion of interval value measurements. In particular, we consider the \"F\" fusion function proposed by Schmidt et.al."}, {"heading": "Wireless Sensor Fusion: Graded Set:", "text": "We will now explain the procedure for getting to the melted interval, which is based on an endless number of measurement intervals. Let 1, 1, 2, 2,.... [,] be the measurement intervals and let \"f\" be incorrect intervals (we do not know which are incorrect). The melted interval estimate is obtained in the following way [3]. c (i.e. the left end point of the melted estimate) is determined in the following way. Order the left endpoints, i.e. from the smallest to the largest value., consider the + 1 measurement as \"c d\" (i.e. the right end point of the melted estimate) is determined in the following way. Order down the right endpoints, i.e. from the smallest to the largest value. Enumerate from the smallest value, i.e. 1, consider the + 1 measurement."}, {"heading": "Consider it as \u201ed\u201f.", "text": "It is clear that the endpoints c, d depend on the number of erroneous intervals (on the sensors)."}, {"heading": "3. Granular Sets: Information System:", "text": "In this section we will present the concept of the \"granular set\" and discuss how such a set naturally arises from the extraction of information from an information system. Let's consider a finite set of objects / patterns, i.e. 1, 2,.... Let's also consider a collection of sets, i.e. C = [1, 2,..., each of which is a union of subsets of X (i.e. elements of 1 \u2264 are subsets of X). Let's call 1 the \"finest set\" and the \"coarsest set.\""}, {"heading": "Definition of a Granular Set :", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the case is an accident."}, {"heading": "4. Granular Sets : Applications:", "text": "As previously discussed, granular sets naturally arise in different hierarchical classification problems that occur in different applications. Specifically, we have recognized that granular sets arise in classification problems associated with an information system represented by an information table. In this case, the sets arise when the target set is the entirety of the objects / patterns in X and the collection of feature sets forms a tiered set. The granular set thus created (taking into account various possible feature sets that form a tiered set) provides a measure of the sensitivity of the classification of all objects / patterns in X, as the set of features is gradually increased. Since the target set can be a proper subset of X, the sensitivity of the classification of objects / patterns can also be achieved with a variation of feature sets. Some quantitative measures of sensitivity could be easily defined."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions:", "text": "Motivated by the practical problem of wireless sensor fusion, the author introduced the concept of \"graduated quantity.\" Graduated characteristics show that an interesting phrase called \"granular quantity\" arises naturally in classification problems associated with an information system. Graduated target sets argue that the lower and upper approximations (of the target set) constitute a graded set of coarse quantities. Applications of \"graduated\" and granular quantities are actively explored."}, {"heading": "References :", "text": "[1] E.
