The constraints are encoded in relationships, so that every homomorphism from A to B corresponds to a solution of CSP. For the rest of this paper, we mainly stick to this definition because it is more convenient for us. In fact, our main result benefits to a large extent from the fruitful connection between these two viewpoints. II In the introduction, we have presented k-consistency as a propagation process of constraint networks. In the following, we present the definition in relation to a formal system of inference (inspired by the system of proof in [1] and a generalization of [4]). This view allows us to see the structure of the existential course of this game, which we define as the main component of our process in which we formally provide the proof of consistency."}, {"heading": "2.1 CSP-refutations", "text": "The axioms are all partial mappings p: V (A) \u2192 V (B), which are not partial homomorphisms.

Consequently, each parallel propagation algorithm must perform at least consecutive steps. (n + d) O (k) processors (one for each instance of the inference rule) can be used to calculate the k consistency in O (nk \u2212 1dk \u2212 1) parallel time, which is optimal for propagation algorithms. Furthermore, the best sequential algorithm runs in O (nkdk). The overhead compared to the parallel approach is mainly caused by the time needed to search for the next inconsistent assignment that may be propagated - and this seems to be the only task that can be parallelized. Although we have demonstrated an optimal lower limit in the general setting, it might be interesting to know the depth of spread structures (if we have consistency)."}, {"heading": "A Appendix", "text": "& & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & # 10; & & # 10; & & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & # 10; & & # 10; & & & # 10; & & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; &"}], "references": [{"title": "Constraint propagation as a proof system", "author": ["A.
