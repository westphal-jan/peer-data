To summarize, despite our best efforts, we only know logarithmic factor approximation algorithms for Correlation Clustering; moreover, we cannot get a constant factor approximation for worst-case instances if the Unique Games Conjecture is true. However, our primary interest in solving Correlation Clustering comes from its numerous applications, and the instances that we encounter in these applications are not worst-case instances. This motivates the study of the average-case complexity of the problem and raises the following question: Can we design algorithms with better provable guarantees for realistic average-case models of Correlation Clustering? Several natural average-case models of Correlation Clustering have been studied previously. Ben-Dor et al.

Mathieu and Schudy consider a generalization of this model where there is an adversary: for each edge, we keep the initial label with probability (1 \u2212 \u03b5), and we let the adversary decide whether to flip the edge label or not with probability \u03b5. The major drawback of these models is that they only consider the case of complete graphs, i.e. they require that the Correlation Clustering instance contains similarity information for every pair of nodes. Chen et al. extended the model of [Ben-Dor et al., 1999] from complete graphs to sparser Erdos\u2013Renyi random graphs. In their model, the underlying unlabeled graph G(V,E) comes from an Erd\u00f6s\u2013Renyi random graph (of edge probability p), and as in [Ben-Dor et al., 1999], the label of each edge is set (independently) to be consistent with the ground truth clustering with probability 1\u2212 \u03b5 and inconsistent with probability \u03b5. While these average-case models are natural, they are unrealistic in practice since most real-world graphs are neither dense nor captured by Erd\u00f6s\u2013Renyi distributions. For instance, real-world graphs in community detection have many structural properties (presence of large cliques, large clustering coefficients, heavy-tailed degree distribution) that are not exhibited by graphs that are generated by Erd\u00f6s\u2013Renyi models [Newman et al., 2006, Kumar et al., 1999]. Graphs that come up in computer vision applications are sparse with grid-like structure [Yarkony et al., 2012]. Further, these models assume that every pair of vertices have the same amount of similarity or dissimilarity (all costs are unit). Our semi-random model tries to address these issues by assuming very little about the observations \u2013 the underlying unlabeled graph G(V,E) \u2013 and allowing non-uniform costs. 1.1 Our Semi-random Model In this paper, we propose and study a new semi-random model for generating general instances of Correlation Clustering, which we believe captures many properties of real world instances.
