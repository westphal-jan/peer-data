For the average number of response sets, our experimental results closely match the theoretical results given in Section 3. To perform the experiments, we have developed a software tool to generate random logical programs based on the user input parameters, such as the type of programs, the number of atoms, the number of letters in a rule, the number of rules in a program and the number of programs in a test set, etc. After generating a series of random programs, the tool calls an ASP solver to calculate the responses of the random programs, records the test results in a file and analyzes them. The experimental results in this section are based on the ASP solution bracket (we have obtained test cases that are similar to 2009, but with different patterns)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Experiment 1: Random Programs without contradiction rules", "text": "In this experiment, c1 = 5, c2 = 0, and n varies with values 50,100,150,..., 500 each. For each of these values of n, 5,000 logic programs were generated randomly and independently within the framework of the linear model.Given the fact that c1 = 5 and \u03b1 > 1 are uniquely determined by \u03b1\u03b1 = ec1, we have this alpha = 3.7687. Thus, the (experimental) values for NAvg and their corresponding theoretical values (i.e., the expected number E [Nk] of the response sets for random programs determined by equation. (The (experimental) values for NAvg and their corresponding theoretical values (i.e., the expected number E [Nk] of the response sets for random programs determined by equation. (4)) will be shown in Table 1. The experimental and theoretical results will be shown in Figure 1. We can see that these two values are very close to each other, even if n is relatively small."}, {"heading": "4.2 Experiment 2: Random Programs with contradiction rules", "text": "In this experiment, we tested random programs that may contain rules of contradiction and obtained similar experimental results as in the first experiment. We set c1 = 10, n = 200 and c2 = 0,1,2,..., 20. For each value of c2, 5,000 programs were generated independently in the linear model. At c1 = 10, equality (12) and equality (13) result in \u03b1 \u2248 5.7289, x0 \u2248 165.0894 and \u03c3 \u2248 1.9552. The value \u03c6 (x0), which depends on c2, decreases roughly from 0.4257 (if c2 = 0) to 0.01297 (if c2 = 20). On the other hand, we can calculate the expected number of response sets for each c2 on the basis of Equation (4). These two types of values are visualized as two curves in Figure 5. It shows that these two curves are very close to each other, which means that our theoretical result on the size distribution of these first responses is smaller than those in the norms."}, {"heading": "4.3 Experiment 3: Approximating the probability for consistency of random programs", "text": "In this subsection, we present our experimental results for verifying the formula for predicting the consistency of random programs (discussed in Section 3): Pr (E (| AS (P) | > 0)) \u2248 1 \u2212 e \u2212 \u03b3 \u00b7 E (| AS (P) |). (20) Here is \u03b3 a constant of about 0.5 (i.e. independent of n). We tested different pairs of c1 and c2. For each such pair, we took n = 100,150,200,..., 1000. Subsequently, for each value of n, we calculated the value determined by Equation (20). For each value of n, we generated 5,000 programs randomly and calculated the ratio of consistent programs to all 5,000 programs. Our experimental results confirm the estimate in Equation (20). Thus, this formula can be used to predict the consistency of random programs generated under the linear model. The corresponding values for two tested cases are determined in Figures 7 and 8 for each of the curves."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "The average size of a random program created in this way is linear to the total number of atoms. We have demonstrated some mathematical results, and the main result shows that the expected number of random program responses converges in the linear model to a constant determined by the probabilities of both pure rules and constraints; the formal proof of this result, as we have seen, is mathematically informative; the main result is further confirmed by our experiments; another important experimental result shows that the (size) distribution of random program responses generated according to the linear model obeys a normal distribution; in this case, there are several problems for future work. Firstly, it would be interesting to prove mathematically some of the results presented in section 4. Secondly, it would be both interesting and useful to investigate phase transition phenomena for hardness phenomena."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The authors would like to thank the editor Michael Gelfond and three anonymous speakers for their constructive comments, which have helped to significantly improve the quality of the work.

Proposition 1: Every normal logic program P is equivalent to a negative bilingual program (Brass and Dix 1999; Wang and Zhou 2005). Thus, we can assume without loss of generality that P is a negative normal program.

Several experimental results are also reported, which justify the suitability of the linear model. It is also experimentally shown that, under this model, the size distribution of answer sets for random programs tends to a normal distribution when the number of atoms is sufficiently large.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
