We have proven that this logic can be decided by translation into SROIQ. The same method can probably be used for several other DLs. For example, SHOIQ [3] is a limitation of SROIQ without role assertions and without R.Self. Since none of the translation rules outside of these constructs uses these constructs, they can be removed and SHOIQ can be defined in the same way as SROIQ. On the other hand, description logic such as ALC [4], which is limited to concepts without counting quantifiers, is not suitable for such a translation. Existential and universal quantification would generate quantifiers during translation that are outside the bounds of logic."}, {"heading": "3. Ian Horrocks and Ulrike Sattler.

There is an impressive variety of Description Logics with diverse expressiveness and complexity, or even with or without decidability. Yet, all are tailored to describe an established and fixed ontology and reason about its properties. Our goal here is to consider properties over dynamic ontologies. We introduce the notion of substitutions to express changes of ontologies (e.g. addition or deletion of an element, respectively a pair of elements, of a concept, respectively of a role). We investigate the addition of such substitutions in the particular case of the logic SROIQ, an extension of the logic SROIQ [2]. We mainly show that the problem of satisfiability in SROIQ is still decidable. Sect. 2 introduces SROIQ, our version of SROIQ with substitutions. Sect. 3 defines the interpretations for that logic. Sect. 4 proves that SROIQ is decidable by transforming formulae in SROIQ to formulae in SROIQ. Sect. 5 illustrates such transformations.
