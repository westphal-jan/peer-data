An important component of GF is its Resource Grammar Library (RGL) that encapsulates the low-level linguistic knowledge about morphology and syntax of currently more than 20 languages facilitating rapid development of multilingual applications. In the ideal case, porting a GF application grammar to a new language would only require introducing the domain lexicon - translation equivalents that are interlinked via common abstract terms. While it is possible for a highly restricted CNL, developing and porting a less restricted CNL requires above average linguistic knowledge about the particular language, and above average GF experience. Specifying a lexicon is mostly straightforward in the case of nouns (incl. multi-word units), however, verbs are the most complex category (in terms of both inflectional paradigms and argument structure), and adding them to a GF application grammar is not a straightforward task. In this paper we are focusing on verbs, investigating the possibility of creating a multilingual FrameNet-based GF library. We propose an extension to the current RGL, allowing GF application developers to define clauses on the semantic level, thus leaving the language-specific syntactic mapping to this extension. We demonstrate our approach by reengineering the MOLTO Phrasebook application grammar.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Jun 2014 11:14:44 GMT  (295kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6844v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["normunds gruzitis", "peteris paikens", "guntis barzdins"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.6844"}, "pdf": {"name": "1406.6844.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "FrameNet Resource Grammar Library for GF", "authors": ["Normunds Gruzitis", "Peteris Paikens", "Guntis Barzdins"], "emails": ["guntis.barzdins}@lumii.lv"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: controlled natural language, frame semantics, FrameNet, multilingualism, gramatical framework"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it will be ready to leave the country in order to enter the EU."}, {"heading": "2 FrameNet", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to put themselves in a situation where they are able to put themselves in a situation where they are able, in a situation in which they are able, in a situation in which they are able, in a situation in which they are able to develop."}, {"heading": "3 GF Application Grammar Development: the Current Approach", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "4 Our FrameNet-Based Approach", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have set themselves in order to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion and Future Work", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund within the framework of Project No. 2011 / 0009 / 2DP / 2.1.1.1.0 / 10 / APIA / VIAA / 112.
