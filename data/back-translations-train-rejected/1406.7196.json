Our technique is simpler, more declarative, and less error-prone than direct and improved hand modeling. The SAT instances that we automatically generate contain less clauses than improved hand-written instances such as in [20], and with unit propagation they also contain less variables.

This technique has been successfully applied to encode the social golfer problem and examine some symmetries that point to this problem. The advantages of our technique are the following: - the modeling process is simple, declarative and readable; furthermore, it is independent and independent of CSP or SAT; - the technique is less error-prone than the handwritten SAT encodings; - the breaking of symmetries can be achieved simply by adding new constraints or refining the model (this cannot be done with direct encodings such as DE or TME); - the SAT instances that are automatically generated are smaller than those of the [20] that are written and improved."}], "references": [{"title": "An attempt to dynamically break symmetries in the social golfers problem", "author": ["F.

We apply our technique to the Social Golfer Problem and we also use it to break symmetries of the problem. Our technique is simpler, more declarative, and less error-prone than direct and improved hand modeling. The SAT instances that we automatically generate contain less clauses than improved hand-written instances such as in [20], and with unit propagation they also contain less variables. Moreover, they are well-suited for SAT solvers and they are solved faster as shown when solving difficult instances of the Social Golfer Problem.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
