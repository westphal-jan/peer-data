The authentication process depends on two key steps: feature extraction and outlier detection. In this paper, a geometric tight frame and some low order moment statistics of the tight frame coefficients are used to extract features from the paintings. Then a forward stage-wise rank boosting is used to select a small set of features for more accurate classification so that van Gogh paintings are highly concentrated towards some center point while forgeries are spread out as outliers. Numerical results on leave-one-out cross-validation show that our proposed method can achieve a 87% classification accuracy which is better than any reported in literature so far. Even with only 4 features, our method can give a 84% classification accuracy, indicating a highly consistent style in van Gogh's brushstroke movements.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Jul 2014 01:55:37 GMT  (209kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0439v1", "14 pages, 10 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 13 Sep 2014 00:53:16 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0439v2", "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a critical error in numerical result"], ["v3", "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 07:20:12 GMT  (778kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0439v3", "14 pages, 13 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["haixia liu", "raymond h chan", "yuan yao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1407.0439"}, "pdf": {"name": "1407.0439.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "GEOMETRIC TIGHT FRAME BASED STYLOMETRY FOR ART AUTHENTICATION OF VAN GOGH PAINTINGS", "authors": ["HAIXIA LIU", "RAYMOND H.

The authentication process depends on two key steps: feature extraction and outlier detection. In this paper, a geometric tight frame and some simple statistics of the tight frame coefficients are used to extract features from the paintings. Then a forward stage-wise rank boosting is used to select a small set of features for more accurate classification so that van Gogh paintings are highly concentrated towards some center point while forgeries are spread out as outliers. Numerical results show that our method can achieve 86.08% classification accuracy under the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. Our method also identifies five features that are much more predominant than other features. Using just these five features for classification, our method can give 88.61% classification accuracy which is the highest so far reported in literature. Evaluation of the five features is also performed on two hundred datasets generated by bootstrap sampling with replacement. The median and the mean are 88.61% and 87.77% respectively. Our results show that a small set of statistics of the tight frame coefficients along certain orientations can serve as discriminative features for van Gogh paintings. It is more important to look at the tail distributions of such directional coefficients than mean values and standard deviations. It reflects a highly consistent style in van Gogh\u2019s brushstroke movements, where many forgeries demonstrate a more diverse spread in these features.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
