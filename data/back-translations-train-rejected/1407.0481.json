It provides RDF-based access to the contents of a relational database without having to replicate it into an RDF memory, thereby avoiding additional implementation and maintenance efforts. Among other things, it is possible to remotely access RDF descriptions of individual entities in the database via the SPARQL protocol (SPARQL endpoint) by dereferencing their URIs (Linked Data provides RDF shortcuts as an alternative to registered discovery mechanisms for the Semantic Web), and c) display contents in HTML (for support for writing and debugging mappings)."}, {"heading": "4.2 The eGov IT Helpdesk support system", "text": "This year it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "4.3 Semantic Annotation of Data", "text": "The idea is that it's about a way in which it's about a way in which people have to focus on themselves and themselves. \"It's about changing the world,\" he says. \"It's about changing the world,\" he says. \"It's about changing the world,\" he says. \"It's about changing the world.\" \"It's about changing the world,\" he says. \"It's about changing the world.\" \"It's about changing the world.\" \"It's about changing the world.\" It's about changing the world, \"he says.\" It's about changing the world. \"\" It's about changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing, changing. \""}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation of the S3-AI for eGov IT helpdesk support", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take one year to move on to the next round."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "This year, it has come to be a place where it comes at a time when people are able to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion", "text": "The S3-AI approach is not limited to the number of applications / data sources that need to be integrated, depending on the scalability of the semantic web technologies used for a particular application. It is possible to adapt the S3-AI approach simply by replacing each technological component with a more scalable one, as the new technology provides at least the functionality shown in the S3-AI implementation, and the recommendation is to use the technologies used in this case (mainly due to their simplicity, open source nature and adaptability)."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "The proposed approach was implemented using the free open source software D2RQ and Fuseki and used in the e-government area within the \"eGov IT Helpdesk Support\" case. Furthermore, the benefits of the approach and the lessons learned from its initial deployment can be discussed. We firmly believe that the approach is noticeable for its simplicity, low cost, low maintenance and highly adaptable architecture. In addition, it can be used to integrate \"living\" and evolving data from multiple sources without the need to forgo original applications and data storage if certain guidelines and recommendations discussed in the paper are followed. Future plans concern the use of S3-AI in other areas where evolving data from different economical applications must be integrated, resulting in further refinements of the approach and further recommendations for its use in different contexts that are open to multiple data sources beyond different government requirements."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors acknowledge the contributions of researchers from the International Hellenic University (IHU), the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), LOV (http: / / lov.okfn.org), PwC and the University of Southampton.
