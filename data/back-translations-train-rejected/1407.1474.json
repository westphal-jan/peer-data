This model can also be used to detect the other possible emotions at the time of recognition. Accuracy measurements of human emotions by the fuzzy model are discussed through two methods; the first is accuracy analysis and the second is false positive rate analysis. This fuzzy model detects more emotions, but on the other hand, for some of emotions, a lower accuracy was obtained with the comparison with the non-fuzzy human emotions detection methods. This system was trained and tested by Support Vector Machine (SVM) to recognize the users' emotions. Overall, this model represents a closer similarity between human brain detection of emotions and computer systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Jul 2014 09:38:21 GMT  (337kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1474v1", "12th WSEAS International Conference on Applications of Computer Engineering (ACE '13), Cambridge, MA, USA, 30 Jan. - 1 Feb. 2013 ISBN: 978-1-61804-156-2, Pages 77-82"]], "COMMENTS": "12th WSEAS International Conference on Applications of Computer Engineering (ACE '13), Cambridge, MA, USA, 30 Jan. - 1 Feb. 2013 ISBN: 978-1-61804-156-2, Pages 77-82", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["kaveh bakhtiyari", "hafizah husain"], "accepted": false, "id": "1407.1474"}, "pdf": {"name": "1407.1474.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Fuzzy Model on Human Emotions Recognition", "authors": ["KAVEH BAKHTIYARI"], "emails": ["hafizah.ukm@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The importance of the topic is reflected in its broad areas of application: computer games (entertainment), computer tutors (e-learning), machine and system control (industrial area), crime (computers) and security (social media)."}, {"heading": "2 Methodology", "text": "Emotions's fuzzy model divides emotions into 5 different levels from 0 to 4. Zero (0) shows 0% of the emotion or the other hand, it does not exist, and 4 shows the highest level of that appropriate emotion. Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) has been used to collect the raw data for modeling classification. PANAS is a standard to find negative or positive emotion of the people [12]. PANAS uses 20 emotions and the seven missed basic emotions were added to this list in our research; and this standard was used to evaluate our system. The list of these 27 emotions is as follows: Joy Surprise Excited Enthusias Inspired Active Anticipatio FearUpset Proud Nervous Afraid Acceptanc Strong IrritableDetermine Disgust Guilty Alert Attentive Sadness DistresseHostile Ashamed Jittery."}, {"heading": "2.1 Analysis of Emotions", "text": "Here, only eight basic emotions were discussed, which are joy, anticipation, anger, disgust, sadness, surprise, fear and acceptance. However, some similar change patterns were found among some emotions. Basically, both negative and positive emotions have similar change patterns, but between these basic emotions, some of ISBN: 978-1-61804-156-2 78they are very close to each other. For example, disgust and anger have a similar change pattern with each other, and sadness is closer to them compared to the other emotions. On the other hand, acceptance and anticipation have very similar change patterns with each other. As can be seen, these emotions are in the same group in terms of positive and negative emotions. Table 1 shows a similar change pattern when the level of joy rises from 0 to 4. Figure 1 also presents the graphic data of Table 1.Fig.1. Emotions change patterns through the term \"joy\" vice versa."}, {"heading": "2.2 Fuzzy Human Emotions Recognition", "text": "In order to detect the emotions, the system was trained and tested by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect the emotions of the users. The above results are now used in the evaluation for multi-stage emotion recognition from 0 to 4, and it is also attempted to detect multiple emotions at each stage of the detection process. Table 7 shows the end result of the detection after applying the blurred logic concept to detect every emotion by SVM in a range from 0 to 4. The following table shows a lower accuracy in detecting some multi-level emotions compared to the other non-blurred methods, as the number of available states has been increased to detect the emotion, but the accuracy in the emotion of Nervous has been increased. Applying the blurred model to human emotion detection systems represents a more natural report on human emotions, which includes all possible emotions and their levels and strengths. This report may not be as accurate as the detection we had for classical emotions, but it is more reliable for the detection of individual emotions."}, {"heading": "2.3 Fuzzy Model on Human Emotions Recognition: Discussion", "text": "The above data and classification were used as a blurred model in our human emotion recognition system. Accuracy of emotion recognition was assessed on the basis of two different aspects: the first aspect assessed whether the name of the emotion or emotion detected was correct or not, and the second aspect assessed the system on the percentage of emotion detected [14, 15]. For example, consider a user with two emotions of joy - 50% and fear - 20%. In the first aspect of the evaluation, if the system was able to detect joy and fear, the evaluation was carried out successfully; in the second aspect, however, not only joy and fear should be correctly detected, but also the detected level of other emotions would be taken into account in the accuracy of the system [16]. This model was tested on a human emotion detection system that operated on the basis of positive keystroke dynamics, mouse movements and touch screen interactions."}, {"heading": "3 Conclusion", "text": "This research proposed a new, blurred model, presenting a new solution based on statistics and probabilities for the recognition of human emotions in order to overcome some of the problems in this field of research. This model recognized the other possible emotions at the same time and worked more naturally by recognizing emotions in terms of level and not by a discrete name of emotion. The human emotion recognition system on which this model was implemented was able to achieve up to 5% higher accuracy in the recognition method, and a maximum 16.7% false positive rate for the recognition of the level of emotions. This model can be extended, improved and even integrated into different systems. Future research will deal with the recognition of human emotions by extracted models for each region of the world and then compare the accuracy and false positive rates of these different regions."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "s thesis in The National University of Malaysia.
