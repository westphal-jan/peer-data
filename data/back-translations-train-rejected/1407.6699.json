CONSERVATION VOLTAGE REDUCTION", "text": "There are papers that assess how much load reduction is achieved through voltage reduction since 1977. Many loads can be operated more efficiently at lower voltage. With voltage optimization, we optimize residential voltages at loads so that they are operated as efficiently as possible with minimum interruptions. It is expected that intelligent measurements will be available and provide feedback at each switching point. This closed loop allows the adjustment of the voltage to feeders in order to reduce the level of consumer terminals to the lowest values. Meanwhile, the integrated VVC, which is an important feature of the future grid, is the application of CVR.Spanish regulation allowing the range of end user terminals to the lowest values values values values values values values to the lowest values values values."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "A fuzzy inference system was designed as an online tool to give the proper distribution strategy for capacitor circuits and tap movements to control reactive power / voltage in a distribution station. It has passed all safety issues around power systems and has been tested in a real case under real conditions. It has managed operation in the control center for an entire day for a distribution station in the Canary Islands. Within the limits of the control capabilities of the system, the fuzzy controller has successfully maintained an acceptable and flat voltage profile, whereby the mean deviation was related to the objective value."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to Endesa Distribuci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica, S.L. and its staff at the Shipping Control Centre in the Canary Islands for providing the valuable system data and shipping experience."}], "references": [{"title": "Review on Implementation and Assessment of Conservation Voltage Reduction,", "author": ["Z.
