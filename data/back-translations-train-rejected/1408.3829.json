Web is used in all areas. Most people use Web for a common purpose such as online shopping, chatting, etc. During online shopping, many reviews / opinions are given by users that reflect whether the product is good or bad. These reviews must be researched, analyzed, and organized to allow better decision making. Opinion Mining is a natural language processing task that involves finding the orientation of opinion in a text section related to a topic. In this paper, a document-based opinion mining system is proposed that classifies the documents as positive, negative, and neutral. Negation is also treated in the proposed system. Experimental results based on reviews of films show the effectiveness of the system.KEYWORDS Opinion Mining, Sentiment Analysis, Reviews, Document, WordNet."}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "A large number of reviews or suggestions about everything that is available on the web today; reviews can include reviews of products, users or critics of films, etc., which helps other users make decisions. Ratings grow faster by the day because each person likes to express their opinion on the Web. A large number of reviews are available for a single product, which makes it difficult for a customer to read all the reviews and make a decision. In this way, this data is evaluated, users \"opinions are identified and classified as an important task. Opinion Mining is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Extraction (IE) task, which aims to obtain the writer's feelings in positive or negative comments by analyzing a large number of documents. It combines the techniques of computer linguistics and information processing (IR). The main task of sentiment analysis is to classify the documents and determine their polarity. Polarity is expressed as neutral, negative or negative."}, {"heading": "2. EXISTING RESEARCH WORK", "text": "The most prominent work was done by Turney. [12] He uses \"bad\" and \"excellent\" seed words to calculate the semantic orientation, using the mutual information method to calculate the semantic orientation of a document. Sentiment orientation of a document was calculated as the average semantic orientation of all such sentences. Overall, the number of positive and negative adjectives is counted in a document to classify the documents. Harb et al. [1] used two sets of seed words with positive and negative semantic orientation to perform a blog classification."}, {"heading": "3.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "All the assessments collected were applied to the proposed system, which classifies the assessments as positive, negative and neutral, and the final results are presented in graphical charts. In order to calculate how well the system classifies each document compared to human decision, all documents were manually classified and the corresponding opinion determined. The results are the results of the system. The same assessments are available online in the Sentiment Analyzer. Finally, the results of the two systems showed that the results of the \"Document Based Sentiment Analyzer\" in graphical form are then applied to the other system, which is called \"the two systems were compared and retrieved in graphical form.\" Figure 6 shows the comparison of the results of the two systems, showing that the performance of the \"Document Based Sentiment Analyzer\" in graphical form is then also applied to the other system, which is called \"the two systems were compared and the Document Based Sentiment Analysis SThree Evaluation Measurement Measurements based on the accuracy of the current results of the AIC system.\""}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The results of the system are summarized and helpful Experimental results indicate that the Document Based Sentiment Orientation System performs well in this area. Opinion Mining is very important nowadays, from the ordinary citizen to the businessman, everyone depends on the Internet. Users can determine which product or movie is good for them, and it helps the Bu determine what customers think about their products and classify them, so that it is helpful for them to read them and make decisions. In future work, efforts would be made to improve this t-document, including relative clauses such as:"}], "references": [{"title": "Web opinion mining: how to extract opinions from blogs", "author": ["A.
