APPROACH", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Game Description", "text": "The problem of interest is to plan a path for a convoy that leads from Origin A to Destination B, where enemy forces might try to ambush him. It is modeled as two players pursuing a non-cooperative zero-sum game, meaning that a player's only goal is to optimize his personal gain (not cooperatively) and the sum of the score across all players is zero. Player 1, BLUE, chooses a path from Origin to Destination. Player 2, RED, chooses a number of locations where he wants to ambush, while the number of ambushes depends on BLUE's resources. In the rest of this paper, RED has only one resource, i.e. it can only ambush because we are interested in mixed strategies. It makes the sum of probabilities over all possible states equal to a higher integer for RED. If BLUE's path leads through an ambush, then RED wins."}, {"heading": "B. Mathematical Formulation", "text": "Let (N, E) be a network; the simplest example of a problem occurring on a node is first of all the problem BLUE (or RED's). Let's assume that the strategies of the two actors are independent of each other. On each node nj, the probability that BLUE will be ambushed is equal to the probability that BLUE's path will be ambushed by nj times the probability that RED will be ambushed on that node. The gain for RED on that node is the expected result of the game relative to that node: 0. (i, j) This problem Epijqjj is a problem that BLUE's path is ambushed by nj times the probability that RED will be ambushed on that node. The gain for RED on that node is the expected result of the game relative to that node."}, {"heading": "III. FRAMEWORK FOR UNSTRUCTURED ENVIRONMENTS", "text": "Although the approach described in Section II was partially addressed in [8, 2], previous studies assumed the existence of a network to optimize routing-on. In order to apply such a model in different environments, it is necessary to investigate what is a good representation of the environment. In this section, three methods for building the network that supports optimization are presented, the result of strategic optimization is compared for different representations of the environment and some key characteristics are identified."}, {"heading": "A. Network Construction", "text": "Assuming that a network limits the number of possible routes for the vehicle, this reduces the advantage of this approach, which aims to increase the variability of the trajectory of the convoy, especially for vehicles with off-road capabilities.Therefore, extending the structured network with a graphical representation of the unstructured environment is expected to improve the efficiency of the approach, which needs to be adapted to the physical model of the vehicle and the characteristics of the environment.Several methods are being tested to create a high-precision directed network in relation to the surroundings while allowing a relatively short computing time.Differences have been made in the scanning method and in the connectivity between the nodes, as shown in Table I. While randomly tested nodes connected by a Delaunay triangulation lead to a relatively small and computer-efficient representation of the surroundings, rdm may not be representative enough for the details of the surroundings.The most complete representation of the environment is achieved by uni8, but it requires 16 points per directed node (rather than two)."}, {"heading": "B. Ambush types", "text": "This model is more realistic in the sense that it relays the idea of maximum reach for RED, which defines the size of the ambushes. Another important reason for an ambush by area is that it can decouple the spatial dependence of the BLUE strategy from the strategy of RED in order to examine the convergence of BLUE's strategy in terms of the precision of the environmental model defining the size of the ambushes for RED. Another important reason for an ambush by area is that it decouples the spatial dependence of the BLUE strategy from the strategy of RED in order to examine the convergence of BLUE's strategy in terms of the precision of the environmental model when setting the amount of ambushes for RED. This is a very interesting feature when using the BLUE routing strategies as an approximation of a continuous strategy. The results will give us insights into the possibility of constructing such an ongoing problem."}, {"heading": "C. Energy Optimization", "text": "One consequence of taking into account the range of RED is the creation of cycles in each ambush area. This means that probabilistic routing could lead to a path in which the vehicle remains within a closed subspace for a very long time \u2212 \u2212 This situation is more likely in ambush areas where the local result is close to zero. This illustrates one of the problems with this routing method, which is the absence of any kind of energy optimisation. \u2212 To avoid cycles, an energy optimisation factor is introduced which makes it possible to optimise the result of the optimisation. Large values of \u03bb lead to a few other paths close to the shortest path and increase the overall risk to the system. Low values of \u03bb will return to routing strategies close to the safest."}, {"heading": "IV. PERFORMANCE", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Metrics description", "text": "In his study of the one-dimensional problem, Ruckle identified the uniform distribution of paths along a line as the optimal strategy. This strategy corresponds to maximizing entropy of the probability distribution. On the basis of this idea, the probability of crossing along the median between departure and arrival is calculated. Entropy is used as the first measurement, it is high for deceptive routes and near zero for non-deceptive ones. The idea that the optimal strategy is evenly distributed over the environment led to the creation of another measurement, the scattering of the route, which measures the proportion of the area covered by the route as a fraction of the total surface of the environment. For each ambush area, the probability of entering this area can be calculated as the sum of the inflowing currents. If the area is reached with the probability p > pmin, the losses of this area in the scattering are calculated."}, {"heading": "B. Results", "text": "Figure 3 illustrates one of the main results of this work. For each method, BLUE's strategy is the approximation of a distribution that depends exclusively on RED's range and local result. RED's range in the following environment is such that the mean between departure and arrival points is divided into seven sections, resulting in an optimal theoretical result of 17 0.1456 and thus a theoretical optimal entropy of 7 x 7 - 17 log (1 7) = protocol (7) 1.94. The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Figure 4. The metrics defined above are calculated for each network construction method, using the simplex or inner point optimization algorithms with or without energy optimization, and energy optimization has been introduced to avoid the presence of cycles in the solutions. However, the parameters must remain small compared to 1, otherwise it would be compared to the strategic optimization function of the network interval representation points as the representation point of the strategy."}, {"heading": "V. APPLICATIONS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. General framework description", "text": "The environment is analysed for three different purposes: the first is to complete the existing road network with an off-road network to cover both structured and unstructured parts of the environment; the second is to identify relevant geographical areas for ambushes; the third is to calculate the local map of results; at each location, a correlation is established between the possible outcome of an ambush and the strategic characteristics of the local environment around that ambush. To achieve these objectives, data of various nature are used; altitude data on the environment is collected through data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, which is publicly available [1]; and SRTM data is divided into two precision levels: SRTM1 (for the US and its territories and possessions) with data collected in an arc-second interval at latitude and longitude; and SRTM3 (for the entire world)."}, {"heading": "B. Risk factors", "text": "In order to broaden the purely theoretical game theory problem and make it more realistic, interviews with former Army personnel were conducted, focusing on the identification of the factors with the greatest impact on the local outcome that could be included in the formulation of the optimization problem. Significant attention was therefore paid to identifying the various factors that affect the local outcomes. The relevant information can be divided into three different areas, which are presented in Figure 6. Firstly, the information related to the environment, whether described by topological or geological data, is crucial. This type of information includes data on altitudes, roads, waterways, as well as vegetation and terrain type and quality. Secondly, the strategic information, such as the resources of RED and BLUE (position, quantity, type) and previous encroachments, must be taken into account. Thirdly, the human factors correspond to other intelligent agents in the geographical region of interest that do not participate in the game."}, {"heading": "C. Examples", "text": "The local result \u03b1 is now defined as a parameter that only depends on the maximum speed, and vice versa. A slower speed implies a higher local result and reciprocal. Environmental data is used to find the maximum permitted speed in a given location. A local result at a given node is proportional to the average time spent at that node. Monaco's speed profile is used in the form of road networks to achieve the maximum permitted speed or the maximum safe driving speed. The local result at a given node is proportional to the average time spent at that node. Monaco's speed profile is presented in the form of 7 (a). The corresponding optimal solution is presented in the form of Figure 7 (b)."}, {"heading": "VI. FUTURE WORK", "text": "From a theoretical point of view, several aspects could be explored further: the convergence observed for the routes of all methods indicates the existence of a boundary distribution.Instead of the dense discretization developed in this essay, the authors would like to propose a continuous model of the present game, which would make it possible to identify the boundary distribution at once and possibly draw a parallel between the different paths between routes and homotopy classes.A number of applications have been envisaged. Currently, the only factor influencing the local outcome is the maximum speed at a particular location.The accuracy of the model could be improved by taking more risk factors into detail.The purpose of this framework is to provide a practical tool for route forecasting. However, the merging of structured and unstructured environments still requires manual coordination. This merging process will be automated more thoroughly in the forthcoming work. Finally, it may be interesting to increase the accuracy of environmental descriptions by one or two orders of magnitude."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "This research defines the reach of the enemy as an important parameter of environmental representation, and the local result becomes more important because of its geographical importance; the possible losses to the system in a particular area in the event of an ambush are calculated by identifying the various factors influencing this result, which are related to the environment and the resources of the agents; by comparing different methods of network construction and different linear optimization algorithms, efficient techniques have been identified to develop strategies for avoiding ambush in unstructured environments; the results highlight the presence of sufficient network density to represent these environments; the correlation between the reach of the ambush and the optimal outcome of the game is illustrated; and a \"representative distribution\" is produced; and a comprehensive framework is elaborated."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "This work was reviewed by the Army Research Office under MURI Award W911NF-11-1-0046.REFERENCES [1] URL dds.cr.usgs.gov.
