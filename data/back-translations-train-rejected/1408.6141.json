We used the DCD algorithm to solve two systems of linear equations associated with the calculation of two auxiliary vector variables. Simulation results confirmed that the proposed DCD-RTLS algorithm exceeds the other existing RTLS algorithms and is at the same time more computationally efficient. We investigated the performance of the DCD-RTLS algorithm and determined its convergence and stability in both the mean and the mean square. We also calculated the theoretical standard mean square deviation (MSD) of the DCD-RTLS algorithm and verified through simulations that the theoretical predicted values of the stationary SD match the good MSD results."}], "references": [{"title": "Linear dynamic errors-in-variables models", "author": ["M.
