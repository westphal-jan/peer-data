INTRODUCTIONConsistency level with consensus degree have a vital role in the decision making process. Optimization technique deals with selecting the best possible alternatives from a set of viable alternatives. Optimization of the CCL level is mandatory to achieve a quality decision. GDM process consists of a team of decision makers who provide their preferences through a number of alternatives. Multiplicative preference relationship and fuzzy preference relationship are two main types of preferences relations. Saaty [1] in 1980 and Wang and Xu [2] in 1990 introduced multiplicative preference relationship which was defined as a reciprocal matrix. In 1978, Orlovsky [3] proposed FPR using complementary matrix to show an expert's opinion in decision making process."}, {"heading": "A.

CONCLUSION", "text": "This article has presented an optimization approach to GDM problems with incomplete FPRs, guided by the additive consistency property. It has used SA to optimize a series of FPRs provided by a group of experts. This method runs automatically without the involvement of a human operator and suggests the group of experts to make necessary changes to their prescribed preference relationships. This article is mainly divided into two phases: estimation of missing preference values and optimization of the CCL level. This method estimates the missing information in an expert's incomplete FPR only using the preference values provided by that particular expert. Future scope of this research would be to increase the CCL level without decreasing the consistency level."}], "references": [{"title": "The analytic hierarchy process", "author": ["T.L.
