We will describe and critically assess the different ways AI systems are evaluated. We first focus on the traditional task-oriented evaluation approach. We see that black-box (behavioural evaluation) is becoming more and more common, as AI systems are becoming more complex and unpredictable. We identify three kinds of evaluation: Human discrimination, problem benchmarks and peer confrontation. We describe the limitations of the many evaluation settings and competitions in these three categories and propose several ideas for a more systematic and robust evaluation. We then focus on a less customary (and challenging) ability-oriented evaluation approach, where a system is characterised by its (cognitive) abilities, rather than by the tasks it is designed to solve. We discuss several possibilities: the adaptation of cognitive tests used for humans and animals, the development of tests derived from algorithmic information theory or more general approaches under the perspective of universal psychometrics.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 02:44:28 GMT  (560kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6908v1", "29 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 10 Oct 2014 02:16:32 GMT  (568kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6908v2", "34 pages"], ["v3", "Sun, 21 Aug 2016 22:44:31 GMT  (572kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6908v3", "34 pages.

This does not mean that we cannot apply more general principles and techniques to solve many of these problems, but that the task is sufficiently specific that the systems are specialized in these systems. For example, the robot navigation of a Mars robot can share some of the techniques with a driverless car on Earth, but the final application is extremely specialized in both cases. This specialization leads to an application-specific (task-oriented) assessment."}, {"heading": "2.1 Types of performance measurement in AI", "text": "An application, as described above, can be characterized by a series of problems, tasks or exercises M.

Also, the system, the problem or the measurement cannot be deterministic. Consequently, it is common to work with the expected value of the performance of the system as E [R (\u03c0, \u00b5).] The definition of M and R does not specify how we want to summarize the results if M has more than one problem.

However, other tasks that are not yet properly solved by AI technology are already evaluated in this way and will one day be successful. However, instead of AI applications that we think about AI systems, we see that there are some types of AI systems for which task-oriented evaluation of humans is not appropriate. For example, cognitive robots, artificial pets, assistants, avatars, smart houses, etc., are not designed to cover a particular application, but the user is expected to be tailored for a variety of tasks. To cover this wide range of (previously unseen) tasks, these systems need to have some skills, such as thinking skills, verbal skills, movement skills, etc. Hence, this includes, apart from task-oriented methods that we evaluate."}, {"heading": "3.1 What is an ability?", "text": "We must first of all make it clear that we are talking about cognitive abilities, in the same way as in the previous section we referred to cognitive tasks. Some AI applications require physical abilities, especially in robotics, but AI is about how the sensors and actuators are controlled, not about their strength, consumption, etc. Once clarified, we can define a cognitive ability as a characteristic of individuals that allows them to function well in a range of information processing tasks. At first glance, this definition may look like a change of perspective (from problems to systems), but what we are now seeing is that the ability to get along without the ability is. In other words, the ability is necessary, but it does not have to be sufficient (e.g. spatial skills are not sufficient, but not sufficient, to drive a car). Also, the ability is assumed to cover a range of skills that we need to have a set of abilities without the ability to have the ability to show the abilities is."}, {"heading": "3.2 The anthropocentric approach: psychometrics", "text": "An early concept that emerged was the distinction between knowledge and skills. For example, an \"idiot savant\" could have a lot of knowledge or would have developed a sophisticated ability over the years for some specific areas, but could be obtuse for other problems. On the contrary, a very capable person without prior knowledge could function well in a number of tasks, provided they are culturally fair. This distinction took several decades to consolidate. In some ways, this is similar to the narrow vs. general dilemma in AI.Psychometrics is about measuring cognitive abilities, personality traits and other psychological traits. Factors that differ from skills in principle are achieved through testing and further analysis through systematic approaches. Some factors were equated and named after existing abilities, while others are \"discovered\" and given new technical names."}, {"heading": "3.3 Evaluation using AIT", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that there will only be one such event until such an event occurs."}, {"heading": "3.4 Universal psychometrics", "text": "Figure 7 shows the fragmentation of the approaches seen in earlier sections, and accordingly the subject can be subjected. As we can see, this fragmentation arises from what kind of measurement we are interested in, but above all by the type of subject being measured. In [55] the term \"universal test\" is introduced, as a test that is applicable to \"any biological or artificial system that exists at this time or in the future\": human, non-human animals, machines, hybrids or collectives. \"The use has been set high since the tests were supposed to function without knowledge of the subject, derived from computational principles, without prejudice (species, culture, language,...), no human intervention that produces an evaluation of meaning, practical and at any time that we have for the test, the higher reliability of the score). Note that in order to apply the same test to several subjects we are allowed to adapt the user interface, provided the characteristics and difficulty of the elements remain unchanged."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions", "text": "We have identified several problems and constraints, and we have found that there is still enormous scope for improvement in the way AI systems are evaluated, but this could play a more relevant role in the future. Imagining and evaluating skills is more difficult than imagining the task. We have argued that this requires integrating multiple perspectives that are currently dispersed in AI: psychometrics, AIT and comparative cognition. The different areas, philosophies, foundations, terminologies and the different types of subjects that can be combined with an integrated perspective as universal psychometry."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the EU (FEDER) and the Spanish MINECO projects CONSOLIDER-INGENIO CSD2007-00022, TIN 2010-21062-C02-02 and TIN 2013-45732-C4-1-P, by the Generalitat Valenciana projects Prometeo / 2008 / 051 and PROMETEO / 2011 / 052 and the REFRAME project of the European Coordinated Research on Long-term Challenges in Information and Communication Sciences & Technologies ERA-Net (CHISTERA), funded by the respective national research councils and ministries (Ministo de Economi? a y Competitividad, code PCIN-2013-037, Spain).

We then focus on a less customary (and challenging) ability-oriented evaluation approach, where a system is characterised by its (cognitive) abilities, rather than by the tasks it is designed to solve.
