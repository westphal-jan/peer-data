Among its many developments, it has become a virtual place where people and software interact in mixed communities, i.e. a hybrid space where people and web robots interact and form new types of collectives, which we will call hybrid societies here. These large-scale interactions create many problems, especially those of reconciliation of formal semantics of informatics (e.g. logic, ontologies, typing systems, etc.) on which the web architecture is built, with soft semantics of people (e.g. posts, tags, status, etc.) on which the web content is built. Let's take a concrete and very common example. Many websites include forums, blogs, status feeds, wikis, etc. In other words, many websites incorporate content management systems and quickly build huge collections of information resources. As these collections grow, several tasks become more difficult to automate: search, notification, navigation aid, etc."}, {"heading": "2 Challenges in bridging formal semantics and social semantics", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move."}, {"heading": "3 Analyzing and modeling users, communities and their interactions in a Social Semantic Web context", "text": "That is the question, whether it is a political project or not."}, {"heading": "4 Formalizing and reasoning on heterogeneous semantic graphs", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to abide by the rules they have established in relation to their work on themselves."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "Wimmics provides models and algorithms to bridge formal semantics and social semantics by formalizing and arguing heterogeneous semantic graphs. Models we design include: users, their profiles, their requirements, their activities, and their contexts; social links, social structures, social exchanges, and processes; conceptual models, including ontologies, thesauri, and folksonomies. Whenever possible, these models are formalized and published in accordance with standardized web formalisms, and can motivate research and proposals to expand these standards. Schemes and datasets created are published as linked data that follow the principles of web architecture; the algorithms we study include: typed graphs that index, argue, and seek; hybrid processing that merge logical conclusions, rules, and metric conclusions; approximation and dissemination algorithms become distributed and scalable alternatives to classical argumentations."}, {"heading": "6 References", "text": "1.
