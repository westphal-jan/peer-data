{"id": "1409.0069", "review": {"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-Aug-2014", "title": "Personalization of Itineraries search using Ontology and Rules to Avoid Congestion in Urban Areas", "abstract": "There is a relatively small amount of research covering urban freight movements. Most research dealing with the subject of urban mobility focuses on passenger vehicles, not commercial vehicles hauling freight. However, in many ways, urban freight transport contributes to congestion, air pollution, noise, accident and more fuel consumption which raises logistic costs, and hence the price of products. The main focus of this paper is to propose a new solution for congestion in order to improve the distribution process of goods in urban areas and optimize transportation cost, time of delivery, fuel consumption, and environmental impact, while guaranteeing the safety of goods and passengers. A novel technique for personalization in itinerary search based on city logistics ontology and rules is proposed to overcome this problem. The integration of personalization plays a key role in capturing or inferring the needs of each stakeholder (user), and then satisfying these needs in a given context. The proposed approach is implemented to an itinerary search problem for freight transportation in urban areas to demonstrate its ability in facilitating intelligent decision support by retrieving the best itinerary that satisfies the most users preferences (stakeholders).", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Aug 2014 00:24:27 GMT  (328kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0069v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["amir zidi", "amna bouhana", "afef fekih", "mourad abed"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.0069"}, "pdf": {"name": "1409.0069.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Personalization of Itineraries search using Ontology and Rules to Avoid Congestion in Urban Areas", "authors": ["Amir ZIDI", "Amna BOUHANA", "Afef FEKIH", "Mourad ABED"], "emails": ["Amir.zidi}@univ-valenciennes.fr)", "amnabouhana@yahoo.fr", "afef.fekih@louisiana.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to leave the country in which it is in order to found a country in which it is able to change the world and in which it is able to change the world."}, {"heading": "2. PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "The proposed approach is based on the ontology-based city logistics paradigm GenCLON, proposed by Anand et al., 2012."}, {"heading": "2.1. Scope of GenCLON", "text": "Urban logistics is the study of the dynamic management and operations of urban freight transport and distribution systems, with the aim of ensuring optimum productivity, reliability and customer care, while reducing environmental impacts, air pollution, energy consumption and congestion. Urban logistics is classified as a discipline that can address sustainable problems that arise in urban freight logistics. One of its most important characteristics is its ability to take into account the heterogeneity of actors in the decision-making process (heterogeneity of information and interests exchanged between different actors (resident-retailer-authority-supplier). In, (Anand et al., 2012), the authors proposed an ontology-based logistics tool (GenCLOn). The aim of this ontology is to formalize the knowledge of the city about logistics, in order to facilitate communication and to share different knowledge with different terminologies and types of decisions made by different actors in urban logistics, such as distributors, etc."}, {"heading": "2.2 Rules Based Personalization", "text": "In general, we focus on classification methods by defining \"classes,\" \"subclasses\" and associated individual resources to such classes, and the relationships between classes and their instances are usually described as they are. (It is a question of whether this is a way of establishing new relationships between the individual classes and their instances.) In our approach, we define rules in order to obtain an efficient application in the area of customization of routes in order to improve the quality of urban freight transport and avoid congestion. In our approach, we define a set of rules that use SWRL using GenCLAs. (Anand et al.) The aim of these rules is to satisfy the preferences of users. (It is about profiles) In a given context, both private and public users or stakeholders involved in urban logistics with different preferences (Figure.2)."}, {"heading": "3. APPLICATION", "text": "As already mentioned, the domain in which the approach was evaluated was urban freight transport. We use GenCLOn kernel ontology, which contains X concepts. To verify the approach and to illustrate its application in a real itinerary, a real data collection is used to build the first knowledge base. It was implemented by Paris Open Data.The interface and functionality of the application are implemented, as usual for web applications, in EACH (Jsp and Servlet). For ontological expansion and development, we use OWL (Ontology Web Language) to ensure maximum expressivity and efficient reasoning. The definition of rules is implemented in SWRL. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 4 was selected as the appropriate ontology environment to implement our ontology and related rules."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSION", "text": "Our approach integrates the concept of personalization into intelligent freight transport as a technique to reduce the problem of congestion in urban areas by providing users with a personalized route that accurately matches their needs and preferences. The proposed approach is based on ontology and SWFD rules. Ontology is used to formalize the representation of various sources of information and gather knowledge of user preferences in urban logistics, while the power of the rules ensures the personalization process.In our future research, we plan to further optimize route search by incorporating information about traffic lights and congestion in real time, resulting in a dynamic and personalized search engine for urban freight transport and distribution systems."}], "references": [{"title": "Personalized pedestrian navigation system with subjective preference based route selection", "author": ["Y.
