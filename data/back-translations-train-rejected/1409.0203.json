In the time intervals where there is no active peaker, diffuse noise is the predominant signal in the room. The table is located in the center of the room, so the deviation from the diffuser near the walls can be neglected. On the basis of the diffuse noise model theory, the distance between two narrow microphones can be estimated by calculating the coherence of their signals. [27] Figure 1 is an example of coherence and the adjusted sink function.

Therefore, D is a symmetrical matrix, and it is often fully shunted.

As described in Section 2, there are two types of missing entries. The first group consists of the structured missing entries corresponding to distances greater than dmax. We call this group S = {(i, j): di j \u2265 dmax}, (6) These structured missing entries are represented by a structured missing entries corresponding to distances greater than dmax."}, {"heading": "3.3.

Evaluation Measure", "text": "Extracting the absolute position of the microphones used in the area requires at least \u0445 + 1 anchor points in addition to the distance matrix. Therefore, in a scenario where the only information available is pairs of distances, the evaluation quantity must quantify the error in estimating the relative position of the microphones, which is robust for the rigid transformations (translation, rotation and reflection). Therefore, we quantify the distance between the actual locations X and the estimated locations X as [29] Dist (X, X) = 1 N point (X, X). This model is not restrictive in practice and Gaussian noise is taken into account for the simulations performed in Section 7, where the Sub-Gaussian assumption reflects the Frobenius standard and uses IN \u00d7 N point in comparison to the distance matrix methods specified in Section 5."}, {"heading": "4.

Matrix Completion", "text": "We recall our problem with N microphones distributed over a space of dimensions.The goal is to obtain MN \u00b7 N of rank N from a sample of its entries without having to determine all N2 entries, or to collect N2 measurements via M. The approach suggested by matrix completion is based on the fact that a low data matrix contains much less information than its ambient dimension implies. Intuitively, since the matrix M (2N \u2212 \u03b7) has at least N of the row entries and N of the column entries, which are reduced by 2 of the repeated values, to cover the whole elements of M.Da ME defined in (12), the matrix completion covers an estimate of the distance matrixM by the following optimization minimize."}, {"heading": "4.2. Cadzow Projection to the Set of EDM Properties", "text": "The classical matrix completion algorithm, as described above, restores a low-order matrix with elements as close as possible to the known entries. However, the recovered matrix does not necessarily correspond to a Euclidean distance matrix; EDMs, for example, are symmetrical with diagonal elements zero. To this end, we apply a Cadzow-like method. The Cadzow algorithm [31] (also known as Papoulis-Gershberg) is a method to find a signal that fulfills a composite of properties by projecting the signal iteratively into the property sets. We modify the matrix completion algorithm by inserting an additional step into each iteration. In the classical version of this algorithm, a simple edge approximation is used by projecting the signal into the property sets."}, {"heading": "4.3.

Related Methods", "text": "The aim is to extract the relative (up to a rigid transformation) microphone position xi, i, i,.., N.

Classic Multi-Dimensional Scaling Algorithm", "text": "MDS refers to a set of statistical techniques used to determine the configuration of objects in a low dimensional space so that the measured paired distances are maintained [19]. Considering a distance matrix, the determination of the relative microphone positions is achieved by MDSLocalize [29]. Ideally, if the matrix M is complete and noiseless, this algorithm will output the relative positions of the microphones. In the first step, a double centering transformation is applied to M to subtract the row and column averages of the distance matrix across (M) = \u2212 12 J M J, using J = IN \u2212 1 / N1N1TN.

In general, the inclusion of wi j = d-i-j, \u03b1-2, \u2212 1, 0, 1, 2,...} results in different loss functions and depending on the structure of the problem, one of them may function better than the other [38]."}, {"heading": "7. Experimental Analysis", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7.1. A-priori Expectations", "text": "The simplest method we have discussed is the classical MDS algorithm, which assumes that all paired distances are known and that in the absence of input and noise, a meaningful benefit function is not minimized. An extension of this method is MDS-MAP, which replaces the missing distances by the shortest route. In many scenarios, this is considered a rough approximation of the actual distances. On the other hand, the SDP-based method is known to work relatively well with missing distance information. Along with its final phase of gradient descent, it has been shown to find good estimates of the location. However, since any distance information is translated into a constraint in the semi-defined program, this approach is not scalable and becomes insoluble for large sensor networks. The alternative approach is to minimize the non-convex s stress function. Although it is known to work well under many conditions, in the case of missing distances, Eurix cannot rule out the possibility of using this classical approach."}, {"heading": "7.2. Simulated Data Evaluations", "text": "The simulated experiments will be performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with modern alternative approaches in different scenarios with different numbers of microphones, magnitude of paired distance measurements, percentage of missing distances, and blurring. The presented assessment is based on a local connectivity assumption for paired distance measurements. We do not assume a specific model (e.g. diffuse noise) for the paired estimation of distance, and the conclusions of this section apply to a general ad hoc array calibration system where the paired distances can be provided by other means that correspond to the local connectivity assumption."}, {"heading": "7.2.1. Performance for Different Numbers of Microphones", "text": "In this section, we present the performance of the ad hoc array calibration when the number of microphones varies from 15 to 200. Microphones are evenly spaced on a disk with a diameter of 19 m. The maximum distance measured in pairs is 7.5 m. In addition, 5% of the distances are assumed to be randomly absent. Therefore, the total number of missing entries varies between 42% and 60%. The standard deviation of the noise coherence model for the measured distances (expressed in (13) - (14)) between two microphones i and j is derived from the dependence of the noise level on the distance due to the limitation of the diffuse noise coherence model for the pair distance determination as elaborated in [28]. Results for each number of microphones are averaged over 500 random configurations. The calibration error is quantified using the metric deviation defined in (15)."}, {"heading": "7.2.2. Performance for Different Noise Levels", "text": "In order to assess the effect of noise on calibration performance, similar (500) configurations of 45 microphones are simulated as described in Section 7.2.1. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the results. We see that the performance improves as the noise level decreases. Based on the theoretical analysis of Section 5 as expressed in (28), a linear relationship between the calibration error of matrix completion and the expected deviation is expected. Empirical observations agree with this theoretical finding. As shown in Figure 5, for example, the second term in (28) becomes too small so that the first term becomes dominant as the slope of error reduction is reduced."}, {"heading": "7.2.3. Performance for Different Missing Ratios", "text": "In order to investigate the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm to different levels of missing distances, a cubic space with unit dimensions (1 \u00b7 1 \u00b7 1 m3) is simulated and 60 microphones are evenly distributed at random positions. 300 random configurations are generated and the average mean position error is evaluated. Alternatively, the self-calibration method proposed by Crocco et al. [14] is implemented taking into account 30 sources and 30 sensors (i.e. a total of 60 nodes). In addition to the known distances, the number of nodes for calibration is the same for both approaches. Distances between all source and microphone pairs are known. Some of the distances are assumed to be random. In addition, white Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.02 m is added. The simulated scenario imitates the evaluation settings of [14] and requires the determination of the position of two microphones to allow us to derive the network position from the error for the different illustrations in the R7."}, {"heading": "7.2.4. Effect of Jitter on Calibration Performance", "text": "The study presented in this paper assumes that the microphones are synchronized prior to calibration. If a pilot signal is used at the sampling frequency f = 16 kHz for synchronization, the effect of the jitter can be modelled as [\u2212 c2 f, c 2 f] by a uniform error in distance measurements, with c being the sound velocity and set to 340 m / s. Consequently, we can model the jitter as additional uniform noise on the distance measurements in the range of [\u2212 1.065, 1.065] cm. The effect of the jitter is evaluated for different sound levels at distances. The number of microphones is 45 distributed on a disc with a diameter of 19 m. 60% of the distances are missing, consisting of 5% random and 55% structured. The experiments are repeated for 300 random configurations and the average calibration error and position estimation error are quantified. Figure 8 illustrates the results."}, {"heading": "7.2.5. Distributed Array Calibration", "text": "In order to further investigate the performance of the proposed approach for calibrating distributed arrays, two scenarios are simulated: In the first scenario, a room measuring 11 x 8 x 5 m3 is considered, giving dmax = 101 cm [28] 4. In the second scenario, a room measuring 8 x 5.5 x 3.5 m3 is considered, giving dmax = 73 cm. [26] The reverberation time is approximately 300 ms. A 9-channel circular microphone array measuring 20 cm in diameter is located in another 6-channel circular field measuring 70 cm in diameter. The standard deviation of noise for distance measurements is in the range of p = 0.06."}, {"heading": "7.3. Real Data Evaluation", "text": "The real data recordings are collected in the Idiap intelligent meeting room [40].4The maximum distance that can be estimated using the diffuse noise model depends on the size of the room and the acoustic parameters. A linear relationship between the maximum measurable distance and the room size has been rigorously presented [28]. However, applying the diffuse noise method to pair distance estimation is only an example of the application of the proposed algorithm and many alternative approaches can be used."}, {"heading": "7.3.1. Recording Set-up", "text": "We consider a scenario in which eleven microphones are arranged on a flat surface: Eight of them are located on a circle with a diameter of 20 cm and one microphone is located in the middle. There are two other microphones at a distance of 70 cm from the central microphone. The microphones are Sennheiser MKE-2-5-C omnidirectional miniature stop type. Although the recording situation for data acquisition is regular, the uniform geometry of the microphone grid does not present any particular limitation. Therefore, without loss of universality, we rely on this available setup to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The floor of the room is carpeted and surrounded by plaster walls with two large windows. The casing is a rectangular room of 8 x 5.5 x 3.5 m3 and it is moderately reverberating; the reverberation time is approximately 300 ms. It contains a central 4.8 x 1.2 m2 rectangular table. This scenario mimics the microphone base of the M40-48 database."}, {"heading": "7.3.2. Pairwise Distance Estimation", "text": "In order to estimate the paired distances, we take two microphone signals of the length 2.14 s, frame them in short windows of the length 1024 samples with a tukey function (parameter = 0.25) and apply the Fourier transformation. For each image, we calculate the coherence function. The average of the coherence functions over 1000 frames is calculated and used to estimate the paired distance by adjusting a sine function as in (1) using the algorithm described in [26]. This algorithm is an improved version of the distance estimation using the diffuse noise coherence model, which allows a reasonable estimate up to 73 cm. We empirically confirm that distances beyond this are not reliably estimated, so that they are considered missing. The following entries of the Euclidean distance matrix are missing: d10,11, d1,10, d7,10, d8,10, d5,11, d6,11, d7,11 (see Figure 9)."}, {"heading": "7.3.3.
