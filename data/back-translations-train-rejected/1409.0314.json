The article will argue that RF measure captures similar information as the standard EvalB metric (Sekine and Collins, 1997) and the tree edit distance (Zhang and Shasha, 1989) applied by Tsarfaty et al.

In the case of historical linguistics, inferred language trees are compared with trees derived from the application of the comparative method (Hoenigswald, 1973). Wichmann et al. (2011) and Pompei et al. (2011) compare different tree distance measurements to compare different language relationships.

From these parses, I discarded any parses with a sentence length of less than 4. After this step, I had 2378 parses left. I also converted the automatic and gold parses to NEWICK format (Rock, 2004). The NEWICK format is a bracket format to represent trees and uses, \"symbol to separate adjacent leaves; opening and closing brackets. I also removed the POS tag for each word. This step removes all nodes that have a grade of 2. Therefore, a definitive NEWICK format tree consists solely of brackets and words. I use the EvalB program to calculate the sentence level precision and retrieve ratings. 2Available at http: / / birc.au.dk / diqst / software."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "Our first hypothesis is that RFD correlates to a large extent with the F-scores, based on the similarity in the formulas shown in Section 2.2. Accordingly, Pearson's r between RFD and F-scores is \u2212 0.9. We attribute the difference to the handling of the top brackets. We ignore the top bracket enclosing the root symbol, while EvalB includes it in the calculation. GRFDs and F-scores also show a correlation of \u2212 0.82. The correlation is likely to be negative, as F-score is a measure of similarity, while RFD is a distance metric. I have also checked the correlation of QD and GQD with F-scores. The correlation is quite high: \u2212 0.73 and \u2212 0.68, respectively. I have also calculated the correlation between the four different distance scales. The correlation is shown in Table 1.The measures that correlate QD with trees that correlate are very different from 2006, but not based on the observation of trees."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and future work", "text": "In this article, I have described two popular parameters for tree distances from computer biology and used them for parser evaluation purposes. I observe that the parameters for the performance of a single parser correlate to a large extent with each other. I also argued that QD and generalized parameters for tree distances are very suitable for parser evaluation tasks, as the gold parses can have internal nodes with degrees greater than 2. I also argued that RF distance measurements do the same thing as the distance for the calculation of blank accuracies. This hypothesis is supported by the high Pearson-r. In the future, we plan to test the various parameters on other standard parameters."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "I thank Richard Johansson for providing the binaries of Charniak Parser.
