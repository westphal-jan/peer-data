By \"intuitively comparable,\" one should understand that if we (humans) perform the comparison, it would generally be impossible for us to distinguish between the results of humans and the results of machines. \"Imitation Game,\" as proposed by A. M. Turing, can be seen as an example of this criterion of comparison. As examples of intellectual tasks, one can consider common tasks such as processing natural language and visual recognition of objects, as well as specialized tasks such as deriving the whole of mathematics from first principles. Machines that are operationally equivalent to a Turing machine have fundamental limitations that hinder them in achieving results that are intuitively comparable to humans."}, {"heading": "Abstractions", "text": "In this case, an abstraction can exist either as an idea in people's minds that is both exposable and adaptable; this system of abstractions is necessary to find meaning in the things that are embedded in people's minds."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Abstractional Models", "text": "A model is to be regarded as a construction of interest consisting of a collection of objects and relationships that follow certain criteria of validity, whereby no object or relationship within the construction can be contradicted by any other object or relationship within the same construction. This is achieved by first creating an initial collection of objects and relationships that are considered fundamental and not contradictory to each other; I will call this initial collection the foundation of the model. Then, in order to build new objects or relationships within the model, only objects and relationships can be used for its foundation or that have been derived from its foundation. It should therefore be clear that a criterion of validity that is imposed on objects at the bottom of a model extends to all derived objects, making the entire model consistent under such criteria. An abstract model is a model in which its objects and relationships are all abstractions and abstractions. It should be clear that no distinction between objects and objects is necessary at the level of the model, since the relationship between the objects and the abstract is a nature of the model."}, {"heading": "Operating Machines", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive themselves, and most of them are able to survive themselves.

In view of some executable operations in an M operating machine, it is possible to describe a predictable abstraction by taking into account concepts defined on the basis of operations in M. The operations taken into account in the derivation of concepts are decided on the basis of predefined criteria (not part of the general process, but of the respective implementation). Thus, for example, we want to perform an abstraction (through a mechanical process) carried out in an M1 operating machine."}, {"heading": "4 Abstractional Machines", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able to understand and understand the things they need to understand what they are doing.

This means overcoming the limitations that machines currently have in performing intellectual tasks. The solution proposed in this paper needs to be further developed, with more examples and applications to be taken into account in future work. Regardless of the solution offered here, particular attention needs to be paid to recognizing the limitations of operating machines and to the fact that without overcoming them there is no way that operating machines can perform intellectual tasks with results comparable to human results, since such limitations have nothing to do with the efficiency or speed of calculations or with the storage capacity of machines."}], "references": [{"title": "MMIXware: a RISC computer for the third millennium", "author": ["Donald E Knuth"], "venue": "volume 1750.
