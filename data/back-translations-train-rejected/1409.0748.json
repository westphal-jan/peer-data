In this post, we examine the ability to detect imminent ADRs, so that we consider all medical events that occur within 30 days of the medication being prescribed as possible drug and ADR pairs. The justification for investigating the 30-day period after a drug is that this is a compromise between a sufficiently long period of time during which underreporting is minimized (as patients have time to report side effects), while reducing the amount of noise by a long period of time. After all medical events that occur within 30 days of the medication being prescribed are found, the pharmacovigilance algorithms developed for EHDs then calculate a dependence between the list of any medical event and any medical event that occur within 30 days of each medical event."}, {"heading": "2.1.1 SRS Algorithms & Background", "text": "The SRS algorithms were originally developed for general SRS databases, where the actual rate at which a drug is prescribed and the rate at which a medical event occurs is unknown, since the SRS databases contain only data on the medicines prescriptions that may have led to an ADR. Consequently, the SRS algorithms estimate the background rate at which a medical event occurs by figuring out how often the medical event is reported with each drug in the database. Medical events that are reported disproportionately more frequently with the drug of interest compared to all the other medications in the database are then classified as highly suspicious ADRs. These algorithms use an emergency table, see Table 1, summarizing the number of reports that contain (or do not include) the drug and the event of interest. An example of an SRS algorithm is the probability of a medical event occurring (ROR), w00 = 1 w1 (11 / 1) after a drug occurs relatively frequent (11 / 1)."}, {"heading": "2.1.2 SRS algorithms Previous Results", "text": "Existing work by Zorych et al. converted the \"modified SRS algorithms\" to a simulated EHD database and a real EHD database [28].

Figure 1 illustrates an example of the transformation. After the THIN database has been transformed, as described in Figure 1, ROR is applied. The left limit of the 90% confidence interval of ROR (ROR05) is calculated for each event occurring in at least three reports of interest to the drug (w00 \u2265 3) and the medical events are evaluated based on ROR05, see Equation 2 [17] [28]. We opted for the left limit of the 90% confidence interval of ROR, as previous work has shown that the ROR05 was better in terms of probability of medical events being RADR28 than the ROR [28]."}, {"heading": "2.2 MUTARA/HUNT", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 MUTARA/HUNT Background", "text": "The algorithms Mining Unexpected Temporary Association Rules given the Antecedent (MUTARA) [11] and Highlighting UTARs, Negating TARs (HUNT) [12] were designed to be implemented on the QueenslandLinked Data Set (QLDS), which consists of the Commonwealth Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS), Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and Queensland Hospital Morbidity Data.

TPD 1 delivered the highest AP for flucloxacillin, amoxicillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin, and HUNT60 delivered the highest AP for benzyl penicillin sodium and ampicillin. This is consistent with overall results, as TPD 1 and HUNT60 generally had the highest AP value of any medication, which is regrettable as stratification of all algorithms in the study is likely to lead to an increase in the time it takes to identify an ADR, as the population of patients on average being prescribed a drug may require the algorithms to apply stratification methods instead of applying the algorithms to all age groups."}, {"heading": "5.3.2 Gender Bias", "text": "The drugs with the greatest gender bias towards women (which are more commonly prescribed to women) were norfloxacin, lofepramine, nortriptyline and doxepine, with male ratios of 0.26,0,28, 0.29 and 0.32, respectively. Aside from lofepramine, MUTARA and HUNT performed much better on medications prescribed to more women than men. This may underscore the need for MUTARA and HUNT to be prescribed more frequently to a subgroup of patients, such as elderly women or young men, as was originally the case for MUTATA and HUNT.The medications gliclazides, glibenclamide, glipizides and glimepirides are more commonly prescribed to men than to women with a male ratio of 0.55, 0.54, 0.53 and 0.53, respectively. These medications had the lowest AP levels compared to all the other medicines studied and may suggest that the algorithms have difficulty detecting ADHD more frequently in malaria, which are more commonly prescribed to malaria."}, {"heading": "5.3.3 Low Prescription Rates", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take one year to move on to the next round."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we compared four existing ADR detection algorithms by applying them to the THIN database for a number of medications, and measured how well they rated the known ADRs or known ADRs at their natural thresholds. We found that the benchmark AP score for ADRs of signal algorithms applied to the THIN database is 0.2, the benchmark AUC [0.0.1] is 0.011 (3dp) and AUC [0.0.3] is 0.076 (3dp). Future algorithms should aim for higher values. Results show that no algorithm was superior for all medications considered, although the results suggest that HUNT may be the optimal algorithm to apply when the number of patients being prescribed the drug is low or TPD may be optimal when patients are old, but further research is needed to confirm these hypotheses."}], "references": [{"title": "Perspectives on the use of data mining in pharmacovigilance", "author": ["J.

thought to have excellent potential for generating adverse drug reaction signals. The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database is an electronic healthcare database containing medical information on over 11 million patients that has excellent potential for detecting ADRs. In this paper we apply four existing electronic healthcare database signal detecting algorithms (MUTARA, HUNT, Temporal Pattern Discovery and modified ROR) on the THIN database for a selection of drugs from six chosen drug families. This is the first comparison of ADR signalling algorithms that includes MUTARA and HUNT and enabled us to set a benchmark for the adverse drug reaction signalling ability of the THIN database. The drugs were selectively chosen to enable a comparison with previous work and for variety. It was found that no algorithm was generally superior and the algorithms\u2019 natural thresholds act at variable stringencies. Furthermore, none of the algorithms perform well at detecting rare ADRs.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
