Side effects that occur in more than one in a thousand patients are likely to be signalled efficiently by current drug surveillance methods, however, these same methods may take decades before generating signals for rarer side effects, risking medical morbidity or mortality in patients prescribed the drug while the rare side effect is undiscovered. In this paper we propose a novel computational meta-analysis framework for signalling rare side effects that integrates existing methods, knowledge from the web, metric learning and semi-supervised clustering. The novel framework was able to signal many known rare and serious side effects for the selection of drugs investigated, such as tendon rupture when prescribed Ciprofloxacin or Levofloxacin, renal failure with Naproxen and depression associated with Rimonabant. Furthermore, for the majority of the drug investigated it generated signals for rare side effects at a more stringent signalling threshold than existing methods and shows the potential to become a fundamental part of post marketing surveillance to detect rare side effects.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 16:00:23 GMT  (773kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0768v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["jenna reps", "jonathan m garibaldi", "uwe aickelin", "daniele soria", "jack e gibson", "richard b hubbard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.0768"}, "pdf": {"name": "1409.0768.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Novel Semi-Supervised Algorithm for Rare Prescription Side Effect Discovery", "authors": ["Jenna Reps", "Jonathan M.

DRESS ALGORITHM", "text": "The DRESS algorithm (Detecting Rare Events Semi-Supervised) consists of five steps, see Figure (2).

The value of k determines the filter threshold and in this essay we look at the 100 best read codes signaled by the algorithms."}, {"heading": "A. Step 1", "text": "The first step of the DRESS algorithm is to generate attributes for each read code that could be an ADR. This is achieved by first finding the set of all read codes recorded for each patient within a month of the first prescription of d *. Then, we designate this set of G read codes. Then, the DRESS algorithm generates the attributes ABratio30 (ei, d *), ABratio365 (ei, d *), DOP (ei, d *), expect (ei, d *), ABratiolev3 (ei, d *), ABratiolev2 (ei, d *) (Eq's (26) - (31)), and the OE ratio values are the IC (ei, d *), 1 (ei, d *), and 2 (ei, d *) (Eq's (16) - (17). The data point for each of these codes G is set by xi values (ei, d), *, 1 (ei), d (*), d (d)."}, {"heading": "B. Step 2", "text": "Since we take a semi-monitored approach, we need labels for some of the read codes. We have decided to have three different labels for each read code, a label for read codes that are ADRs (known as ADR), another label for read codes that cause the drug to be taken by patients (indicator), and the final label for read codes that are not associated with the drug (noise). The reason for choosing three labels is that there is information that enables us to identify the labels for a sufficient number of read codes when we use three labels. We have identified the read codes that are labeled as sounds by using the hierarchical structure of the read code tree that is not associated with any imminent ADRs."}, {"heading": "C. Step 3", "text": "After labeling some of the read codes, we then apply the metric learning algorithm described in detail in [26]. Labeling with S denotes the set of all index pairs for read codes with the same labeling (e.g. if read codes corresponding to data points x1 and x2 are called noise, then (1, 2) indicator then (1, 5) indicator for read codes with different labeling (e.g. if the read code corresponding to data point x1 is called noise, but the read code corresponding to data point x5 is called indicator then (1, 5) indicator then (D) and the inner product of two d \u00b7 n real-weighted matrices, X, Y-Rd \u00b7 n, is called < X >: = Tr (XTY) indicator, where Tr (A) means the track of the matrix A.

Step 4", "text": "The limited K mean algorithm [27] is a semi-supervised algorithm that specifies the class of designated read codes and uses these designated read codes to calculate the initial cluster centers, then iteratively assigns the unspecified read codes to the cluster with the closest mean, recalculating the means iteratively until convergence. If the DRESS algorithm is implemented, the set of data points entered into the restricted Kmeans algorithm is the set {f (x1), f (xn)}, the value of the K input is 3 and the initial seeds are S1 = {xi: xi: xi is designated as ADR}, S2 = {xi: xi: xi is designated as an indicator}, and S3 = {xi: xi: xi is designated as noise."}, {"heading": "E. Step 5", "text": "The last step was to apply two additional filters and then use the read code attributes and clusters to sort the read codes according to how likely they are ADRs. The first filter removed all read codes (ei's) that were in the indicator cluster or those (1 \u2212 expect (ei, d '))) \u00b7 ABratio30 (ei, d's) < 1. The second filter is a filter that we have developed for post-processing with any algorithm that recognizes ADRs by removing the THIN database. This filter removes all read codes that are irrelevant to ADR detection, such as read codes that correspond to administrative events. Finally, read codes were arranged in descending order (1 \u2212 expect (ei, d ') \u00b7 ABratio30 (ei, d ') \u00d7 1\u03b2, where \u03b2 = 1 are read codes in the ADSS cluster relevant to the REDR cluster, and then read codes in the ADSS cluster semi-attributes that they are used in the ADSS cluster summary."}, {"heading": "V. RESULTS", "text": "It has applied the DRESS algorithms to a number of other algorithms, some of which have been withdrawn from the market due to serious ADRs. Table II shows that each data set algorithm is based on a known and serious drug and ADR pair; the table also shows the cause for taking the drug (indication), the year in which the drug was withdrawn, and the manner in which the drug was prescribed to patients. In some cases, the rare and serious ADR cases were listed as ADR on the netdoctor's website to prevent any bias in the DRESS algorithms; all labels for the ADR codes that were examined at the end of Level 2 before the semi-supervised steps were removed. Thus, the read codes of corresponding ADR comparisons were always unlabeled in the DRESS algorithms; the DRESS algorithms had an average ranking of 14 pairs above the drug and other 3.75 pairs of ADR algorithms."}, {"heading": "VI. DISCUSSION", "text": "This year it is as far as never before in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have described a new method for detecting rare ADRs that includes some existing methods (Observe Expected Ratio, MUTARA and HUNT), gathering information from the Internet, metric learning, and semi-monitored clustering. Results suggest that this method is capable of detecting rare and serious ADRs for the drug spectrum selected in the study, and has the potential to detect many currently unknown ADRs. The method is unable to remove all medical events related to the cause of drug use, and future work should aim to prevent signals for these medical events by adding an additional attribute to clustering that determines the expectation of each medical event, based on sequential patterns that can be derived from the entire database. Further work could also examine various metric learning and semi-monitored clustering techniques."}], "references": [{"title": "and J", "author": ["S. Gautier", "H. Bachelet", "R.

frequently prescribed to patients with the aim of improving each patient\u2019s medical state, but an unfortunate consequence of most prescription drugs is the occurrence of undesirable side effects. Side effects that occur in more than one in a thousand patients are likely to be signalled efficiently by current drug surveillance methods, however, these same methods may take decades before generating signals for rarer side effects, risking medical morbidity or mortality in patients prescribed the drug while the rare side effect is undiscovered. In this paper we propose a novel computational meta-analysis framework for signalling rare side effects that integrates existing methods, knowledge from the web, metric learning and semi-supervised clustering. The novel framework was able to signal many known rare and serious side effects for the selection of drugs investigated, such as tendon rupture when prescribed Ciprofloxacin or Levofloxacin, renal failure with Naproxen and depression associated with Rimonabant. Furthermore, for the majority of the drug investigated it generated signals for rare side effects at a more stringent signalling threshold than existing methods and shows the potential to become a fundamental part of post marketing surveillance to detect rare side effects.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
