We used a subset of the THIN database for this research, which included records for 4 million patients. Within the subset, there were a total of 30191726 medical events recorded for 1.7 million patients when they were 17 years old or younger. For each patient, their year of birth, gender, and other personal details are known. Each medical record indicates the patient to whom the record corresponds, the recording date, and the medical event that the patient has experienced. Medical events have a tree structure, with the medical event becoming more specific as its depth of node (i.e. the length of the path from root to node) increases. Therefore, medical event nodes with a depth of 1 are the most common and medical event nodes with a depth of 5 are the most specific. Each prescription within the THIN database contains details of the specific drug being prescribed, and contains a code corresponding to the drug being prescribed."}, {"heading": "3 Methodology", "text": "3.1 Ensemble of Simple Studies Design Framework OverviewThe proposed Ensemble of Simple Studies Design (ESSD) framework for signaling acute ADRs occurring within the pediatric population is: 1. Generate simple studies called data - Select n drug families of interest, designating each drug family as Dk, k, k [1, n]. - Determine the medical risk events (RMEDk), these are all medical events that are potentially acute ADRs to the drugs in Dk. - For each drug family Dk and medical event RMEDk pair, determine whether the medical event is a known ADR or non-ADR of the drug family Dk and add labels. The label for the ith pair is designated as yi. For example, if the ith pair matches an ADR pair, then ADyi = 1, but if the category-dependent ADR pair does not match an ADR-type pair, the RDR-type label is specified."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Risk Medical Events", "text": "Because we are interested in acute ADRs, we limit our attention to only investigational events that are observed within one month of a medication being prescribed within DK. A month was chosen as an appropriate compromise to give the patient sufficient time to report the medical event without introducing an excessive amount of noise. Therefore, the medical risk events of Dk (RMEDk) for a drug family Dk are defined as the aggregate of all medical events observed in at least three patients within one month of a drug being prescribed within DK. We have chosen to add a limit of three or more patients experiencing the potential ADR as it is difficult to determine whether a medical event is an ADR if it is experienced by fewer than three patients."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Generating Features", "text": "In fact, it is so that the majority of them are able to survive themselves, without there being a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which there is a process in which"}, {"heading": "3.1.3 Random Forest Classifier", "text": "A random forest is a monitored classifier. The task of monitored learning is to use the training data to learn a mapping between the trait vector and the class. This mapping can then be used to predict the class for invisible data. Random forest is known as an ensemble classifier because it combines weak and diverse classifiers. Any random classifier is a decision tree that uses a subset of the available characteristics (e.g. the simple design study Measures of Association) to predict the class (ADR or non-ADR). The advantage of random forest classifier is that it can have characteristics that are both discrete and continuous and do not require the characteristics to be pre-processed (e.g. centered and scaled). The parameter of the random forest that needs to be selected is the number of characteristics that each decision tree can use, this is referred to as mtry."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Creating the Reference Set", "text": "Medical events listed as adverse events on the BNF website or on the medical event list the occurrence of an adverse event or medical event known to cause candididiasis, as antibiotics are known to cause it.

Likewise, the number of false negatives (FN) is the number of pairs that correspond to the ADRs, but the method classes are classified as non-ADRs, and the number of true negatives (TN) is the number of pairs that correspond to the non-ADRs, and the method classes are classified as non-ADRs.
