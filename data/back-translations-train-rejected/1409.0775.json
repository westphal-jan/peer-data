ADRs are one of most common causes to withdraw some drugs from market. Prescription event monitoring (PEM) is an important approach to detect the adverse drug reactions. The main problem to deal with this method is how to automatically extract the medical events or side effects from high-throughput medical events, which are collected from day to day clinical practice. In this study we propose a novel concept of feature matrix to detect the ADRs. Feature matrix, which is extracted from big medical data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database, is created to characterize the medical events for the patients who take drugs. Feature matrix builds the foundation for the irregular and big medical data. Then feature selection methods are performed on feature matrix to detect the significant features. Finally the ADRs can be located based on the significant features. The experiments are carried out on three drugs: Atorvastatin, Alendronate, and Metoclopramide. Major side effects for each drug are detected and better performance is achieved compared to other computerized methods. The detected ADRs are based on computerized methods, further investigation is needed.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 16:25:58 GMT  (337kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0775v1", "International Journal of Information Technology and Computer Science (IJITCS), in print, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Information Technology and Computer Science (IJITCS), in print, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["yihui liu", "uwe aickelin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.0775"}, "pdf": {"name": "1409.0775.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Feature Selection in Detection of Adverse Drug Reactions from the Health Improvement Network (THIN) Database", "authors": ["Yihui Liu", "Uwe Aickelin"], "emails": ["yxl@qlu.edu.cn", "uwe.aickelin@nottingham.ac.uk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The main problem in dealing with this method is how to automatically extract the medical events or adverse events from high-throughput medical events that are collected day-to-day in clinical practice.

Introduction", "text": "The two main methods of detecting ADRs are the Spontaneous Reporting System (SRS) [2-5] and the Monitoring of Medicines with Prescription Drugs (PEM) [6-10]. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a signal for detecting ADRs as \"all reported information on a possible causal link between an adverse event and a drug.\" [11] The Spontaneous Reporting System uses many machine learning methods to detect ADRs, such as trust in the distribution of medicines (BCPNN)."}, {"heading": "2. Feature matrix", "text": "Typically, patients take medications for different periods of time and have a different number of repetitive prescriptions. The longer the period, the more medical events relate to the drug. Presenting the high-throughput data related to prescriptions and medical events is a critical step in recognizing the ADRs. The feature matrix forms the basis for storing data and comparing data. In this study, two types of feature matrix are created based on medical events, the Level 1-5 readcodes and Level 1-3 readcodes, respectively. The medical events that use Level 1-3 readcodes define the general term, while those that use Level 1-5 readcodes provide more detailed descriptions."}, {"heading": "2.1 The THIN database", "text": "The Health Improvement Network (THIN) is a collaborative product between two companies of EPIC and InPS. EPIC is a research organization that provides the electronic database of patient records from the United Kingdom and other countries. InPS develops and continues to provide the widely used computer system of general practice Vision. The anonymized patient data is regularly collected without interruption from the Vision practice clinical system and sent to EPIC, which delivers the THIN data to researchers for study. Research studies for publication with THIN data are approved by a state-approved ethics committee, which also approved the data collection scheme. There are \"Therapy\" and \"Medical\" databases in THIN data. The \"Therapy Database\" contains the details of prescriptions issued to patients. Information about patients and the date of prescription for the drug can be obtained. The \"Medical\" database contains a record of symptoms, diagnoses and interventions made by the physician and / or primary care team, together with a record of the patient's symptoms, each of their symptoms or a record of their symptoms."}, {"heading": "2.2 Readcodes and feature matrix", "text": "There are 103387 types of medical events in the database \"Readcodes.\" The Read Codes (GP) used in general practice were invented and developed in 1982 by Dr. James Read. The NHS (National Health Service) has expanded the codes to cover all areas of clinical practice. The code is hierarchically from left to right or from level 1 to level 5. It means that it provides more detailed information from level 1 to level 5. Table 1 shows the medical symptoms based on readcodes at level 3 and level 5. \"Other soft tissue visitor sorters\" is a general description with readcodes at level 3. \"Foot pain,\" \"heel pain,\" etc. provide more details with readcodes at level 5. \"Other extrapyramidal diseases and abnormal movement disorders at level 5\" is the general term \"Readbudes,\" \"Essential and other specified forms of tremor,\" etc., are detailed descriptions of medications at level 5. \""}, {"heading": "2.3 The extraction of feature matrix", "text": "To detect the ADRs of the drugs, the first feature matrix is extracted from the THIN database = = describes the medical events that patients experience before or after taking drugs. \u00b7 Then, the Student T-Test and Wilcoxon Ranking Selection Methods are performed to select the significant features from the feature matrix that contains thousands of medical events. Figure 1 shows the process of detecting the feature matrix ADRs. (Figure 2) The feature matrix B is one after taking drugs. For repeated prescriptions, all medical events related to each patient prescription are entered to build the feature matrix. If the interval between two adjacent prescriptions is less than 60 days, we put all medical events between two adjacent patients into feature matrix."}, {"heading": "3. Feature selection", "text": "After obtaining two characteristic matrices representing the medical events before and after medication intake, feature selection methods are used to identify the significant characteristics that reflect the significant changes. Characteristic selection methods usually have two classes. One class is \"wrapper methods,\" which select characteristic subgroups based on the classification performance, such as the genetic algorithm [22, 23]. Another class is filter methods, which select characteristics based on the discrimination criterion between classes, which determine the ranking order and are not involved in the classification performance in the process of trait selection, such as the Studentic t test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Obviously, in this study, it is not the classification problem. The main idea is to find out which medical event significantly changes and to name its ranking in the process of trait selection. We apply characteristic selection test to the Students \"Normal Assumption, also based on the Wilcoxon Test and the Students\" Normal Assumption."}, {"heading": "3.1 Student\u2019s t-test", "text": "The student's t-test is a type of statistical hypotheses test based on a normal distribution and used to measure the difference between two types of samples, from which the student's t-test calculates a score to measure the difference between attribute matrix X and Y, representing the significance of a medical event or ADRs between all patient groups.The student's t-test is defined as: yyyyxxjyyyyMSMSyx t22 + \u2212 = nj,..., 2.1 = (5), where jx and jy represent the mean values of two groups of samples, xjS and yjS represent the standard deviations of two groups. xM and yM represent the number of two groups of samples."}, {"heading": "3.2 Wilcoxon rank-sum test", "text": "The t-test of the student assumes that the data follow a normal distribution. If no assumption can be made about the shape of the population distribution, non-parametric statistical methods can be used. The Wilcoxon rank sum test is a non-parametric analogy to the t-test of the student for two independent samples. It is used to determine the equality of the averages of two non-normal samples. The test is based on the rank of the individual data within the attribute matrix. As it is based on rank-transformed data, it is also a robust choice for detecting significant medical symptoms. In this test, the ranking of the data is performed first by assigning the highest rank to the attribute with the highest value (equal number of characteristics) and the lowest rank to the attribute with the lowest value."}, {"heading": "3.3 Other parameters", "text": "Variable 2R represents the ratio of the number of patients after taking the drug to the number of the total population displaying a particular medical symptom; variables 1R and 2R are defined as follows: = 3; 0; 0 1BABBANifNNifN NR (6) NNR A / 2 = where BN and AN represent the number of patients before or after taking medications for a particular medical event; variable N represents the number of total population taking medications.We compare our proposed method with published results in [19].

Experiments and results", "text": "Three medications of atorvastatin, alendronate and metoclopramide are used to test our proposed method using 20 GPs data in the THIN database. Atorvastatin belongs to the class of \"statins\" and has the particular \"muscle pain\" side effects. For the drug of alendronate, \"temporomandibular joint disease\" is a typical side effect. Metoclopramide has the typical side effects of \"extrapyramidal effects\" or \"abnormal movement disorders.\" Therefore, three medicines with different typical ADRs will be used in this study to test our proposed method. Jin et al. also use the medicines of atorvastatin and alendronate to test their proposed methods of MUTARA and HUNT [18,19]. The t-test of the student and Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be performed to select the significant features of the medicines after detailed changes in the disease characteristics of the matrix show the disease characteristics."}, {"heading": "4.1 Atorvastatin", "text": "In fact, it is in such a way that most of them are able to survive themselves if they go into another world, in which they go into another world, in which they do not go into another world, in which they do not go into another world, in which they do not go into another world, but into another world in which they move.

Discussion", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Feature matrix", "text": "In this research, we propose the novel concept of the characteristic matrix. For the medical data collected from day to day in clinical practice, it is an irregular and generous data. Each patient has different medical information. Even for the same medicine, different patients have taken medications at different times and periods of time and have different medical symptoms. How to extract the useful information after patients take medications is the first and most important step in detecting the adverse drug reactions. A novel concept of the characteristic matrix is proposed to store and characterize the common information that deals only with symptoms before and after taking medications for patients. For each medication, the appropriate characteristic matrix is built to cover all symptoms or medical events that occurred before or after taking the medication for all patients. The characteristic matrix transfers the non-related information of the different patients to common memory and forms the basis for detecting the adverse drug reactions for all patients."}, {"heading": "5.2 Feature selection and the performance", "text": "In this research, we compare our proposed methods with the published results in [19]. Their proposed methods do not detect significant side effects of muscle pain and sore muscles. Equal evaluation standards are used in our research. Our proposed methods are based on extracted traits and characteristics that achieve good results. For medicines, atovastatin and alendronate are detected and 100% and 85% accuracy are achieved.

If the methods detect the ADRs only on the frequency of drug occurrence, there is never enough data to support the hypothesis of a causal relationship between the drug and the reaction. The rare ADRs of \"Temporomandibular Joint Disease\" for the drug Alendronate and \"Extrapyramidal Disease and Abnormal Motion Disorders\" for the drug Metoclopramide are not sufficient to support the hypothesis of a causal relationship between the drug and the reaction."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "In this study, we propose a new method for successfully detecting ADRs by introducing feature matrix and feature selection to detect significant changes after drug intake. A feature matrix that characterizes medical events prior to drug intake or after drug intake is created from the THIN Database. Feature matrix translates the irregular and high-throughput medical data collected daily into feature matrix of the standard memory format and is a basis for performing feature selection methods. Feature selection methods based on the Study t Test and Wilcoxon Ranking Test are used to detect the significant features from the high-dimensional feature matrix. Significant ADRs that correspond to significant features are detected. Experiments are performed with three drugs: atorvatin, Aldratin-based metlomide, and other tests are required."}], "references": [{"title": "Adverse drug reactions: role of pharmacogenomics", "author": ["G.

ADRs are one of most common causes to withdraw some drugs from market. Prescription event monitoring (PEM) is an important approach to detect the adverse drug reactions. The main problem to deal with this method is how to automatically extract the medical events or side effects from high-throughput medical events, which are collected from day to day clinical practice. In this study we propose a novel concept of feature matrix to detect the ADRs. Feature matrix, which is extracted from big medical data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database, is created to characterize the medical events for the patients who take drugs. Feature matrix builds the foundation for the irregular and big medical data. Then feature selection methods are performed on feature matrix to detect the significant features. Finally the ADRs can be located based on the significant features. The experiments are carried out on three drugs: Atorvastatin, Alendronate, and Metoclopramide. Major side effects for each drug are detected and better performance is achieved compared to other computerized methods. The detected ADRs are based on computerized methods, further investigation is needed.", "creator": "PrimoPDF http://www.primopdf.com"}}}
