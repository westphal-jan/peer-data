Great efforts have been made in the last century to find new metrics and similarities to satisfy the needs of different applications."}, {"heading": "2. Material and Methods", "text": "There are 3 problems related to Eq (1), which are: 1- It cannot be handled correctly with points that have 0 values. (Example: If Ai is equal to 0, then the distance between 0 and any other positive non-value is 1, no matter how large or small this value is. 2- The distance between 0 and 0 is not defined. 3- In addition, the distance is not well defined in points with negative values. 10 (8) The distance between -1 and -2 is equal to the distance between 1 and 2 is 0.5. This essay represents a new similarity measurement based on Equation (1) to solve all the above problems.

Discussions", "text": "As shown in Table 2, the proposed distance has achieved good results that exceed the other distances in 10 datasets, and the overall average accuracy is the best of all the distances tested. As expected, the lowest accuracies were recorded by Eq (1) due to the problems with Eq (1) already mentioned. For example, the accuracy of Eq (1) on Vowel, Segments and Waveform40 are 7.30%, 14.20% and 38.10%. The reason for this low performance is due to the data used on these datasets, which contain real numbers, see Table 1), while Eq (1) is not well defined in negative values. Eq (1) is also low performance on other datasets, such as Glass, Monkey1 and Heart, with accuracy of 35.80%, 47.50% and 49.80%. This is justified by the number of zeros."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements:", "text": "The author would like to thank both Professor Christopher Farah of the University of Maine and Fausto Galetto, ex-Professor of Industrial Quality Management at Politecnico di Torino, for their valuable discussions and comments that have enriched this work."}, {"heading": "Corresponding Author:", "text": "Dr. Ahmad Basheer Hassanat IT Department Mutah University, Mutah - Karak, Jordan, E-mail: ahmad.hassanat @ gmail.com"}], "references": [{"title": "A Comparative Study for Comparing Two Feature Extraction Methods and Two Classifiers in Classification of Earlystage Lung Cancer Diagnosis of chest x-ray images.", "author": ["Al Gindi", "Amal M", "Tawfik A Attiatalla", "Moustafa M Sami"], "venue": "J Am Sci 10,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Performance Evaluation of Distance Metrics: Application to Fingerprint Recognition.", "author": ["Bharkad", "Sangita D", "Manesh Kokare"], "venue": "International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence 25,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Comparing Distance Measures with Visual Methods.", "author": ["Bonet", "Isis", "Abdel Rodr\u00edguez", "Ricardo Grau", "Maria M Garc\u00eda", "Yvan Saez", "Ann Now\u00e9"], "venue": "7th Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence,.
