In particular, we consider the complexity of finding an alignment that has a significant overlap with an optimal alignment. We discuss ways of representing the solution for the general weighted sentence alignment as well as phrases-to-words alignment problem, and show that computing a string which agrees with the optimal sentence partition on more than half (plus an arbitrarily small polynomial fraction) positions for the phrases-to-words alignment is NP-hard. For the general weighted sentence alignment we obtain such bound from the agreement on a little over 2/3 of the bits.

We show that for PWSA, even if the weight function is limited to {0, 1} values, an alignment is calculated that matches an optimum of at least n / 2 + n, links are NP hard, where n is the length of the source sentence. Moreover, the hardness stems from the problem of partitioning the source sentence into phrases: We show how to modify the NP hardness proof so that the optimal alignment can be recovered directly from such a partition. Specifically, we define a compact solution representation for this problem to be a binary string that encloses the positions of the phrase boundaries, and show that the optimum alignment of a partition can be retrieved so that the hardness of such a partition can be changed."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this case, it is only possible for each word in a sentence (in both sentences) to occur in exactly one sentence (here we treat each word as a separate word); a weighting function is triggered if each word has a series of links, so that each word (in both sentences) occurs in exactly one sentence (here we treat each word as a separate word); a weighting function is triggered if each word has a weighting; an overall weighting of a link (a) is a product of the weighting of its links."}, {"heading": "2.1 Defining a natural witness for WSA", "text": "Before we talk about the structural approximation of ESC, we must define what is meant by the testimony (or possible solution), it is a reduction to the ESC problem. Here, we will consider an arrangement of any weight to be a practicable solution; the question remains how to represent an approximation when the block is linked to the ith-word of e with the kth-word of e. Thus, each connection becomes a rectangular all-one block in the matrix. This representation is not the most efficient in space, although it is convenient for visualizing the solution. In particular, for the instances coming from the 3SAT, each practicable solution will have only 3m cells (m + n)."}, {"heading": "3 Edit distance inapproximability", "text": "It is a question of whether it is a \"yes,\" a \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"no,\" \"\", \"\" \",\" \"\", \"\" \",\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\", \"\" \",\" \"\" \",\" \"\", \"\" \",\" \",\" \"\" \",\" \",\" \"\", \"\" \",\" \"\" \",\" \"\", \"\" \",\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \",\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\", \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \",\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \""}, {"heading": "4 Hamming distance and edit distance inapproximability of PWSA and WSA", "text": "In this area, we will not be able to take a series of measures that will affect the resolution of the crisis.
