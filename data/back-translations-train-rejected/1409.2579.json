Recently, a rapid implementation of the linear zero discrimination analysis method using random matrix multiplication with scatter matrices has been proposed. However, if the random matrix is chosen arbitrarily, the orientation matrix may be insufficient and some useful discriminatory information may be lost. In this paper, we will examine how to correctly select the random matrix so that the two criteria of the zero LDA method are theoretically fulfilled.

However, a major disadvantage of the LDA is that the so-called total scatter matrix must be meaningless. In fact, in many applications scatter matrix reduction is unique since the thedata class, and thus usually the number of data samples is much smaller than the data dimension. This is the well-known small sample size (SSS) or the minor problem (Fukunaga, 1990).Let X = [xxx1, x2,."}, {"heading": "2 The main result", "text": "Since the nth vectors (x) ni = 1 are linearly independent, and the orientation matrix W = 1 is necessary to be of the full column count in the zero LDA method, in this thesis we focus on how to get Y \u2212 Rd \u2212 (c \u2212 1) (from rank c \u2212 1) to (1,4), so rank (W) = 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 2 in (Sharma et al., 2012).LetST = U1 \u2212 2 UT = [U1, U2] [UT1 UT2] the eigenvalue decomposition of ST, where U1 - Rd \u00b7 (n \u2212 1) corresponds to the range of ST, U2 - Rd \u00b7 (d \u2212 n + 1) corresponds to the zero space of ST, and we use it 1 - R (n \u2212 1)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The first author is supported by the Postgraduate Innovation Project of Jiangsu Province with the grant CXLX13 968, the second author is supported by the National Science Foundation of China with the grant 11371176, the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province with the grant BK20131126, the 333 Project of Jiangsu Province and the Talent Introduction Program of China University of Mining and Technology.
