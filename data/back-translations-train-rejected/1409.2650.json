BACKGROUND", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Genetic algorithm", "text": "A genetic algorithm is a kind of search algorithm. It seeks a space for an optimal solution to a problem. The main feature of the genetic algorithm is the way in which the search is carried out. The algorithm creates a \"population\" of possible solutions to the problem and lets it \"develop\" over several generations in order to find better and better solutions. Population is the collection of candidate solutions that we consider over the course of the algorithm. Over the generations of the algorithm, new members are \"born\" into the population, while others \"die\" from the population. A single solution in the population is called an individual. An individual's fitness function is a measure of how \"good\" the solution is that represents the individual. The better the solution, the higher the fitness - obviously this depends on the problem to be solved. The selection process corresponds to the survival of the individual in the natural world. Individuals are selected for \"breeding\" (or crossing) the solution that brings together the two individuals, each of whom they are placed in their own position - the two of the water."}, {"heading": "2.2. Related works", "text": "Different types of timetable problems appear in relation to educational institutions and depend on the elements that are planned, i.e. exams or regular courses. An excellent overview of the exam time techniques is given in Qu et al. [8]. The exam timetable is similar in most institutions and consists of scheduling the exams for a number of courses, over a limited period of time, while avoiding the duplication of exams for each student, as well as finding the largest dispersion over the exam period [9].However, the course timetable differs in relation to the institution, i.e. universities, schools. A course timetable problem essentially deals with the effective distribution of five types of units (or resources): spaces, courses, teachers, students and time (days and hours).In university timetables, the problem presents a large number of restrictions that need to be met."}, {"heading": "3. THE AHP/GA PROCESS AND PROBLEM DESCRIPTION", "text": "A common classical definition of GA fitness function, as set out in previous work [13, 14, 15, 16], takes into account the time conflict. Therefore, our AHP / GA approach assumes that the time conflict has already been resolved by using one of the aforementioned fitness functions. Our concern is to look at teacher preferences in such a way that a workable solution is the one that satisfies most of these preferences. The AHP / GA process is practically comprised of two functions: the conflict function and the satisfaction function. First, AHP is used to calculate the score of each teacher resulting from a set of information given according to the valuable criteria of the institution. This score is considered to be one of the GA input. GA's fitness function consists practically of two functions: the conflict function and the satisfaction function. A workable solution should be confirmed by both functions; however, we omit the process used by the conflict function, as it may be the same as in a previously mentioned work by the teacher to verify the satisfaction function of the parameter that the GA has the satisfaction function of the teacher."}, {"heading": "Description of a school TTP", "text": "In this paper we will find only an informal description of our approach to simplify the schedule, and the presentation of its solution later we will consider the following simple TTP models: \u2022 The school is only open 3 days a week, i.e. it has 12 sessions a week, and they are only 4 sessions a week. \u2022 The school has 2 sessions a week."}, {"heading": "4.

CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper represents a new approach that addresses teacher preferences while simultaneously creating the timetable of a school curriculum. Our approach is to integrate a satisfaction function into the genetic algorithm. The parameters of the satisfaction function are teacher stress and a set of results calculated based on the analytical hierarchy process. The key point of the satisfaction function in the calculation of results is the paired comparison of a number of teacher criteria. Consequently, the new approach is a combination of AHP and GA, and it leads to a new methodology for solving the timetable problem that we call AHP / GA. In this paper, we present an informal description of our AHP / GA approach. The formal description and implementation of the process are perspective. In addition, we must review our contribution by applying the implemented AHP / GA to various case studies in Lebanese schools."}, {"heading": "Authors", "text": "Ihab Sbeity, the lead author, is Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Faculty of Sciences of the Lebanese University.

This paper is intended to solve the problem of satisfying the teachers\u2019 preferred schedule in a way that regards the importance of the teacher to the supervising institute, i.e. his score according to some criteria. Genetic algorithm (GA) has been presented as an elegant method in solving timetable problem (TTP) in order to produce solutions with no conflict. In this paper, we consider the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to efficiently obtain a score for each teacher, and consequently produce a GA-based TTP solution that satisfies most of the teachers\u2019 preferences.", "creator": "Microsoft Office Word"}}}
