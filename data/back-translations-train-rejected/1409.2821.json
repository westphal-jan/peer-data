However, the accuracy of FCM is subject to false detections caused by noisy records, weak feature selection and low certainty of the algorithm in some cases. The false detections are very important in some decision-making application domains like network security and medical diagnosis, where weak decisions based on such false detections may lead to catastrophic outcomes. They are mainly emerged from making decisions about a subset of records that do not provide enough evidence to make a good decision. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting such ambiguous records in FCM by introducing a certainty factor to decrease invalid detections. This approach enables us to send the detected ambiguous records to another discrimination method for a deeper investigation, thus increasing the accuracy by lowering the error rate. Most of the records are still processed quickly and with low error rate which prevents performance loss compared to similar hybrid methods.

Classical K-Means clustering assigns each data set exactly to one cluster. In contrast, FCM Clustering uses fuzzy sets to group a database of N objects into a set of K clusters in such a way that each sample can belong to more than one cluster, with possibly varying degrees of membership in each cluster. Therefore, it groups the data sets with varying degrees of membership, even if there is a lack of security. [2] The basic idea of the FCM algorithm is based on obtaining a collection of n-dimensional data sets as input and trying to minimize the objective function represented in Equation (1) to assign the data sets to clusters [2]: The main idea of the FCM algorithm is based on obtaining n-dimensional data sets as input and each sample is a partition matrix assigning the degree."}, {"heading": "3.2 Ambiguity in clustering algorithms", "text": "In some cases, it is very difficult to determine the real clusters with the given attributes of the samples or with specific algorithms. Let's look at two adjacent, cracking clusters in a two-dimensional space with a common boundary. What happens if we have a sample at that boundary? Using current methods, the algorithm tries to assign that sample (s) to either the most relevant clusters in a fuzzy cluster or a random cluster in a non-fuzzy cluster. Figure 1 illustrates the fuzzy case. Two fuzzy clusters exist and the space in between is where records cannot be assigned to a particular cluster with sufficient certainty, i.e. as safe as the nucleus of the clusters. We refer to the space between clusters as \"ambiguous space.\" It can be observed that if a sample lies here, the exact cluster to which that sample belongs cannot be determined with the same accuracy as the nucleus of the cluster."}, {"heading": "3.3 The proposed AD-FCM method", "text": "As discussed in Section 1, one of the biggest challenges in clustering is the lack of certainty in distinguishing between ambiguous and unambiguous samples. In this section, we present the design of the AD-FCM, which aims to deal with the ambiguity that exists in fuzzy clustering. AD-FCM is a preprint submitted to Elsevier on May 24, 2014 (rev.) to provide more accuracy than existing methods, but unlike hybrid techniques with little or no negative impact on processing time. This is achieved through a two-step clustering approach. In the first step, most data samples are clustered with high accuracy and speed. In the second step, the ambiguous data sets are sent for further processing, which preserves the advantages of hybrid algorithms but avoids their extensive time consumption. The proposed clustering algorithm with ambiguous data sets is described below."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 The Bayes\u2019 theorem and certainty factor", "text": "Considering an input dataset R, it is useful to determine the certainty of a given hypothesis or the best hypothesis about R from outer space H. In other words, the Bayes theorem makes it possible to calculate the probability of the hypothesis itself based on its previous probability, the probabilities of other different datasets and different hypotheses, and the dataset observed. Let's introduce some notations for a better description of the concept. We assume that P (h) is the initial probability that holds the hypothesis h. For a given cluster C, P (h) is calculated as the average of the membership values of all datasets in that cluster. Furthermore, to calculate the validity of this value based on R's membership in clusters other than C, we need to add the degree of dependence of the datasets on them."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 The general process of AD-FCM", "text": "An overall process of our proposed AD-FCM method is represented in Fig. 2. It starts with a base FCM clustering = > 1.2 membership and then performs the additional processing required to detect the ambiguous data sets. A pseudo code is also given to explain the detailed steps to calculate the certainty factor as shown in Fig. 3. The proposed AD-FCM algorithm begins by specifying the certainty threshold that will determine the boundary between the unique data sets (accepted by the clusters) and the ambiguous data sets. In line 2, the input data is computed by the FCM and then in lines 3 to 6 the matrix P, which is the probability matrix that will be computed. Row 7 begins the loop for each data set to calculate the maximum relevant cluster in line 8. Then, in line 10 to 13, the score is computed which we calculate the formula as shown in Equation 4 (the relevant matrix is computed)."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results", "text": "In this section, the proposed AD-FCM cluster method is evaluated using four sets of data: the well-known KDD99 dataset for network intruder detection systems (IDS), Pima Indian's diabetes as a medical dataset, the semantic image segmentation benchmark, and finally the MSR GPS Privacy mobile user location dataset to evaluate the impact of noise on basic FCM and AD-FCM. The similarity of the first two datasets is that both have a large normal class and one or more abnormal classes, which are insignificant and sometimes unpredictable, and therefore difficult to learn by learning algorithms. In detecting intruders, the goal is to distinguish intruders from normal traffic. The general approach is to detect abnormal traffic that may never have been seen before. Learning methods, due to their processing times and inability to detect invisible patterns, may not help identify intruders from normal traffic."}, {"heading": "4.1 AD-FCM for intrusion detection", "text": "One of the biggest challenges with IDS is the trade-off between calculating and maintaining system security. In most IDS scenarios, the packets cannot be examined in depth. Nowadays, algorithms examine the packets almost carelessly and superficially to facilitate heavy calculations [1, 3, 4, 6], and this is an unsolved problem [2, 5]. The proposed AD-FCM method is applied to IDS data to show that, unlike existing methods, it can offer both advantages, a speed normally associated with simple learning methods, and a high accuracy that requires hybrid methods."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Data preprocessing and feature selection", "text": "In general, a small and optimal subset of characteristics is required, otherwise the learning algorithm will be misled or overloaded.

The results of these experiments are also presented in Figure 5.Threshold, which was submitted to Elsevier on May 24th, 2014. (rev.) As shown in Figure 6, by increasing the safety threshold, the number of ambiguous data sets will increase and the ratio of misclustered data sets will decrease.

Fig. 9 also shows the effect of the safety threshold for another classic photo. In Fig. 10 (b), which shows the basic FCM, too many details are discarded, as opposed to Fig. 10 (c), which shows the AD-FCM result with a safety threshold of 0.4, and the weed is easily detected by determining the ambiguous threshold.

Hoh et al. [33] propose K-means to determine the most visited places of the user such as home, work and hobbies. One of the methods to achieve privacy is to send \"loud\" queries so that the intruder is confused [34]. Here, we use the MSR GPS dataset 2009 [35] and extract the center of the clusters with that of Hoh et al. Then we add loud queries to the dataset and extract the center of the clusters with FCM and AD-FCM and then calculate the sum of errors, which is the distance between the real centers and extracted centers. Table 10 shows the results of this experiment and the comparison of both algorithms. The results are calculated by the sum of errors for five different users, after they are added noise and the places are calculated with M-security, and the important users with M-security."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In the current study, we demonstrated that the accuracy of fuzzy clustering is improved by focusing on the concept of ambiguous data. We proposed a method for separating ambiguous output records that cannot be clustered with high certainty using existing methods, and this approach enables us to increase the accuracy of the algorithm. We evaluated this method using four known data sets in four different areas of detection of network intruders, medical diagnosis, image segmentation and additional noise for privacy in the location dataset. Results show that separating ambiguous data sets significantly reduces the error rate: 41% decrease in error rate (from 34 to 20) for the Pima dataset and 81.57% decrease in error rate (from 3.8 to 0.7) for the IDS KDD99 and up to 50% for noisy queries added to the MSR. Also, image segmentation showed that more details of photos can be examined by highlighting the ambiguous areas that can be used as a basis for this improvement."}], "references": [{"title": "Algorithm AS 136: A k-means clustering algorithm, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society", "author": ["J.A.

providing more flexibility than non-fuzzy clustering methods. However, the accuracy of FCM is subject to false detections caused by noisy records, weak feature selection and low certainty of the algorithm in some cases. The false detections are very important in some decision-making application domains like network security and medical diagnosis, where weak decisions based on such false detections may lead to catastrophic outcomes. They are mainly emerged from making decisions about a subset of records that do not provide enough evidence to make a good decision. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting such ambiguous records in FCM by introducing a certainty factor to decrease invalid detections. This approach enables us to send the detected ambiguous records to another discrimination method for a deeper investigation, thus increasing the accuracy by lowering the error rate. Most of the records are still processed quickly and with low error rate which prevents performance loss compared to similar hybrid methods. Experimental results of applying the proposed method on several datasets from different domains show a significant decrease in error rate as well as improved sensitivity of the algorithm.", "creator": "PDFCreator Version 1.7.3"}}}
