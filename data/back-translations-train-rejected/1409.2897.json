This paper investigates the dynamics of co-adaptation, a process in which both the computer and the user are adapting their behaviors in order to improve the speed and accuracy of the communication through handwriting. We devised an information-theoretic framework for quantifying the efficiency of a handwriting system where the system includes both the user and the computer. Using this framework, we analyzed data collected from an adaptive handwriting recognition system and characterized the impact of machine adaptation and of human adaptation.

As handwriting varies considerably from person to person, it is difficult to design a handwriting recognition system that is good for all users. Modern handwriting recognition systems rely on machine learning techniques to adapt and specialize their handwriting models to each individual user. Generally, as the recognition mechanism adapts to the human user, it is likely that the user will also adapt to the system. We call this situation \"co-adaptation,\" in which humans and computers adapt to each other at the same time. In general, co-adaptation can manifest itself in any adaptive system. Designing a system that adapts to users is a problem of its own [1, 2, 3]. Our goal in this paper is not to address these challenges, but to focus on characterizing the effects of machine adaptation and human adaptation in the context of handwriting."}, {"heading": "HANDWRITING RECOGNITION AS A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL", "text": "In contrast to typing, which transmits information to the computer, the reciprocal points of time, the handwriting, are continuously transmitted to the two channels. (Q1) Handwriting is analyzed as a \"unit\" at a point in time when \"unit\" can be a catchword, a word, or even a sentence. In this work, we propose an alternative analysis in which the data is analyzed at fixed time intervals. We consider the process of writing as a process by which the intended letter is disambiguated from the other possible intention. We formalize this process using the concept of the communication channel [4]. Let's leave the set of all possible inputs as a set of sentences, a set of words, or a set of characters. Without losing generality, we assume that E is a set of 26 English characters."}, {"heading": "ADAPTIVE RECOGNITION ALGORITHM", "text": "We developed an adaptive handwriting recognition algorithm that maps for each time step t > font instance W1: t to a posterior distribution over E, which is referred to by Qfinal. Realising that the effect of user customisation is likely to be present, we designed our recognition algorithm to adapt not only to each individual user, but also to changes in the handwriting trajectory distribution P (W \u2212 M), which is unique to each user over time. The idea of specialising and adapting the recognition algorithm for each user has been studied and proved effective in reducing the error rate [6, 7, 8].At a high level, our adaptive recognition system can be outlined as follows. For each user, the system generates and maintains one or more character models for each character in E. We refer to each of these models as a prototype. Each prototype is basically a representative handwriting instance."}, {"heading": "Initial adaptation", "text": "The first adaptation is crucial for any intelligent system. It is undeniable that the performance of any well-behaved intelligent system increases as the system learns more about the user. If the first adaptation is bad, users may become frustrated with the system and stop using it even before it can fully adapt to it. We address the problem of initial adaptation by sharing data between different users. Typically, people have a similar handwriting, especially if they share the same educational culture. The process of initial adaptation can be described as follows. In the very first interaction with the user u, our system has no information about the user and therefore assigns a set of typical prototypes that have been trained on the basis of data from multiple users in the past. Specifically, the typical prototypes are the centroids of clusters, which by executing a cluster algorithm (k-means) refer back to a set of handwriting instances. We refer to this group of prototypes as P0."}, {"heading": "Decoding", "text": "Our decoding algorithm is based on the standard Bayean conclusion. For a trajectory W1: T and the current set of prototypes Pu, the algorithm calculates the distance from W1: t to each prototype in Pu for every 1 \u2264 t \u2264 T. The distances are then converted into a probability distribution Qt. As a transmission function we use e \u2212 x. If a single prediction is expected, the algorithm simply returns the prediction with the maximum probability."}, {"heading": "EXPERIMENT", "text": "The main objective of our experiment is to determine and quantify the effect of machine adaptation and human adaptation when users interact with the system over a period of time. We implemented the handwriting recognition system described in the section as an application on Apple's iOS platform. The application was presented to users as a writing game. However, in each session each participant was presented with a random permutation of the 26 lowercase English alphabets, i.e. E = [a. z] and P (M) is uniform. The aim of the game was to write the characters presented as quickly as possible and, more importantly, the handwritten characters should be recognized by the system. A score, which is the average channel rate of the session, was given to the user immediately after each session to reflect the performance of the session. There were 15 participants in this experiment. We asked them to play our game for at least 20 sessions at their own pace."}, {"heading": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "The average channel rates per session for both Radapt and Rfixed conditions are shown in Figure 3a and Figure 3b. In both conditions, the results show increases in channel rates over time, where the improvement appears to be greater in the early sessions than in the later sessions. Figure 3c shows the difference between Radapt and Rfixed, which corresponds to the channel rate of the system, if we ignore the effects of user adjustment. From the result, we observe that the effects of machine adjustment tapers after 10 sessions. Although the prototype is not in Rfixed, we observe that the channel rate increases over the sessions. To quantify our confidence in this increase, we perform the pairedt test to compare the difference between the average channel rate in the first 5 sessions and the last 5 sessions."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We presented an information theoretical framework for quantifying the information rate of a system that combines a human typewriter with a handwriting recognition system. Using the concept of channel rate, we investigated the effects of machine adaptation and human adaptation in an adaptive handwriting recognition system. We analysed the data collected from a small deployment of our adaptive handwriting recognition system and concluded that both machine adaptation and human adaptation have and must be significant effects on channel rate. This result led us to believe that for a handwriting recognition system to achieve the maximum channel rate, both machine adaptation and human adaptation are and must be present. Specifically, such a system should be able to adapt to the user while at the same time enabling the user to write or scribble with a simple hand movement, as improving the writing speed is essential to achieve a higher channel rate. In addition, the system should have a mechanism to recognise handwriting if it cannot provide feedback to the user."}], "references": [{"title": "Steps to take before intelligent user interfaces become real, Interacting with computers", "author": ["K.
