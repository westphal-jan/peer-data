Opinion Mining or Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing task that mines information from various text forms such as reviews, news, and blogs and classify them on the basis of their polarity as positive, negative or neutral. But, from the last few years, user content in Hindi language is also increasing at a rapid rate on the Web. So it is very important to perform opinion mining in Hindi language as well. In this paper a Hindi language opinion mining system is proposed. The system classifies the reviews as positive, negative and neutral for Hindi language.

EXPERIMENTS & RESULTS", "text": "The experiment is based on film reviews. Film reviews have been collected from several websites and contain Hindi ratings. Ratings have been used by us as input into the system that classifies these ratings and ascertains the polarity of these ratings and presents the aggregated positive and negative results that prove helpful to users. Entry ratings have also been classified by us to determine how well the system rates the ratings in comparison with human judgment. Three benchmarks are used to calculate system performance, namely: \u2022 Precision \u2022 Recall \u2022 Accuracy The common method for calculating these metrics is based on the confusion matrix in Table 1. International Journal on Computational Sciences & Applications (IJCSA) Vol.4, A \u2022 Accuracy is the percentage of all truly predicted instances versus the instance accuracy of 100% means that the predicted instances are exactly the same as the actual results of the system."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "Opinion Mining is an emerging field of research and this task is very important because people spend most of their time on the Web. In this paper, an approach is proposed to determine mood orientation, i.e. the polarity of Hindi reviews. Opinion Mining must be performed due to the increase in Hindi data on the Internet in Hindi language. Separate positive and negative summarized results are generated, which are helpful for the user in making decisions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach in this area works well and reaches the accuracy of 65%. In the future, work can be extended to Feature Base Opinion Mining in Hindi reviews by extracting the feature from these reviews, and to perform Opinion Mining in other Hindi areas."}], "references": [{"title": "Bandyopadhyay,(2010),\u201dSentiWordNet for Bangla", "author": ["S.A.
