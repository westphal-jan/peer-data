Departing from prior studies on crowdsourcing skyline and ranking queries, it considers the case where objects do not have explicit attributes and preference relations on objects are strict partial orders. The partial orders are derived by aggregating crowdsourcers' responses to pairwise comparison questions. The goal is to find all Pareto-optimal objects by the fewest possible questions. It employs an iterative question-selection framework. Guided by the principle of eagerly identifying non-Pareto optimal objects, the framework only chooses candidate questions which must satisfy three conditions. This design is both sufficient and efficient, as it is proven to find a short terminal question sequence. The framework is further steered by two ideas---macro-ordering and micro-ordering. By different micro-ordering heuristics, the framework is instantiated into several algorithms with varying power in pruning questions. Experiment results using both real crowdsourcing marketplace and simulations exhibited not only orders of magnitude reductions in questions when compared with a brute-force approach, but also close-to-optimal performance from the most efficient instantiation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Sep 2014 06:38:57 GMT  (539kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4161v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["abolfazl asudeh", "gensheng zhang", "naeemul hassan", "chengkai li", "gergely v zaruba"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.4161"}, "pdf": {"name": "1409.4161.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Crowdsourcing Pareto-Optimal Object Finding by Pairwise Comparisons", "authors": ["Abolfazl Asudeh", "Gensheng Zhang", "Naeemul Hassan", "Chengkai Li", "Gergely V.

RELATED WORK", "text": "This is the first work on crowdsourcing Pareto-optimal object finding. In addition, there are several recent studies on the use of crowdsourcing to arrange and answer objects by asking human workers to rate small subsets of objects. Davidson et al. [13] evaluates top-k and group comparisons by asking the crowd to answer questions (whether two objects belong to the same group) and to ask questions (such as the arrangement of two objects). Lofi et al. [8] answers skyline questions by asking the crowd to provide missing attributes. I summarize the similarities and differences between these studies and our work."}, {"heading": "III. GENERAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "The key to finding such objects is to maintain the preference relationships, i.e., the strict partial definitions of individual criteria. Towards this end, the most basic approach is to perform a pair-wise comparison - given a pair of objects x and y and a criterion c, to determine whether one is better than the other (i.e., (x, y). The problem of crowdsourcing Pareto-optimal object finding is thus essentially crowdsourcing pair-wise comparisons. Each comparison task between x and y is presented by criterion c to the mass as a question q (denoted x?).The result of the question (denoted rlt) is aggregated by the answers of the mass."}, {"heading": "A. Question Selection", "text": "The goal is to find a sequence as short as possible. (Figs. 3 and Alg.1 show that the frame is an iterative procedure of object division based on question results. \u2022 It can also be considered a process of moving objects from O? to O \u00b7 and O. \"Once an object is controlled by another object, it cannot be moved again. In relation to this process, we make two important observations, as follows. \u2022 In order not to declare an object x as Pareto-optimal, it is sufficient to know that x is controlled by another object. It immediately follows that we do not really care about the dominance relationship between objects in O and can therefore skip the comparisons between such objects. Once we know x, it will be dominated by another object, it cannot be pareto-optimal and will move directly to O x."}, {"heading": "B.

Fig.9 shows such a question. We required answers from 10 people for each form. Some people skipped various questions posed by the \"unsafe\" option in Fig.9. Finally, we collected at least 6 answers to each question. The results were derived by defining an equal number of questions (see Equation (1). Table V shows the number of questions allowed by different methods in this case study Fig.9, an average of over 30 executions.

finding, which has applications in public opinion collection, group decision making, and information exploration. Departing from prior studies on crowdsourcing skyline and ranking queries, it considers the case where objects do not have explicit attributes and preference relations on objects are strict partial orders. The partial orders are derived by aggregating crowdsourcers\u2019 responses to pairwise comparison questions. The goal is to find all Pareto-optimal objects by the fewest possible questions. It employs an iterative question-selection framework. Guided by the principle of eagerly identifying non-Pareto optimal objects, the framework only chooses candidate questions which must satisfy three conditions. This design is both sufficient and efficient, as it is proven to find a short terminal question sequence. The framework is further steered by two ideas\u2014macro-ordering and micro-ordering. By different micro-ordering heuristics, the framework is instantiated into several algorithms with varying power in pruning questions. Experiment results using both real crowdsourcing marketplace and simulations exhibited not only orders of magnitude reductions in questions when compared with a brute-force approach, but also close-to-optimal performance from the most efficient instantiation.", "creator": "gnuplot 4.6 patchlevel 3"}}}
