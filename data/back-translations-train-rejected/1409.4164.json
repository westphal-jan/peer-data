In order to construct such solutions, mediation brings more information and knowledge, and, if possible, resources to the negotiation table. The contribution of this paper is the automated mediation machinery which does that. It presents an argumentation-based mediation approach that extends the logic-based approach to argumentation-based negotiation involving BDI agents. The paper describes the mediation algorithm. For comparison it illustrates the method with a case study used in an earlier work. It demonstrates how the computational mediator can deal with realistic situations in which the negotiating agents would otherwise fail due to lack of knowledge and/or resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Sep 2014 07:14:37 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4164v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tomas trescak", "carles sierra", "simeon simoff", "ramon lopez de mantaras"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.4164"}, "pdf": {"name": "1409.4164.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Dispute Resolution Using Argumentation-Based Mediation", "authors": ["Tomas Trescak"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 140 9.41 64v1 [cs.AI] 15 Sep 2014"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction and Motivation", "text": "Dispute resolution is a complex process, depending on the willingness of the parties involved to reach a consensus when they are satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations, enabling them to achieve part or all of their objectives with the resources available. In many cases, such a negotiation depends on the search for alternative solutions, which requires in-depth knowledge of the subject matter at issue for sound reasoning; such information may not be available to the negotiating parties and negotiations may fail. Mediation, a less radical alternative to mediation, can help both parties reach an amicable agreement. [1] This paper presents an argument-based mediation system that builds on previous work in the area of argument-based negotiation. It is an extension of the work presented in [1] and focuses on issues where negotiations have stalled and had no solution.

[1] The authors use different contexts to represent different components of an agent architecture, and specify the interactions between them using the bridge rules between contexts. We briefly recall the components of the agent architecture within the ABN system [1] and add a new \"resource\" component for mediation purposes. Units are structural units that represent the main components of the architecture. There are four units within a multi-context BDI agent, namely: the communication unit and units for each of the beliefs, desires, and intentions. Bridge rules connect units that specify the internal agent architecture by determining their relationship. Three well-established groups of relationships for BDI agents have been identified in [30]: strong realism, weak realism, and realism."}, {"heading": "4 Mediation Algorithm", "text": "In a mediation process, both parties try to resolve their dispute by negotiating alternative solutions presented by a mediator. Such solutions are constructed using available knowledge and resources; mediator knowledge is considered private and is not shared with the other negotiating party; resources to obtain alternative solutions may be of high value to their owners or completely lacking; therefore, we suggest that the role of the mediator is to obtain sufficient knowledge and resources to be able to bring about a new solution; the mediator presents a possible solution for agents (in the form of an argument) who either do not approve or reject (attack); parties can negotiate a possible solution in order to reach a mutual agreement; below, we formally define the foundations of our algorithm.

Mediator \u00b5 owns a screwdriver and knows that a mirror can be hung with a screw and a screwdriver. The difference, for example, in [1] is that Mediator has the knowledge and resources needed to resolve the dispute, not the agents. This reflects the reality when customers seek advice from an expert to solve their problem.

Failure if the mediator cannot create a new solution and knowledge or new resources; the algorithm begins with the mediator gathering information about the dispute from both agents (GetKnowledge function); in the first round, the agents explain their goals, which become part of the mediator's beliefs: B: B\u00b5 (I\u03b1) (Can (hang image)))) (M.4), B: B\u00b5 (Can (hang) and the mediation of two (Can (hang mirror))."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "Mediation brings more information and knowledge to the negotiating table, so an automated mediator would need the machinery to do so. To solve this problem in an automated environment, we have presented an ABN approach that extends ABN's logical approach with BDI agents, as outlined in [1]. We have introduced a mediator into the multi-agent architecture that has extensive knowledge of mediation cases and access to resources, and the mediator proposes solutions that will become the subject of further negotiations if the conflicting parties cannot resolve the conflict on their own. We have described our mediation algorithm and illustrated it using the same case study presented in [1]. The presence of a mediator in ABN enables us to deal with realistic situations when negotiations stall. In this work, we assumed that the actors and the mediator operate within the same ontology and describe the negotiation area. In the real world, negotiators may interpret the same term differently."}], "references": [{"title": "Agents that reason and negotiate by arguing", "author": ["S. Parsons", "C. Sierra", "N.

The contribution of this paper is the automated mediation machinery which does that. It presents an argumentation-based mediation approach that extends the logic-based approach to argumentation-based negotiation involving BDI agents. The paper describes the mediation algorithm. For comparison it illustrates the method with a case study used in an earlier work. It demonstrates how the computational mediator can deal with realistic situations in which the negotiating agents would otherwise fail due to lack of knowledge and/or resources.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
