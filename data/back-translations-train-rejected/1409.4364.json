Language Representation", "text": "The Unicode hexadecimal range 0900 - 097F is used to render Sanskrit letters in Devan\u0101gar\u012b font. Characters used to render Sanskrit letters in English font are found in the Unicode ranges Basic Latin (0000-007F), Latin-1 Supplement (0080-00FF), Latin Extended-A (0100-017F) and Latin Extended Additional (1E00 - 1EFF). The Latin character set was used in this thesis to render Sanskrit letters as e-text. Therefore, the scheme presented and the algorithms do not use Devan\u0101gar\u012b font. To use the algorithms for text in Devan\u0101gar\u012b font, the text must first be converted to Latin text."}, {"heading": "B. Terminology", "text": "The terminology used in this work for certain groups of letters in the Sanskrit alphabet is derived from Table 1.and is known for its mathematical precision, although it deals with the nuances of the language at various levels such as morphology, syntax, semantics, phonology and pragmatics.Due to the cryptic nature of the A\u1e63\u0101nta-kaumud\u012b [1] and K\u0101\u015bik\u0101 [2], one or more commentaries are required to gain a clear understanding of its content.The current work deals with P\u0101\u1e47ini's sandhi-related aphorisms using the recognized Commentaries, Siddh\u0101nta-kaumud\u012b [1] and K\u0101\u015bik\u0101 [2].Both commentaries are accepted by Sanskrit scholars as authoritative works on P\u0101\u1e47ini's sandhi-related grammatics.P\u0101\u1e47ini's statements on grammatical rules are expressed only on the basis of the M\u0101hev\u015b\u016btra-5th S\u0101ph\u0101tras or the Aph\u0101va-3th Aph\u012bva-S\u012bva-Halortha-14th."}, {"heading": "A. The Approach", "text": "The present work is based on earlier work by the authors, in which P\u0101\u1e47ini's rules are codified in a novel way by binary representations. [4] The unique data representation conceived by the authors has been further refined in this work, and consonant-based, visarga-based Sandhi rules as well as some specific Sandhi rules have been incorporated into this work. Rule representation has been simplified to minimal binary set-unset operations. Furthermore, the S\u016btra order has been carried out after gaining a thorough understanding of the workings of P\u0101\u1e47ini's sandhi-related aphorisms. As such, this work represents a significant extension, refinement and completion of the earlier work of the authors. Furthermore, it provides a clear understanding of the rules for Sandhi laid down by P\u0101\u1e47ini in a comprehensive and simplified way that has not previously been found in the literature."}, {"heading": "B.

The letters are used to represent special conditions that relate to an entire word or a sequence of letters involved in the sequence of letters.
