In this paper, a series of experiments using prevailing machine learning techniques are presented to build models for predicting the day of the week, using the weather data for that particular day, i.e. temperature, wind, rain, etc., and testing its reliability in four cities in Australia (Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart).

Introduction", "text": "Weather is perhaps the most common natural phenomenon affecting a large proportion of the human population on a daily basis. Given the large number of variables that can contribute to the overall nature of a given location, it is quite difficult to accurately predict the weather on a given day and day of the week based on the weather conditions given. In our experiments, we train our classifiers on the basis of historical data: 1. Predicting the day of the week (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sa, Sun) by analysing the given weather conditions for that day, including temperature, rain, wind and season. 2. Predicting the weather conditions for a given day, i.e. the probability of rain, wind and temperature ranges. 3. Test the robustness of these models by applying them to different cities in Australia and compare their results."}, {"heading": "2. Classifiers", "text": "The following classification algorithms were used to create predictive models to perform the experiments: Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) Classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier based on Bayes \"theorem of strong (na\u00efve) assumptions of independence, i.e. the classifier assumes that the presence (or absence) of a particular characteristic of a class has nothing to do with the presence (or absence) of any other characteristic, as the class variable. It is easy to build and quick to make decisions. It efficiently adapts new data by changing the associated probabilities. Random Forests (RF) Classifier is a variant of the Decision Tree Classifier. It works by building a variety of decision trees at training times and issuing the class, which is the mode of class output by individual trees. This method is similar to dredging in many ways, but the construction of each tree method differs from standard decision classification classifier."}, {"heading": "3. Methodology", "text": "The algorithms are compared on the basis of the accuracy of their results. We further investigate the correlation between the discretization techniques and the accuracy of the results. ReplaceMissiongValues1 filters have been applied to replace the missing attributes in the datasets. ReplaceMissiongValues1 filters in Weka are used to replace the values for missing attributes in the datasets. Adding the missing values provides a complete dataset for the persons to be carried. 3.1.2. DiscretionThe following two techniques have been used to replace the attributes in the dataset."}, {"heading": "4. Results", "text": "4.1 Result Set 1 - Prediction of the day of the week {Mon...

Prediction of the day of the week {Mon, Tue, Med, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun} by analyzing the givenweather conditions.Result: Discretization of the year attribute (F1) in 2 bins coupled with Random Forest classifier yielded the highest accuracy, at 16.01% for Brisbane data. The second- and third-best performance algorithms were highlighted in the following table (Table 1): The following table (Table 2) shows the results of prediction algorithms as they are applied in the four cities. Random Forest classifier performs best on Adelaide weather data, yielding 19.04% accuracy when the data is in 10 bins.Unsupervised we. \""}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "The choice of discretization technique (s) and classification algorithm (s) primarily depends on the context and nature of the data available. Some algorithms are better suited to nominal values, while others perform best with numerical data. It is difficult to make a clear judgement based on the results of this experiment, but in most cases Random Forests and J48 yielded higher accuracy; slightly better results compared to IB1 and noticeably better Na\u00efve Bayes simple. Although Na\u00efve Bayes yielded much higher accuracy in some cases, while the others were worse. From what we observed in the test results, the accuracy of predictions decreases with increasing resolution of the results and vice versa. In other words, we can predict with greater accuracy between a smaller number of decisions (coarse resolution)."}], "references": [{"title": "WEKA - Machine Learning Algorithms in Java, Chapter 8, Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning", "author": ["I.H.
