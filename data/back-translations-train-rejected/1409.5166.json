In the MPISP, each inspector is scheduled to perform a route in a given multi-period planning horizon. At the end of each period, each inspector is not required to return to the depot but has to stay at one of the vertices for recuperation. If the remaining time of the current period is insufficient for an inspector to travel from his/her current vertex $A$ to a certain vertex B, he/she can choose either waiting at vertex A until the start of the next period or traveling to a vertex C that is closer to vertex B. Therefore, the shortest transit time between any vertex pair is affected by the length of the period and the departure time. We first describe an approach of computing the shortest transit time between any pair of vertices with an arbitrary departure time. To solve the MPISP, we then propose several local search operators adapted from classical operators for the VRPTW and integrate them into a tabu search framework. In addition, we present a constrained knapsack model that is able to produce an upper bound for the problem. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm with extensive experiments based on a set of test instances. Our computational results indicate that our approach generates high-quality solutions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Sep 2014 23:29:46 GMT  (182kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5166v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["hu qin", "zizhen zhang", "yubin xie", "rew lim"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.5166"}, "pdf": {"name": "1409.5166.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Tabu Search Algorithm for the Multi-period Inspector Scheduling Problem", "authors": ["Hu Qin", "Zizhen Zhang", "Yubin Xie", "Andrew Lim"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This paper presents a problem of multiple scheduling by inspectors (MPISP), which is a new variant of the problem of multi-vehicle scheduling with time windows (VRPTW).

Conclusion", "text": "This paper presents a problem of inspector planning, where a number of inspectors are sent to complete a series of inspection applications at different locations within a multi-tiered planning horizon. At the end of each period, each inspector does not have to return to the depot, but must stay at one of the inspection sites for recovery. First, we investigated the way in which the shortest duration between any locations can be calculated if the work periods are taken into account. Next, we introduced several local search operators adapted to classical VRPTW operators and integrated these adapted operators into a taboo search framework. In addition, we presented a limited knapsack model capable of generating an upper limit for the MPISP. Finally, we evaluated the algorithm base on 370 TOPTW instances and 672 MPISP instances. The experimental results reported in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and can serve as a measure of the number of time windows that are widely used in practice."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was partially supported by the Basic Research Fund for the Central Universities of HUST (grant no. 2014QN206) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 71201065)."}], "references": [{"title": "Network flows: theory, algorithms, and applications", "author": ["R.K.

In the MPISP, each inspector is scheduled to perform a route in a given multi-period planning horizon. At the end of each period, each inspector is not required to return to the depot but has to stay at one of the vertices for recuperation. If the remaining time of the current period is insufficient for an inspector to travel from his/her current vertex A to a certain vertex B, he/she can choose either waiting at vertex A until the start of the next period or traveling to a vertex C that is closer to vertex B. Therefore, the shortest transit time between any vertex pair is affected by the length of the period and the departure time. We first describe an approach of computing the shortest transit time between any pair of vertices with an arbitrary departure time. To solve the MPISP, we then propose several local search operators adapted from classical operators for the VRPTW and integrate them into a tabu search framework. In addition, we present a constrained knapsack model that is able to produce an upper bound for the problem. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm with extensive experiments based on a set of test instances. Our computational results indicate that our approach generates high-quality solutions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
