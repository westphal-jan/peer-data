In this article, two merging semantics are considered, the first being based on the weighted sum of distances, the second on a priority order. Formula R is available from K1,..., Km if it is the result of merging this formula with some weights or priorities. Using the first semantics, it amounts to verifying the existence of weights, so that R is the result of merging K1,...., Km with these weights. For the second semantics, the definition is the same with a priority order instead of weights.

Therefore, the drastic distance from a model to a knowledge base is 0 if the model satisfies the base and 1 otherwise.

Separate models with different ratings of X, K1 and R contain the subformula \"Y,\" which contains all the variables in Y and a copy of it \"X\" is too wrong; K2 instead contains F \"Y\" (Y 6 x Y \").

In some ways, these can be considered the extreme opposite of the spectrum of many possible semantics for fusion [18,7]: the first is numerical, model-based and majority obedient; the second is qualitative (priority-based), syntax-dependent and non-majority obedient. The idea of obtaining reliability information, in whatever form it may be expressed, is a semantic based on this, but other semantics can be demonstrated on the semantics of the secondary, which is the primary result for the secondary."}], "references": [{"title": "Local Search in Combinatorial Optimization", "author": ["E.
