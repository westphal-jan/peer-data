Introduction", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this topic is a complex one that is likely to be of interest. [RKPW08]. Human participation remains central to the process of word processing. While the topic of computer-aided modeling can capture vast amounts of data and extract information, people are able to develop a deeper understanding. [RKPW08] The recognition that the essential roles of computer-aided and human information processing in the field of word processing are essential, demonstrating the need for effective communication between the two parts. Visualization is a highly efficient communication channel that is made possible by interaction."}, {"heading": "2. Probabilistic Topic Modeling", "text": "The family of probabilistic topic modeling algorithms has emerged as a widely popular approach to analyzing the thematic structure in the text. Deferred Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is thear Xiv: 140 9,56 23v2 [cs.IR] 2 7N ov2 01 most fundamental among them, as it has inspired a long series of variations [BL09]. Topic modeling is particularly applicable to problems where there is little prior knowledge of the content of the text, i.e. where exploratory analysis is required. LDA cites latent topics in an unsupervised manner, based on the presence of words in documents, and delivers interpretable results in the form of probabilities. The algorithm takes the desired number of topics as input, assumes that each document can discuss multiple topics and attempts to identify coherent and meaningful topics by analyzing the terms in each document."}, {"heading": "3. Visualization of Topic Models", "text": "Some tools that present topic modeling results rely heavily on text arranged in different areas, but use few visual tools to communicate structure (see, for example, [CB12, GLL * 10]). However, there is still much room for further research on how visualization techniques can improve the communication of topic modeling results, and the results of text mining models in general. This research is also supported by Tufte's [Tuf83] design principle of using graphics when words alone cannot effectively communicate the message, since structural information is so central to the analysis of text as semantics. Our work extends that of Chuang et al. [CMH12], which we consider the most promising previous example of topic modeling."}, {"heading": "3.1. Selecting informative topic keyterms", "text": "The raw topic-term probabilities provided by the LDA are not suitable as a ranking to find terms that, as already mentioned, distinguish well between the topics. Various measures have been proposed to better describe the meaning of the topic, such as a TFIDF-inspired term score [BL09] and others that also punish terms that predominate in many topics. Rank of terms is crucial to describe and distinguish key terms for the presentation and visualization of the topic meaning.For reasons of interpretation, we use the conditional probability P (T | w) = P (w | T) P (T) / P (w), when a term w is observed, the probability that it belongs to topic T is a measure of how the distinction w of T. We derive the measure as P (T | w) = P (T) P (T) / P (w), with (P) being provided by the key term distribution being LDA."}, {"heading": "3.2. Visualizing topics and keyterms as a graph", "text": "Because of our basic visualization techniques, we use a graph with forced layout (using the D3 force algorithm [BOH11]). It provides a spatial metaphor for the thematic similarity in the corpus. The graph, as shown in Figure 1, consists of topic nodes associated with key terms, which produce a relatively sparse graph for which forced layout can provide clear results. Topics are not directly linked to each other, but only by their common key terms. Nevertheless, the positioning of the node conveys general thematic similarity structures, and the linking of key terms provides qualitative details about the nature of their relationship. Visual connectedness is a powerful tool for communicating relationships [PR94]. The illustration shows a (partial) overview of topics where key terms are encoded, and the linking of key terms to terms that are qualitatively detailed."}, {"heading": "3.3. Finding documents by topic and keyterm", "text": "Since the graph displays only topic nodes and a limited number of key term nodes, but no document information, it acts like an abstracted topical view of the corpus. All document information is accessible only through interaction, which means that the scaling of the body size does not affect the visualization. Double-clicking on nodes allows any number and type of nodes to be selected to serve as anchors for the underlying documents. This mechanism is used to respond to documents related to interesting topics, key terms or their combinations.The titles of the documents are listed in a page window associated with the full texts. Both the focus on nodes and their selection follow the visual information search mantra [Shn96], filtering information and providing details about topics, key terms or related documents if necessary."}, {"heading": "4. Case: Visualizing Topics in Financial Patents", "text": "An example of this is the fact that the solution to these problems is a purely theoretical question, which is usually a purely theoretical question."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "We discussed a new visualization design for the presentation of LDA models using graphs, in terms of topic structure and meaning, while maintaining a certain degree of abstraction. Its use is demonstrated by modeling the topics in a number of financial patent abstracts, where it can assist in finding information problems. We explicitly focused on the research of models, assuming that the modeling results are satisfactory, although the use of topic models in the real world requires an assessment of model quality by domain experts. Ongoing studies of this type of visualization should take into account that the results of topic modeling are rarely perfect and what impact this might have on interface design."}], "references": [{"title": "Topic models.
