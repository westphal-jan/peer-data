Central to our approach is a novel spatial superposition logic, whose semantics is defined over the quad-tree of a partitioned image. We show that formulas in this logic can be efficiently learned from positive and negative examples of several types of patterns. We also demonstrate that pattern detection, which is implemented as a model checking algorithm, performs very well for test data sets different from the learning sets. We define a quantitative semantics for the logic and integrate the model checking algorithm with particle swarm optimization in a computational framework for synthesis of parameters leading to desired patterns in reaction-diffusion systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 Sep 2014 05:21:06 GMT  (666kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5671v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CE cs.LG cs.LO cs.SY", "authors": ["ebru aydin gol", "ezio bartocci", "calin belta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.5671"}, "pdf": {"name": "1409.5671.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Formal Methods Approach to Pattern Synthesis in Reaction Diffusion Systems", "authors": ["Ebru Aydin Gol", "Ezio Bartocci", "Calin Belta"], "emails": ["(ebru@bu.edu)", "(cbelta@bu.edu)", "(ezio.bartocci@tuwien.ac.at)"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of us are able to outdo ourselves, and we are able to outdo ourselves, \"he said in an interview with The New York Times.\" I don't think we will be able to change the world. \""}, {"heading": "II.

First, we show that the parameters of a reaction diffusion system satisfying the TSSL formula can be found by optimizing quantitative model verification results. Second, we conclude the optimization in a supervised iterative procedure for parameter synthesis. We easily abuse the terminology and say that an orbit x (t), t-0 of the system S (p) is satisfactory if the QTS Q = (S, s), the L) of the corresponding observation, H (t), is satisfactory."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We have shown that formulas in this logic can be efficiently learned from positive and negative examples. We have defined a quantitative semantics for TSSL and combined it with an optimization algorithm to develop a supervised, iterative method for synthesizing pattern production parameters. While the experiments show that the current version of logic works quite well and can accommodate translation and rotation symmetries that are common in biological patterns, there are several directions of future work. First, we expect that even better results could be obtained if more statistical moments were used, and not just the mean as in the current version of this work. Second, we do not use the full semantics of logic in this essay. In future work, we plan to study the argument across several branches and apply the operator \"to.\" Third, we plan to apply this method to more realistic methods that can be used in synthetic networks to generate synthetic patterns that we expect from existing cells."}], "references": [{"title": "Heterocyst formation in anabaena", "author": ["J.
