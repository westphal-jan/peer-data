These local search algorithms are either based on solving multiple scalarizations of the objective function vector, or they are based on Pareto dominance. The most successful local search algorithms combine both approaches [3,4,10,13]. These successes explain the growing interest in understanding the role of local optimal solutions in the context of MCOPs. Previous work has focused on the characteristics of individual local optimal solutions [14]. However, algorithms for MCOPs typically do not lead to a single solution, but to a number of solutions that approach the Pareto set. Thus, local search algorithms for MCOPs are typically affected by (Pareto) local optimal sets (PLO sets), that is, sets of (Pareto) optimal solutions are also related to the PLI 1957 Xiv 9.19]."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "It is not the first time that a solution is based on the multi-dimensional function vector f: X (X).

The archive starts with a random solution of the problem, which corresponds to a random effect on each of the three selected neighborhood solutions. In the following, we cover the three selected PLLS solutions, selecting the epistatic degree k (1, 2, 4, 8) so that k < n, an objective spatial dimension m (2, 3, 5) and an objective correlation (0.7, -0.2, 0.2, 0.7) so that the corresponding correlation matrix is symmetrically positively defined. [14] The problem sizes investigated allow us to exhaustively enumerate the solution space and then optimally resolve all instances. For each parameter combination, an independent random instance is taken into account: < \u03c1, m, n, k >. This results in a total of 91 problem instances. In our implementation of PLS for the PLLS landscapes, the neighborhood structure is taken as a neighborhood flip-1."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Analysis", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Cardinality of Pareto Local Optimal Sets", "text": "Figure 1 shows the size of the PLO sets identified by PLSunb with respect to different instance characteristics. Each point indicates the mean over the 25 random seeds of the same instance, and the error bars indicate the standard deviation. PLO sets are plotted on a logarithmic scale. Generally, the cardinality of PLO sets increases exponentially with the number of targets m, as shown in Fig. 1a-1c. Correlation between the objective values \u03c1 is also a decisive factor: the cardinality of PLO sets increases exponentially with the linear decrease of \u03c1 (Fig. 1c). The cardinality of PLO sets also increases with lower k, but much less clearly (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, the small error bars in Fig. 1a-1d indicate that for a given case maximum PLO sets consistently exhibit approximately the same size, but with much less clarity (Fig. 1a)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Quality of Local Optimal Sets", "text": "We examine the quality of the PLO sets found by PLSunb, PLShva and PLSmga using two simple quality measures, namely the hypervolume and the multiplicative epsilon [15]. To compare the hypervolume value for cases with very different characteristics, we calculate the relative difference of the hypervolume as hvr (A) = (hv (P) \u2212 hv (P), where A Z is the image of a PLO set in objective space and P is the exact Pareto front for the instance under consideration. Thus, the reference point is determined at the origin. The Epsilon measure specifies the minimum multiplication factor around which a PLO set must be shifted in objective space to weakly dominate the exact Pareto front. Thus, a lower value in relation to volume is preferred for both measurements."}, {"heading": "4.3 Difficulty of Identifying Local Optimal Sets", "text": "Indeed, the longer the process takes, the larger it becomes, the larger it becomes, and the larger the number of local optimists."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we analyzed the characteristics of local optima in the context of a multi-objective local search when applied to multi-objective NK landscapes with correlated targets. Firstly, the main factors influencing the cardinality of the maximum PLO sets returned by PLSunb are the number of targets and the correlation between them. By altering these two factors, the size of PLO sets may vary from a few tens to tens of thousands. Our results confirm trends that have already been observed for other MCOP problems. In particular, the exponential increase in PLO sets with lower objective correlation has already been reported for the bi-objective QAP sets [13]. Another interesting observation is that the variability of PLO sets is usually a very small fraction of the average size of PLO sets, i.e. most maximum PLO sets for a given instance have approximately the same size of PLO sets as we do not know at present, and other PLO sets do not."}], "references": [{"title": "Working principles, behavior, and performance of MOEAs on MNK-landscapes", "author": ["H.E.
