OUTLOOK", "text": "We introduced dissociation as a new algebraic technique to approximate the probability of Boolean functions. We used this technique to derive oblically optimal upper and lower boundaries for conjunctive and disjunctive dissociations, and proved that dissociation always brings equally good or better approximations than models. We did not address the algorithmic complexities of exploring the space of alternative disassociations, but considered our technique as a fundamental building block for new algorithmic approaches. Such future approaches can apply dissociation on two conceptual levels: (1) at the query level, i.e. before analyzing the space of alternative disassociations, or (2) at the data level, i.e. in analyzing the data. The advantage of query-centric approaches is that they can be executed in guaranteed polynomial time, 27 but at the expense of no general approximation that guarantees a general approximation (28)."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We would like to thank Arthur Choi and Adnan Darwiche for helpful discussions on Relaxation & Compensation and for drawing our attention to Prop. 5.1 [Choi and Darwiche 2011]; we would also like to thank Vibhav Gogate for helpful discussions on quantification and guidance in using his SampleSearch tool; Alexandra Meliou for suggesting the name \"Dissociation\"; and the reviewers for their careful reading of this manuscript and detailed feedback, which was partially supported by NSF grants IIS-0915054 and IIS-1115188.

Our motivation comes from the weighted model counting problem (or, equivalently, the problem of computing the probability of a Boolean function), which is #P-hard in general. By performing several dissociations, one can transform a Boolean formula whose probability is difficult to compute, into one whose probability is easy to compute, and which is guaranteed to provide an upper or lower bound on the probability of the original formula by choosing appropriate probabilities for the dissociated variables. Our new bounds shed light on the connection between previous relaxation-based and model-based approximations and unify them as concrete choices in a larger design space.
