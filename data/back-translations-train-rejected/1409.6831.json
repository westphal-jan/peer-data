SIMULATION RESULTS", "text": "In this section, we use Borda counting with three candidates as an example. Once the ranking is known, we can draw a narrower boundary than the general error rate in Section III, because we know exactly what the pair-wise comparison boundaries are. We compare all the upper boundaries with the simulation error rates. In Borda, we count 1 point for each vote that the candidate receives first, the second receives 0.5 points, and the lowest candidate receives no points. The aggregate rank is sorted by the total points that each candidate receives. We list 3! = 6 permutations in the following order, and we stick to this order for the rest of this paper: abc, acb, cab, cba, bca, bac. \u2212 Letm = (1 0.5 0 0 0.50.5 0 0.5 1 0 0.5 1 0 1 1 0).

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we apply the differential privacy framework to ranking by adding noise to the voices. We analyze the likelihood that the aggregated ranking will become inaccurate as a result of noise, and derive upper limits for ranking error rates for all position ranking rules on the assumption that the profiles are evenly distributed, and the boundaries can be tightened by high-dimensional polytopic volume calculation techniques when we obtain a specific ranking rule. Our results provide insight into the trade-offs between privacy and ranking accuracy. 7"}, {"heading": "VI.
