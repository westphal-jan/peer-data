These justifications are expressed in terms of causal graphs formed by rule labels and edges that represent their application ordering. For positive programs, we show that the causal justifications obtained for a given atom have a direct correspon- dence to (relevant) syntactic proofs of that atom using the program rules involved in the graphs. The most interesting contribution is that this causal information is obtained in a purely semantic way, by algebraic op- erations (product, sum and application) on a lattice of causal values whose ordering relation expresses when a justification is stronger than another. Finally, for programs with negation, we define the concept of causal stable model by introducing an analogous transformation to Gelfond and Lifschitz's program reduct. As a result, default negation behaves as \"absence of proof\" and no justification is derived from negative liter", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Sep 2014 14:56:57 GMT  (79kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7281v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["pedro cabalar", "jorge fandinno", "michael fink"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.7281"}, "pdf": {"name": "1409.7281.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Causal Graph Justifications of Logic Programs\u2217", "authors": ["Pedro Cabalar", "Jorge Fandinno", "Michael Fink"], "emails": ["jorge.fandino}@udc.es)", "fink@kr.tuwien.ac.at)"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Key concepts: response programming, causality, knowledge representation, value added logic programming"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "An important difference between the classical models and most logical programming (LP) semantics is that, in the latter case, true atoms are able to be substantiated or justified by a certain derivative. Consequently, falsehood is ultimately understood as a lack of evidence: for example, a common informal way in which the actual requirement literally does not include p, \"there is no way to derive p.\" Although this idea seems quite intuitive, it does in fact fall back on a concept of ways to derive p, outside the scope of standard LP semantics. In other words, LP semantics indicates whether there is any derivative for an atom, it does not provide the derivatives themselves if several alternatives exist. However, such information about justifications for atoms can be of great interest for representation (KR), and in particular for dealing with problems related to 09 K09 T05, the XX-a-MEA program X62 is expected to be partially observed by the XX-5C X09-X62 discrepancy between the diagnostic behavior."}, {"heading": "2 Causes as graphs", "text": "In this and subsequent section 3, we present the grid of causal values in two different steps. (In a first step, we focus on the idea of an \"individual\" cause, and then proceed to explain the concept of causal value, which enables us to grasp various alternative causes. We begin to refer to several causal definitions and notations. (A (directed) graph is a pair < V > graph is a set of causal graphs in which V and E represent a series of causal graphs. (A (directed) graph is a causal graph. (A) graph is a set of causal graphs V and E is a set of causal graphs G. \"In the following definitions, we leave G = < V > and G\" a particular graph. \"We write G\" to stand for the graph < V \"E\" >. We represent the reflexive and transitive conclusion of G \""}, {"heading": "3 Alternative causes", "text": "After clarifying the case for individual causes, we now proceed to present situations in which several alternative and independent causes for an atom p can be found. The obvious possibility is to use a series of causal graphs for this purpose. However, we should also ignore causes for which there is a stronger alternative. For example, as we have seen before, cause rm is sufficient to explain this atom, and therefore it is also an alternative way to prove this atom, but redundant in the presence of the stronger cause rm. This suggests choosing sets of -maximum causal graphs as \"truth values\" for our polyvalent semantics. In principle, this is the central idea, although the causal graph has some minor inconveniences in the mathematical treatment. If we collect various alternative causes simply by using the relationships of the maximum causal graphs, the elements do not have to be maximum in the result."}, {"heading": "4 Positive programs and minimal models", "text": "We rethink the logical programs and provide semantics based on the causal values we have just defined. For the syntax, we remember the standard LP definitions, which are only slightly extended by introducing rules. A signature is a pair < At, Lb > of sets, each representing a set of atoms (or propositions) and a set of terms. As usual, a letter is defined literally as an atom p (positive literal) or its default negation not p (negative literal). In this work, we will focus on programs without disjunctions in the head (and leave their treatment for future work).Definition 5 (causal logical program) Given a signature < At, Lb >, a (causal) logical program P is a (possible infinite) set of rules of the form: t: H,."}, {"heading": "5 Default negation", "text": "To introduce the standard negation, let us consider the following variant of our current example. Example 8 Suppose that the law e is a requirement and that there may be exceptional cases in which the punishment is not effective. In particular, some of these exceptions are a coincidence that the punishment has been lifted or that the person has diplomatic immunity. A possible program P4 encoding this variant of the scenario is as follows: l: Punishment of the driving force, drunk d: Driving force abnormal, not abnormal r: Resistance force abnormal This program has a unique stable model that still holds the prison to be true, since no evidence of abnormal driving force could be provided, i.e. no exception can be made. From an exclusive perspective, it can be stated that the absence of an exception is part of a cause (e.g. for imprisonment) that it is counterproductive. It is not the case that we go to prison because we do not receive a punishment, no mercy."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves, and they are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have provided a multi-value semantics for normal logic programs, whose truth values form a grid of causal graphs. A causal graph is nothing more than a graph of rule applications that reflects a certain order of rule applications. Thus, a model assigns a value to each true atom that contains justifications for its derivation from the existing rules. We have also provided three basic grid operations: an addendum that stands for alternative, independent justifications; a product that represents a common interaction of causes; and a concatenation that reflects the application of rules. We have shown that for positive programs there is a minimal model that corresponds to the least fixed point of a direct consequence operator, analogous to van Emden and Kowalski (1976). Thus, we are able to transfer a direct correspondence between the semantic values we receive and the syntactic idea of proofs, which are interpreted by more stable models as the cause. \""}, {"heading": "Appendix A.

Note that a is the main switch, while b only affects the lamp when a is actually on top. Also, when the light is on, we want to track which section of cable, v or w, is current to the lamp.A as commented by Pearl (2000), the interesting feature of this circuit is that it behaves exactly like a pair of independent parallel switches, so it is impossible to detect the causal dependence between a and b by merely observing the actions performed and their effects on the lamp. Figure 5 also includes a possible representation for this scenario; let us call it program P5. It uses a pair of fluents up (X) and down (X) for the position of the switch X, as well as up and down to represent the state of the lamp."}, {"heading": "Appendix D.

Perhaps the most established AI approach for causality is relying on causal networks (Pearl 2000; Halpern and Pearl 2005; Halpern 2008). In this approach, it is possible to conclude cause-effect relations like \u201cA has caused B\u201d from the behaviour of structural equations by applying the counterfactual interpretation from Hume (1748): \u201chad A not happened, B would not have happened.\u201d As discussed by Hall (2004), the counterfactual-based definition of causation corresponds to recognising some kind of dependence relation in the behaviour of a non-causal system description.", "startOffset": 15, "endOffset": 1173}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "Apart from the different AI approaches and attitudes towards causality, from the technical point of view, the current approach can be classified as a labelled deductive system (Broda et al. 2004).

A causal graph is nothing else but a graph of rule labels that reflects some order of rule applications. In this way, a model assigns to each true atom a value that contains justifications for its derivation from the existing rules. We have further provided three basic operations on the lattice: an addition, that stands for alternative, independent justifications; a product, that represents joint interaction of causes; and a concatenation that reflects rule application. We have shown that, for positive programs, there exists a least model that coincides with the least fixpoint of a direct consequences operator, analogous to van Emden and Kowalski (1976). With this, we are able to prove a direct correspondence between the semantic values we obtain and the syntactic idea of proof.", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 1694}, {"referenceID": 17, "context": "An example of causal action theory In this section we consider a more elaborated example from Pearl (2000).", "startOffset": 12, "endOffset": 107}, {"referenceID": 23, "context": "As commented by Pearl (2000), the interesting feature of this circuit is that, seen from outside as a black box, it behaves exactly as a pair of independent, parallel switches, so it is impossible to detect the causal dependence between a and b by a mere observation of performed actions and their effects on the lamp.", "startOffset": 16, "endOffset": 29}, {"referenceID": 20, "context": "(McCain 1997).", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 13}, {"referenceID": 18, "context": "An iteresting variation of this example is incorporating some mechanic device to stop the wheels (Van Belleghem et al. 1998; Lin and Soutchanski 2011).", "startOffset": 97, "endOffset": 150}, {"referenceID": 28, "context": "Stumme was showed in (Stumme 1997) that the concept lattice B\u3008F,VLb,\u2206\u3009 (with F\u2206I\u21d4 F \u2229 I 6= / 0) is isomorphic to the free completely distributive complete lattice generated by the partial lattice \u3008CLb,+,\u2217\u3009 where + and \u2217 are two partial functions corresponding with the supremum and infimum.", "startOffset": 21, "endOffset": 34}, {"referenceID": 15, "context": "Thus, from Theorem 1 in (Kifer and Subrahmanian 1992), it follows that the operator TP is monotonic.", "startOffset": 24, "endOffset": 53}, {"referenceID": 15, "context": "Thus from Theorem 3 in (Kifer and Subrahmanian 1992), it follows that TP \u2191 \u03c9 (0) = l f p(TP) and this is the least model of P.", "startOffset": 23, "endOffset": 52}], "year": 2014, "abstractText": "In this work we propose a multi-valued extension of logic programs under the stable models semantics where each true atom in a model is associated with a set of justifications. These justifications are expressed in terms of causal graphs formed by rule labels and edges that represent their application ordering. For positive programs, we show that the causal justifications obtained for a given atom have a direct correspondence to (relevant) syntactic proofs of that atom using the program rules involved in the graphs. The most interesting contribution is that this causal information is obtained in a purely semantic way, by algebraic operations (product, sum and application) on a lattice of causal values whose ordering relation expresses when a justification is stronger than another. Finally, for programs with negation, we define the concept of causal stable model by introducing an analogous transformation to Gelfond and Lifschitz\u2019s program reduct. As a result, default negation behaves as \u201cabsence of proof\u201d and no justification is derived from negative literals, something that turns out convenient for elaboration tolerance, as we explain with a running example.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
