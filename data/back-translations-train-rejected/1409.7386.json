Background", "text": "In this section, a brief description of the grammar of dependence and the working principles of the parsers considered for this experiment, namely Stanford and Minipar, are presented."}, {"heading": "A. Dependency Grammar", "text": "Since the beginning of the idea of presenting the syntactic structure of a sentence by linking words with a number of dependencies, many variations have been proposed, but the basic assumption of the dependency grammar remains unchanged: it is possible to relate the words in a sentence by a number of asymmetric and binary dependency relationships. Moreover, the words have very specific roles in a dependency relationship to each other: the constituent word of a dependency relationship can be either a header or a dependency that modifies the header. If we take the sentence economic news as an example, then the dependency relationships can be derived from the Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) that is drawn from the sentence. The DAG drawn for each sentence has several properties: the words in the sentence are the nodes of the graph and their relationships are asymmetric edges that connect them."}, {"heading": "B. The Stanford and Minipar Parsers", "text": "Several parsers have been developed to represent dependency relationships in one sentence. Minipar, a statistical parser, derived from its previous edition called Principar [6] and works on the basis of the basic principles of dependency grammar. It was developed in 1998 and immediately underwent a rigorous Susanne Corpus evaluation. The evaluation result was satisfactory as it extracted 79 percent of the dependency relationships in the corpus with a high precision of 89 percent. Minipar's main advantages are: it uses the basic principles of dependency grammar without modification, its availability, its simplicity, its performance and its training corpus, which was a subset of the Brown Corpus that makes it a far-reaching parser [6]. Minipar drew the attention of researchers as soon as its performance is published and to date its use is varied: to parse domain-specific texts to compete in the natural language Parser and to count as gold in many others."}, {"heading": "III. Performance of the Parsers on Biomedical Texts", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Setup", "text": "To test the parsers, the set of interconnected biomedical concepts consisting of four scientific articles was used. Therefore, for each pair in the sentence, the sets of essays containing both of these concepts are passed to the parsers. However, the parsers are not trained with biomedical corpora. Therefore, if we use the Part of Speech (POS) taggers of these parsers to mark biomedical text, it is likely that they assign incorrect POS assignments. Fig. 3 shows, for example, that glutamate is referred to as an adjective (YY) by the Stanford tagger, even though it is a chemical component and a noun (NN) tag is appropriate. Before the sentences are passed to the parsers, the sentences are marked with Genia POS tagger [14], which is trained with biomedical corpora and designed specifically for marking biomedical text."}, {"heading": "B.

Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the performance of dependency parsers, namely Stanford and Minipar, in parsing biomedical texts was reported. Experiments showed that the parsers were less successful in detecting dependencies between biomedical concepts that are already demonstrably connected, the reason for the low success of the parsers was that, as statistical parsers, they were unable to detect dependencies between words that maintain a decent syntactical distance. Minipar's ability to parse biomedical texts was also measured against Stanford's gold standard in terms of attachment score. Precision, recall and F-score of Minipar's attachment score indicate that the parser is not yet ready to parse biomedical texts, but it is also firmly convinced that Minipar will increase its performance in this area when trained with biomedical companies."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "In this paper, the performance of two dependency parsers, namely Stanford and Minipar, on biomedical texts has been reported.
