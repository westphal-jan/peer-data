In addition, the paradigm shift to the Internet of Things will equip many physical objects with wireless networking capabilities that will then be able to begin communicating from machine to machine [1]. These connections, in turn, can include entire (ad hoc) wireless networks between these networked objects, one example of which are sensor networks already in use today. In many scenarios for robotic applications, such as utilizing the sensor capacities of a decentralized sensor network or accessing cloud-based resources, robots must be able to integrate into various wireless networks. In addition to these machine-to-machine communication scenarios, mobile robots may also be nodes of very flexible, easy-to-deploy wireless communication networks that can be used as communication infrastructure."}, {"heading": "1.1 Problem Statement", "text": "In this paper, we consider a very basic, yet very relevant, task for the robot. Finding the physical location of a particular network node is the prototype task for many tasks related to navigation within a wireless network. Later in this paper, we will show how to adapt the presented framework to cope with more complex objectives. A robot receives packets from the network node, which are found in different spatial positions, and measures the signal strength of these packets as a scalar measurement, scanning a scalar field at different points in space. The robot has no means to detect the direction from which the packets arrive, as would be possible with a directional antenna. Furthermore, it cannot measure the time flight of the packets, which would enable the robot to simply trilateralize the source. While both options are technologically feasible, we will not consider them here to be independent of additional technology and hardware, as they would be required for flight time measurement."}, {"heading": "1.2 Related Work", "text": "A similar problem exists in nature, for example, in the form of chemotherapy [4], in which the bacteria penetrate to the highest concentrations of food (or to the lowest concentrations of food)."}, {"heading": "2 Physical Model", "text": "We discuss in detail the underlying physical models for displacement losses. This forms the basis for the discussion of the algorithm itself and is of universal importance for all network robotics algorithms."}, {"heading": "2.1 Minimalistic Physical Model", "text": "The measured signal strength depends on many environmental parameters and is generally difficult to calculate. In many cases, values can only be obtained by direct measurement or numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. A minimalist model of displacement loss, which ultimately defines the signal strength measured by a user, is a simplified displacement loss model derived from the free space displacement model. It can be written as [16, chap. 2] P (x) = \u2212 10\u03b3 log10 (xd0) (1) in dB, where d0 and \u03b3 are empirical constants and x is the distance between receiver and transmitter. d0 has typical values of several meters and \u03b3 is about 3 for urban environments. Since this model is only used to obtain an intuition about the general behavior of displacement loss and thus the signal strength, we present only the one-dimensional rotationally symmetric version of the displacement loss. To get an intuition about its derivatives (and thus its displacement losses of 10x) (and thus its displacement losses of 10x (10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10xxx10xxx10xxxxxxx10xxxxx"}, {"heading": "2.2 Elaborate Physical Model", "text": "This year it is as far as never before in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany."}, {"heading": "2.3 Small Scale Fading", "text": "As discussed in the previous section, small-scale fading is the result of interference and affects the length scale of the wavelength. This effect is deterministic and can lead to local minimums in the signal strength that would violate some convergence conditions (see Fig. 4.2).An example measurement is in Fig. 1. The deterministic fluctuations on the wavelength scale (12.5 cm for 2.4 GHz in this case) are clearly visible; these effects can be stronger than the noise sources and must be treated to ensure the convergence of the presented algorithms. Typically, this is not a problem for a flying robot because it cannot maintain its position with a precision of this magnitude, which means that due to stostic motion (caused by aerodynamics and additionally transformed into a larger area by wind fluctuations than by deterrence)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Abstract Model: Notation", "text": "Based on the more complex models discussed above, we describe an abstract model to be used for a compact notation in the remainder of the paper. It covers all the more complex models discussed above and is rather vague to allow for the short notation. It should be noted that it implicitly includes all the features required for the convergence discussion. In our model, we can only measure the true signal strength f (~ x) up to a measurement error (~ x) = f (~ x) + x (5), where the measurement error (~ x) is a random variable with E [preservation (~ x)] = 0, (6) V [preservation (~ x)] = \u03c32. (7) The measurement errors (~ x) are generally for the individual measurements.

This estimate is the most common with improved precision with respect to unilateral finite differences. Currently, this estimate does not take into account the measurement errors discussed in Sec. 3.2, but only the errors from the numerical approximation.

This noise is added to every motor command and thus influences all movements. In general, this noise is vector and affects every infinitely small movement of the robot, which results in a random, running-like behavior. This behavior is graphically represented in the input of Fig. 2. Since it makes no qualitative difference to our argument 1, but simplifies the notation, we abstract here from this vector noise only to a sound in the direction of motion. For the central differences, this means that f (~ x) is not sampled at f (~ x + h ~ ei), but at f (~ x + h ~ ei), but at f (h + h + h)."}, {"heading": "3.4 Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "text": "The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a useful quantity that describes the relationship of a measured signal amplitude to the amplitude of the noise introduced into this channel.

We formally present this algorithm and discuss its convergence and statistical properties."}, {"heading": "4.1 Finite Difference Stochastic Approximation", "text": "One of the most basic algorithms for finding the minimum of a scalar field is the method of the steepest descent. It consists of the calculation (or in this case estimation) of the gradient ~ gmes (~ x), which begins at a certain starting point ~ x0 and follows it with a certain increment ak: ~ xk + 1 = ~ xk + ak ~ gmes (~ xk). (20) The increments h of the gradient estimate (9) can also be adjusted for each step and are therefore called hk. Iterations of this algorithm are estimates of the position of the minimum, starting from an initial assumption ~ x0, which in this case is trivial the position of the robot at the start of the algorithm, and are therefore referred to as ~ xk. Thus, this algorithm is basically stateless and the current position of the robot is always the best estimate of the minimum."}, {"heading": "4.2 Convergence", "text": "It can be shown that this algorithm converges when ak, hk, f (~ x) and \u0430 (~ x) meet certain conditions [15, pp. 159-162].

There is a global maximum that can be easily converted into a global minimum by measuring the measured values at minus on.The second condition c limits the noise of the signal. Measurement noise as modeled in Sec. 2.4 is mainly physical origin and is discussed in Sec 2.1."}, {"heading": "4.3 Distribution of the Iterate", "text": "Unfortunately, there is no known finite sample distribution for the general nonlinear distribution of ak and hk [15, p. 112], but the asymptotic normality of this distribution can be shown for more specific decisions of ak and hk [15, p. 162-164]: ak = a (k + 1 + A) \u03b1, (28) hk = h (k + 1) \u03b3. (29) Here, a > 0, h > 0, \u03b1 > 0, \u03b3 > 0 must be assumed. \u2265 0 is a stability constant that ensures small gains at the beginning and sufficient gains at the end. In order to show an asymptotic normality, some limitations must be added for these constants. The most practical ones are: \u03b2 \u2261 \u03b1 \u2212 2ctua > 0, (30) 3ctua \u2212 \u03b12 \u2265 0.

Motor noise in the movement of the robot - provided it is truly random and unbiased - can be considered an additional error in the estimated (or measured) gradient of f (~ x). This discussion is similar to that in paragraph 3.3. This error is constant per unit length, but as the increment ak decreases, the resulting overall motion error also decreases. As the error increases with decreasing hk due to the central differential approximation (14), the motion error becomes irrelevant for large k and thus does not affect convergence."}, {"heading": "4.5 Other Stochastic Approximation Algorithms", "text": "FDSA is only one algorithm from a family of stochastic approximation algorithms that exhibit similar properties and similar convergence conditions. It was chosen because of the intuitive formulation of the gradient estimation, which enabled us to discuss the properties of the estimated gradients in the light of our use of network robots. Other algorithms from this family work with different formulations for gradient estimation and can be proven as analytical convergence. They are known from the stochastic approximation literature [15] and have been successfully used in robotic contexts [13]. The detailed conditions for the convergence of these algorithms differ, but the basic constraints on the measured scalar field, as stated in Sec. 4.2, are the same for all algorithms from this family. Therefore, the discussion relating to wireless communication in Sec. 4.2 applies to the entire family of algorithms. Then there is a set of sehoad-based diagnostic errors for the algorithms and the noise algorithms in Sec."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "To show how to overcome the problems of small fades, we implemented the algorithm with a ground-based robot, for which the effects of small fades are much more severe than for a flying robot, since it can position itself with much higher precision (see also the discussion in Sec. 2.3).The algorithm was initially implemented with four measurements for each gradient estimate according to its original formulation.The resulting behavior was random and showed no convergence. The most likely reason for this behavior is the small fades due to its local periodic nature and the resulting effects on this naive gradient estimation. Since a robot must move from one sampling point to the next while executing the algorithm, we decided to use this motion and continuously measure it as it moves along the two axes of the gradient estimation. We supplemented the finite differential estimation of the derivatives with a linear model of the data collected along these lines."}, {"heading": "6 Adapting more Complex Objectives", "text": "For this purpose, we choose a typical task in network robotics, namely bridging two network nodes, i.e. we move to the position between the nodes with maximum signal strength and equal signal strength to both nodes. This task often occurs when a gap in the network needs to be bridged. For this task, we define the objective function g (~ x) asg (~ x) asg (f1) \u2212 f2 (~ x) asc."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "This work showed that network robotics can use algorithms based on stochastic approximation that work with signal strength measurements for tasks such as navigation. We made estimates of the accuracy of gradients calculated from signal strength measurements. Measurements of signal strength and motor noise were physically motivated and their effects on the convergence of these algorithms were discussed in detail. We also implemented the algorithm experimentally to show how to deal with some of the specific challenges that network robotics presents, and we showed that more complex goals can be formulated within this framework."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank all those who contributed to the success of this project, including all members of the Cognitive Robotics Working Group and the DFG Research Training Group METRIK (RTG 1324), which is also funding one of the authors."}], "references": [{"title": "From the internet of computers to the internet of things.
