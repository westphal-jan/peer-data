For example, development can be understood as movement (e.g. economics moves forward, the engine of economics). In other words, a conceptual metaphor consists in mapping the conceptual source domain (e.g. vehicles) properties to a target domain (e.g. economics). For example, an economy develops like a vehicle. In language, conceptual metaphors are expressed through linguistic metaphors, i.e. natural language phrases expressing the implicit representation of two domains."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "It is a question of whether and how people who identify with other people can express their identity and identity (Fass, 1991; Krishnakumaran and Zhu, 2007; Baumer et al., 2010), which is based on existing lexical and semantic resources (Peters and Peters, 2013), which are based on predefined concepts and concepts of source that represent a conceptual metaphor that represents a conceptual metaphor (Heintz et al., 2013).

This knowledge can be captured by suggestions, i.e. tuples of words that exhibit a certain pattern of syntactical relationships between them (Clark and Harrison, 2009; Pe\u00f1as and Hovy, 2010; Tsao and Wible, 2013).While many such tuples may be flawed due to parsing errors, statistically higher frequency levels can be considered more reliable. We have generated sentences from parked English and Russian corpora. We have English giga-words (Parker et al, 2011) with Boxer et al."}, {"heading": "4 Generalizing over Propositions", "text": "In fact, we will be able to retaliate, \"he said in an interview with Welt am Sonntag, in which he said\" yes. \"\" We have been able to retaliate, \"he said.\" We have to be able to retaliate, \"he said.\" We have to be able to retaliate, \"he said.\" We have to be able to retaliate. We have to be able to retaliate, \"he said."}, {"heading": "5 Generating Salient Concept Properties", "text": "In a metaphor, properties of a source domain are assigned to a target domain. In natural language, concepts and properties are represented by words and phrases. There is a long-standing tradition of considering mathematical models derived from the coexistence statistics of words as capable of producing reasonable property-based descriptions of concepts; see (Baroni and Lenci, 2008) for an overview. We use the proposition stores to derive prominent properties of concepts that can potentially be mapped in a metaphor. If we give a seed lexem l, we extract all tuples from the proposition store containing this lexem. For each tupel t = < x1,.., xn > there is a set of patterns of the form pi (t) = < x1,.., xi \u2212 1, xi + 1,.., xn >, i.e. a pattern of poverty is achieved by replacing the argument with a blank value."}, {"heading": "6 Generating Source Lexemes", "text": "Some of the real estate prices presented in Sec. 5 already point to conceptual metaphors: \"Poverty is a place where we live\" (in poverty), \"Poverty is an enemy\" (in poverty), \"Poverty is an abyss\" (in poverty). We generate potential sources for a seed target lexeme l in three steps: 1. Find all potential source lexeme S so that for every possible source-source-lexeme-lexeme-lexeme-lexeme-lexeme-lexeme-lexeme that occur in position i in position i in position i. \"The row of tuples containing l and s in the same positions is denoted by Tl, s.3. Weight potential source-lexeme s-lexeme S using the following equation: weightl (s) =\" We generated potential source-lexica for the target areas of poverty. \""}, {"heading": "7 Generating Conceptual Metaphors", "text": "A conceptual metaphor is a triple < Ct, Cs, P >, consisting of a target concept Ct, a source concept Cs, 1We also experimented with the model of latent semantic analysis (Dumais, 2004), but the LDA model proved to be more relevant results.2http: / / radimrehurek.com / gensim / and a set P of properties transferred from Cs to Ct. Each concept is a set of words and phrases. To obtain potential source concepts, we bundle generated source lexemes. Both (Mason, 2004) and (Gandy et al., 2013) we use the WordNet hierarchy for clustering. In this essay, we take a similar approach and use those on WordNet and Wikipedia.3 source lexemes belong to the same concept (Mason, 2004) and (Gandy et al., 2013) we use the WordNet hierarchy for clustering."}, {"heading": "8 Finding Linguistic Metaphors", "text": "For each potential conceptual metaphor, we are looking for supportive linguistic metaphors in corpora. A large number of LMs that support a particular CM suggest that this CM may be cognitively plausible. However, it should be noted that if a CM is not supported by any LMs, this does not mean that this CM is wrong. The target-source mapping may still be cognitively relevant, but not yet conventional enough to be represented linguistically. We use a simple method to find LMs. If a target lexem and a source lexem are linked by a dependency relationship in a sentence, then we assume that this dependency structure contains an LM. In the formulations of Medicine Against Poverty, Chronic Poverty, Source lexemes - and Source lexemes - it is not a target lexeme."}, {"heading": "9 Evaluation", "text": "In this section we describe an evaluation of the proposed approach. First, we present a validation of the generated CMs. As mentioned in Sec. 7, the terms turned out to be the best seeds for generating potential sources. For two of the selectednoun targets per language (poverty, wealth, misrepresentation) that we are able to generate source code, we select 100 top lexemes that classify them into source concepts, and select 10 top ranking CM suggestions (Tables 5 and 6). To get a lexically richer representation of the domains, we expand the sentences of these goals and source lexemes with the help of English and Russian concepts."}, {"heading": "10 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "Contemporary research on computational processing of linguistic metaphors is divided into two main strands: metaphor recognition and metaphor interpretation. In this paper, we take a different approach and present an automated method for generating conceptual metaphors from linguistic data. The proposed approach does not rely heavily on manually encoded resources and does not require a commented training set. It provides a mechanism for metaphor recognition in the face of predefined target and source domains (see Section 8). It also enables metaphor interpretation through patterns shared by target and source lexemes (see Tables 3 and 4). All developed tools, generated resources and validation data are freely available to the community as an open source project at http: / / ovchinnikova.me / proj / metaphor.html.me. In the future, we will examine various word aggregation algorithms and their effect on preserved metaphors."}], "references": [{"title": "An artificial intelligence approach to metaphor understanding", "author": ["J.A.
