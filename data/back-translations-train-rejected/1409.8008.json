For example, there are some designated entities, each of which has a valid dictionary entry. Unlike English, developing an NER system for most Indian languages is difficult because there is no capitalization information, no free-speech structure, and no inflexibility in many Indian languages. In addition, gazetteers play an important role in the development of a practical NERS system. But building well-diversified gazetteers requires hard and time-consuming work. Therefore, developing a practical NERS system is still an active and challenging area of research. Although there is some research to develop a NERS system for Indian languages, further research is needed to develop a better understanding of the problem and thus create a workable system."}, {"heading": "2 Training and Test Data", "text": "ICON has provided us with training, development and test data (8: 1: 1 ratio) for the joint task in the Indian languages Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Telugu, Urdu and English.

In our experiment, we used the CRF + + 1, an open source package. We used various combinations of language-independent features [Ekbal et al., 2008] and finally selected the features for which we obtained the highest precision on a development set. Below, the details of the features used in the NE recognition task: \u2022 Context Words: The previous and next word of a particular word. \u2022 Word Prefix and Suffix: We took into account the word prefix and suffix from 3 letter lengths to 5 letter lengths for all NNNPs. \u2022 POS and Chunk Information: We used the POS and chunk information of a particular word as a feature. \u2022 First and Last Words: We used the first word of a sentence and the last word of a sentence, i.e. the last word of a sentence (n)."}, {"heading": "4 Results and Error Analysis", "text": "The result of the joint task of ICON and 2013 is in Table 2. From the results we can conclude that gazettes are very helpful in increasing the performance of a NERs. Since we have used gazettes in Bengali, Hindi and English, their preformities in relation to Tamil and Telegu, for which we have not used gazettes, seem to be much better."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "The goal of this experiment was the rapid development of NER for Indian languages. It is well known that the CRF-based approach can achieve this goal with limited accuracy. It is well known that the role of the gazetteer is as important for Indian languages as it is for English. It is true that building a diversified gazetteer is time consuming and tedious, but some tricks such as using wiki names, telephone e-directories, who's who lists, etc., can help to create gazetteers without much manual intervention. We have practiced this aspect in the present experiment and were able to improve the performance of the system. However, more language processing may be needed to capture an essentially valid dictionary."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank the organizers of the ICON2013 NER Tool Competition."}], "references": [{"title": "Conditional random fields: Probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data", "author": ["John D.
