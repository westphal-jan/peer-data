This paper describes a novel approach to diagnosis based on the SP theory of calculation and cognition (described below). The main attractions of this approach are: \u2022 A format for presenting diseases that are simple and intuitive. \u2022 An ability to deal with errors and uncertainties in diagnostic information."}, {"heading": "2 The SP theory", "text": "The SP theory arises from a long tradition in psychology that many aspects of brain function can be understood as information compression (see, for example, [2, 3, 4, 5]); it is based on the principles of minimal length coding 1, advanced by Solomonoff [6], Wallace and Boulton [7], Rissanen [8] and others (see also [9]); an overview of the theory is given in [10] and can be found in more detail in other papers cited there (see also [11]); SP theory was developed as an abstract model of any system for processing information, whether natural or artificial; in broad terms, the system receives \"new\" information from its environment and transfers it to a repository of \"old\" information; at the same time, it tries to compress the information as much as possible by finding patterns that match and fuse patterns or \"unify\" patterns that are the same."}, {"heading": "2.1 Computer models", "text": "Two computer models of the SP system have been developed: \u2022 SP62 is a partial realisation of the theory that does not transfer information from new to old. This model attempts to compress the new information in relation to old information by building up several alignments of the type shown below. SP62 also contains procedures for calculating the probabilities of conclusions that can be drawn from alignments. A somewhat earlier version of this model (SP61) is quite complete in [16]. Both versions are relatively robust and mature. \u2022 SP70 implements all the main elements of the theory, including the transfer of information from new to old. In addition to building several alignments such as SP62, the model assembles one or more alternative \"grammars\" for the information in New, using minimum length coding principles. This model and its application to unattended learning is described quite comprehensively in [18, 19]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Representation of knowledge", "text": "In the SP system, all kinds of knowledge are stored as arrays of atomic symbols in one or two dimensions, which are called patterns. In the previous work, the emphasis was on one-dimensional patterns (i.e. symbol sequences), but it is intended that the concepts will eventually be generalized to patterns in two dimensions. \u2022 For current purposes, we can define patterns and symbols as follows: \u2022 A pattern is a sequence of symbols limited by pattern endings such as \"(\" and \"), which are not shown in the examples in this paper. \u2022 A symbol is a chain of non-space symbols delimited by white space (spaces, newlines, etc.). \u2022 Each symbol can be matched with any other symbol, and for each symbol pair, the two symbols are either\" the same \"or\" different \"symbols, which represent a different result. \u2022 Symbols have no intrinsic meaning such as\" Add \"for the hieratic symbol + an associated symbol or a multiplicate pattern for the respective system."}, {"heading": "2.3 Processing knowledge", "text": "The process of building multiple alignments in the SP system described and illustrated here provides a uniform model for a variety of computational effects, including fuzzy pattern recognition, best-match information gathering, probabilistic and accurate thinking, unattended learning, planning, problem solving, and others, as described in [10]."}, {"heading": "2.3.1 Multiple alignments", "text": "In bioinformatics, multiple alignment is an arrangement of two or more patterns of DNA sequences or sequences of amino acid residues so that the matching symbols are aligned. Fig. 1 shows a typical example. The general idea is that by carefully \"stretching\" sequences as many symbols as possible are aligned with each other. A variety of measures of \"goodness\" of alignments are used, but they all tend to favor alignments in which the number of aligned symbols is high and the gaps between them are relatively small. In the SP framework, the concept of multiple alignment is modified as follows: \u2022 One or more of the sequences (called patterns, as described in Section 2.2) are considered \"new.\""}, {"heading": "2.3.2 Evaluation of alignments", "text": "As mentioned above, a \"good\" multiple alignment is one in which the New Pattern or Pattern can be economically encoded relative to the old patterns in alignment, and how is this assessment done? Each symbol has an associated \"weight,\" which is the number of bits needed to encode that symbol, and the weight is derived from the frequency of occurrence of the symbol in which that symbol appears (as described in Section 2.2) (a method similar to the known Huffman method), and the frequency value for each symbol is derived from the frequency value of the pattern (or patterns) in which that symbol appears (as described in Section 2.2). In the context of medical diagnoses, the frequency associated with a particular pattern is the frequency of occurrence of the disease represented by that pattern (see Section 3.1, below)."}, {"heading": "2.3.3 The building of multiple alignments", "text": "In bioinformatics, it is generally understood that the abstract \"space\" of alternative possible alignments between two or more patterns is astronomically large - with few exceptions - meaning that it cannot be searched exhaustively. All practical methods for finding \"good\" alignments between two or more sequences use heuristic methods such as \"mountaineering (or\" descent \"),\" beam search, \"genetic algorithms\" or the like, selectively and exclude large portions of the search space. Methods like these can provide good approximate solutions in a reasonable amount of time, but you can never be sure of finding the best possible solution (unless the sequences are very short and very few). Finding good multiple alignments in the SP system is no different. At the heart of the SP system for building multiple alignments is an improved version of \"dynamic programming\" to find complete matches and good partial matches between two patterns."}, {"heading": "2.3.4 Unsupervised learning", "text": "In its entirety, the SP model is conceived as a system that is created and compressed at the same time by transferring new information to its repository of old information. This abstract concept now has two stages: 1. The model creates new patterns that are incorporated into the repository of old patterns; 2. Further development of the model is necessary in order to unfold its full potential; 3. The model creates new patterns that are incorporated into the repository of old patterns."}, {"heading": "2.3.5 Computational complexity", "text": "The temporal complexity of the SP62 model in a serial processing environment is approximately O (log2n \u00d7 nm), where n is the size of the New Pattern or Patterns (in bits) and m is the total size of the Patterns in old (in bits). In a parallel processing environment, the temporal complexity O (log2 n \u00b7 n) can approximate depending on how well parallel processing is applied. Spatial complexity in serial or parallel environments is O (m). Further details can be found in [16]. In medical diagnosis, it seems reasonable to assume that there will normally be a relatively small maximum for the number of signs and symptoms (hereinafter abbreviated as \"symptoms\") shown by a patient. Accordingly, there should be a maximum size for the size of the series of new patterns used to represent the symptoms of the patient. If we consider this to be a constant value for n, then in a serial processing environment it is approximately O (and can approximate the complexity in a parallel environment)."}, {"heading": "3 Application of the SP system to medical di-", "text": "To a large extent, medical diagnosis can be seen as a problem of (blurred) pattern recognition: finding the best match between a particular symptom group for an individual patient and the symptoms associated with one or more diseases. However, causal considerations also play a role when, for example, it is assumed that a particular disease is caused by a bacterial or viral infection. This section provides an example of how the SP system can be applied to medical diagnosis, which is considered a process of pattern recognition; the system can also support causal considerations about medical problems, and this will be briefly discussed in Section 3.9.Other aspects of the proposals will be discussed in other sections."}, {"heading": "3.1 Describing diseases using SP patterns", "text": "< < p > Patterns > Patterns > Patterns and symptoms of an individual patient < p > Patterns and symptoms of an individual patient may be presented as a series of one or more new patterns. A pattern in the memory of old information may represent a disease and its associated symptoms or a combination of diseases (see Section 3.7.2, below), or may represent a cluster of symptoms that tend to occur together in two or more different diseases (see Section 3.5, below). In addition, there may be patterns that support Ro les (see Section 3.6, below).The frequency value of each of these patterns can be used to represent the absolute or relative frequency with which a particular disease or cluster of symptoms is found in a particular population. These numbers can be derived from epidemiological surveys or they can be estimated by medical experts."}, {"heading": "3.2 Multiple alignment and medical diagnosis", "text": "The diagnostic process can be modeled by building one or more multiple arrangements. Figure 6 shows the best arrangement created by SP62, with a series of new arrangements shown in Figure 5, \"John Smith and His Symptoms,\" and a series of old arrangements as shown in Figure 4, which represent illnesses or disease aspects. 5Such an arrangement can be interpreted as the result of a detection process. In this case, the symptoms that have been detected are those of influenza, as shown in column 2. In the following subsections, aspects of the arrangement and this interpretation are discussed."}, {"heading": "3.3 A \u2018framework\u2019 pattern", "text": "In an application such as this, it is convenient, but not strictly necessary, to add a \"frame pattern\" to the old patterns, as illustrated in column 1, which is a generalized pattern for diseases of all kinds, listing the main categories associated with diseases such as \"< dname > < / dname >\" (the name of the disease), \"< respiration > < / respiration >\" (the state of the patient's respiration) and \"< temperature > < / temperature >\" (the patient's temperature), but not setting specific values for a category. This frame pattern serves as an anchor for symbols in other patterns and facilitates the formation of multiple alignments according to the rules described in [10] and previous publications."}, {"heading": "3.4 The ordering of descriptors", "text": "In describing a patient's symptoms, it should make no difference whether \"high temperature\" is in front of \"runny nose\" or vice versa. However, within the SP framework, any pattern describing a disease or symptom group inevitably imposes an order in which categories of descriptors are defined. However, users of the system can specify the patient's symptoms in any order that is convenient. This is because symptoms are described using a series of new patterns and there is no intrinsic order among the new patterns provided to the system. In our example, new patterns were provided to the SP62 model in the order shown in Fig. 5, but in the orientation shown in Fig. 6, they appear in a completely different order of symbols. Note that this freedom in the order of descriptors applies only to whole patterns. If two or more symbols in a pattern coincide with one or two other symbols, they must appear in the same order of symbols."}, {"heading": "3.5 Dereferencing of pointers", "text": "As already mentioned, a symbol such as \"fever\" or \"flu symptoms\" in a pattern can serve as a reference or reference to another pattern that describes a cluster of symptoms that can occur in two or more different diseases. In Fig. 6, we can see how such references are \"dereferenced\" in the SP system. The \"flu symptoms\" symbol in column 2 is compared to the same symbol in column 3, where flu-like symptoms are listed. Likewise, the \"fever\" symbol in column 3 is compared to the same symbol in column 4, where the symptoms of fever or are listed."}, {"heading": "3.6 Uncertainties in diagnosis", "text": "Diagnosis is not an exact process: \u2022 Most diseases are \"familial similarity\" or > \"polythetic\" concepts, because the majority of symptoms associated with a particular disease are neither necessary nor sufficient to diagnose the disease: they are \"characteristic\" of the disease in the sense that such a symptom does not necessarily have to be present in every case and one of them can be associated with other diseases. \u2022 There may be errors in observing or recording the symptoms and they occur frequently. SP62 can take this kind of uncertainty into account in diagnosis in two ways: \u2022 Since it looks for a global best match among patterns, it does not depend on the presence or absence of a particular symptom. Note how SP62 managed to construct the orientation shown in Figure 6, even though there is no match with \"bad\" in the new pattern. < Appetite > poor < Appetite > bad < / Appetite > \"and\" yes \"in the new pattern.\""}, {"heading": "3.7 Weighing alternative hypotheses and the calculation of probabilities", "text": "In medical diagnosis, it is quite common for the physician to consider alternative hypotheses about what diseases or illnesses the patient may be suffering from. However, the SP framework provides a model for this process in the way the system builds alternative arrangements for each given pattern or a series of patterns in New. Orientations - and the corresponding diagnoses - can be evaluated as follows. As already mentioned (Section 2.3.2), for each arrangement a \"compression difference\" is calculated, as shown in Equation 1. The value Sei used in this equation can be translated into an absolute probability for the given arrangement: P = 2 \u2212 Be. (2) For each individual arrangement (the jth arrangement) in a series of alternative arrangements, a1... an encoding the same symbols from New, a relative probability can be calculated for the same arrangement of new, a relative probability for the arrangement of new arrangements."}, {"heading": "3.7.1 \u2018Explaining away\u2019", "text": "The symptoms of influenza and smallpox are quite similar, except for the very pronounced rash and blisters that occur in smallpox. The example shown in Fig. 6 does not say anything about whether John Smith had a rash and blisters or not. If one had seen a rash and blisters, this would have been presented as \"< skin > normal < / skin >.\" Given this lack of information about the condition of the patient's skin, he may have either flu or smallpox, but he is much more likely to have the former than the latter, as the calculated probabilities show. If \"< skin > rash with blisters < / skin >\" is added to the symptoms recorded in New, and if SP62 is executed again with the expanded set of symptoms, the best alignment the system has found is similar to the one in Fig. 6, but with the pattern for smallpox. (the second pattern in Fig. 4) instead of a pattern for a < the other one with < the same pattern in < someone with a pattern in < and the other."}, {"heading": "3.7.2 A patient may suffer from two or more diseases at the same time", "text": "As mentioned above, it is possible for a patient to suffer from two or more diseases at the same time. If we want the system to calculate probabilities for disease combinations, then the repository of old patterns must contain patterns, the combinations of these kinds. Any such pattern can be economically constructed by using references to component diseases, just as symptom clusters can be referred to, as in Section 3.5.As with individual diseases, frequency values for a combination of diseases can be derived from population surveys or according to the judgment of medical experts. In the absence of direct evidence of a statistical link between two or more diseases, it seems reasonable to assume that they are statistically independent. In such cases, frequency values can be derived directly from normalized values for disease frequency."}, {"heading": "3.8 Inferences and the diagnostic cycle", "text": "In multiple alignment, as shown in Fig. 6, each symbol within an old pattern that does not match a symbol in New represents a conclusion that can be drawn from alignment. In this example, we can conclude from alignment, among other things, that the patient is likely to have a cough and headache and that standard treatment for influenza is required. Probabilities of these conclusions can be calculated as described in [15]. If a \"good\" alignment makes a prediction about a marker that can be found in the patient's blood or something that can be observed in an X-ray, this can be interpreted as a suggestion to the physician that he or she should order a corresponding blood test or X-ray. If tests of this kind or any other type of examination are prompted as a result of conclusions drawn from preliminary voting, the results of these examinations, together with the original symptoms, can be fed back into the system as new information."}, {"heading": "3.9 Causal reasoning", "text": "Apart from the types of conclusions just described, medical diagnosis often seems to involve a \"deeper\" way of thinking about the causes of symptoms and diseases, using knowledge of bacteria, viruses, anatomy, physiology, etc. The SP framework supports a variety of ways of thinking, including probabilistic \"deductive\" thinking, abductive thinking, non-monotonous thinking, and (as we have seen in Section 3.7.1) \"clearing the way\" (see [15]). Thus, there are reasons to believe that it may be possible within the SP framework to extend the pattern recognition analysis described above to causal ways of thinking. Recent studies have confirmed this expectation. In the SP framework, the input-output relationships of each subsystem within a larger system can be modelled as a set of patterns, and causal relationships can be established by convergence of outputs to inputs."}, {"heading": "3.10 Classes and subclasses of diseases", "text": "One of the attractions of the SP system is that it presents concepts on several levels of abstraction (e.g. \"cat,\" \"mammal,\" \"vertebrate,\" \"animal\") in an object-oriented way and, by constructing several abstractions, enables a particular entity (such as \"my cat Tibs\") to be recognized on several levels of abstraction [10, 15]. To some extent, this idea is already illustrated by the example shown in Figure 6. The concept of \"fever,\" represented by the pattern in column 4 of the figure, can be considered a superclass encompassing all diseases in which the patient may have a fever. Likewise, the pattern of flu symptoms (column 3 in the figure) can be considered a superclass of diseases in which such symptoms may occur. In contrast to the classification of animals and plants, the hierarchy of diseases tends to be relatively flat."}, {"heading": "3.11 Acquisition of knowledge", "text": "By and large, the knowledge required in any artificial system for medical diagnosis can be obtained \"manually\" from experts or written sources, or it can be obtained by automatic or semi-automatic abstraction of knowledge from raw medical data, or by a combination of both. SP has the potential to facilitate one or all of these processes."}, {"heading": "3.11.1 Elicitation of expert knowledge", "text": "The above example should make it clear that the SP system is a means of presenting medical knowledge in a form that is simple and intuitive. Perhaps, the simplicity of presenting all knowledge as a pattern is less important than the fact that this system allows computer-aided knowledge to be expressed in a form that reflects the natural structure of the original concepts. This feature of the system should facilitate traditional ways of gaining knowledge from experts or written sources. Medical experts should have little difficulty expressing their knowledge directly in the form of SP patterns. Given that such experts are frequently employed and their time is in any case expensive, there are advantages if at least part of the process of building computer-aided knowledge databases can be carried out by knowledge engineers without special medical training, and these people should be able to derive much of the necessary knowledge from medical textbooks and other written sources."}, {"heading": "3.11.2 Automatic or semi-automatic learning", "text": "Section 2.3.4 presents a sketchy description of how the SP70 model learns the types of structures found in the syntax of natural languages. As indicated in this section, this learning style is probably not entirely appropriate for medical data, but the same general principles should apply. This subsection broadly describes how the SP system can be applied to learning medical knowledge. Simply, the simplest way of \"learning\" is to keep a record of the symptoms of each specific patient and the corresponding diagnosis. This is the principle of \"case-based learning\" and, in conjunction with a system that finds ways of finding good partial matches between the description of a new patient and the stored knowledge of old patients, it can be very practical and useful in making new diagnoses. As the SP system is able to find good partial matches between patterns, it could be used in this way, as in Section 4.5, below.However, physicians usually recognize a degree of medical knowledge in a cluster, such as Section 3.10 describes a cluster of several diseases:"}, {"heading": "3.12 Integration", "text": "The very simple format for presenting the knowledge described in Section 2.2 should be as \"universal\" as possible in the sense that it should represent a wide range of different types of knowledge, and this should be much more true if the concept of pattern has been generalised to two dimensions. Similarly, the concept of multiple alignment described in Section 2.3 should be a \"universal\" model for a wide range of different types of processing: pattern recognition, information gathering, different ways of thinking, etc. As far as these two objectives are feasible, they should facilitate the seamless integration of different uses, including medical diagnoses. For example, it should be relatively easy to apply a natural language interface to an SP system for medical diagnosis or to integrate the type of visual pattern recognition required for diagnosing different types of skin cancer with other types of medical expertise."}, {"heading": "4 Comparison with alternatives", "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, a variety of philosophies and systems have been applied to the problem of medical diagnosis. In this section I will briefly discuss some of the more prominent of these approaches and compare them with the SP approach as described in this paper."}, {"heading": "4.1 Rule-based systems", "text": "Rule-based systems (such as the well-known MYCIN system [24]) contain if-then rules where the \"if\" side of a rule is a collection of one or more conditions for the rule connected by logical operators such as \"AND,\" \"OR\" (which can be inclusive or exclusive), and \"NOT.\" In contrast, the SP system expresses all knowledge in the form of patterns. At first glance, SP patterns lack the meaningfulness of ifs-then rules. But the effect of such rules can be modeled within the SP system if necessary [12, 17]. And if medical diagnoses are seen as a process of pattern recognition (as in this paper), then SP patterns and SP frames are probably a more natural and flexible medium for displaying and processing knowledge than if-then rules. To illustrate this last point, we can see the characteristics of influencing by a rule such as: IF chills AND headache AND the likelihood of having a painful muscle AND (9) as a rule associated with a sore nose."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Probabilities", "text": "In systems such as MYCIN and some of its successors, the \"probabilities\" calculated by the system are actually standards of trust without the theoretical foundations of probability theory. In other systems... \"formal approaches based on probability theory are precise, but can be cumbersome and not intuitive to apply.\" [25, p. 272] In contrast, the SP framework enables the simple calculation of true probabilities (see Section 3.7 and [15]) and strict compliance with established theory (as described in sources such as [20])."}, {"heading": "4.2 Neural networks", "text": "One of the attractions of artificial neural networks in support of medical diagnosis is that they can be trained with appropriate data, thus avoiding the need for the manual compilation of knowledge by medical experts or knowledge engineers. \"However, a major disadvantage is that\" knowledge \"embedded [in the neural network] is encoded cryptically as a large number of weights and activation values. Consequently, the lack of tools to validate neural networks is often one of the reasons that restrict their use in practice, especially in the context of medical diagnosis, where physicians cannot trust a system without explaining their decisions.\" [26, pp. 141-142] Although there may be scope for extracting rules from a trained neural network (ibid.), this adds complexity and uncertainty to the technology, defeating the other main attraction of a neural network: as classifier specific cases in the sense of the knowledge learned. As a system for unsupervised learning of knowledge structures, the potential raw data cannot yet be understood by the SP."}, {"heading": "4.3 Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory", "text": "Given the variability of diseases and other uncertainties associated with medical diagnosis (Section 3.6), the field of blurred logic (and of blurred set theory) has the obvious appeal that it was designed with the explicit intention of providing a model for \"blurred\" concepts and \"blurred\" operations thereon (see, for example, [27, 28]). In purely theoretical terms, the field of blurred logic can be criticized because it introduces a fairly sophisticated conceptual framework to take into account the undoubtedly blurred nature of many human concepts, but this conceptual framework is poorly integrated with other ideas about the nature of human knowledge. On the contrary, SP theory has emerged from psychological research and offers a unified model for several aspects of human perception and cognition [10]. Reflections of this kind can be dismissed as not relevant to the practices of medical diagnosis."}, {"heading": "4.4 Bayesian networks", "text": "Two of the main differences between Bayesian networks (see, for example, [23]) and the SP system are: \u2022 Bayesian networks focus on the binary relationship between a given node in the network and each of its parent nodes (if any). In this respect, they inherit part of the thinking behind ifs-then-rules. In contrast, the SP system is geared toward representing and processing associations (expressed as patterns) that can contain any number of elements. \u2022 Accordingly, each Bayesian network stores its statistical knowledge in the form of conditional probability tables, one for each node in the network. In contrast, the SP system stores its statistical knowledge in the form of integrators, one for each pattern that represents the absolute or relative frequency of that pattern in some areas.These and the related differences seem to underlie some of the obvious disadvantages of Bayesian networks compared to the SP framework: \u2022 The directional character of Bayesian networks does not contradict the Bayesian framework of probabilities, which are not easily medicalculative in nature or conditional in nature."}, {"heading": "4.5 Case-based reasoning", "text": "A great attraction of case-based thinking in medical diagnosis (see, for example, [31, 32]) is that, compared to many alternatives, it can greatly simplify the process of acquiring the necessary knowledge. In its simplest form, a case-based system only requires the description of one or more specific examples of each disease and a search algorithm that can find exact matches or good partial matches between the symptoms of a particular patient and one or more of the stored records. In some ways, the SP system is like a case-based system, and it could actually be used like a case-based system. To use it this way, each of the old patterns should represent a specific case (including its diagnosis), and the new pattern or pattern should represent the symptoms of a patient requiring a diagnosis. The system's ability to identify exact matches and good partial matches between patterns makes it possible to retrieve patterns for previously diagnosed cases that resemble a particular case."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "As we have seen, the SP system accommodates the most important elements of medical diagnosis, which are considered to be a pattern recognition problem, and there is reason to believe that it can also provide support for causal considerations in medical diagnosis. However, the SP62 model is only a prototype for research and demonstration purposes. It is not yet an \"industrial strength\" system. The main developments needed to achieve this goal are: \u2022 Providing a well-designed graphical user interface. \u2022 There is likely to be scope for improvements in the search methods used within the system. \u2022 There is scope for the application of parallel processing both to improve the scaling properties of the system (Section 2.3.5) and to increase the absolute processing speed. \u2022 Of course, appropriate knowledge needs to be provided to the system. For each scope, a set of patterns needs to be developed describing the diseases and symptom clusters in this area. \u2022 At some stage, after developing a realistic knowledge base, the performance of the system needs to be validated against the medical experts \"judgment."}], "references": [{"title": "Rampal, Model selection for medical diagnosis, Decision Support Systems, Decision Support Systems", "author": ["P.
