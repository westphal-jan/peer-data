INTRODUCTION", "text": "One of the most important functions of the news media is to serve as a place for critical review and presentation of information on social, political, economic and ideological issues of the day. Many of these questions are controversial in the sense that they provoke arguments in which people express strongly conflicting opinions. [10] For this reason, journalists often have to take special precautions and make careful language choices when writing about controversial topics. This can often manifest itself as different types of use of language, for example news sources will often use a number of terms to signal that a controversy exists, such as \"outcry,\" \"riot\" and \"uproar.\" It has been theorized that journalists become vulnerable to the ideologies, attitudes and pressures of their organization, as well as unspoken rules and norms. These submissions can influence the specific language used to discuss controversial topics within a particular news source."}, {"heading": "2. PREVIOUS WORK", "text": "The unique structure of Wikipedia as a collaborative venture has been used by Rad and Barbosa [11], who recognize controversies based on mutual regression, bipolarity in the collaborative network and / or mutually reinforced ratings for editors and articles (controversial editors work in controversial articles).The fact that an article on Wikipedia is controversial was then used to assess the level of controversy of other documents (e.g. websites) by assigning it to related Wikipedia articles [9].Pennacchiotti and Popescu [10] recognize controversies around celebrities on Twitter.

NEWS ARTICLES", "text": "The data was provided by NewsCred, which aggregates news content from thousands of news sources and provides it via an API (further described in Diakopoulos et al. [7]). We selected 15 high-volume NewsCred sources and looked at their articles over the period from March to September 2013. The main criterion we used for this selection was diversity - both national and regional - while trying to keep the list relatively short to facilitate analysis and presentation: CNN, Reuters, Usa Today, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, News Day, Minneapolis Star Tribune, Houston Chronicle, Philadelphia Inquirer, Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Huffington Post, New York Times, ProPublica and Talking Points Memo.Two data collection tasks were completed. First, we collected a random subset of articles to obtain high-frequency words."}, {"heading": "4. CONTROVERSIAL WORDS", "text": "Whether a word is controversial or not is a highly subjective and context-dependent matter, but only 25 of them helped get more people involved than usual in the CrowdFlower crowdsourcing platform (https: / / crowdflower.com /), and we ran a comment campaign with a relatively large pool of commenters. We employed 25 US-based commenters hired by CrowdFlower crowdsourcing platform (https: / / / crowdflower.com /) and paid $0.80 (USD) for every 100 words commented, following the platform's standard pricing practices. The original list was composed of the most common buzzwords in a large random sample of articles. We filtered this list to keep just one word by using a part-of-speech tagger."}, {"heading": "5. CONTROVERSY AND SENTIMENT", "text": "Using the data sets described above, we explore the vocabulary used in articles mentioning controversial / non-controversial topics, using a set of lexical resources associated with sentiment and bias. The general methodology is to look at every word w in our vocabulary of 462 topics and every media source s in our list of 15 news media. Then, collect all articles in the sources that contain the word w, eliminate duplicate and nearly duplicate articles (typically a by-product of articles that have multiple URLs) and combine all articles into a topical (and very large) superarticle for analysis. The analysis consists of examining this content using a lexical resource, counting the proportion of words that correspond to a specific category in the lexical resource. We consider the following feeling lexicons: a. Affective norms for English words3 (ANEW) is a set of normative English words for emotional ratings of 2.476."}, {"heading": "CNN SWN \u2212", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "CNN SWN +", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "CNN ANEW \u2212", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "CNN ANEW +", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "CNN MWNOp \u2212", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "CNN MWNOp +", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "CNN Gen Inq \u2212", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "CNN Gen Inq +", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "CNN Bias", "text": "Third, the use of positive terms on non-controversial topics is more likely than on controversial topics. This is statistically significant for p < 0.01 for 40 of the 60 conditions, with 16 ties and 4 cases with a significant difference in the opposite direction. Strong emotions. Three of our lexicographs (ANEW, MicroWNOp and SentiWordNet) contain values that allow us to distinguish between weak and strong emotional. We observe that the use of strong emotional words on controversial topics is less likely. This is statistically significant for p < 0.01 for 32 of the 45 conditions (15 sources and 3 sentiment lexicographs), with only 1 of the remaining conditions showing a significant difference in the other direction. Differences between the different sources we find a wide variety in the different treatment of controversial and non-controversial topics, in terms of the use of biased and emotional words. In terms of statistical significance, the more marked difference between controversial and non-controversial topics has been observed."}, {"heading": "6.

DISCUSSION", "text": "In this study, we found that controversial topics are often framed by negative emotions. Many of the terms that have been discussed controversially often relate to social problems and violence, such as firearms, fighting, crime, victims and shootings, or war. There may not be as many ways to discuss some of these topics in a non-negative light. However, other terms could be viewed in a negative, positive, or even neutral light depending on the context in which they are used, for example, terms like health, safety, or jobs. However, since these words often raise larger ideological issues of government spending, privacy, or the economy, frames may emerge that are more antagonistic. Instead of highlighting the positive aspects of one's own perspective, an author may choose to highlight the negative aspects of opposing views. Furthermore, we found that controversial topics also contain less strongly emotional words."}], "references": [{"title": "Harmony and dissonance: Organizing the people\u2019s voices on political controversies", "author": ["R.
