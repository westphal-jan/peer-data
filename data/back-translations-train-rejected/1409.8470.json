Recent findings in cognitive psychology showed that the quantum probability can fully describe human decisions within an elegant framework. Their results suggest that human thoughts, before making a decision, are considered as overlapping waves that can mutually influence each other and influence the final decision. In this work, we propose a new Bayesian network based on the psychological insights of cognitive scientists. We conducted experiments with two very well-known Bayesian networks from literature. The results obtained showed that quanta such as the Eyesian network can drastically influence the probable conclusions, especially when the level of uncertainty of the network is very high (no evidence is observed). If the level of uncertainty is very low, then the proposed quantum-like network collapses to its classical counterpart VE VE, VT ET EN, VT ET EN, VT E1, VT ET E1, VT, VT E1, VT E1, VT Eca, Veca, Veccia T21 / Tie, VT 1."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The problem of violations of the axioms of probability dates back to the early 1960s. [32] This has influenced modern psychology by showing that man violates the laws of probability theory when he makes decisions. The principle that man is constantly violated is defined by the principle of the sure thing. It is a concept that is widely used in game theory and was originally introduced by the Law. This principle is fundamental in probability theory and states that if one prefers action A over B under the state of world X, one always prefers action A over B, even if the state of the world is non-specific. Cognitive psychologists A. Tversky and D. Khamenman are also researching more situations in which the classical theory of probability cannot be reconciled."}, {"heading": "1.1 Motivation: Violations in The Two-Stage Gamblings", "text": "In their experiment, participants at each stage were asked to decide whether they were playing a game of chance that had an equal chance of winning $200 or losing $100. However, Figure 3 illustrates the experiment. Three conditions were verified: 1. Participants were informed if they had won the first game; 2. Participants were informed if they had lost the first game; 3. Participants did not know the outcome of the first game; The two-stage game of chance was one of the first experiments used to determine whether the ure Thing principle would also be verified with people who were unaware of the existence of this principle. Results of the experiment [71] showed that this principle is constantly violated and consequently people do not follow the laws of probability theory and Boolean logic. Overall results showed that the participants who knew they had won the first game again decided that they knew the principle of the participants that they had lost the principle of the participants."}, {"heading": "1.2 Research Questions", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves, and that they are able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

The following sections describe how classical theory and quantum theory develop in the subsequent trial."}, {"heading": "2.1 Space", "text": "In classical probability theory, events are contained in example rooms. An example room corresponds to the totality of all possible results of an experiment or a random trial. [31] In assessing whether a suspect is guilty or innocent, the example room is represented by Figure 5, which represents the example room of a defendant as guilty or innocent.In quantum probability theory, events are contained in the so-called Hilbert spaces.A Hilbert space H can be considered a generalization and expansion of Euclidean space into spaces with any finite or infinite number or dimension. It can be considered a vector space of complex numbers and provides the structure of an inner product to allow the measurement of angles and lengths [40]. Space is spanned by a series of orthonormal vectors H = {guilty, innocent}. Together, these vectors form a basis for space. Figure 6 represents a part representing a guilty space or another space that is normally innocent."}, {"heading": "2.2 Events", "text": "In classical probability theory, events can be defined by a set of results to which a probability is assigned. They correspond to a subset of the sample space in which they are contained. Events can be mutually exclusive and they obey set theory. This means that operations such as the intersection or unification of events are well defined. Since they respect set theory, the distribution axiom is also defined between sets. In our example, they can be regarded as two mutually exclusive events. According to quantum probability theory, events correspond to a subspace spanned by a subset of the base vectors contained in Hilbert space. Events can be orthogonal, that is, they can be mutually exclusive. Operations such as intersection and unification of events are well defined when the events are spanned by the same base vector. [17] In quantum theory, all events contained in a Hilbert space are defined by a superlative state."}, {"heading": "2.3 System State", "text": "A system state is nothing more than a probability function Pr, which maps events in probability numbers, i.e. positive real numbers between 0 and 1. In classical theory, the system state exactly corresponds to its definition. There is a function that is responsible for assigning a probability value to the result of an event. If the event matches the sample space, the system state assigns a probability value of 1 to the event. If the event is empty, it assigns a probability of 0 to the event. In our example, the juror is not told otherwise, then the probability that the defendant is guilty is Pr (guilty) = 0.5. In quantum theory, the probability that a suspect is guilty is given by the square size of the projection from the superposition state S into the subspace containing the observed event. Figure 8 shows an example. If the juror is not told anything about the guilt of a defendant, then, according to quantum theory, we start with an overlay of the state S in the subspace in which the observed event is going on."}, {"heading": "2.4 State Revision", "text": "State revision corresponds to the situation in which, after observing an event, we are interested in observing other events since the previous event occurred. In classical theory, this is determined by the conditional probability formula Pr (B | A) = Pr (A) B) Pr (B). So, suppose that evidence has been presented to the jury proving that the defendant is indeed guilty, what is the probability that he is innocent? This is calculated as follows: Pr (innocent | guilty) = Pr (innocent) Pr (guilty) = 0Since the events are mutually exclusive, their intersection is empty, resulting in a zero probability value. In quantum theory, state revision is given by first projecting the surveillance state S into the subspace representing the observed event, and then normalizing the projection so that the resulting vector has a unit length."}, {"heading": "3 The Path Trajectory Principle", "text": "In order to describe direct dependencies between a number of variables, path diagrams are usually used.

Probability can be calculated by determining the product of individual probabilities for each transition from one state to another by using conditional probabilities. According to Figure 10, the probability of transition from state A, followed by state B and ending in state C, i.e., Pr (A \u2192 B \u2192 C) = Pr (B | A) \u00b7 Pr (C | B) \u00b7 Pr (7) In a quantum path diagram model, the calculation of probabilities for a one-way trajectory is similar to the classical Markov model."}, {"heading": "3.2 Multiple Indistinguishable Trajectories", "text": "An indistinguishable path consists in transferring from an initial state A to a final state D by deviating from several possible paths without knowing which path was taken to reach the final state. Figure 11 shows an example of multiple indistinguishable paths. This is known as the one-way principle and is in accordance with the law of total probability. Thus, if one does not observe which path was taken to reach the final state D, one can simply calculate this probability by adding up the individual probabilities of each path. This is in accordance with the law of total probability. Thus, if one follows Figure 11 to reach the state D, one begins in state A, one can take the path A \u2192 B \u2192 D or the path A \u2192 C \u2192 D. The final probability is given by: Pr (A \u2192 D) = Pr (A) \u00b7 Pr (B | A) \u00b7 Pr (A) \u00b7 Pr (A) \u00b7 Pr (A) Pr (A \u00b7 A \u00b7 C) Qur (C \u00b7 C) (C \u00b7 A \u00b7 C) Pr (C) Pr \u00b7 A \u00b7 C (C) theory is assumed by Pr \u00b7 C (C)."}, {"heading": "4 The Interference Term", "text": "Quantum theory allows the modeling of the decision system as a wave moving through a state space until a final decision is made. Interference can be considered from this perspective as a chain of waves in an overlay state coming from different directions. When these waves collide, one can experience a destructive effect (one wave destroys the other) or a constructive effect (one wave merges with another), in both cases affecting the final probabilities of each wave. Psychological findings showed that this happens not only on a microscopic scale (such as electrons), but also in a macroscopic environment [44, 61, 22]. In this section, we will show how to derive the concept of interference by taking into account only known properties of complex numbers [48]. The concept of interference can be derived in two different ways: (1) from the general formula of probability of unification of N mutually exclusive events and (2) from the total law of probability."}, {"heading": "4.1 Deriving the Interference Term from the Union of N Mutually Exclusive Events", "text": "The classical probability formula of the union of two mutual extraordinary events is given by the Born rule, i.e.: Pr (A) = Pr (A) + Pr (B) + Pr (B) + Pr (B) + Pr (B) (12) Again, the relationship between a classical probability function and a quantum probability amplitude corresponds to the square size of a complex amplitude. It is obtained by multiplying the probability amplitude with its complex conjugation, i.e., the jealousy-related amplitude A (2) = jealousy-related aversion A (2) = jealousy-related aversion A. Taking into account the equation 13, one can write an overlay state between two mutually exclusive events A and B in the following way:"}, {"heading": "4.2 Deriving the Interference Term from the Law of Total Probability", "text": "These interference terms can also be derived directly from the law of total probability \u00b2 \u00b2.

John always calls the police when he hears the alarm, but sometimes confuses the sound of the alarm with the ringtone of his phone, which leads to a misleading phone call to the police.

With respect to the prisoner's quantum mechanical quantum game, many papers have been proposed in the literature formalizing the problem in a quantum approach. For example, [61] a quantum dynamic Markov model for the prisoner's quantum mechanical game suggested. In their model, the authors represented the belief and actions of the players as overlapping in a quantum state vector. If the player knew the information about the opponent's action, the supercharge state collapsed into a new state that was compatible with the opponent's action."}, {"heading": "10.2 Conjunction and Diskunction Errors", "text": "Other situations in which the laws of probability are violated correspond to disjunction or conjunction errors. A conjunction error occurs when specific conditions are assumed to be more likely than a single general one. A disjunction error, on the other hand, consists in the assumption that the disjunction of two events is at least as likely as one of the two events separately. Several papers in the literature have used quantum probability models to explain these errors. [34] For example, a quantum probabilistic model has been developed to explain errors when preferences are made to a series of events, more precisely, the conjunction fallacy. [19] The authors also focused on quantum models to explain the conjunction and [26] focused on disjunction fallacies. The first experiments in which these errors were observed were conducted by [71]. An alternative model for conjunction and disjunction errors corresponds to [70].

Recent work in cognitive psychology revealed that quantum probability theory offers another method of calculating probabilities without falling into the limitations that classical probabilities have modeled cognitive systems of decision-making. Quantum probability theory can also be seen as a generalization of classical probability theory, since it also includes classical probabilities as a special case."}, {"heading": "A A Grid Search Approach to Find Quantum Parameters", "text": "The most naive approach to parameter search is the grid search method. In this approach, a grid is placed over the parameter space and the data is evaluated at each grid intersection and the parameters that lead to the maximum performance of an algorithm are returned. [55] However, the grid search has the problem of being unlimited, since an unlimited number of parameters are available to be tested. In the context of this work, this is not a problem, because we always have a limit. The values of a cosine function can all be specified for angles between the range [0,2\u03c0]. The grid search approach is a very naive method of finding parameters in the parameter space. In fact, there are several advanced parameter search algorithms in the literature that do not have high compilation costs. The motivation behind the use of the grid search approach is that the variability in this work is almost the computational time of other advanced methods like the use of the grid search method."}],

community for deriving probabilistic inferences. However, modern cognitive psychology has revealed that human decisions could not follow the rules of classical probability theory, because humans cannot process large amounts of data in order to make judgements. Consequently, the inferences performed are based on limited data coupled with several heuristics, leading to violations of the law of total probability. This means that probabilistic graphical models based on classical probability theory are too limited to fully simulate and explain various aspects of human decision making. Quantum probability theory was developed in order to accommodate the paradoxical findings that the classical theory could not explain. Recent findings in cognitive psychology revealed that quantum probability can fully describe human decisions in an elegant framework. Their findings suggest that, before taking a decision, human thoughts are seen as superposed waves that can interfere with each other, influencing the final decision. In this work, we propose a new Bayesian Network based on the psychological findings of cognitive scientists. We made experiments with two very well known Bayesian Networks from the literature. The results obtained revealed that the quantum like Bayesian Network can affect drastically the probabilistic inferences, specially when the levels of uncertainty of the network are very high (no pieces of evidence observed). When the levels of uncertainty are very low, then the proposed quantum like network collapses to its classical counterpart.
