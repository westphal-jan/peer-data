Nowadays, authorship attribution,for both information retrieval and analysis, has gained great importance in the context of security, trust and copyright preservation. This work proposes an innovative multi-agent driven machine learning technique that has been developed for authorship attribution. By means of a preprocessing for word-grouping and time-period related analysis of the common lexicon, we determine a bias reference level for the recurrence frequency of the words within analysed texts, and then train a Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBPNN)-based classifier to identify the correct author. The main advantage of the proposed approach lies in the generality of the semantic analysis, which can be applied to different contexts and lexical domains, without requiring any modification. Moreover, the proposed system is able to incorporate an external input, meant to tune the classifier, and then self-adjust by means of continuous learning reinforcement.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 11:10:23 GMT  (648kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8484v1", "Published on: Proceedings of the XV Workshop \"Dagli Oggetti agli Agenti\" (WOA 2014), Catania, Italy, Sepember. 25-26, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Published on: Proceedings of the XV Workshop \"Dagli Oggetti agli Agenti\" (WOA 2014), Catania, Italy, Sepember. 25-26, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG cs.MA", "authors": ["christian napoli", "giuseppe pappalardo", "emiliano tramontana"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.8484"}, "pdf": {"name": "1409.8484.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An agent-driven semantical identifier using radial basis neural networks and reinforcement learning", "authors": ["C.

EXTRACTING SEMANTICS FROM LEXICON", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to go in search of a solution."}, {"heading": "III. THE RBPNN CLASSIFIER AGENT", "text": "For the work proposed, we use a variation based on Neural Networks (RBNN). RBNNs have a topology similar to the common FeedForward Neural Networks (FFNN) with BackPropagation Training Algorithms (BPTA): the primary difference lies only in the activation function, which, instead of being a sigmoid function or a similar activation function, represents a statistical distribution or a statistically significant mathematical function. Indeed, the selection of transfer functions is crucial to the speed of convergence in approximation and classification problems [22]. The types of activation functions used for Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) must meet some important characteristics in order to maintain the generalization capabilities of ANNs. In addition, these functions have to preserve the decision limits of probable neural networks."}, {"heading": "A. The RBPNN structure and topology", "text": "In an RBPNN, both the input and the first hidden layer can correspond exactly to the PNN architecture: the input neurons are used as distribution units that return the same input values to all neurons in the first hidden layer, which for historical reasons are called pattern units. In a PNN, each sample product of the input pattern v is passed through a weight vector W (0) and then performs a nonlinear operation to the result. This nonlinear operation returns the output x (1), which is then provided to the following summary layer. While a common sigmoid function is used for a standard FFNN with BPTA, in a PNN the activation function is an exponential one, so that for the j-esime neurons the output isx (1) j exp (0) j exp (| W (2), where the predefined activation function can be modified or substituted."}, {"heading": "B. Layer size for a RBPNN", "text": "While the sample layer is only a nonlinear processing layer, the summation layer selectively adds up the output of the first hidden layer. The output layer fulfills the nonlinear mapping such as classification, approximation, and prediction. In fact, the first hidden layer of the RBPNN is responsible for performing the basic task expected of a neural network [28]. In order to achieve a proper classification of the input data set, i.e. the analyzed texts to be attributed to the authors, the size of the input layer should correspond to the exact number of NF of different lexical groups given to the RBPNN, while the size of the sample units should correspond to the number of samples, i.e. the analyzed texts, NS. The number of summation units in the second hidden layer should correspond to the number of output devices we are interested in correctly recognizing the loudspeakers (Figure 5)."}, {"heading": "C. Reinforcement learning", "text": "In order to continuously update the reference database for our system, a statically trained NN would not be sufficient for the purpose of the work. As the goal of the presented system is to have an expanded database of text samples for classification and recognition, the agent-driven identification should dynamically follow the changes in such a database. If a new entry is made, it means that the RBPNN database should also be properly managed to ensure a continuous adaptive control for enhancing learning. Furthermore, it is desirable that a human supervisor submits proposals when the system begins to work. Human activities relate to the provision of new entries in the text database and to the elimination of misclassifications made by the RBPNN. We used a supervised control configuration (see Figure 6) where the external control is provided by the actions and decisions of a human operator."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP", "text": "The proposed RBPNN architecture was tested on the basis of several examples of text coming from public speeches by various people both from the present and the past era; each sample of text was given to the pre-processing agent, who extracted some features (see Section II), then these results were given to the classification agent; the total number of examples was 344, and we used 258 of them for training the classification agent and 86 for validation; the text examples, both for training and validation, came from various people who gave a speech (from A. Einstein to G. Lewis), as shown in Figure 7. Given the flexible structure of the implemented learning model, the word groups are not fixed and can be modified, added or removed over time through an external tuning activity; by using the number of words in a group, rather than a word-by-word count, the multi-agent system then realizes a statistically indicated textual classification of the most likely person to be identified and the most likely to be identified."}, {"heading": "V. RELATED WORKS", "text": "Multiple generative models can be used to characterize datasets that determine characteristics and enable the grouping of data into classes. Generative models are based on stochastic block structures [33], or on \"Infinite Hidden Relational Models\" [34], and \"Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel\" [35]. The main problem of class-based models is that such solutions are able to describe. Since the definition of a class depends on attributes, there is a risk that the existing classes will be replicated for each new attribute. E.g. such models would not be able to organize similarities between classes. \"and\" Dogs \"as children's classes.\""}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper presented a multi-agent system, in which an agent analyzes fragments of text and another agent, consisting of an RBPNN classifier, performs a probabilistic clustering. It has succeeded in identifying the most likely author of a given list for the text samples examined, and the provided identification can be used to supplement and integrate a comprehensive verification system or other software systems that attempt to automatically identify the author of a written text. The RBPNN classifier agent is continuously trained using enhanced learning techniques to follow a potential correction provided by a human supervisor or agent who learns about supervision, and the developed system has also been able to cope with new data that is continuously fed into the database to improve the adaptability of its cooperating agents and their thinking on the basis of Ns."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This work was supported by the project PRIME in the framework of POR FESR Sicilia 2007-2013 and the project PRISMA PON04a2 A / F in the framework of PON 2007-2013."}], "references": [{"title": "Simplified firefly algorithm for 2d image key-points search", "author": ["C.

documents in digital form, and the deception possibility raise bound to the essence of digital documents and the way they are spread, the authorship attribution problem has constantly increased its relevance. Nowadays, authorship attribution, for both information retrieval and analysis, has gained great importance in the context of security, trust and copyright preservation. This work proposes an innovative multi-agent driven machine learning technique that has been developed for authorship attribution. By means of a preprocessing for word-grouping and timeperiod related analysis of the common lexicon, we determine a bias reference level for the recurrence frequency of the words within analysed texts, and then train a Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBPNN)-based classifier to identify the correct author. The main advantage of the proposed approach lies in the generality of the semantic analysis, which can be applied to different contexts and lexical domains, without requiring any modification. Moreover, the proposed system is able to incorporate an external input, meant to tune the classifier, and then self-adjust by means of continuous learning reinforcement.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
