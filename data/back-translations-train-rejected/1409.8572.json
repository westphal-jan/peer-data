Recently, CARS has addressed this problem by linking the user's interest to the user's situation (time, place, friends). However, they cannot help recommending the same document under the same circumstances. As a result, a small set of documents is repeatedly recommended, which are then considered favorite documents, but the largest result in Exr / Exp is often performed within a short period of time by the Thompson Sampling (TS) section, but its disadvantage is the lack of document freshness in the recommendation. The freshness of documents can be considered the strength of Exploration / Exploration documents. In fact, the greatest result in Exploration / Exploration documents is performed by the Thompson Sampling (TS) section, but its disadvantage is the lack of document freshness in the recommendation. The freshness of documents can be considered the strength of Exploration documents as the strength of Exploration / Exploration documents."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "We refer below to techniques that examine the different dimensions of our problem. Multi-Armed Bandit Problem in RS. Recently, the researchers addressed the problem of multi-armed bandits in RS by looking at the behavior of the user as context. In [1], authors analyze the problem of contextual bandits. The authors suggest to develop an algorithm called Contextual Greed, which recommends a recommendation sequentially based on contextual information about the documents of the users. The authors analyze the problem of contextual bandits. The study shows that there is a better empirical performance compared to the state-of-art methods. The authors in [3, 1] describe an intelligent way of balancing the documents of the users."}, {"heading": "3 Key Notion", "text": "This section is about introducing the key terms used in this thesis. Situation: A situation is an external semantic interpretation of context data that allows a higher level of specification of human behavior. Formally, a situation S is a n-dimensional vector, S = (O\u03b41.c1, O\u03b42.c2,..., OTime.cj, OSocial.ck), in which each user represents a concept of an ontology, a context data dimension. According to our need, we consider a situation as a 3-dimensional vector S = (OLocation.ci, OTime.cj, OSocial.ck), in which each user represents a concept of localization, time and social ontology.User preferences UP are deduced during user navigation activities. UP D \u00d7 V, where D is a set of documents, A is a set of preferential attributes and V is a set of values."}, {"heading": "4 FA-TS", "text": "The proposed FA-TS algorithm is described in Algorithm 1 and includes the following tasks for each study.

We have randomly divided users into five groups, and we have each group with a fixed exploration of freshness: FA-TS-1, the risk is fixed at 1 (= 0), which means that the algorithm does not take freshness into account in its recommendation. FA-TS sets the risk at 0.5 (= 0.5), which means that the algorithm is fixed at 1 (= 0), which means that the algorithm does not take freshness into account."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have examined the issue of document freshness in CARS and proposed a new approach that takes the freshness of the document into account in recommendations regarding the situation of the user. Experimental results show that the freshness of CARS significantly increases its performance. Furthermore, this study concludes that handling the recommendation of a new document offers real added value in recommendation performance, depending on the risk of the situation."}], "references": [{"title": "Thompson sampling for contextual bandits with linear payoffs", "author": ["S.
