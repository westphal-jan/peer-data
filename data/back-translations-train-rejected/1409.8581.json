INTRODUCTIONSMT systems with linguistic information have recently been introduced to address the problem of the word \u00a9 Elsevier, 2013order and morphological discrepancies between language pairs. Integration of this linguistic information can be described as pre-processing, and this pre-processing of the source language is constantly based on the training and test corpora. Further source-side pre-processing steps bring the source language sentence closer to the sentence introduced by Och et.al. Statistical translation models have evolved from the word-based models originally proposed by Brown et.al [1] to syntax-based and phrase-based techniques. The beginnings of phrase-based translation can be seen in the alignment template model introduced by Och et.al. A common probability model for phrase translation has been proposed by Marcu et.al [3]. Koehn et.al [4] used certain hayristics to extract phrases that align with word directions."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORKS", "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, much preparatory work has been done on the source language side to improve the performance of statistical machine translation. Recent developments have shown an improvement in translation quality in the use of explicit syntax-based reordering. One of these developments is the pre-translation approach, which changes the word order of the source sentence before translation into the target language order, based on predefined linguistic rules that are either created manually or automatically learned from parallel corporas. Noteworthy research in SMT to improve the performance of the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system using morphosyntactic information is also explained in this section."}, {"heading": "A. Handling Word-Order Differences", "text": "Various methods of reordering translation quality have been developed, with these rules automatically learned from the parse trees for source and target sentences. Marta Ruiz Costa-juss'a 2006, [7] proposed a novel reordering algorithm for SMT. They presented two new approaches: block reordering and statistical machine reordering (SMR). They also explained various reordering methods such as syntax-based reordering and heuristic reordering in 2009 [8]. Irimia Elena and Alexandru Ceau\u015fu (2010) [9] presented a method for extracting translation examples using the dependency linkage of both the source and target language sets. They identified two types of dependency linkages and chains and used these structures to set the translation example boundaries. Sriram Vapety, an English-based dependency coupling system based on Sms and synchronisations."}, {"heading": "B. Handling the Morphological Differences", "text": "The second approach improves morphological translation performance by adding linguistically motivated syntactical features to specific phrases. These additional features are based on English syntactical information, namely on parts of linguistic knowledge with English-Arabic statistical translations (SMT). The second approach improves morphological agreement in machine translation by post-processing. This method uses the projection of English dependence parsetree on the Arabic sentence in addition to Arabic morphological analyses to extract concordance between words in the Arabic sentence. Individual morphological features are trained using syntactical and morphological information."}, {"heading": "III. MORPHO-SYNTACTIC COMPARISON BETWEEN ENGLISH AND TAMIL LANGUAGE", "text": "The grammar of a language is divided into syntax and morphology. Syntax is how words are combined into a sentence, and morphology deals with the formation of words. Morphology is also defined as the study of how meaningful units can be combined into words. One of the reasons for processing a morphology and syntax together in language processing is that a single word in one language corresponds to a word combination in another. \"Morphosyntax\" is a hybrid word derived from morphology and syntax. Morphosyntax plays an important role in the processing of different language types, and it is also a related term to machine translation because the elementary unit of machine translation are words and phrases. Retrieving syntactic information is a primary step in translation between two languages. The tool used to retrieve syntactic structures from a given sentence is called parsing, and is used to derive morphological features from a word."}, {"heading": "A. Syntactic Comparison", "text": "This subsection provides a closer look and remarkable differences between the syntax of the English and Tamil languages. Syntax is a theory of sentence structure and guides the rearrangement when translations between a language pair contain different sentence structures. English and Tamil come from different language families. English is an Indo-European language and Tamil is a Dravidian language. English has the word order Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and Tamil the word order Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). For example, the main verb of a Tamil sentence always comes at the end, but in English it comes between subject and object. English is a fixed word order in which Tamil word order is flexible. Flexibility in the word order means that the order can change freely without affecting the grammatical meaning of the sentence. During the translation from English to Tamil, English verbs must be shifted from the subject to the end of the sentence."}, {"heading": "B. Morphological Comparison", "text": "Morphology is the study of the structure of words in a language. Words are composed of morphemes to capture the entire surface. These are the smallest meaningful units in a word. For example, \"pens\" consists of \"pen\" + \"s,\" here \"s\" is a plural marker, \"spoken\" is from \"talk\" + \"ed,\" here \"ed\" stands for past tense. English is morphologically a simple language, but Tamil is a morphologically rich language. Morphology is one of the most significant terms for improving the performance of the machine translation system. Morphological differences between English and Tamil complicate the statistical machine translation task. The English language mediates the relationship between words that use functional terms or the location of the words, but the Tamil language expresses itself with morphological variations of the word. Therefore, the Tamil language has greater vocabulary of the surface forms."}, {"heading": "IV. METHODOLOGY FOR PRE-PROCESSING SOURCE SENTENCES", "text": "This section explains the preprocessing methods for English sentences to improve the quality of English on the Tamil Statistical Machine Translation System. The preprocessing module for English sentences comprises three phases: reordering, factorization, and compounding. Fig.2 shows the preprocessing steps of the English sentence. The first step in the preprocessing of the English sentence is to retrieve linguistic features such as lemma, POS tag, and syntactic relationships using the Stanford parser tool [23]. These linguistic features are subjected to reordering and factorization steps along with the sentence. Reordering applies the manually created ordering rules to the syntactic trees to integrate the phrases into the English sentences. Factorization incorporates the generic terms of the sentence and then factorizes them using syntactical tools. This information is appended to the words in the sentence. Parts of the speech tags are simplified and incorporated into the factorization."}, {"heading": "A. Reordering the word-order in source language Sentences", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "B. Factoring the source language Sentences", "text": "Factorization splits the superficial word into linguistic factors and integrates as a vector. Instead of mapping superficial words in the translation, factored models depict the linguistic units (factors) of the language pair. Stanford parser is used for factorizing the English language sentence. From the output of the parser, linguistic information such as, lemma, linguistic division labels, syntactical information and dependency information are retrieved. This linguistic information is integrated as factors in the superficial word. Current phrase-based models are limited to mapping small snippets of text without the use of explicit linguistic information such as morphological and syntactic information. Such information plays an important role in morphologically rich languages. On the other hand, the availability of linguistic pairs based on bilingual corpora is very low."}, {"heading": "C. Compounding the morphology information in Source Language Sentence", "text": "A basic line of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) takes only surface word forms into account and does not use linguistic information. Translation into the target word form depends not only on the word form, but also on additional morphosyntactical information. This morphological information is an important term for creating a word form in the target language. This pre-processing phase is used to extract the required linguistic information from the source text. Morphologically rich languages have a large number of surface forms in the lexicon to compensate for a free word form. This pre-processing phase is used to extract the required linguistic information from the source text."}, {"heading": "V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "text": "Four experiments will be performed to evaluate the effects of source-side pre-processing in the SMT system. The first experiment, Baseline, will be performed with the Phrase-based SMT system and the other three experiments will be based on Factored SMT models. In the basic Factored model, the target surface shapes will be created using the built-in generation model and another Factored model that uses the existing Tamil morphological generator system [22] to generate them.The final experiment is the combination of pre-processing and the Tamil morphological generator in Factored SMT. The size of 10,000 English-Tamil parallel sentences in tourism from the English Indian Languages Machine Translation System (EILMT) project, funded by the TDIL program DeitY, will be used in our experiments. From this corpus, 9000 sets will be used as a training set and 1000 sets as a test set."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This paper presents the effects of source-side linguistic pre-processing in the English-Tamil SMT system. The pre-processing stages include reordering, factoring and compounding, and these techniques correspond to the English language sentence with the Tamil sentence. Finally, the integration process includes the pre-processing phases. The paper also presents the syntactical and morphological variation between English and Tamil language. However, reordering plays an important role, especially for language pairs with different sentence structures. The difference in the sequence of words between two languages is one of the most significant sources of error in machine translation. While phrase-based MT systems are very good at reordering within short word windows, reordering over long distances seems to be a challenging task. Translation accuracy can be significantly improved if the reordering is carried out before translation. Compounding and factoring are used to reduce the amount of English-Tamil bilingual data."}], "references": [{"title": "A statistical approach to machine translation", "author": ["P. Brown", "J.
