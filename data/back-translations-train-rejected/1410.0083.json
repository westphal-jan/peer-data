(Belief in the game is referred to as B-2Q.) We define a function \u03b1: Pref (G) \u2192 B, which maps a prefix of g into a belief as follows. (There is a prefix of p = q0a0.)

MAIN RESULTS", "text": "In games with partial information, algorithms in [5] can be used to synthesize observation-based controllers that ensure that given temporal logic specifications are met securely or almost securely, i.e. with probability 1, whenever such controllers exist. In this article, we will consider only those cases where observation-based controllers do not exist and therefore require additional runtime information to meet given temporal logic specifications. We distinguish two phases in online planning: the progression phase and the sensing phase. As the names suggest, the system implements physical measures during the progression phase to satisfy the temporal logical limitations, and during the sensing phase, the system implements sensing measures to reduce uncertainty in its belief in the current game state. The transition from one phase to another is explained after we have presented the methods for synthesizing the strategies used in both phases."}, {"heading": "A.

The faith-based strategy fP is constructed from the sure winning strategy WS in the following way: Let Win1 \"Q\" be the group of states in which WS is defined.

(2) Assumption 2: For each state B encountered during the progress phase, if fP (B) is not defined, then fS (B) will not be able to predict what beliefs the system might have during execution with online planning; in the extreme, we will have a meaningful action or combination of meaningful actions to determine its truth value."}, {"heading": "IV.

The robot and the Wumpus do not move at the same time. The Wumpus can move in four compass directions with actions \"N,\" \"S,\" \"W\" and \"W\" within a limited area and emits stench to its surrounding cells. The aim of the robot is to visit the region R1, R2 and R3 in this order, while avoiding executing the temporal logic."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Our work shows that if additional information can be obtained through scanning actions, a sure winning strategy with complete information can be turned into a belief-based, randomized strategy, which is then combined with an active scanning strategy at runtime to ensure that a given temporal logic specification is satisfied with probability 1. The synthesis method avoids a subset construction to solve games with partial information. Meanwhile, the active scanning strategy results in a cost-effective way of sensor design: Although we need a sufficient number of scanning actions to avoid dead ends at runtime, the system minimizes the use of scanning actions by asking the most revealing queries depending on which specification is to be met and how much uncertainty the system has about the game state at runtime. In future work, we will look at more examples of practical robotic motion planning under partial observations."}], "references": [{"title": "Deterministic generators and games for LTL fragments", "author": ["Rajeev Alur", "Salvatore La Torre"], "venue": "ACM Transactions on Computational Logic,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Games for synthesis of controllers with partial observation", "author": ["A Arnold", "A Vincent", "I Walukiewicz"], "venue": "Theoretical Computer Science,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2003}, {"title": "The complexity of partialobservation parity games.
