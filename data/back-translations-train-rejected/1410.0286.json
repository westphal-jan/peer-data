The Hebrew Bible", "text": "The Hebrew Bible is written in ancient forms of Hebrew and Aramaic, which are now dead languages. Written manuscripts are our only source for the study of these languages. The study of such a corpus of historical texts involves research questions from various disciplines. Linguistic analysis is a springboard that must be followed by questions at a higher level of abstraction, such as literary questions: How did authors use the system of language to shape their design: i.e. style, literary impact, focus and all those features of the text that are not dictated by the language system (van Peursen et al. 2010)? Another question falls into historical linguistics: The systematic recording of linguistic variations in the biblical language corpus can help answer the question of whether the variation reflects diachronic development (van Peursen and van Keulen 2006)."}, {"heading": "1.1 Bible and Computer", "text": "In fact, a group of researchers in Amsterdam started to compile a text database in the 1970s: the Werkgroep Informatica Vrije Universiteit (WIVU). This led to a database of text and markup, the so-called WIVUar Xiv: 141 0.02 86v1 [cs.CL] 1 Odatabase (Talstra and Sikkel 2000), which became widely known because it was included in Bible study software packages. WIVU markup is based on observable properties of the texts and dispenses with a certain linguistic theory or framework. There is no explicit grammar to match the marked text material. One of the consequences is that the data cannot be comfortably described in a hierarchical structure, although that plays a role. There are several incompatible hierarchies implicit in the database."}, {"heading": "1.2 Text, markup, and annotation", "text": "In 2013, the CLARIN-NL4 project SHEBANQ5 began transforming the Hebrew text database from its EMDROS representation into a Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF) (Ide and Romary 2012). The Linguistic Annotation Framework defines a fairly general data model for annotated data, assuming that there is an invariable data resource with identifiable regions in it. Regions can be connected to nodes, nodes can be linked to edges, and both nodes and edges can be the target of annotations that contain characteristics. This annotated graph, anchored in primary data, can be expressed using the GrAF6 scheme proposed by the LAF standard. This model has proven to be very good for annotations that contain characteristics."}, {"heading": "2. LAF-Fabric", "text": "The primary result of the conversion of the Hebrew text database to LAF (van Peursen and Roorda 2014) is the fact that now a standardized representation of the data can be archived. In addition, we can also store queries in the database, according to an idea expressed in (Roorda and Heuvel 2012), but as soon as you turn to the LAF representation, the question comes to mind: Are there tools to work with this LAF resource?"}, {"heading": "2.1 LAF tools", "text": "There are tools that deal with stand-off annotations and markup, but here the versatility of stand-off markup has to be paid for: there are no tools that apply to all stand-off resources. Even if we restrict ourselves to LAF, there are no mature tools that deal with LAF in full generality. However, there are candidates that take more than an hour, even simple queries took tens of minutes. Certainly, this could have been improved by setting up indexes, but it is by no means obvious that indexes are needed for all kinds of queries. We chose not to follow this path."}, {"heading": "2.2 Computing with LAF-Fabric", "text": "In fact, it is a way in which people are able to determine for themselves how they have behaved."}, {"heading": "2.3 Beyond pure LAF", "text": "LAF is a rather loose standard. There are many ways to model specific language resources, and it is not obvious which decisions are best suited for data processing. In particular, the semantics of the edges in LAF are completely open.Specific resources can have more structure than can be exploited by a generic LAF tool. Therefore, LAF-Fabric has connectors for third-party modules to take advantage of additional regularities. We ourselves have developed a package called etcbc that provides additional functionality for the Hebrew text database in its LAF representation: 1. Node order: Hebrew Bible data has object types that can be ordered for more comprehensively than just based on generic LAF data. LAF-Fabric can be instructed to use the etcbc sorting instead of its default sorting. 2. Data input: etcbc contains ways to generate forms for data input, read back the results from LAF and convert them into orderly files."}, {"heading": "2.4 Notes on the choice for LAF", "text": "In fact, it is a matter of a pure structure which is able to hide itself in a position, without it being a matter of an structure, in which it is a matter of an structure, in which it is a matter of an structure, in which it is a matter of an structure, in which it is a matter of an structure, in which it is a matter of an structure, in which it is a matter of an structure, in which it is a matter of an structure, in which it is a matter of a structure, of a structure, of a structure, of a structure, of a structure, of a structure, of a structure, of a structure, of a structure, of a structure, of a structure, of a structure, of a structure, of a structure, a structure, a structure, a structure, a structure, a structure, a structure, a structure, a structure, a structure, a structure, a structure, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a"}, {"heading": "2.5 Preprocessing for research", "text": "The following sections describe several areas of research that benefit from the incarnation of the data at LAF and LAF-Fabric as a pre-processing tool; they are examples of historical, literary, and linguistic research lines, and thus serve to show the breadth of the landscape of Bible science.
