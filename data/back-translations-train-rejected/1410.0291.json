However, the Japanese language has an extensive honor system, and nouns often adopt courtesy prefixes and suffixes (for animate objects), and a small group of suffixes are also used to refer to collective nouns. Venerable prefixes The prefixes \"o\" and \"go-\" are prefixes that are applied to nouns (and sometimes verbs) to convey a respectful or polite tone of speech. Japanese words are preceded by \"o,\" while Chinese-Japanese words are usually preceded by \"go-,\" though there are exceptions in both cases. 4http: / / mecab.googlecode.com / svn / trunk / mecab / doc / posid.html2 of the 11 Honorific suffixes are suffixes that almost always refer to personal names and occasionally other non-human objects (such as animals, which are unrelated suffixes, etc.)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Verbs", "text": "Due to the agglutinative nature of the language, suffixes are relatively productive and in loose language many contractions are used.

Unlike Western languages, where adjectives are usually inflected much like noun declensions, Japanese adjectives are conjugated like a verb. This is because words that behave semantically like adjectives are technically regarded as specialized verbs (i-adjectives) or nominal (na-adjectives). There are some other classes of adjectives that are more commonly used in classical Japanese, and in modern Japanese they are limited to a few special cases. There are two main classes of adjectives: adjective verbs and adjective nouns."}, {"heading": "5 System Design", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 High level overview", "text": "Our morphological analyzer will focus on the task of analyzing the morphology of individual tokens. Therefore, we will design our analyzer to take input from the processed output of MeCab, a high-quality Japanese part of the language tag and morphological analyzer. MeCab is a CRF classifier that segments and marks each token with a part of the language category. It has a hierarchical tag set (of up to 4 levels), starting with 8 broad categories and a total of 68 fine categories. In the case of nouns, it provides a rough morphological analysis by segmenting the morphemes for honorable words and collectivism and classifying them as suffixes or prefixes belonging to persons, places, quantifiers, etc. Consequently, our contribution would be to integrate finer details of the classification such as courtesy and gender attributes as fantasy."}, {"heading": "5.2 Morphological analyzer system details", "text": "We implement our analyzer by building finite-state converters to process and generate finer analyses.

Generally, most nouns in the corpus have no morphology. For nouns that contain morphological elements, our analyzer was able to identify them with high accuracy.

Here, we will briefly describe the morpheme suffixes treated by our analyzer."}, {"heading": "7.2 Phonological rules", "text": "As in most languages, there are different phonological rules for conjugated verbs and adjectives. One such frequent and regular rule is the phonological modification of the endings to a [t] consonant. For example, the endings of the te form to -ite, -chite, -rite to a double consonant, -tte, the endings to -bite, -mite, -nite to -ende (intonation of the te syllable), the endings to -kite to -ite and the endings to -gite to -ide (intonation of the te syllable)."}, {"heading": "7.3 FST as a generator", "text": "Due to the agglutinative nature of language, the morphemes suffixes can be added in many different arbitrary sequences. Therefore, we have designed the FST as a generator, which means that the output of the FST is the surface form of a conjugated verb and the input is its lemmas and morphological characteristic. By its very nature, the FST has no knowledge of valid or invalid orders of these suffixes and therefore tends to overgenerate surface shapes for a particular input.When using the FST, it is trivial to reverse the direction of the FST and return the underlying form of the verb token. However, it is quite possible that a verb token has several forms of analysis and that it is left to the downstream application to decide between possible analyses.7.4 Adjective morphology phenomena are like adjectives (as described in \u00a7 4.3, there are two main classes of objective adaptors, and we use them to describe our analytics)."}, {"heading": "8 Second System Analysis (verbs and adjectives)", "text": "We extracted all the tokens that were marked as verbs or adjectives in the Tanaka corpus. Table 1 shows statistics on the verbal and adjective lexical elements in the corpus. From all the tokens we extracted 2,000 composite and 1,000 adjective tokens for manual evaluation. Since the FST produces multiple analyses for each token (there may also be several valid analyses without context), we measure the accuracy / recall performance of our analyst. Table 5 presents the results of our evaluation. Since our FST contains # correct analyses of analyses and recalls # of analyses and recalls # of analyses and recalls # of evaluation setI (# correct analyses > 0), Table 5 presents the results of our evaluation."}, {"heading": "8.1 Examples", "text": "See table 6 and 7 for example verbs and adjectives."}, {"heading": "9 Final Revisions", "text": "Many of the erroneous analyses can be eliminated by simple heuristics.

We decide whether the analyses contain 9 out of 11 (i) invalid orders of morphemes or (ii) match the dictionary forms returned by MeCab. We believe that this will help reduce the number of analyses generated per input and thus improve accuracy without compromising the callback."}, {"heading": "10 Future Work", "text": "For future work, we propose the following improvements: (i) widening the coverage of verbal and adjective lexical elements, (ii) widening the coverage of the analyzer to include the use of t-shaped subjunctive verbs, (iii) widening the coverage of the adjective analyzer to include the use of rare adjectives and verb classes, and (iv) possibly more heuristics in post-processing to address overgenerations.10 of 11"}], "references": [{"title": "JMDict: A Japanese-Multilingual Dictionary", "author": ["James Breen"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Workshop on Multilingual Linguistic Resources,", "citeRegEx": "Breen.,? \\Q2004\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Breen.", "year": 2004}, {"title": "FOMA: A Finite-State Compiler and Library.

It is an agglutinative language with a SOV word order. The Japanese writing system makes extensive use of Chinese characters, also known as kanji , along with scripts, hiragana and katakana, which are syllabic. There are 3 main lexical classes in Japanese that exhibit morphology, they are the nouns, verbs and adjectives. In Japanese, adverbs are often adjectives suffixed with a special morpheme. As such, it is often not considered a separate class of words. In \u00a74, we will discuss the phenomenon for each of these word classes. 2 Past Work on the Japanese morphology In traditional Japanese morphological analysis, a lexicon is assumed. The lexicon is a list of pairs of a word and its corresponding part-of-speech. As Japanese is an unsegmented language, past work on Japanese language morphology analyzers require the use of a segmenter. Often, the segmentation step is conducted jointly with the morphological analysis step in a rule based [Matsumoto et al., 1991] or machine learning framework [Kudo et al., 2004, Matsumoto et al., 1999]. The current state of the art Japanese language part of speech and morphological analyzer is MeCab [Matsumoto et al., 1999], which is an extended from ChaSen [Matsumoto et al., 1991], but using CRFs[Lafferty et al., 2001] instead of HMMs to model the morpheme sequences. \u2217This morphological analyzer is done as part of the project requirements for the Spring 2013 NLP Lab (11-712) at Carnegie Mellon University (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\\protect\\unhbox\\voidb@x\\penalty\\@M\\{}nasmith/NLPLab/).
