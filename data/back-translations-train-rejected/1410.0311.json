INTRODUCTIONIMAGE denoising has been a field of research for several decades and continues to represent a challenging task with advances in imaging modalities. Recently, attempts have been made to effectively solve the problem of denociation through dictionary-based algorithms. The basic idea behind such approaches is to develop a dictionary that is able to present image patches parsimoniously in order to be more precise by using sparse representation. In many applications, the assumption of gaussianness of noise might not hold in reality, making the \"2 minimization based algorithms inapplicable. In addition, these algorithms may lead to an excessive smoothing of the image, leading to serious loss of detail in the images."}, {"heading": "A. Review of recent literature", "text": "Some of the initial contributions to the problem of dataadaptive dictionary learning were made by Aharon et al. [5], [6]. They proposed the K-SVD algorithm, which is by far the most popular and successful algorithm for dictionary design. They successfully used the K-SVD algorithm to solve the problem of image denoisation [6], in particular to eliminate additive white Gaussian noise. They proposed two training options: (i) training on a corpus of clean image fields and (ii) training on the noisy input image itself. As the K-SVD algorithm is not suitable for dealing with large image patches arising from large computer requirements, it was proposed to enforce thrift. The KSVD algorithm uses the '2 distortion metric as a measure of data fidelity."}, {"heading": "B. Contributions of this paper", "text": "In this paper, we propose a dictionary learning algorithm that aims to minimize the \"1-distortion metric\" on the date date. The proposed RDL algorithm minimizes the \"1 error using the IRLS idea, which essentially comes closer to solving the\" 1-minimization problem by iteratively solving a series of \"2-minimization problems.\" Using \"1-metric for data fidelity results in noise harshness in terms of training performance and proves efficient for removing impulsive noise from images while preserving the edges and texture, as shown by the experimental results."}, {"heading": "II. ROBUST DICTIONARY LEARNING (RDL) ALGORITHM", "text": "Describe the training data set with T containing N training examples {yn} Nn = 1 in Rm corrupted by additive noise. The goal is to learn a dictionary D with K atoms tailored to the data set T, so that D denotes all examples in T with sparse coefficient vectors {xn} Nn = 1. Typically, D is overcomplete, which means that m < K denotes the symbols Y and X denote the matrices constructed by stacking Yns and Xns in the columns. (1) To achieve robustness against noise, we suggest solving the following optimization problem: min D, xn N-N, N-N-N-N-N, 1 + N-N-N, 1-N-N-N, 1-N-N. (1) The use of \"1 metric on the data date is the key to roughness, which can be interpreted from the perspective of Lapamecian (1) using the adaptation function for the previous (1), with the adaptation function in D (1)."}, {"heading": "A. Sparse coding", "text": "To update the coefficient vectors xn, when D is fixed, N must be solved independent problems of the form xn, xn, xn, xn, xn, (2). We propose to solve (2) the solution with an iterative algorithm using the idea of IRLS. Starting from a first guess x (0) n, update xns in the (k + 1) st iteration asx (k + 1) n = (D, TW (k) 1n, \u2212 1 D, TW (k) 1n, where W1ns and W2ns are diagonal weight matrices of suitable dimensions. Typically, one starts the iterations by setting W (0) 1n and W (0) 2n s to identity matrices."}, {"heading": "B.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have developed a dictionary learning algorithm called RDL, which aims to minimize the \"1 error\" on the data term and apply the image denocialization algorithm. The motivation behind using \"1 metric as a measure of data fidelity is to achieve noise immunity and alleviate the problem of smoothing texture and edge areas in images. Experiments with synthesized data sets show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over its\" 2-based counterpart, the K-SVD algorithm, in terms of the removal of the recovered dictionary from the basic truth. Denoization experiments on real images show that the RDL algorithm leads to output images with better PSNR values compared to the K-SVD algorithm. Textures and edges in the images are also better preserved."}], "references": [{"title": "Iteratively re-weighted least squares minimization for sparse recovery", "author": ["I. Daubechies", "R.D.
