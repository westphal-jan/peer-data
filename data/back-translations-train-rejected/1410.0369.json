If your mind is cloned, and if a copy is instantiated in a substrate other than the original (or on the same substrate), how can it be verified that the copy is actually an identical mind? At least immediately after cloning and before learning any new information. To this end, I propose a variant of a turing test, which is also based on interactive pure text communication, to determine the quality of the copied mind. The text-only interface is important so as not to disadvantage the tester against unusual substrates on which the copied mind could be executed. The test runs by asking the tester (the original mind) questions of the copy (cloned mind), questions that supposedly only the original mind should be able to answer as a private matter (the good mind can always answer)."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Science is experiencing at regular intervals a discovery of a whole new realm of intelligence (minimal enough for general intelligence and subjective intelligence); observations by Galileo Galilei lead to the birth of observational astronomy (66), also known as the study of our universe; Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA lead to the birth of the field of genetics [67], which investigates the universe of blueprints for organisms; Stephen Wolfram's work with cellular automata has led to \"a new kind of science\" [68], which investigates the universe of computational processes. I believe that we are about to discover another universe - the universe of intelligence. As our understanding of the human brain improves, thanks to numerous projects aimed at simulating or reversing a human brain, we will realize that human intelligence is only one point in the vast universe of potential intelligent agents that would like to include a new realm of intelligence, the new term I would like to use."}], "references": [{"title": "The Structure and Space of Possible Minds.
