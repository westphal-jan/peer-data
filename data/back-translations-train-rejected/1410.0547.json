It is also noteworthy that the 3D antennas surpassed a physical design handmade by the antenna manufacturer for the mission (2011), but most approaches have used simulations to provide the fitness of the designs developed before final fabrication. However, the majority of blade design optimization is performed by using CFD simulations, which are typically performed using 3D-based Navier Stokes equations (Anderson, 1995). However, 3D CFD simulations are computationally expensive, with a single calculation that takes hours on a high-performance computer, making their use difficult with an iterative search approach. In addition, assumptions must be made regarding turbulence or pressure distributions that can significantly affect the accuracy of wind turbine modeling."}, {"heading": "2.3 Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms", "text": "As the speed and cost of the fast prototype continues to improve, developing a design before it can be assigned must remain an expensive task when potentially thousands of assessments are required; for example, 10 minutes of printing time for each very simple individual in the work of Rieffel and Sayles (2010). However, given the fitness of an evaluated individual N, a surrogate model (also known as metamorphosis or response model), it can be constructed where the genotype and Y-fitness are to calculate the fitness of an invisible dataset."}, {"heading": "2.4 Coevolution", "text": "Since the early work in developing both competing (Axelrod, 1987) and cooperative (Husbands and Mill, 1991) multi-agent systems (Husbands and Mill, 1991), the problem of selecting assessment partners has been identified, and many strategies have been presented, varying from the extreme case of individuals in a population that all other populations use (e.g. Koza, 1991), to the use of a subset of other individuals (e.g. Hillis, 1991), to the mathematically preferred use of one individual from each population (e.g. Bull and Fogarty, 1993); the use of the currently best individuals from the other populations has been investigated by Potter and De Jong (1994); in their work, all populations also received a common fitness measure; using a generational CGA, they reported that the strategy was performing well; they also suggested that for higher crossings epistasis an additional randomly selected person should be used as a partner, and the highest fitness obtained from the epidemics, the differences between the two were examined, with significant differences between the two."}, {"heading": "3 Methodology", "text": "In fact, it is not as if it were a reactionary project, but a reactionary project that is able to establish itself, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to continue it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it, to reform it."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Modelling Techniques", "text": "To investigate whether there is a significant advantage in replacing the neural network that was previously used as a surrogate model, several algorithms using the Weka 3.6.10 machine learning collection2 were performed on the data generated by the GA (Preen and Bull, 2014a). It is therefore important to note that a surrogate model with a greater fitness prediction error may be more accurate in predicting the ranking of individuals than a Model2Weka is an open source data mining algorithm collection. http: / / www.cs.waikato.ac.nz / weka / with a lower error. Since the ranking is the guiding influence on the evolutionary process, alternative quality measures for safe models have been proposed. However, Bischl et al. (2012) have found no difference between the use of the root average square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), or the spearman's actual grain relation between the predicted."}, {"heading": "4.2 Windowing", "text": "In the interactive evolutionary calculation, the rating of a user within each generation is relative, and thus fitness scores from past generations are used; multiples may differ from recent generations, even if the evaluated candidate is identical. Consequently, Wang and Takagi (2005) found that a neural network surrogate model that uses only current training data was more effective than the use of all past data. Furthermore, many other surrogate-assisted approaches may be beneficial in excluding older training samples for SCGAs (e.g. Bull, 1997b), although they did so to save computing time rather than intentionally helping with convergence. Due to the timing of the partnership with the elite species, it may be beneficial to exclude older training samples for SCGAs. To investigate whether there is any benefit from using different windowing approaches to train the surrogate model, 13 different models of Weka were used across the 4 datasets, consisting of 80 evolutionary coexperts evaluated from the individuals."}, {"heading": "4.3 Model Enhanced Local Search", "text": "Typically n individuals are evaluated with the real fitness function of each generation, with n < P. This results in a population consisting of a mixture of individuals evaluated with the real fitness function and those whose fitness ability is approximate. However, Ulmer et al. (2004) introduced a pre-selection approach for surrogate support of ESs. The approach consists of generating pre-offspring for which \u03bbPre > \u03bb, and evaluating each with the real fitness function. This enables improved local search by evaluating a large number of offspring and prevents evolutionary search with the real fitness function. The main difference is that pre-selection generates all offspring from parent individuals who are directly evaluated with the real fitness function. This enables improved local search by evaluating a large number of offspring, while preventing the evolutionary search from being driven too far out of the rated design space that can repeatedly result from offspring approaching individuals."}, {"heading": "4.4 Collaboration Strategies", "text": "While it is relatively expensive to manufacture a new VAWT prototype (\u0445 30 minutes), rotational velocity measurement with the laser speedometer is relatively cheap (\u2264 1 minute). Therefore, while it may not be the case for more complex wind tunnel conditions, re-evaluation of some fabricated individuals with other partners is a relatively cheap way to increase their performance. To see if a two-partner strategy can increase performance in designing two interacting VAWT species, the CGA was again performed with the same initial population as before, however, collaboration was conducted with an individual who was proportionally selected (i.e., roulette wheel) in addition to the usual elite members from the other species population, and the larger of the two fitness scores that are evaluated (CGA-2). Since no fitness scores are initially known, each individual in the first generation of a species population was evaluated in conjunction with a single randomly selected population."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "This year, it is at an all-time high in the history of the European Union."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the UK Leverhulme Trust under grant RPG-2013-344."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2015, "abstractText": "An initial study of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms used to design verticalaxis wind turbines wherein candidate prototypes are evaluated under fan generated wind conditions after being physically instantiated by a 3D printer has recently been presented.
