In other words, N is the number of Volterra terms and M is the memory length of the system. However, with this notation it is easy to describe different Volterra models by examining the behavior of the borderline cases: V (\u221e, M), V (N, \u221e) and V (\u221e, \u221e) (Doyle et al., 2001, Ch. 2), (Pearson, 1999, Sec.4.2).It is important to take into account the limitations of the V (N, M) class. Some of these limitations include the inability to issue output variety (Boyd and Chua, 1985).This can be intuitively described by saying that if a system can have the same output through different local volume inputs (i.e. different constant state reactions to the same steady state), Boyd can have diversity (1985) and Boyd (1985)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Volterra Model Parameterization", "text": "Another important practical limitation, which is not dependent on application, is the parameterization of the Volterra model.

Laguerre polynomial acts as a filter with a time constant of 1 / a. The time scale should be chosen as the time constant of the response to be modelled. As a separate time scale can be chosen for each Volterra term, this also allows adjustments to different reactions within the same input.

Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, the general Volterra series was presented and some typical simplistic assumptions discussed. Limitations of the V (N, M) class Volterra series were discussed in relation to physical systems. These limitations can often be beneficial as they represent behaviors that are not common in physical systems. Perhaps the key limitation of the Volterra series is the number of parameters required to describe a model, Laguerre polynomials were introduced as a tool to estimate the Volterra cores and reduce the total number of model parameters required for a particular system. A new algorithm is presented to generalize the identification of discrete VL systems.

A better discussion of fading memory systems and the work on them can be found in Doyle et al. (2001, p. 41) and Boyd and Chua (1985, Sec. III). It turns out that the concept of fading memory exists at least as long as the Volterra series itself. Regularly, the horizon should be equal to the number of steps in time to steady state.

A major drawback is the number of coefficients required model such systems. In order to reduce the number of required coefficients, Laguerre polynomials are used to estimate the Volterra kernels.

This paper presents a novel algorithm for generalized calculation of the finite order Volterra-Laguerre (VL) series for a MIMO system. An example addresses the utility of the algorithm in practical application.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
