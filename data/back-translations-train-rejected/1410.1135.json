Introduction", "text": "It is no longer used by many speakers only in languages other than English. The need to analyze opinions, attitudes and emotions relating to topics covered by reviews or news is spoken by millions of people in Arabic. [1] Sentiment Analysis is the method of calculating opinions, attitudes and emotions relating to topics covered by reviews or news. [2-4] The classification process is commonly formulated as a two-tier classification problem; positive and negative. [3] As it is a text classification problem, any existing verified learning method can be applied, e.g. Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) classifies the web has lately become a very important source of information as it is becoming a reading and writing platform. The dramatic increase in OSN, video sharing sites, online news sites, online forums and online websites that generate user-generated content in unstructured text format has garnered a lot of attention for their long-lasting importance."}, {"heading": "2. Methodology", "text": "The aim of our study is to process data from Twitter, Facebook and a review page on the same topic in Arabic for South Africa. We selected a hot topic for the films recently shown in cinemas for the last festival in August 2014, which were: \"The Blue Elephant\" means \"The Third World War\"; \"The Blue Elephant\" means \"Made in Egypt\"; \"The Third World War\" means \"Official Marriage.\" We downloaded related tweets from Twitter, comments from the Facebook pages of some films and user reviews from the review site elcinema.com. Tweets were downloaded via the films, using Twitter's regular search, as many of the pages that retrieve tweets are closed, such as (searchHash, topsy)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Corpora Preparation", "text": "Removing comments that contain only URLs or advertising links from Facebook lowered them to 1296. After removing non-Arabic comments, they decreased to 1261. The final number of downloaded tweets was 1787 tweets. After removing tweets that contain only URLs or advertising links, or some that only provide links to watch the movie, they were reduced to 1069. Some were links to specific scenes or related videos on Youtube. After removing unrelated tweets, since the search on Twitter was made only by the names of the movies that may imply other meanings, they were reduced to 862. Removing non-Arabic tweets reduced them to 781. The number of reviews downloaded from the review pages was 32. Ratings only took two preparation steps, as shown in Figure 1. After pre-processing, purifying and filtering the data, they must first be submitted to the filter method."}, {"heading": "2.3 Text processing and Classification", "text": "After the note, we have applied word processing techniques to the tricorpus with various alternatives to the stopword list, which are: -A general MSA list: This list contains a combination of three published lists, the first is a project that generates stopwords with all kinds of suffixes and prefixes, the other two are in (https: / / code.google.com / p / stopwords / Source / Search / trunk / stopwords / stopword tarabish.txt) and (http: / / www.ranks.nl / stopwords / Arabic -A generated corpus-based list: This list is generated from the most commonly used words from the Ecorpora, regardless of their nature.-A generated Egyptian dialect list: This list is generated from the most common words in the Ecorpora."}, {"heading": "3. Stopword list Generation", "text": "The most common English words that do not affect the meaning of a sentence are such as \"a,\" \"the,\" \"of....\" Removing stop words reduces the body size without losing important information. In some corpus-specific words, the meaning of the word \"movie\" in a movie review corpus could not be affected, but means something in the news corpus. This word could be considered a stop word when analyzing the corpus of movie reviews. The common strategy for determining a stop word list is to calculate the frequency of occurrence of each word in the document collection, and then take the most common words. The selected terms are often filtered by hand according to their semantic content relative to the domain of the indexed documents and marked as a stop word list. The English stop word list is generic and contains 127 words such as (all, just being,....). To generate the stop word generally for Arabic, they are specified in these three steps."}, {"heading": "3.1 Calculating words frequency", "text": "The rating corpus gives 3781 unique words, the Facebook corpus 1451 unique words and the Twitter corpus 1160 unique words. This shows that despite the number of ratings, they are much less than the OSN corpus, but they are lexically rich. After they are combined together and the duplicates removed, the list of common words consists of 4818 words. Then we calculated the frequency of occurrence of each word from the list of all words in the three corpus together."}, {"heading": "3.2 The validity of words to be a stopword", "text": "To create a general list of Egyptian stopwords, we have taken the most common 200 words and removed the semantically recognized words, which are likely nouns and verbs. Then, to create a general list of Egyptian dialects, we have added each word of the Egyptian dialect to the most common words, which are semantically meaningless. To confirm whether the word is a stopword or not; if the word is an MSA word, we check its existence in the MSA stopword list. If it does not exist, we check its corresponding meaning in the English stopword list. If the word is in the English language, we should see its correspondence in English if it does not exist in the MSA stopword list. \""}, {"heading": "3.3 Adding possible prefixes to the words", "text": ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"}, {"heading": "4.

We commented on the ratings according to the rating of the site. In the OSN data, we commented on the corpora manually. The manual comment was more reliable because the person analyzing the data is so far better than the machine. Table 1 shows the number of positive, negative and neutral reviews, comments and tweets resulting from comments."}, {"heading": "4.2 Classifiers Preparation", "text": "We trained Naive Bayes and Decision Tree Classifiers. The classifiers were performed with the nltk 2.0 toolkit. There are some parameters that can be entered into the DT classifier to improve accuracy or reduce training time [25]. The parameters are: -entropy cutoff: used during the tree grafting process. If the entropy of the probability distribution of the label selection in the tree is greater than the entropy cutoff, then the tree is further refined. But if the entropy is lower than the entropy cutoff, then the tree grafting is stopped. Entropy is the uncertainty of the result. If the entropy approaches the 1.0, uncertainty increases and vice versa. Higher values of entropy cutoff reduce both the accuracy and the training time. It was set to \"0.8.\" Depth of the tree to control the depth of the cutoff."}, {"heading": "4.3 Feature Selection", "text": "There are two features selection (FS) techniques used in the test: -Unigram: treats the documents as Bag of Words (BOWs), which build a word presence function from all words in an instance. -Bigram: is the same as a one-off, but finds two words."}, {"heading": "3.5 Results", "text": "We have conducted many experiments to test the effect of removing stopwords from different lists using the combination of two FS techniques and two classifiers with the three different corpora. We have performed the tests to determine 75% of the total number of data in each corpus for training and 25% for testing data. The default accuracy was used to evaluate the performance for each test. Accuracy is defined as: the ratio of the number of correctly classified reviews, comments and tweets to the total number of data. Table 2 contains the results of the various tests we performed. The accuracy of the ratings is relatively high as the number of ratings is low and the data highly unbalanced. Accuracy decreases when using corpus-based list on the lexically rich ratings, and the general lists including Egyptian dialects provide better results than the others. The timing does not change much, but in general it decreases when removing stopwords. The DT delivers better results than Facebook's extreme because it is NT-B."}, {"heading": "5. Discussion", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Corpora Analysis", "text": "We believe that people who write whole reviews on review pages have a complete opinion about the film and want to show it. They do not tend to be neutral. The number of positive reviews on Facebook represents 78% of the total data, while the number of negative reviews represents 18% of the total data. The data is patently unbalanced, since the films were successful this season, not many user reviews were egative.The number of neutral comments on Facebook represents 68% of the total data. These are not neutral opinions about the film. People who write in OSN are not neutral at all. The neutral comments are mainly objective sentences that do not contain feelings. Many were adjusted debates between users. Some expressed their personal feelings and some were usingadjectives without specifying who or what visa.The number of positive comments represents 29% of the total data and the number of negative comments represents 2% of the total data."}, {"heading": "5.2 Specializations of Arabic Language", "text": "It is not only a question of time, but also of time, in which we place the three words in a single word in the space, in which we see ourselves able to discuss the various terms in a single word.

Conclusion and Future work", "text": "The method consists of three phases: Calculation of the frequency of occurrence of words, verification of the validity of a word to be a stop word, and addition of possible prefixes and suffixes to the generated words.

We compare it with other lists used in comparison: previously generated lists of MSA, the body-based generated list of Egyptian dialects, and a combination of the Egyptian dialect list with the MSA corpora. We have also proposed a methodology to prepare corpora in Arabic language by OSN corpora-corpora-corpora-corporus-corpora and review page for Sentiment Analysis (SA) task. It includes the translation of English words that appear in the text and the transformation of Franco-Arabic corpora-corpora-corpora-lists.
