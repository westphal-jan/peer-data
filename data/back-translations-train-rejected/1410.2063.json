Commitment-based communication, where communicating agents are seen as a debtor agent who is committed to a creditor agent to bring about something (possibly under some conditions) is now very well-established. The approach of DACMAS (Data-Aware Commitment-based MAS) lifts commitment-related approaches proposed in the literature from a propositional to a first-order setting via the adoption the DRL-Lite Description Logic. Notably, DACMASs provide, beyond commitments, simple forms of inter-agent event-based communication. Yet, the aspect is missing of making a MAS able to acquire knowledge from contexts which are not agents and which are external to the MAS. This topic is coped with in Managed MCSs (Managed Multi-Context Systems), where however exchanges are among knowledge bases and not agents. In this paper, we propose the new approach of DACmMCMASs (Data-Aware Commitment-based managed Multi- Context MAS), so as to obtain a commitment-based first-order agent system which is able to interact with heterogeneous external information sources. We show that DACmMCMASs retain the nice formal properties of the original approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Oct 2014 11:11:13 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2063v1", "Draft of a paper submitted to an International Conference"]], "COMMENTS": "Draft of a paper submitted to an International Conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["stefania costantini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.2063"}, "pdf": {"name": "1410.2063.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Committment-Based Data-Aware Multi-Agent-Contexts Systems", "authors": ["Stefania Costantini"], "emails": ["stefania.costantini@univaq.it"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 141 0.20 63v1 [cs.AI] 8O ct2 01"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The communication and interaction between agents in multi-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-agent-"}, {"heading": "2 Background on mMCS and DACMAS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 mMCS", "text": "(Managed) Multi-context systems [26,27] aim to build systems that need to access multiple, possibly heterogeneous, data sources (despite the variety of formalities and languages on which these data sources can be based.

Then D is locally consistent.The execution semantics of a DACmCMAS can be an extending the transition system defined for DACMAS in [21], Section 4. We do the full extended definition for lack of space. However, it should be enough to say that the transitional system construction (Figure 1 in [21]) needs to be modified: (i) in steps 2-24, manage the rules to include bridge rules; (ii) in steps 30-37, manage the actions so that they are compatible."}, {"heading": "4 Concluding Remarks", "text": "In this paper, we have expanded DACMAS, which is a formalization of ontology-based and commitment-based multi-agent systems. Our extension allows a system to include not only agents, but also external contexts, with the goal of modelling real-world situations in which agents not only interact with each other, but also consult external heterogeneous data and knowledge technologies to extract useful information. In this way, both individual agents and the overall system can evolve through the incorporation of new data / knowledge. To this end, we have merged DACMASs with managed multi-context systems (mMCS), which model the exchange of data and knowledge between heterogeneous sources in a controlled manner. Thus, we obtain a more general formalization, called DACmMCMAS, which maintains the desirable properties of both approaches. Similar to the authors \"argument for DACMAS, instances of DACMCAS are easy to implement."}], "references": [{"title": "Specifying open agent systems: A survey", "author": ["A. Artikis", "J.V.

extensive investigation since many years. Commitment-based communication, where communicating agents are seen as a debtor agent who is committed to a creditor agent to bring about something (possibly under some conditions) is now very well-established. The approach of DACMAS (Data-Aware Commitmentbased MAS) lifts commitment-related approaches proposed in the literature from a propositional to a first-order setting via the adoption the DRL-Lite Description Logic. Notably, DACMASs provide, beyond commitments, simple forms of inter-agent event-based communication. Yet, the aspect is missing of making a MAS able to acquire knowledge from contexts which are not agents and which are external to the MAS. This topic is coped with in Managed MCSs (Managed Multi-Context Systems), where however exchanges are among knowledge bases and not agents. In this paper, we propose the new approach of DACmMCMASs (Data-Aware Commitment-based managed MultiContext MAS), so as to obtain a commitment-based first-order agent system which is able to interact with heterogeneous external information sources. We show that DACmMCMASs retain the nice formal properties of the original approaches.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
