Analyzing Language", "text": "Although the analysis of linguistic data among statisticians is unusual, there are many linguists who apply statistical techniques. For example, corpus linguists collect language samples that are representative of a particular aspect of a language, and then analyze them using tools from both statistics and information theory. The Brown Corpus, for example, was founded in 1961 to be representative of American English, and consists of 500 samples, each containing about 2,000 words. Computer linguists are also sophisticated users of statistics. In fact, there are statistically oriented books written by linguists such as Manning and Sch\u00fctze (1999) and Oakes (1998). So if a statistical teacher wants to use text data in class, many examples have already been elaborated.This paper gives three examples of the application of statistics to language: The first applies a method in which the word play matches using string patterns that are called regular expressions; the second discusses collocations, which are a concept of linguistics, which should be applied to the third word play."}, {"heading": "2. Wordplay and Regular Expressions", "text": "Different types of puns and puns require finding a word with letters that meet a given string pattern, which can be built using a programming method called regular expressions, or reggexes for short. It is useful because it is implemented in a variety of packages. In this essay, we use SAS \"implementation of regular Perl expressions, first introduced in version 9. Only some simpler patterns are shown here: For a more in-depth introduction to regexes and their use in text mining, see Chapter 2 of Bilisoly (2008)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Crossword Puzzle Example", "text": "First, we look at crossword puzzles. Here, the length of an answer is known, and when the puzzle is partially complete, some of the letters in the answer may be known. For example, consider a seven-letter word with a b at the fourth position and a u at the last position. How informative is this, i.e., how many words meet these constraints? This can easily be done in two steps. First, read a word list in SAS, as shown in Figure 1. The file crosswd.txt comes from Ward (2002), which is freely available from the Gutenberg Project. This word list is used for all code examples in this paragraph.Using the record word list generated by the SAS code in Figure 1, Figure 2 uses a regular expression called regex to select the seven letters that meet the above crossword constraints."}, {"heading": "2.2 Hangman Example", "text": "Hangman is something like a single word in a crossword puzzle, except that there may be letters that you know are not in the word. Even if a guessed word occurs in a word, all instances of it are revealed. These new constraints can easily be implemented with regular expressions. Suppose a seven-letter word has an e for the second letter and ends in s (so that none of the unknown letters is either e or s), plus the letters t, a, o, i, n were guessed but do not appear in that word. Figure 4 gives an SAS code that can find all of these words. Note that Figure 4 is almost exactly the same as Figure 2: the only differences are the square expression used. Note that square brackets that begin with a ^ do not match any of the brackets. It follows that the ^ within square brackets has a different meaning than the {four immediately preceding it}."}, {"heading": "3. Word Collocations", "text": "The previous section offers two examples of word play, which are of interest to students who enjoy such leisure activities. However, word analysis can also serve a more serious purpose in linguistics. An example of word collocations is given in this section, and it is important for both corpus linguists and categorical data analysis."}, {"heading": "3.1 Examples of Word Collocations", "text": "In linguistics, word collocations are two (or more) words that appear as a unit, which has a meaning that is not apparent from the meaning of the constituent words. For example, \"white house\" might just mean an arbitrary house that is white, but it often appears in print because that is where the President of the United States lives. However, this latter definition cannot be derived from knowing the definitions of the words \"white\" and \"house.\" Therefore, \"white house\" is an example of word collocation. One way to find word collocations is to compare the frequency of the constituent words with the frequency of the words. Positive correlation indicates a collocation, whereas independence does not. If you look at English texts, you can also find negatively correlated words, such as \"ultraviolet house,\" which appears only 110 times when you search for Google (on 9 / 16 / 2009)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Frequency Table Analyses", "text": "In the last section, it was pointed out that word collocations are often words that occur together more frequently than chance. However, statistics can be helpful in quantifying this, which linguists have known for a long time. Chapter 5 of the Fundamentals of Statistical Language Processing (Manning and Sagittarius (1999)) mentions several techniques, including t-tests, chi-square tests, probability ratios, and mutual information. The last method suggests that linguists have also delved into information theory, which is true. In this section, Fisher's close test is applied to word pairs to verify whether independence is a tenable hypothesis. Figure 7 shows a contingency table to test whether two words are independent or not. If dependence is found, then it may be the case that the two words form a collocation. The use of program 6.1 (mentioned in the last section) is applied to the Brown Corpus, two sale verbs are considered to raise the value of two racial considerations against each other."}, {"heading": "4. Coupon Collecting and Pangrammatic Windows", "text": "A pangram is an English text that contains all 26 letters (ignoring the case), and a pangrammatical window is a coherent sample of text from a source that is also a pangram. The goal is to compare pangrammatical windows from Dickens \"Christmas Carol with what one would expect if the letters of the alphabet were independent of each other. Of course, letters are interdependent, but it is interesting to see how independence can fail. Here's just one analysis: compare the length of the pangrams found in his novel with the length of the pangrammes by generating random letters using the empirical frequency of the letters in his novel. Before we begin with this analysis, here is an example of a shorter pangram found in a Christmas Carol. Note that the letter j was the last one to appear, the spirit fell under it, so that the eraser covered its entire form, but though Scrooge was holding it down with all the force that he could not hold down the time."}, {"heading": "4.1 The Coupon Collector\u2019s Problem and Comparing Pangram Lengths", "text": "The problem of the coupon collector analyzes how long it takes to collect a complete set of coupons, that is, the 26 letters of the alphabet in this case. Of course, the letters of the alphabet do not appear equally often, but the problem of the coupon has a closed-form solution if the coupons each have unequal probabilities. Deriving this solution is not easy, and the key result is merely quoted here. Let pi be the probability of the ith coupon, and let Njk be the number of coupons needed, so that j different coupons each appear at least k times. Finally, let ek (t) the kth order Taylor approximation of the exponential function, e t. Then Theorem 2 by Flajolet al."}, {"heading": "4.2 A Birthday Problem Aside", "text": "Flajolet et et al. (1992) give a general formula for E (Njk) and point out how the birthday problem is related to N12. Looking at the actual birth dates for a given year (Chance (2009) gives US data for 1978), it turns out that birthdays are not uniformly distributed, because there is a decrease of more than 10% on weekends and holidays, together with a smaller seasonal influence, as in Figure 14. It turns out that E (N12) hardly changes as a result: assuming uniformity, it is 24.62, but using the 1978 data it drops to only 24.53."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "There are two lessons to be learned from this work: firstly, linguists have already produced many statistical examples, which is a good starting point for a statistical teacher who wants to include examples of language use; secondly, corpus linguists who believe in creating examples of text that are representative of a particular aspect of language and then use computers to perform numerous analyses; and secondly, statistical examples that use language can be used in a variety of statistical courses, including statistical programming, categorical data analysis, multivariate data analysis and applied statistics. I have just started to include examples of language in my courses with generally positive results."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Thanks to my STAT-456 class (Introduction to SAS Programming for Spring Semester 2009) for allowing me to try out some language examples for the first time.
