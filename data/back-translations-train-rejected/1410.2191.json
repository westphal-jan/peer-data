NMF,whichtriestorepresentanonnegativedatamatrixasaproductoftwolowrank nonnegative matrices, has been a popular method for data representation due to its ability to explore the latent part-based structure of data. Recent study shows that lots of data distributions have manifold structures, and we should respect the manifold structure when the data are represented. Recently, manifold regularized NMF used a nearest neighbor graph to regulate the learning of factorization parameter matrices and has shown its advantage over traditional NMF methods for data representation problems. However, how to construct an optimal graph to present the manifold prop- erly remains a difficultproblem due to the graph modelselection, noisy features, and nonlinear distributed data. In this chapter, we introduce three effective methods to solve these problems of graph construction for manifold regularized NMF. Multiple graph learning is proposed to solve the problem of graph model selection, adaptive graph learning via feature selection is proposed to solve the problem of constructing a graph from noisy features, while multi-kernel learning-based graph construction is used to solve the problem of learning a graph from nonlinearly distributed data.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Oct 2014 09:25:43 GMT  (55kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2191v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jim jing-yan wang", "xin gao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.2191"}, "pdf": {"name": "1410.2191.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Jing-Yan Wang", "Xin Gao"], "emails": ["jimjywang@gmail.com", "xin.gao@kaust.edu.sa"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 141 0.21 91v1 [cs.LG] 3 O"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "[13, 20, 27, 35, 33, 34] is a popular data representation method in the field of machine learning.

In addition, we must also select an affinity function and its corresponding parameters to calculate the affinities between each pair of connected data samples. However, we can use a linear search in hyperspace of the distance function, affinity function and parameters to find the optimal combination of options to construct the graph. However, this strategy is time-consuming and easy to over-match the training data. To overcome this problem, in our previous work we proposed to construct the multiple graph learning method to construct an optimal graph for the regulation of NMF. We assume that we have different candidate graphs and they are constructed with combinations of different distance functions, affinity functions and parameters.

If the data samples are not distributed linearly, and we use a linear property space to find the closest neighbors and calculate the affinities, the graph obtained will not be suitable for further regularization of NMF. In this case, we can use a nonlinear function to construct a data sample from a nonlinear space into a high-dimensional linear space [14] in which d \u00b2 is the dimension of high-dimensional linear space, then construct the graph and perform NMF [37]. In this case, we assume that the base vectors can be obtained by the linear combination of the nonlinear imaging of the training samples, hk = n \u00b2 n \u00b2 n \u00b2 n \u00b2 of the linear space in which we learn them (X) gk = linear (X)."}, {"heading": "5 Summary", "text": "In this chapter, we will examine a fundamental problem in variously regulated NMF methods - how to construct an optimal graph to represent the multiplicity. We will introduce three different methods to this problem that learn multiple graphs, consider feature selection and multiple kernel learning methods, and integrate them into the problem of NMF. This is crucial for many uncontrolled learning methods: 1. The parameters of multiple graph learning, feature selection, and multiple kernel learning are all learned in a single objective function, but we used alternative optimization methods to update them. Interestingly, we found that the parameters of multiple graph learning, feature selection, feature selective learning, and multiple kernel learning [in this chapter] will expand the parameters of multiple graph learning, feature selection, and multiple kernel learning in different ways."}], "references": [{"title": "Supervised transfer sparse coding", "author": ["M.

NMF, which tries to represent a nonnegative data matrix as a product of two low rank nonnegative matrices, has been a popular method for data representation due to its ability to explore the latent part-based structure of data. Recent study shows that lots of data distributions have manifold structures, and we should respect the manifold structure when the data are represented. Recently, manifold regularized NMF used a nearest neighbor graph to regulate the learning of factorization parameter matrices and has shown its advantage over traditional NMF methods for data representation problems. However, how to construct an optimal graph to present the manifold properly remains a difficult problem due to the graph model selection, noisy features, and nonlinear distributed data. In this chapter, we introduce three effective methods to solve these problems of graph construction for manifold regularized NMF. Multiple graph learning is proposed to solve the problem of graph model selection, adaptive graph learning via feature selection is proposed to solve the problem of constructing a graph from noisy features, while multi-kernel learning-based graph construction is used to solve the problem of learning a graph from nonlinearly distributed data.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
