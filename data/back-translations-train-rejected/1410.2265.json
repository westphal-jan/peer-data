In recent years, the amount of mood-rich data on the Web has increased rapidly with the increase in social media users. Various companies are now turning to online forums, blogs, etc., in order to get customer reviews of their products, Sentiment Data is now considered big data that requires techniques capable of efficiently processing such large amounts of data. In this research, a lexicon-based approach to sentiment analysis is applied."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "A lot of work has been done in the field of opinion research or mood analysis for over a decade. Various techniques are used to classify the text by polarity, and most of these techniques fall into two categories:"}, {"heading": "2.1. Machine learning", "text": "This means that a machine learning algorithm must first be used for editing texts."}, {"heading": "2.2. Lexicon Based", "text": "Lexicon-based techniques work on the assumption that the collective polarity of a document or sentence is the sum of the polarities of individual words or phrases. Some of the significant works performed with this technique are: Kamps [12] used a simple technique based on lexical relationships to perform the classification of text. Andrea [13] used word network to classify the text using the assumption that words with similar polarity have a similar orientation. Ting-Chun [14] used an algorithm based on pos (part of the speech) -Patterns. A text phrase was used as a query for a search engine and the results were used to classify the text. Prabhu [15] used a simple lexicon-based technique to extract feelings from Twitter data Turney [19] used semantic orientation in user meetings to classify the underlying feelings [20] Sentifications, Sentitions, Sentitions, Sentitions, Sentitions, Sentations, Sententitions, Sentences, Sentences, Sentences based, Sentences based on Twitter data."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "As explained earlier, the focus of this research was on developing an approach that could perform mood analysis more quickly, as huge amounts of data had to be analysed, and ensuring that accuracy was not compromised too much while focusing on speed. The proposed approach is a lexicon-based technique, i.e. a dictionary of mood words and their polarities was used to divide the text into positive, negative or neutral opinions. Machine learning techniques are not used because they are more accurate than the lexicon-based approaches, but take far too much time for mood analysis, as they require initial training and are therefore not efficient in handling large mood data. The main component of this approach is the mood lexicon or dictionary."}, {"heading": "3.1. Sentiment Lexicon", "text": "Unlike the small dictionaries used in other approaches, which are constructed from a small set of words that use a training data set, the dictionary used in this technique contains a large set of feelings that carry words along with their polarity. The dictionary is domain specific, i.e. the polarities of words in the dictionary are determined according to a particular domain, e.g. book reviews, political blogs, etc. The same word in different domains can have different meanings, the dictionary used in this approach is made for movie reviews. The dictionary contains all forms of a word, i.e. each word is distorted along with its various verb forms, e.g. applause, applause, applause, applause, applause, applause, applause. Therefore, there is no need to contain each word, which saves more time. Emoticons are generally used by people to represent emotions. Therefore, it is obvious that they contain very useful sentiment information. The dictionary, which contains more than 30 subcons, is used together with their emotions."}, {"heading": "3.2. Feature detection using Twitter hashtags", "text": "A hashtag is a word or phrase that is prefixed with the digit sign (\"#\"). It is a form of metadata tag. Words in messages on microblogging and social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Google +, or Instagram can be tagged by prefixing them with \"#,\" either as they appear in a sentence, or as an appendage. As part of this research, Twitter data is categorized by polarity. Recognizing the topic to which the mood is directed is a tedious task, but since Twitter is used as a data source, hashtags can be used to easily identify the topic, eliminating the need for a complex feature recognition mechanism, saving time and effort."}, {"heading": "3.3. Handling negation and blind negation", "text": "Negative words are the words that reverse the polarity of the feelings contained in the text. For example, \"the film was not good.\" Although the word \"good\" describes a positive feeling, the negation - \"not\" - reverses its polarity. In the proposed approach, whenever a negative word appears in a tweet, its polarity is reversed. Blind negative words are the words that operate at the sentence level and refer to a feature that is desirable in a product or service. In the sentence \"action must be better,\" for example, \"better\" describes a positive mood, but the presence of the blind negative word \"necessary\" indicates that this phrase actually represents negative feelings. In the proposed approach, if a blind negative word occurs in a sentence, its polarity is immediately described as negative."}, {"heading": "3.4. Sentiment Calculation", "text": "The polarity value is calculated by using the algorithm 1: ALGO _ SENTICALInput: Tweets, SentiWord _ Dictionary Output: Sentiment (positive, negative or neutral) 1) BEGIN 2) For each tweet Ti 3) {4) SentiScore = 0; 5) For each word Wj in Ti, which is in Sentiword _ Dictionary 6) {7) If polarity [Wj] = blindnegation8) {9) Return negative; 10)} 11) Else 12) {13) If polarity [Wj] = negative & & & & Strength [Wj] = Strongsubj 14) SentiScore = SentiScore + 1; 16) If 17) If Elj Strength = 21 = Wj ="}, {"heading": "4. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION", "text": "In this section, the description of the instruments used to perform the Mood Analysis, together with the performance of the approach and its comparison with existing approaches, is given."}, {"heading": "4.1. Experimental Setup", "text": "The proposed algorithm was implemented with a sandboxed version of Hadoop. Hadoop is designed to operate in a huge multimode environment composed of thousands of servers in different locations, but for research purposes, a single node virtual environment is often used that creates the illusion of multiple nodes located and working together in different places. To simulate the Hadoop environment, an Intel Core i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz processor with 6GB of memory was used. Data was imported from Twitter with Flume, a distributed, reliable, and available service for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of data into the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Subsequently, the data is refined and the algorithm described in the previous section is implemented on top of it using HiveQL. HiveQL is an SQL-like language used in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for manipulating and manipulating huge databases."}, {"heading": "4.2. Results and Evaluation", "text": "The proposed approach has developed very well in terms of speed. It took 14.8 seconds to analyze the feelings behind 6,74,412 tweets. Table 1 shows the performance of the algorithm. In addition, speed can be greatly improved by using an actual multimode chaos environment instead of a sandbox configuration of a single node. The algorithm also performed very well in terms of accuracy. Tweets were analyzed with an accuracy of 73.5%. As expected, it is not as high as the methods of machine learning, but has a relatively good accuracy compared to other lexicon-based approaches. Figure 1 shows a comparison between the average accuracy of machine learning and lexicon-based techniques discussed in Section II and the accuracy of the proposed approach. Table 2 shows the performance of the proposed approach Number of tweets Time Taken Accuracy6,74,412 14.8 seconds 73.5% Figure 1 compared to other methods."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We have outlined some state-of-the-art solutions for emotion classification and provided a new approach that efficiently scales to big data sets. A scalable and practical lexicon-based approach to emotion extraction using emoticons and hashtags is being introduced. Hadoop has been used to classify Twitter data without any training, and our approach has proven extremely successful in terms of both speed and accuracy, showing signs that it can be further scaled to much larger sets of data with similar, indeed better performance. At the heart of this research was the rapid execution of sentiment analysis to handle large sets of data efficiently, and the work can be expanded further by introducing techniques that increase accuracy by addressing issues such as thwarted expressions and implicit sensations that still need to be adequately addressed."}], "references": [{"title": "Sentiment Analysis and Subjectivity", "author": ["B.
