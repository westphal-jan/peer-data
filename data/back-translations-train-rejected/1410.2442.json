While RCC8 is essentially dimensionless, most current applications are limited to considerations of a two-dimensional or three-dimensional physical space. However, the goal of this paper is to analyze how confinement to convex regions limits the feasibility of networks of RCC8 relationships. First, we identify all the ways in which the meaning of RCC8 base relationships can be limited to ensure that consistent networks in 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D can be realized beneficially. Most surprisingly, we find that when the relationship \"partially overlaps,\" all consistent euccepsional networks can be realized using consistent 2D, 2D, 3D, and 4D."}, {"heading": "1.

qualitative spatial relations between regions, such as adjacency, overlap and parthood, can be expressed. While RCC8 is essentially dimensionless, most current applications are confined to reasoning about two-dimensional or threedimensional physical space. In this paper, however, we are mainly interested in conceptual spaces, which typically are high-dimensional Euclidean spaces in which the meaning of natural language concepts can be represented using convex regions. The aim of this paper is to analyze how the restriction to convex regions constrains the realizability of networks of RCC8 relations. First, we identify all ways in which the set of RCC8 base relations can be restricted to guarantee that consistent networks can be convexly realized in respectively 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D. Most surprisingly, we find that if the relation \u2018partially overlaps\u2019 is disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 networks can be convexly realized in 4D. If instead refinements of the relation \u2018part of\u2019 are disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 relations can be convexly realized in 3D. We furthermore show, among others, that any consistent RCC8 network with 2n + 1 variables can be realized using convex regions in the n-dimensional Euclidean space.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
