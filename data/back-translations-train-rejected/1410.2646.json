INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "2. STATE OF THE ART", "text": "Referring to the previous work, the approaches related to the automatic vocalization of Arabic texts can be divided into three sections: rules-based approaches, statistical approaches, and hybrid approaches."}, {"heading": "2.1. Rule-based Approaches", "text": "One of the first studies on this topic is the approach mentioned in [14], which uses syntactic rules for the semi-automatic vocalization of Arabic verbs. In [1] Debili, Fathi and Hadhemi Achour present a study on the automatic vocalization of Arabic texts in relation to the ambiguity of written words and the effects of lexical and morphological analysis and POS tagging in the detection of ambiguities and thus the vocalization of Arabic texts. However, given the high degree of ambiguity, the large number of morphological and syntactic rules, the unavailability of an efficient parser and the need for semantic analysis in some cases, it is difficult to develop an automatic vocalization system based solely on grammatical rules and this explains the lack of such an efficient system."}, {"heading": "2.2. Statistical Approaches", "text": "Given the great achievement achieved by statistical approaches in various areas of natural language processing, such as automatic speech recognition, machine translation and information gathering [15], most works in the field of automatic vowelization of Arabic texts have adopted these approaches. Indeed, the methods used are quite diverse. Indeed, some researchers have developed statistical methods based on the research of diacritical signs at the sign level. Others have used these methods to identify diacritical signs at the word level. Finally, a third group of researchers have developed hybrid methods linking the two approaches. In fact, Emam and Fischer [7] had filed a patent for an automatic vowelization system for Arabic texts based on exemplary machine translation. To select the most likely sentence vowelization, the approach consists first of looking for some examples of the sentence in a database, then the parts of the sentence, and finally the isolated words of the sentence."}, {"heading": "2.3. Hybrid Approaches", "text": "Hybrid methods are algorithms that combine linguistic rules and statistical processes to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches. Of the important work in this area, there is the diacritizer ArabDiac developed by RDI. [18] This system uses the morphological analyzer ArabMorpho and the POS tagger ArabTagger within a probable framework within which the choice of the best vowelization is made with the A * search algorithm. However, the authors Nelken and Shieber [10] have proposed a method for automatic vowelization based on finite state automates.This method combines statistical tri-gram models at the word level, quad-gram models at the character level, and a light morphological analyzer that recognizes the prefixes and suffixes of words. Zitouni, Sorensen, and Sarikaya [3] present a vowelization system with statistical classifications based on maximum entropy."}, {"heading": "3. PRESENTATION OF THE SYSTEM", "text": "This section gives a detailed description of the developed system. The process of automatic vocalization of Arabic texts will take place in two main phases, as shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "3.1. First Phase: Morphological Analysis", "text": "Morphological analyses are performed with the open source analyzer Alkhalil Morpho Sys, which provides all possible vocalizations for each word of the text taken out of context. To further clarify this point, a brief overview of the analyzer and its functioning is given at the beginning, and then the details of the lexical database integrated into the analyzer databases are presented. To evaluate the contribution of the added lexical database, the performance of the system with and without lexicon is tested and the results presented in the section on tests below."}, {"heading": "3.1.1. Overview of Alkhalil Morhp Sys", "text": "The morphological analyzer Alkhalil Morpho Sys is considered one of the most important open source analyzers [13].

Statistical Analysis", "text": "After the program has performed a morphological analysis of text words, which makes it possible to have the potential vocalizations for each word, the second step of the vocalization process is initiated. It consists of a statistical treatment based on the hidden Markov model and the Viterbi algorithm, and enables the most likely vocalization of words in the sentence. In the following, the mechanisms of this model are recalled in detail. Let O = {o1,..., oM} be a finite set of observations and let S = {s1,..., sN} be a finite set of hidden states.

Arabic texts are presented in this article. The process is made up of two modules. In the first one, a morphological analysis of the text words is performed using the open source morphological Analyzer AlKhalil Morpho Sys. Outputs for each word analyzed out of context, are its different possible vowelizations. The integration of this Analyzer in our vowelization system required the addition of a lexical database containing the most frequent words in Arabic language. Using a statistical approach based on two hidden Markov models (HMM), the second module aims to eliminate the ambiguities. Indeed, for the first HMM, the unvowelized Arabic words are the observed states and the vowelized words are the hidden states. The observed states of the second HMM are identical to those of the first, but the hidden states are the lists of possible diacritics of the word without its Arabic letters. Our system uses Viterbi algorithm to select the optimal path among the solutions proposed by Al Khalil Morpho Sys. Our approach opens an important way to improve the performance of automatic vowelization of Arabic texts for other uses in automatic natural language processing.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
