INTRODUCTIONWith the rapid adoption of Western culture and science since the beginning of the 20th century, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been seriously questioned as to its scientific basis. If this kind of debate has been tested in terms of debaters \"attitudes toward TCM, it can be seen that two kinds of feelings prevail: one school believes that TCM is not proven by scientific experiments, so it is pseudo-science and should be abolished, while the other school believes that the TCM service effectively treats many diseases and is therefore essentially a kind of science. Microblogging is now a very popular communication tool among Internet users. In China, Sina Weibo (http: / / www.weibo.com), a Twitter-like microblogging service launched in 2009, has accumulated less than 500 million users in less than four years, leading to its most important role in the social media marketing platform."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "The main studies were divided into two categories: the first is machine learning techniques, which attempt to learn a sensation classification based on the frequency of the various words in the documents; the second is semantically oriented, with words divided into two classes, such as \"positive\" or \"negative,\" and then a general positive / negative assessment of the text; a very broad overview of the existing work was presented in [1, 2]. In their survey, the authors describe existing techniques and approaches to sensation analysis; with the popularization of microblogs and social networks such as Twitter and Weibo, sensation analysis becomes interesting for much research; some of the early and recent results on sensation data from Twitter data have been presented in [3-5]. Go et al. [3] used remote learning to obtain sensation data."}, {"heading": "III. DATA COLLECTING AND LABELING", "text": "In this section, we discuss collecting and pre-processing TCM tweet topics. For each tweet in our corpus, we transform it into a sequence of words."}, {"heading": "A. Corpus Collection based on User Tag", "text": "In China, Sina Weibo is one of the most important social networking channels in China and is the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. As with Twitter, Weibo users are allowed to post real-time messages, called tweets. Tweets are short messages that are limited to 140 characters in length. There are some significant differences between Twitter and Weibo. For example, users are free to tag themselves to indicate their interests and characteristics on Weibo. Of course, tagging is not mandatory on Weibo, where users can mark up to 10 keywords.In January 2014, we searched Weibo users interested in TCM for the user tag. If someone has more than one user tag in our search keyword list, he / she would not be duplicated in our dataset. After filtering the duplicated users, we constructed a dataset of 48861 Weibo users that is called user tag. The user tags and corresponding numbers of Weibo users are listed in Table 1."}, {"heading": "B. Two Dictionary Resources", "text": "In this article we present two new resources for pre-processing Weibo data on TCM: custom dictionary and TCM terminology dictionary. We collect Western medicine terminology, TCM terminology and popular vocabulary on the Internet, totaling 5307 words in the custom dictionary. It can be used as a helpful addition to the built-in dictionary general tool for Chinese word segmentation. TCM terminology dictionary collects 2715 words from TCM terminology, including Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chinese Patent Medicine, Chinese Herbal Medicine and acupuncture points, etc. It can be used to filter the Weibo topic related to TCM."}, {"heading": "C. Preprocessing of Data", "text": "We edit all tweets as follows: 1) simplify translation of the tweet into Chinese if it is written by Chinese Traditional; 2) filter URLs (e.g. http: / / example.com), Weibo usernames (e.g. @ shen with symbol @ indicating a username), Weibo special words (e.g. response) and emoticons from tweets; 3) segment Chinese words (using the ICTCLAS tool [8] and the custom dictionary introduced in Section B) to generate a sequence of words; 4) remove stopwords (such as \"oh\") from the wordbag; 5) filter advertising by keyword (e.g. \"sale\")."}, {"heading": "D. Filtering Chinese Medicine Tweets", "text": "However, the themes of the tweets posted by users interested in TCM are diverse and do not only concern the TCM. Therefore, in our study, we should screen out the tweets that are not about TCM. In our approach, we filter the TCM Tweet theme using the TCM terminology dictionary (introduced in Section B). Normally, a TCM Tweet theme contains more than one keyword, so we strictly filter the tweets with at least two different TCM keywords. After filtering, there are 1,650,497 tweets in our corpus where the real topic is about TCM."}, {"heading": "E. Labeling the Data", "text": "When we label the mood of the tweet, our approach is based on the basic principle: The user tends to have uniform opinions on a particular topic due to the principle of consistency. [9] This means that if the user's opinion is for TCM, the mood of all the tweets he / she has posted is for TCM. In our approach, we record the user's opinion about TCM through the user tag. The keyword used as the user tag is defined by the user. Consequently, the user tags might be different even if the mood is the same to TCM. The user tags used to label the mood are in Table 2. Only the user tags cited by more than 10 users are included in the table. As a result, CetC66 user sentiment is not supported by TCM, while the rest of CetC66 user sentiment is supported by Timbo."}, {"heading": "IV. METHODOLOGY", "text": "This section introduces the methodology of the sentiment classification we use. First, the feature selection method is used to pick out differentiating terms for training and classification, then we use the machine learning method to create a sentiment classifier, and finally, we adjust the classification result based on the basic principle that a user has consistent opinions on a particular topic."}, {"heading": "A. Feature Selection", "text": "Text categorization examined a number of criteria for the selection of attributes, i.e. chi-square (CHI), information gain (IG), correlation coefficient (CC), and odds ratio (OR), all of which methods calculate a score for each individual attribute and then select a predefined size of the attribute set. In our approach, we use the method of chi-square attribute selection, one of the most effective methods for text categorization [10]. chi-square measures the lack of independence between a term t and a category ci and can be compared with chi-square distribution, giving a degree of freedom to assess extreme states. It is defined as: \u03c72 (t, ci) = N [P (t, ci) P (t, ci) \u2212 P (t, ci) P (t, ci) P (t, ci)] 2P (t (t) P (t, ci) (t, ci) (total number) (ci) (P) (ci) (P), ci (N) is the document."}, {"heading": "B. Machine Learning Method", "text": "So far, most research on the classification of feelings has focused on machine learning training algorithms to classify assessments. Support vectors (SVM) have proven highly effective for traditional text categorization [11]. Based on the principle of structural risk minimization from computational learning theory, SVM seeks a decision space to separate the training points into two classes and makes decisions based on the support vectors selected as the only effective elements in the training set. Here, we limit our discussion to linear SVM due to its popularity and high performance in text categorization [12]. Optimization of SVMs (dual form) is intended to minimize: ~ \u03b1 = arg min {\u2212 n \u0445 i = 1\u03b1i + n \u0445 i = 1 n \u0445 j = 1 \u03b1jyiyj < ~ xi, ~ xj >} Subject to: n \u0445 i = 1 \u03b1jyij < ~ xxi}."}, {"heading": "C. Adjusting Sentiment Classification Result", "text": "Based on the basic principle that the same user should have consistent opinions on a particular topic, we adjust the sentiment classification result: assign a majority sentiment label to all tweets posted by the same user. Based on the sentiment classification result, we can obtain the number of tweets posted by a user as Cs as supporting TCM, and the number of tweets posted by the same user that are judged to be contrary to TCM as Co. Then we define q as\u03b3 = max {Cs, Co} Cs + Cowhere 0.5 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 \u2264 1. If q = 1 means that the user's mood is absolutely consistent. If q = 0.5 means that Co is equal to Cs, we do not need to adjust the sentiment classification result. If 0.5 < GP < < 1, we can adjust the classification result."}, {"heading": "V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "text": "In our dataset, there are 1,650,497 tweets focusing on TCM, including 40,888 tweets designated as supporting TCM and 6,975 tweets designated as counterproductive TCM (introduced in Section 4). Since the topic is unbalanced, we focused not only on global performance, but also on the performance of each class. Therefore, we chose formula 1 to evaluate the classification system. After applying the CHI feature selection to tweets, we used the Support Vector Machine for all our experiments and reported 5-fold cross-validation test results. Pang [11] argued that the binary value of feature presences is more useful than the feature frequency for SVM classification. Therefore, we use a binary value for each feature instead of feature frequency."}, {"heading": "A. The performance measure", "text": "To evaluate the unbalanced classification system, we use formula 1. This unit combines recall and precision in the following ways: Precision = Number of Correct Positive ForecastsNumber of Positive ForecastsRecall = Number of Correct Positive ForecastsNumber of Positive ForecastsF1 = 2 \u0445 Precision \u043a Callback + Precision"}, {"heading": "B. Feature Selection Results", "text": "Among TCM advocates, it is not surprising that \"medical material,\" \"health maintenance,\" \"traditional Chinese medicine\" and \"body\" are often used. \"State\" and \"China\" may be used frequently because the Chinese government has a clear policy of supporting TCM. Opponents of TCM include \"aristolochian acid,\" \"cinnabar,\" \"Longdan Xiegan Wan\" and \"injection.\" This could be due to the fact that all these terms are associated with adverse effects, so that opponents want to shake the scientific basis of TCM. Figure 1 shows the performance curves of the classification using the CHI feature selection method vs. feature number. The performance of the classification is over 90% stable and the performance increases with the number of features. It is noted that the performance of the TCM advocate classifiers is slightly higher than the performance of the entire fix."}, {"heading": "C. Classification Results", "text": "Since the data set is unbalanced, we adjust the wi parameter for SVM, where 0 \u2264 wi \u2264 1.Figure 2 shows the performance of F1, precision and callback by varying the parameter wi from 0.1 to 1.0. If wi increases from 0 to 1, precision, callback and F1 all increase significantly and reach a plateau.Figure 3 shows precision and callback separately from each class by varying the parameter wi. Interestingly, precision has a reverse trend of callback. If wi increases from 0 to 1, the precision of support for the TCM gradually decreases, while the precision of the opposing TCM increases rapidly. During the same process, the callback of support for the TCM increases, while the callback of the opposing TCM decreases markedly. Figure 4 shows the performance of each class individually. From these numbers we can see that it is better to set wi to 0.9 as the precision of the TM increases rapidly."}, {"heading": "D. Adjusted Classification Results", "text": "As introduced in section 4.3, we can adjust the classification results based on the principle that the same user should have uniform opinions on a particular topic. Figure 5 shows the performance by varying the parameter \u03b3 from 0.5 to 1 (and fixing wi = 0.9). There is a significant decrease in F1. If \u03b3 is set to 0.5, our model achieves the best performance of F1, which is 97%."}, {"heading": "E. Prediction", "text": "Figure 6 shows the curves for the number of tweets that each support TCM (a) and reject TCM (b). The number of tweets that support TCM far exceeds the number of tweets that reject TCM. For simple comparison, the number of tweets that reject TCM and support TCM is converted to their protocol forms, as shown in (c). This result is consistent with the real world. In China, most people support TCM, especially the TCM regime. There are only a small number of people who oppose TCM. Furthermore, the number of tweets before 2010 is very small, due to the limitation of Weibo, where only the most recent 2000 tweets of each user can be mapped to TCM."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "Traditional Chinese Medicine is an ancient but thriving and somewhat controversial discipline, in the meantime it is important to study the feelings and opinions of the public about TCM. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to study the emotion analysis for TCM based on user tags on Weibo. We classify opinions about TCM into two categories: support for TCM and resistance to TCM. The measurement of our method is 0.97. In addition, we collect 48,861 Weibo users who are interested in TCM and 1,650,497 tweets about TCM. And we construct two dictionary resources for processing Chinese tweets on TCM. Based on the above companies and resources, we build an effective classification with SVM to automatically analyze feelings about TCM using Weibo tweets."}], "references": [{"title": "Opinion mining and sentiment analysis,", "author": ["B.
