Since many online services rely on machine learning algorithms to recommend relevant content to their users, it is crucial that user feedback is legitimate and indicative of true interests. \""}, {"heading": "II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "text": "We begin with a detailed look at several current methods for detecting web fraud and spam. Table I shows a qualitative comparison between different methods for detecting link fraud."}, {"heading": "A. Spectral methods", "text": "We classify techniques that analyze the latent factors produced as spectral methods in graph-based self-analyses or matrix / tensor decomposition. These algorithms attempt to find patterns in graph decompositions in order to extract coherent groups of users or objects. Prakash et al's work on the eigenSpokes pattern [19] and Jiang et al's work on spectral subspaces of social networks [9] are two such approaches that we primarily focus on and that have been applied to real datasets to detect suspicious link behavior. [21] Using a similar analysis of spectral link patterns, we focus on random link attacks (RLAs) that exhibit properties other than link fraud and thus produce different patterns. This work utilizes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the input graph graphs graphs graphs graphs graphs graphs graphs graphics graphs that focus on graph behavior, but not on graph-detect patterns."}, {"heading": "B. Graph-traversal based methods", "text": "A variety of algorithms have been proposed to traverse the graph directly to find or stop suspicious behavior. [20] offers a random walk algorithm to detect RLAs. [6] suggests a PageRank-like approach to punishing promiscuous users on Twitter, but unfortunately only proves effective in detecting spammers already caught rather than detecting new ones. [18] uses belief propagation to find near-bilateral cores of attackers on eBay.The most similar application, however, is Beutel et as a COPYCATCH algorithm to find suspicious lockstep behavior in Facebook page likes [3]. COPYCATCH is a clustering method that attempts to find densely connected groups in loud data by limited graph transgression, motivated by the intuition of scams that take the form of naively generated two-sided cores in the input graph."}, {"heading": "C. Feature-based methods", "text": "Detection of spam and fraud has traditionally been described as a function-based classification problem, based, for example, on the words in spam emails or URLs in tweets. [7] However, it focuses on malicious tweets and notes that approaches to blacklisting are too slow to curb the spread of Twitter spam. ODDBALL [1] proposes functions based on egonets to find abnormal users using weighted charts. [4] and [13] take a game theory approach to learning simple classifiers about generic traits to detect spam. Although these approaches are related from an adverse perspective, they focus on the general function-based classification as for spam email, rather than the graph analysis required to detect link fraud."}, {"heading": "III. AN ADVERSARIAL ANALYSIS - OUR PERSPECTIVE", "text": "In this section, we examine the exploitability of state-of-the-art methods from an opposing point of view, that is, we ignore the methods we use to detect the limitations of these methods. In particular, we use theoretical analyses to show that existing methods are highly vulnerable to attacks by intelligent attackers. Table II provides a comprehensive list of symbols and corresponding definitions used in our paper. Given the knowledge of the detection threshold used by a particular service, how can an attacker avoid intelligent attacks on this service in order to avoid detection by fraud methods? We present the following adversarial problems: Problem 1: Given an input diagram adjacency matrix A, with rows and columns corresponding to the users and objects, engineer a covert attack that falls below the minimum size detectable by modern state-of-the-art detection methods.As previously described, most of the core detection methods focus on the finders, or rather the finblatants."}, {"heading": "A. Na\u0131\u0308ve Injection", "text": "This is the most remarkable attack pattern considered in previous work. Na\u0131-Frobenius injection distributes the entire fraudulent sc actions into an s \u00b7 c submatrix of S. Thus, only s of the f-attacker nodes perform fraudulent actions, and all fraudulent actions are distributed among these s-nodes. Graphically, this corresponds to the introduction of an s \u00b7 c complete bipartite core. Such an attack corresponds to the attackers linking almost the same set of s-nodes with each of the c customers, creating a complete block in A. Figure 2a shows a visual representation of such an attack. Lemma 1: The leading singular value of an s \u00b7 c bipartite core injection is \u03c31 = \u221a cs.Proof: Since S is a complete block, where Si, j = 1 for all i \u2264 s, j \u2264 c, SST must be an s-matrix, where Sc = \u221a s for all is equal."}, {"heading": "B. Staircase Injection", "text": "However, in contrast to the na\u00efve method, where each node that performs fraudulent actions does so for each of the c customers, the stairwell method forces different subgroups of nodes to connect to different subgroups of customers. This distribution results in the S matrix looking like a staircase of links. Figure 2b shows a visual representation of such an attack. We limit our analysis here to staircase injections where all users have the same degrees o and the same degrees i, although they are not the same i. If the degrees and the degrees are not the same, users and objects do not have uniform connecting properties, which complicates the calculations. In particular, we assume that the periodicity of the staircase pattern given by t = lcm (s, f) / s is such that t | c is equivalent to ensure these criteria."}, {"heading": "C. Random Graph Injection", "text": "The random graph bears close resemblance to the nearly bifurcated core with the density p attack noted in [3]. The random graph distributes \u2248 sc fraudulent actions roughly evenly across the f attack nodes. Figure 2c shows a visual representation of such an attack. This approach assigns to each node a fixed probability p = sc / cf = s / f of performing a fraudulent operation related to one of the c customers. Given the average number of fraudulent operations per customer, it will be approximately the expected value of s, and as a result, the total number of fraudulent actions will be close to sc. The random graphic injection is similar to the erdo-re method defined by G (n, p) [5], unless we consider a directed graph with cf possible edges."}, {"heading": "IV. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK FOR FRAUD BEHAVIORS", "text": "As shown in Section III, current detection methods are effective for catching blatant attacks, but effectiveness decreases as the attack size decreases. Although the scale of detected attacks is differently defined for different sets of data, there is necessarily such a detection overlap point given the well-defined nature of the singular value generated by common attack types. In this section, we will give a more comprehensive overview of possible attack modes and the capabilities of current methods in dealing with them. Table IV shows how current techniques fit into our classification of suitable defenses against four different types of attack and how the proposed FBOX algorithm can fill the remaining holes to provide a more holistic framework for fraud detection. The four types of attacks we address in this work are classified on the basis of two densities - the scale of attack and the presence of camouflage patterns given above, the scale of attack is unrelated to the size of the attack, the scope of the scope of the attack, or the scope of the attack."}, {"heading": "A. Blatant Attack/No Camouflage", "text": "Of the four types, blatant attacks without camouflage are the easiest to detect. Blatant attacks with singular values above the threshold \u03c3k and therefore occurring in the precedence-k decomposition of spectral methods generate spoke-like patterns and can be identified with SPOKEN. It should be noted that SPOKEN is a method of filtering large communities out of graphics, and not necessarily attackers. In this case, a check of blatant lockstep behavior is required as fraudulent."}, {"heading": "B. Blatant Attack/Camouflage", "text": "Of course, blatant attacks with camouflage are more difficult to detect than without. Although the singular values of the attacks are above the threshold \u03c3k and the associated singular vectors occur in the simple decomposition of spectral methods, Jiang et al. showed that the spectral subspace diagrams had tilting beams instead of axial spokes. COPYCATCH is also effective in detecting blatant attacks with camouflage (provided the parameter selection is sufficiently large to limit the rate of false positive parameters), since camouflage is ignored in the case that an m, n, p nearly two-sided nucleus is found for a subset of U and P for a fixed snapshot of the input graph."}, {"heading": "C. Stealth Attack/No Camouflage", "text": "As noted in Section III, current detection systems are highly vulnerable to covert attacks designed to fall below the parameter thresholds of \u03c3k for spectral methods or m, n, p for cluster methods. To our knowledge, no previous technology has been able to successfully and effectively identify users involved in this type of attack. Although covert attacks may be of less importance individually than major fraud cases, they have the insidious ability to achieve the same number of fraudulent actions in a more controlled and less detectable manner, at the expense of creating more fraudulent accounts. In response to this threat, we propose the FBOX algorithm for identifying such attacks in Section V and demonstrate its effectiveness in Section VI."}, {"heading": "D. Stealth Attack/Camouflage", "text": "Given that the identification of small attacks has been an open problem for fraud detection, the problem of identifying these attacks with disguise has not been addressed either. The difficulty of dealing with camouflage is particularly evident when looking at user accounts with few outgoing or incoming links, as is typically the case with smaller attacks. From a user's perspective, it may seem that a truly fraudulent account is mostly honest, but with a few suspicious or uncharacteristic links (which are not enough to be labeled fraudulent) or is rarely / rashly used due to the small number of total links."}, {"heading": "V. PROPOSED ALGORITHM", "text": "Given this problem, it is natural to consider the following question - how can we identify the many small attacks that tend to slip under the radar of existing techniques? In this section, we formalize our problem definition and propose FBOX as the appropriate method to solve this problem."}, {"heading": "A. Problem Formulation", "text": "We identify the main problem that needs to be addressed as follows: Problem 2: Given input diagrams adjacence matrix A = Unique A = Unique A = Unique A = with rows and columns that correspond to users and objects (could be pages, articles, etc. or even other users), identify stealth attacks that are undetectable given a desired decomposition rank k for A (undetectable since their singular values fall below the threshold).Note that problem 2 is an exact foil to problem 1. In this paper, we primarily focus on intelligent attacks that fall below a practice-defined decomposition threshold, since a number of earlier mentioned works have addressed the problem of detecting blatant attacks. Given that this body is effective in detecting such attacks, we note that the best means of boxing in attackers is a complex approach to existing methods of intrinsic analysis, such as our technique in Section IV that indicates a lack of fits."}, {"heading": "B. Description", "text": "The question we ask ourselves is whether we are able to supplement existing fraud techniques by being able to identify the real application techniques of the real application techniques of the real application techniques of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application practice of the real application of the real application practice of the component-component-component-component-component-component-no application of the real application practice of the real application practice of the component-component-component-component-component-component-component-component-no application of the real application of the real application practice of the real application of the real application of the real application practice of the real application of the real application practice of the real application of the real application of the real application of the real application practice of the real application of the real application of the real application practice of the real application of the real application practice of the real application of the real application of the real application of the component-component-component-component-component-component-component-component-component-component"}, {"heading": "VI. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Datasets", "text": "For our experiments, we primarily use two datasets: the who-follows-who Twitter graph and the who-rates-what Amazon graph. (The Twitter graph was scraped by Kwak et al. in March 2013 and contains 41.7 million users with 1.5 billion edges [11]. We showed the distribution of the suspicious values in Figure 3a. Our analysis is performed both directly and via synthetic attacks. B. FBOX on real Twitter accounts To show our effectiveness in capturing smart link fraud attacks on real data, we performed a classification of data from the Twitter graph. Specifically, we collected the results for suspicious fans and idols with a grade of at least 20 (to avoid catching unused accounts) for seven different values of the detection threshold."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we approached the problem of distinguishing dishonest attackers and their customers from honest users in the context of charts of online social networks or web services using a graph-based approach (using the Adjazency Matrix, which represents user-object relationships). Our main contributions are: 1) Theoretical Analysis: We examine several modern methods for detecting fraud from an opposite perspective, and provide theoretical results regarding the vulnerability of these methods to various types of attack. 2) FBOX Algorithm: We describe FBOX, a method that is motivated to address the blind spots discovered in theoretical analysis, in order to uncover a class of clandestine attacks that previous methods could not effectively detect. 3) Real Data Effectiveness: We apply FBOX to a large Twitter follower-sem dataset from 2010 and discover many tens of thousands of suspicious users whose accounts remain active for data."}], "references": [{"title": "Oddball: Spotting anomalies in weighted graphs", "author": ["L.
