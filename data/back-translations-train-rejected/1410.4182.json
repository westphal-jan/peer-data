Literature Review", "text": "The environmental impact study presented to external users and people in general is known as environmental reporting, or EIA. The growing need for stakeholder information and changes in organizational practices have led to enormous amounts of information that need to be measured [6]. In addition, good environmental performance (or resource productivity) is seen as an advantage in dynamic business competition [7]. Therefore, environmental concerns need to be integrated into corporate objectives, with economic decisions achievable for the company."}, {"heading": "3.

Research Objectives and Hypothesis", "text": "The overall goal of the study is to systematically examine and analyze the nature of environmental reporting by selected companies from a global perspective. To conduct the analysis, data mining technology is used to develop a model for extracting data from a vast database. 1. To create a data mining model for generating frequencies and scorecards for the annual reports. 2. To investigate how the selected variables have a significant impact on the industrial sector. 3. To determine which control variables distinguish between two or more naturally occurring groups. 4. To conduct a further investigation of the relationships between the extracted factors. Industries that are subject to rigorous scrutiny by environmental groups and community stakeholders will have much higher environmental costs [20]. Therefore, it is assumed: \"The extent of reporting between different industries is similar.\""}, {"heading": "5.

Limitations and Conclusion", "text": "Data mining on qualitative reports can be improved by making searches smarter when complex searches for words of similar meaning can be found within a file. In this study, only the criteria available on the company registry website were used, and no additional sources were used to collect data. The dependent variable selected for the study is only one type of business. In this study, the criteria for searching in the reports are limited to 10 variables, which could be revised over time for further investigation. Similar studies could be conducted on other demographic data such as location, size, time series, within the same domain and the like. The study examines and analyzes the nature of environmental reporting using data mining technology. As it is of different nature, it will be difficult for users of information to measure the reports and make appropriate decisions. As the data included for the study is a global directory of company reports, the information provided is highly reliable and up-to-date, so it will be difficult for users of information to measure the reports and make appropriate decisions. As the data included for the study is a global directory of company reports, the information provided by data mining technology is highly up-to-date."}, {"heading": "8.
