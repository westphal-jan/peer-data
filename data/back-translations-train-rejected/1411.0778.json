However, technical approaches toward preventing suicide are challenging and remaining under development. Recently, several actual suicidal cases were preceded by users who posted microblogs with suicidal ideation to Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media network akin to Twitter. It would therefore be desirable to detect suicidal ideations from microblogs in real-time, and immediately alert appropriate support groups, which may lead to successful prevention. In this paper, we propose a real-time suicidal ideation detection system deployed over Weibo, using machine learning and known psychological techniques. Currently, we have identified 53 known suicidal cases who posted suicide notes on Weibo prior to their deaths.We explore linguistic features of these known cases using a psychological lexicon dictionary, and train an effective suicidal Weibo post detection model. 6714 tagged posts and several classifiers are used to verify the model. By combining both machine learning and psychological knowledge, SVM classifier has the best performance of different classifiers, yielding an F-measure of 68:3%, a Precision of 78:9%, and a Recall of 60:3%.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Nov 2014 03:48:20 GMT  (543kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0778v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xiaolei huang", "lei zhang", "tianli liu", "david chiu", "tingshao zhu", "xin li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.0778"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.0778.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Detecting Suicidal Ideation in Chinese Microblogs with Psychological Lexicons", "authors": ["Xiaolei Huang", "Lei Zhang", "Tianli Liu", "David Chiu", "Xin Li", "Tingshao Zhu"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "I. INTRODUCTIONThe World Health Organization (WHO) recently reported that 800,000 suicides occurred worldwide in 2012 [1], which translates to a person committing suicide every 40 seconds. However, this regrettable report places suicide among the leading causes of death worldwide, especially for young people aged 15 to 29. However, in recent years, the suicide problem in China has attracted a lot of attention. Previous psychological researches [2] have reported that about 290,000 Chinese people died each year from suicide, with about 36% of all suicides being solved worldwide. Although the number of suicide techniques has declined in recent years, the WHO [1] reported that there were still 120, 730 Chinese who committed suicide, in 2012.Psychologists have been working on suicide prevention for years, finding that suicide ideology can be clearly identified from the writings and contributions of victims. Wong, et al. analyzed suicide notes found in the medical records of Hong Kong [3]."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORKS", "text": "In this section, we give an overview of suicide detection in psychology, and then briefly present current research on suicidal thoughts that are classified. Suicide has been extensively studied in the field of psychology. Traditional research methods rely mainly on questionnaires. Chen, et al., reported that \"media propagation\" had significant effects on depressive behavior [6]. They found that suicide rates increased solely due to news reports of coal burning. Li, et al., studied a 13-year-old adolescent who wrote 193 blog entries using the Chinese Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (CLIWC), and found several key features in his suicide notes, including the frequency of posting, and positive to negative emotion words ratio. [7] In another study, Delgado-Gomez et al, they acquired 849 cases from Spain and manually punctuated them through psychological or standards."}, {"heading": "III. METHODS", "text": "In this section, we present the background and detailed description of our system and the algorithms involved. An overview of our three-level framework for detecting suicides is shown in Fig. 1. Posts collected from our crawler are used to extract several basic attributes: 1) text content; 2) user behavior, such as time, mentions, posting type; 3) social interactions, such as users commenting on or liking this post. Using linguistic dictionaries, we are able to extract a number of characteristics from these basic attributes in the first step, such as keywords, negations, negative emotions, etc. We then take a sample and assign weights to process the data in order to resolve unbalanced data. Unbalanced data refers to each data set that has an unequal distribution among its classes [21]. In our data set, no suicidal posts are used as self-generating posts, and eventually become self-suicidal posts."}, {"heading": "A. Data Collection and Tagging", "text": "Our data is collected through the Open Platform API of Sina Microblog [22] and our Java-based crawler. We have downloaded 53 verified suicide profiles and over 30,000 posts. In addition, we have also collected 600,000 posts from 1,000 random, non-suicidal users. We have curated all suicide posts and received 614 real suicide posts. To perform a 90-10 test, we randomly evaluated 6,140 posts from the group of non-suicidal users, totaling 6,754 posts. After filtering some blank posts, we receive 6,704 posts."}, {"heading": "B. Lexicon Construction", "text": "Since there are no lexicographs specifically for suicidal words or phrases, we are expanding our psychological lexicographies with the latest version of HowNet [23], a Chinese-based resource for emotional words or phrases for emotional analysis. Psychological dictionaries contain some depressive words or phrases commonly used in suicide notes cases. We use these dictionaries to determine and count the number of positive, negative, neutral words or phrases and the ratio of positive to negative words. Examples of Chinese words and phrases in HowNet are shown in Table I and examples of psychological dictionaries in Table II."}, {"heading": "C. Feature Extraction and Modeling", "text": "We use Ansj [24], a Chinese word segmentation tool, to segment words and remove punctuation, as we usually only get complex sentences on web pages. We choose three basic N -gram characteristics: Unigram, Bigram, and Trigram. We use emotional words from the lexicon to find out their emotional polarity in the sentence, and we also calculate the ratio of negative to positive emotions words.Li, et al., found that suicide victims tend to write more about themselves and less about others in posting entries, like me, myself, us, etc. During our research we found that victims also like to mention their parents or grandparents, brothers or sisters, or even other suicide victims. Statistics of the references are included in Table III.Syntactic functions include dependency relationships, part of speech (POS) tagging, and sentence tenses. We use Stanford Parser NLP [25] to get the statistics of each POS sentence."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION", "text": "In this section we describe our experimental approach and discuss the results. The classification results of our experiment are evaluated by \"precision,\" \"recall,\" \"F-measure\" and \"accuracy.\" We assume that the classifier could correctly detect the suicidal posts for \"precision,\" \"recall,\" or \"F-measure.\" Accuracy \"refers to all predictions that correspond to their designations, regardless of whether they are suicidal posts or not. We use 10x cross validation to ensure proper separation of our 6704 experimental data entries, and use various classifiers to perform classification methods. We use the SVM classifier from LibSVM [27] package for suicidal posts or not. The classifier in our experiments used a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. For parameters, we use the network search with LibSVM [27] package for suicidal posts or not."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK", "text": "Based on psychological lexicographs, we use machine learning techniques to detect suicidal thoughts in social media posts, which is a new approach to studying people's online behavior. As social networks provide people with a new way of communicating so they can express their emotions, including suicidal thoughts, it is very helpful to build a monitoring system that could help psychologists analyze these posts to identify psychological traits such as suicide. In our work, the accuracy of suicidal thoughts is 79%, and overall accuracy can reach 94%. The purpose of this research is to draw people's attention to the issue of suicide and show how useful it is if we could use both machine learning and psychological knowledge to identify suicidal thoughts. Our future work will be done in three directions: \"Topic Model,\" \"Latent Social Relationship,\" and \"Deep Learning.\" Topic Model [28] is a very useful tool to analyze suicidal thoughts."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The authors are grateful for the generous support of the National High-Tech R & D Program of China (2013AA01A606), National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program 2014CB744600), Key Research Program of CAS (KJZD-EW-L04) and Strategic Priority Research Program (XDA06030800) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences."}], "references": [{"title": "Preventing Preventing suicide:A global imperative", "author": ["W.H.
