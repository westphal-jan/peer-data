The messages they post have the potential to reveal their psychological indices such as suicidal ideation with or without intention. In this post, we have proposed a task that predicts the suicidal ideation of Sina Weibo users, thereby enabling the group to be identified with a high likelihood of committing suicide and lives can be saved through intervention. First, we collect information about both suicidal ideation and messages from Sina Weibo users. Suicide ideation is measured by the Suicide Probability Scale (SPS), a widely used psychological scale. Messages are downloaded using a crawling device. Second, linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and latent Dirichlet Allocationar Xiv: 141 1.08 61v1 [cs.SI] messages are applied to 4DA (LDA) features."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Sensing Suicidal Ideation", "text": "Hotline service and personal diagnosis are two effective methods of suicide intervention, but both have limits when there is a lack of initiative. Mentally ill people are encouraged to engage with the high-risk group of suicide users, but with low efficiency. Enlightened by the phenomenon of many people posting suicide notes on the Internet, the suicide sensation on the Internet shows an effective method of proactive suicide prevention. Although it is not yet clear to what extent suicide notes on social networks have a bad impact or even trigger imitation suicides [18], the suicide intervention of net users is a promising method of saving lives. Ours are only two studies that focus on detecting suicidal ideation on the Internet. Silenzio proposed a method to identify hard-to-reach populations that reported high rates of suicide [20]. Jared et al. made easier progress to create a message filter on Twitter that uses phrases and risk factors."}, {"heading": "2.2 Predict Psychological Indexes with Social Network", "text": "Well-studied psychological indices included personality, mental health, subjective well-being, etc. Golbeck et al. built predictive models on both Twitter and Facebook [8,10]. The information they gathered from two websites included language traits, personal information, activities and preferences, internal website statistics, composite traits, structural, etc. Sibel and Golbeck then proposed a comparative study on predicting personality with social behavior [1]. The most recent progress of their research is that they used Twitter follower contacts to calculate the political preferences of an organization's Twitter followers [9]. A solid predictive model requires large-scale data, which is why Kosinski et al. made such an effort, together with more than 6,000,000 test results, to collect more than 4,000,000 individual Facebook profiles. Using large-scale data, they create a predictive matrix for users to predict wide range of personal attributes."}, {"heading": "2.3 Linguistic Feature Extraction", "text": "Dictionary-based methods are typically used by psychologists to analyze people's linguistic differences. A dictionary of positive emotions, for example, could contain words such as \"happy,\" \"good,\" \"love,\" \"beautiful\" and \"sweet.\" Counting the frequency of positive emotions used by introverts and extroverts provides psychologists with a quantitative result that distinguishes two types of people based on their linguistic differences. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is a handmade dictionary used in social psychology studies and is widely used [15]. Considering \"positive emotions\" is just one category in our example, the 2007 version of LIWC offers 64 categories to cover a wide range of human linguistic traits. Thus, for each document we are interested in, LIWC can provide 64 characteristics for the analysis of researchers. Topic models are a set of algorithms that reveal outstanding information behind collections of documents."}, {"heading": "3 Methods", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data Collection", "text": "Sina Weibo is the largest microblog site in China. In May and June 2014, 1038 Sina Weibo users were recruited to complete the Suicide Probability Scale (SPS) [6]. The SPS consists of four sub-scales, each with eight points on each sub-scale. The end result of the SPS is the sum of all four parts. Participants who complete the scale can be paid 30 Chinese yuan. The age of participants ranges from 14 to 63 years and the average is 24. The gender of participants is not evenly distributed, so that a total of 647 women and 391 men take part in the test.Figure 1 shows the age and gender distribution of all participants. In order to link the score with Sina Weibo users, we create a crawler program to download the most recent 2000 messages from participants to Sina Weibo (download all messages if there are fewer than 2000 messages). Figure 2 shows the distribution of the number of messages per user. To ensure the reliability of the Text2, we have excluded the small number of users from the SPS-2 to answer the question."}, {"heading": "3.2 Text Process", "text": "The length of messages on microblog are always limited. Sina Weibo allows users to post less than 140 Chinese characters each time. Nevertheless, Sina Weibo is a very good source of text for web content mining because all messages are publicly visible and the amount is huge. LWIC and theme models are often used on Facebook status updates and Twitter messages, all of which are written in English. On Chinese corpus such as Sina Weibo messages, the process details and their performance remain questions.Preprocess. first, we removed some Sina Weibo specific markers (such as retweet markers, hashtags) and the words do not speak by the author (such as retweets, answers). Then, a segmentor is used [5], as the Chinese words are not separated by default. The segment model of the segment is trained by manually segmented Sina Weibo sentences. After segmentation, we removed the stopwords and individual words (consider the express unit of the Chinese version of the IBL, the original Chinese dictionary, we revised 7."}, {"heading": "3.3 Predict Model", "text": "When creating prediction models, text attributes (LIWC attributes and theme attributes) are independent variables and PLC score-dependent variables. Caret creates a unified modeling and prediction interface that includes a variety of \"auxiliary functions\" and classes. We use RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) [23] to evaluate the uncertainty of the predicted score."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "With the help of the Caret package, a 10x cross-validation is used to get the most benefit from the data and avoid potential overmatch."}, {"heading": "4.1 Predictive Power of LIWC", "text": "The second highest correlated dimension are \"cognitive processes\" (e.g. \"cause,\" \"knowledge,\" \"should\" in English), with the correlation coefficient of 0.09. Both correlations are significant at p < 0.01. Since we have only one parameter to predict, its RMSE is 15.43. Using this figure as a baseline, we can compare it with the obtained result topic model."}, {"heading": "4.2 Predictive Power of Topic Model", "text": "As discussed in Chapter 3.2, we perform the topic attributes in two different ways. Result of the trained topics As shown in Figure 3, we experimented with LDA using 10, 20,..., 100, 200 and 300 topics. If the number of topics is no more than 70, the RMSE fluctuated only slightly (from 11.68 to 11.97). If a larger number is set on LDA, the RMSE obviously increased (to 15.06). It indicates that if the granularity of the topics is too low, the topics are more likely not to capture the reference to suicidal ideation. The top rated RMSE is 11.68 if the number of topics is set to 70, which is much better than the result of the LIWC (15.43). It also confirms previous research that the topics exceed the LIWC characteristics beyond the predictive power [17.19]. The result of the derived topics As shown in Figure 4, we present RMSE with the same number of topics that are set by the subjects trained."}, {"heading": "4.3 Predictive Power of LIWC+Topic Model", "text": "As shown in Table 2, LIWC does not place much value on predictive power for the PLC score. If we combine LIWC and trained topics as characteristics, the predictive model has been improved compared to the pure use of trained topics. If we combine LIWC and derived topics as characteristics, the predictive model has not been improved. Generally, only derived topics can achieve the highest performance, whether with or without LIWC."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "The best RMSE score achieved with gradual linear regression is about 11 on a scale of 1-32. The study results suggest that the suicidal ideation is predictable, but the predictive accuracy needs to be improved. As suicidal ideation transactions are rare, we are trying to innovate with topics derived from a model trained by a group with a high suicidal ideation, and the resulting 10 topics achieved the same or higher rates in the prediction task. The same method is also worthwhile for other prediction tasks. In addition, some conclusions from previous work are confirmed in our study."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors are grateful for the generous support of China's National High-Tech R & D Programme (2013AA01A606), China's National Basic Research Programme (973 Programme 2014CB744600), the CAS Key Research Programme (KJZD-EW-L04) and the Strategic Priority Research Programme (XDA06030800) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences."}], "references": [{"title": "Predicting personality with social behavior: a comparative study", "author": ["S.
