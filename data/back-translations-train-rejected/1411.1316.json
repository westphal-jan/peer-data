Yet, while difficulty and player learning have been explored in the context of games, there has been little work analyzing skill per se, and how it pertains to a player's input. To this end, we present a data set of 476 game logs from over 40 players of a first-person shooter game (Red Eclipse) as a basis of a case study. We then analyze different metrics of skill and show that some of these can be predicted using only a few seconds of keyboard and mouse input. We argue that the techniques used here are useful for adapting games to match players' skill levels rapidly, perhaps more rapidly than solutions based on performance averaging such as TrueSkill.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 16:41:12 GMT  (1242kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1316v1", "16 pages, 28 figures, journal paper submission"], ["v2", "Thu, 6 Nov 2014 13:04:25 GMT  (1437kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1316v2", "16 pages, 28 figures, journal paper submission"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 28 figures, journal paper submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["david buckley", "ke chen", "joshua knowles"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.1316"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.1316.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Rapid Skill Capture in a First-Person Shooter", "authors": ["David Buckley", "Ke Chen", "Joshua Knowles"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This is an important component of any recreational or competitive activity. In our research, it not only contributes to the outcome, the relationship between skill and difficulty of the activity influences the experience of those who participate in a game. Players in a game, for example, often have as little fun against beginners as they do, dominated by highly skilled players or skill. In our research, skill is a player's property, defined in terms of their average performance and difficulty of the activity. This discount influences the ideas of \"skillful\" behavior of other players than those who help win the game. The definition used here corresponds to existing metrics [1], [2] and allows dexterity to be explicitly measured. If a player's skills were known before they were played, their opponents could be selected in a way that would optimize their experience of the game."}, {"heading": "II. PREVIOUS WORK", "text": "We define dexterity as the average level of performance over a series of games. A value of dexterity has meaning only for a particular group and for a particular average technique. This definition does not take into account concept drift or learning and assumes that dexterity is averaged over a reasonable period of time. The definition of dexterity used here differs from the term dexterity defined by Parker and Fleishman [8]: \"dexterity refers to a more general, stable characteristic of the individual that can facilitate performance in a variety of tasks.... The term dexterity is more specific: it is task oriented.\" Performance is the value assigned to a person after completion of a particular task. This value or yardstick is defined by a metric in which different measurements can provide different performance measures for the same task, and the choice of the metric used affects the ranking of players within a certain period of time. The link between dexterity and performance was illustrated in Figure 1 and is considered to be similar to the link we always draw between dexterity and competence [although the prediction is drawn between skill and competence]."}, {"heading": "A. Performance and Skill Metrics", "text": "There are numerous ways to measure the performance of a task, and each video game has its own common metrics used by developers or its community. StarCraft and Counter-Strike, for example, use win-loss metrics to determine the winner, while the players of each game use actions per minute and killer-death ratio to compare themselves, which can and are often averaged to provide players with metrics. A common problem with these metrics is \"inflation,\" in which players change their gameplay to manipulate their performance (and hence their skills), contrary to the developers \"intent. Combining and adjusting different metrics is done to promote desired behavior [10].

Red Eclipse", "text": "The test bench for this experiment was an open-source first-person shooter, Red Eclipse2, which is a fully customizable, fast-paced action game that incorporates many common game mechanics from the FPS genre. A screenshot of the game is in Fig. 2. While Red Eclipse strives to emulate traditional game mechanics, it also offers a \"parkour\" system that is absent from most first-person shooters. It allows players greater freedom to move around in their environment, but adds a higher level of complexity. Many players tried to use this feature, but very few consistently used it. Data collected from the games was limited to logging the player's input and some information about the game. A time-stamped log file was created for each game, recording the game settings and recording a selection of events."}, {"heading": "B. The Log File", "text": "Although the structure of the log file was designed independently of each other, the inspiration was drawn from similar research conducted at the time [22]. Each log file has a set of metadata describing the game, and a list of variable-length events. The log files, originally text-based, were published as JSON objects for flexibility and legibility reasons. Each game contains information describing its settings; the list of metadata can be found in Table I. The number of customers is determined when connecting to an online game by Red Eclipse, but is always 0 in this record. Although the bot difficulties had a greater range, in this experiment they were limited to 40 and 100, as difficulties smaller than 40 were minimally different.Two types of events were extracted from the game: input events and game events. Input events were further divided into keystrokes, mouse expressions and key movements, each containing the mouse events and the final button events."}, {"heading": "C. Data Collection", "text": "This level of control gave both the consistency and the reliability of the data set. It allowed the experimenters to back up the data set, which was balanced by figs. Although the conditions of the participant and the player are interchangeable, they were then compared with a written tutorial and the context of the game. The overall format of the experiment was presented in fig. Each participant began with a demographic questionnaire, and they were then given as much time as necessary to read it."}, {"heading": "D. Questionnaires", "text": "Throughout the experiment, three different questionnaires were used: a demographic questionnaire, an experience-based questionnaire on the Likert scale [23], and an experience-based questionnaire based on 4 alternatives of forced choice (4-AFC) [24]. The demographic questionnaire was submitted to participants before they started. In this questionnaire, information such as age, gender, and, most importantly, two self-made skills were collected. The first measure of how many hours the participant plays per week is a common question in research [25], [26] and the second, the number of first-person shooters, was designed to take into account the effects of other genres and the overall gaming experience of the player, rather than gaming habits. These questions were designed to be objective and avoid self-assessment of which players are notoriously bad at [27]. The two experience-based questionnaires used the same questions in two different ways, to give the first impression, and to allow the second impression to be discussed."}, {"heading": "E. Data Distribution", "text": "The complete data set consists of 476 games from 45 participants. The number of games played varied from 4 to 22 and was shown in Fig. 4. As the skills of the players were the focus of this study, some efforts were focused on ensuring balance. This was confirmed by the number of FPSs played (f), which turned out to be a better indicator for the two self-reported measurements. Although there was a general imbalance of players according to this measurement, the distribution of the original population was unknown and the range of skills played was considered acceptable. The card and bot difficulties were independently and uniformly randomly selected and adjusted by the experimenter to ensure that the players did not have a distorted gaming experience. The distribution of the cards over the players is also shown in Fig. 4, while the cards and bot difficulties played for each qualification group are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6."}, {"heading": "IV. METHODS", "text": "In this section, we review the metrics and algorithms used in our experiments. In our analysis of skill metrics in Section V, we present the details of the TrueSkill algorithm and discuss some methods for evaluating similar skill metrics. Next, we present some techniques used to extract traits from the inputs of players used in Section VI. Finally, we present the Random Forest Algorithm used in Section VII to predict skills."}, {"heading": "A. The TrueSkill Algorithm", "text": "TrueSkill is a widely used measure of dexterity in commercial games that is primarily used in the course of the game and therefore serves as an important benchmark for other methods presented in this work. The algorithm assigns to players uniform values, \u00b5 and \u03c3, which represent the belief of the algorithm in the dexterity of the player. The first value, \u00b5, is the current estimate, and \u03c3 is the confidence in that estimate. Together, the two values represent a normal distribution of dexterity. When two players compete, the two normal distributions can be combined to indicate the probability of a draw (the previous one). After the game, the result (probability) can be used to update the belief of the model in both players. If a player, Alice (\u00b5a, \u03c3a), beats Bob (\u00b5b, \u03c3b), \u00b5a would increase, the probability of a draw (the previous one) would decrease, and both values of the pass would decrease according to the following formulas: the winner, the loser, the loser, the loser."}, {"heading": "B. Evaluating Skill Metrics", "text": "For classification problems, it is customary to evaluate the model based on its test accuracy (or error rate). There are other metrics and techniques that contribute to understanding the performance of the model. Within regression (predicting a continuous measure), the proportion of declared variance (R2) is a common evaluation criterion. These and others, including relative absolute error (RAE) [20], penalize offset results and those who suffer from scaling effects. However, the values we compare are scaling metrics; metrics that are ultimately used for player ranking. Therefore, we use Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (Spearmans B) to evaluate our models. This has the added advantage that the ranking of two different scaling metrics can be compared. Spearmans B is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient [32] between two ranked players. Therefore, we use Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (Spearmans B) to evaluate our models. This has the added advantage that the ranking of two different scaling metrics can be compared. Spearmans B is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient [32] between two ranked players. Therefore, we use Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (Spearmans B) to evaluate our models to evaluate our models. This has the additional advantage that Spearmans B is used to evaluate the ranking of two ranked players."}, {"heading": "C. Complexity of Hardware Input", "text": "A reasonable hypothesis is that skilled players use controls in a more complex way than beginners. We therefore use a number of techniques to measure this complexity - some to compress a sequence and others to analyze a time series. These techniques are used to extract characteristics, which are then compressed in Sections VI and VIII. The first two, Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) [34] and Huffman encoding, can all be used to compress data. Simple or better predictable data should be easier to compress so that it can be used to measure complexity. The first, LZW, has the advantage of being easy to implement. The algorithm is as follows: 1) Initiate a dictionary with individual strings. 2) Find the next longest string, W, in the dictionary. 3) Replace W with the dictionary index. 4) Add (+ next character W) to the dictionary."}, {"heading": "D. Prediction Using Random Forests", "text": "Previous research [21], [38] has successfully used SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization), an algorithm for support vector machines [39]. Random forests [40], however, have been selected for their ability to generalize well, even with a large number of features with unknown properties. A random forest also has the added advantage of being a \"gray box\" because it can be used with little knowledge of its internal mechanics, but can tell us which features were most important during training. Finally, for any classification or regression, a random forest model can be trained that can accommodate the different shapes and sizes of manufacturing metrics. Random forests are an ensemble method that trains multiple trees on different subsets of data. The MATLAB implementation used was an interface to R implementation by Andy Liaw et al. [41]. Two settings are used during the training of this model."}, {"heading": "V. ANALYSIS OF SKILL METRICS", "text": "To better understand how we rate skills, this section presents an analysis of a number of skills based on our data set. For reference, these skills and their notations are summarized in Table II. Although not a complete analysis, this section shows how skills metrics should be understood before any analysis or prediction of skills."}, {"heading": "A. Rank", "text": "In many games, rank (r) is used, with r = 1 being the winner, r = 2 indicating second place, and so on. r is used in the TrueSkill algorithm and is a descriptive value for victory and defeat in multi-player or team games. Rank is the value that defines performance for a single game. Therefore, it is a logical metric. Although large differences in the abilities of r are ignored, it is less easily influenced by the content (a win on one card has the same value as a win on another card). However, r is still defined by the number of players on one card, and the continuum of values is limited by it. This makes it more difficult to distinguish between two high-performance players. In our research, ability is measured over the entire task and should therefore be independent of content and difficulty."}, {"heading": "B. Score", "text": "The primary goal of a death match (the task in this experiment) is to earn points by killing other players, awarding additional points for \"skillful\" behavior such as helping other players. At the end of the game, each player's rank is calculated from the number of points they have: their score (s). Similar scoring systems are used in other first-person shooters. However, it is important to note that the score can only be used as a performance measure because rank is based on it. For another game mode or genre, a different score should be used: Team Fortress 2, for example, holds a score for each player; however, since these scores do not directly affect the outcome of the game, it is meaningless as a performance measure because rank is based on it."}, {"heading": "C. TrueSkill Estimate", "text": "TrueSkill is designed for multiplayer leagues where a TrueSkill model for a player interacts with other TrueSkill models for other opponents. Unfortunately, the participants in our experiment never played against each other, but against each other. To take this into account, a slight adjustment was made to the TrueSkill algorithm. For each game, the opponents (bots) were randomly selected from a predefined range, b. Since we did not know the exact difficulty of each bot, we assigned an \u00b5b and \u03c3b value to the entire range, b; in other words, each bot in range had the same \u00b5b and \u03c3b values. To calculate the final \u00b5b and \u03c3b values, the TrueSkill algorithm was executed via randomly selected games, updating both \u00b5b and \u03c3b with the average latecomers, as well as from all bots. These final \u00b5b and \u03c3b values were used to calculate the TrueSkill algorithm as normal to calculate the players \"TrueSkill values."}, {"heading": "D. Self-Reported Measures", "text": "In commercial games, players are often asked to select a difficulty setting. However, players are poor estimators of their own abilities [27]. This research therefore examines two objective criteria for reporting on player experience, hours played (h) and hours played (f). The number of hours a player plays games for may indicate gaming behavior. Fig. 15 shows how this value is compared with a performance measurement (s) and a skill measurement (s). In addition to the low correlation between groups (Table IV), there is significant overlap in skills between groups, and some players from h = 2-5 have higher scores than those in higher skill categories. In fact, the use of a landmark Mann-Whitney U test with a significance of \u03b1 = 0.025 is insufficient evidence that a group was statistically larger than its previous categories."}, {"heading": "E. Community Measures", "text": "s strengths and weaknesses, but are often specific to the game genre they are used for, such as actions per minute in StarCraft.Kill-to-Death Ratio (k), often abbreviated to KDR, and accuracy (a) are two performance measures that are specific to first-person shooters.The first, k, stands for the number of kills that the player has performed against the number of times he himself has been killed.The second, a, is the player's hit ratio; the number of punches he has hit opponents against the number of shots he has fielded.The third measure, the average number of deaths for a player (d), has been added to Table IV to compare the player's hit rate; the number of punches he has hit against the number of shots he has fired, the number of shots he has fired, the relationship between one or both."}, {"heading": "VI. PLAYER INPUT FEATURE ANALYSIS", "text": "Using the methods presented in Section IV and previous work [17], 174 global characteristics were extracted from the keyboard and mouse events of each game.3 These characteristics are grouped and analyzed in this section to better understand player input and their relationship to dexterity. Three different schemes were used to group the characteristics, which are summarized in Table V. By grouping these characteristics, we can begin to see how different types of player input are affected by dexterity. Although the groups of each scheme were designed to be mutually exclusive, some characteristics could not be categorized, so they are not grouped and were not used in the analysis."}, {"heading": "A. Hardware: Keyboard, Mouse Movement and Clicks", "text": "The first group of groups separates characteristics according to which the input device generates the events. As one of the first obstacles to playing a game, the use of the input devices is likely to contribute to the ability. Furthermore, different types of games may have different dependencies on each device. The characteristics extracted from the keyboard events related to the complexity of the input or the frequency with which they3The full list of characteristics and associated groups can be found on the website. Figure 18. Pearson correlation coefficient for each characteristic to the game score (s), grouped by characteristic group and ordered by correlation. Dotted lines indicate a correlation of \u00b1 0.6. Some of these characteristics were based specifically on the movement keys enabling the player to move. A number of mouse motion events have already been used in related HCI research [17], and these formed the basis for the mouse characteristics."}, {"heading": "B. Type: Event Frequency, Complexity and Kinetics", "text": "The second grouping scheme is a little less obvious, as the characteristics are grouped according to the type of input they describe, for example, some characteristics describe the kinetic movement of the mouse, while others describe how complex the input of a user was (according to the algorithms introduced in Section IV.) These groups allow us to see which types of player input are most relevant to the skill. Unfortunately, there were 49 ungrouped characteristics that did not fall into any of the three groups within this category. There were a number of complexity-based characteristics that correlated with the skill, especially those that described how complex a player's keyboard input was. For example, the LZW complexity of the four movement keys (forward, left, right and backward) correlates to a high degree with skill (r = 0.799). Experienced players had a higher LZW value, which implies that their skill is more complex than the LZW algorithm."}, {"heading": "C. Context: Free and Dependent", "text": "Ideally, the data collection could be done independently of each game. By dividing the characteristics into those that require some prior knowledge of the game (e.g. the user presses a button that moves the player forward) and those that do not (e.g. the user presses the \"w\" button), we begin to understand how independent the characteristics of the game are. This category had the most balanced grouping of each sentence. The group of addicts sits at the top, as shown in Fig. 19. This was to be expected as this group was allowed to know more about the game. On the other hand, characteristics extracted from the keyboard without knowing anything about the game still contained some information about dexterity. For example, the time two buttons were pressed simultaneously had a correlation to s of 0.780. After finding the strongest correlations for each of the groups, we identified 6 different types of correlations that are shown in Fig. 20."}, {"heading": "D. Player Learning", "text": "The cumulative average for each score group was shown in Fig. 21. In the first games of the Skilled and Expert groups, there was a significant increase in average performance, which is less visible in the other two groups. As only one person had previously played Red Eclipse, this is consistent with previous research showing that qualified players learned faster [44]. If we select a trait that was particularly strongly correlated with the score of the player (the average number of keys pressed simultaneously), we plot the cumulative average for this trait over consecutive games in Fig. 22, also grouped by score group. Unlike Fig. 21, there are significantly less value fluctuations over several games. This suggests that the trait values extracted from the input are more stable than performance indicators."}, {"heading": "VII. SKILL PREDICTION", "text": "This section describes how a player's abilities can be predicted based on their entry into a game. Experiments presented include predicting different skill classes, predicting continuous skill measurements, and finally trying to learn from smaller sections of gameplay. Each experiment used the random forests presented in Section IV and used 5-fold cross-validation."}, {"heading": "A. Predicting a Skill Category", "text": "For example, StarCraft groups players in leagues where players from the same league are generally comparable in ability. [21] The scoring groups introduced in Section V are therefore used to construct a classification model.The average accuracy of such a model is shown in Fig. 23. An average accuracy of 77.1% is achieved by training for keyboard features, which is significantly higher than the baseline of the majority class of 27.4%. The confusion matrix of this model is shown in Table VI and shows that many errors (77.1% of all misclassifications) are in adjacent classes, but the intermediate class was the most difficult to predict. For some applications, it is often enough to distinguish between two types of players: those who have never played and those who have not. For this binary classification, we divide the data into two groups: beginners and all others. As in Fig."}, {"heading": "B. Predicting Skill Measures", "text": "A regression model would make it possible to predict these continuous values for each player, but has not been studied as thoroughly in the literature. Predicted values are presented in this study with a hat (e.g. \"s\" is the prediction of \"s\"). We constructed several models to predict \"s\" based on different groups of characteristics, calculating the performance for each model based on \"s.\" The performances for these models are summarized in Figure 25. the basis for comparison for this experiment is to use the performance of the player, s (which can be collected after a game), as a substitute for the qualification measure, s \"s. s\" is successfully predicted with \"s\" = 87.4, significantly higher than s, \"which has a correlation of only\" s \"= 67.3. We visualized the average predicted values of the player (s\") and the player KDR (k \") for each game (s\" s \"and\" k \") in Figure 26. it seems particularly clear that the two models correlate in each case."}, {"heading": "C. Prediction Convergence Rate", "text": "However, to investigate how quickly a player's abilities could be predicted, the same characteristics were extracted from smaller segments of the game. In addition to the full 180 s already used, data were extracted from the first t of the game, selecting several t values between 1s and 120s. Dividing the players into two groups of roughly the same size, beginners and advanced players in one group, the experienced and experienced players in the other, we trained the model based on different segment sizes. The result is presented in Fig. 27 and compared with a model that was trained using score (s) as a feature. We performed the same test for a regression model and predicted s for each segment of the game. The performance of this test is compared with how well the current score correlates with s in Fig. 28."}, {"heading": "VIII. DISCUSSION", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own, without being held accountable."}, {"heading": "IX. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This research has provided a solid foundation for capturing skills in video games by providing some methods for understanding the metrics used. Specifically, we have shown that skills can be reliably predicted after 10 years of gameplay (see Figure 28). Applications for this research can be applied directly to dating and DDA systems, potentially improving player satisfaction in the short term. However, the models need to be further refined or adapted when applied to other areas or when using different input devices. The area of research we want to explore next is capturing skills in singleplayer games, using the same methods presented here and showing how they can be used to improve the DDA."}], "references": [{"title": "The Rating of Chessplayers", "author": ["A.

Yet, while difficulty and player learning have been explored in the context of games, there has been little work analyzing skill per se, and how it pertains to a player\u2019s input. To this end, we present a data set of 476 game logs from over 40 players of a first-person shooter game (Red Eclipse) as a basis of a case study. We then analyze different metrics of skill and show that some of these can be predicted using only a few seconds of keyboard and mouse input.
