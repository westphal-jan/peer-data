Intrinsically, the electrodes add some sounds to the recorded end data, and also some external sources, usually from the human body, add some other sounds. Dealing with this type of noise is one of the challenges in recording the correct ECG of a person's heartbeat. As a regular task, an ECG is used to record a person's heartbeat, but in some specific cases it is used to record the heartbeat of two people, mother and baby in their abdomen. In these cases, the ECG gives a mix of two heartbeats and the previously explained sounds. The important task will be to distinguish the two different heartbeats. To help this problem, multiple electrodes are connected to the mother's body."}, {"heading": "2 Our Approach", "text": "In Figure 1, we show three signals in the same diagram. After we have the blue signal, we want to extract the red signal, which means that we can consider the rest as noise, both the parent signal and real noise. Generally, a decryption filter works as Figure 2. The error that will be minimized in this type of filter is error = s + 0 \u2212 y [3]. Our approach is to use the least Mean Square algorithm in filtering to denoise the mixed signal and extract the child signal [4, 5]. Here, we explain how we implemented the LMS algorithm. We define L as a delay time. So, we look at the last L input data to measure the current noise signal. We have weights, W, assigned to all of these input data and made the output as weighted some of these L elements. We call it the total noise at the time. By subtracting this mixed signal, we subtract the child signal at the end."}, {"heading": "3 Experiment and Results", "text": "We tested our approach with a sequence of mixed signals with the length of 90,000. This sequence is used to store the data for 3 minutes, which gives us the frequency of 500Hz. We applied this sequence to our filtering function. We tested the results with the real child signal given by Professor Jaeger and available on the start page of the course. After the result and the real target signal, the equation for the calculation error is as follows, taking into account the last 75,000 points.diff = result \u2212 targetdiff = X1, X2,..., Xnerror = \u221a Xinvar (target) The first test was with only one filter provided in the sample code lr = 600. The error was 3.7117. The rest of the experiments was performed with three filters, but under different conditions. The first two filters were borrowed from the sample with this accuracy and the second filter is implemented to try to apply a changing learning rate to the other two signals, which means that we have 3.717 after one."}, {"heading": "4 An Unsuccessful Approach", "text": "The first idea I had at the beginning was to use spectral analysis to separate two different signals from each other, but after spending some time with it, I could not cope. The idea was to use discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) to separate two different signals. Since mother and child do not have the same clock rate, the frequency is different. DFT can transform signals from the time domain to the frequency domain. By means of this transformation, I could extract the different frequencies and select the child frequency, which is greater than the mother clock frequency. Then, I would select the lower frequency and perform the inverse Fourier transformation to return to the time domain. The other problem was the change of the frequency in time. Therefore, I decided to select the last two seconds only and display the results with two seconds delay. It is noteworthy that less than a second was not possible because the mother frequency was at a certain time less than a frequency in the time of this signal is mixed to the T, and the result of the application is shown in the T in the result that I was unable to resolve the signal."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this report, we explained two filters for denocializing an ECG signal to extract the child's heartbeat from the mother's heartbeat and other sounds. We showed the first and simplest approach with adaptive filters. We explained our results with different settings on the same input data. There was another approach that was not successful, but theoretically must work. It may be a future work to perform this filtering by spectral analysis, but the delay is considerable."}], "references": [{"title": "Adaptive Filters, Theory and Applications", "author": ["F.
