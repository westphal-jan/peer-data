From $D$ and for a specific domain $\\Delta$ we construct the information space $I$ of $X$ by interpreting variables, functions, and explicit relations over $D$ in $\\Delta$ and by including other relations that $D$ implies under the interpretation in $\\Delta$. Then from $I$ we build up the knowledge space $K$ of $X$ as the product of two spaces $K_T$ and $K_P$, where $K_T$ is obtained from $I$ by using the induction principle to generalize propositional relations to quantified relations, the deduction principle to generate new relations, and standard mechanisms to validate relations and $K_P$ is the space of specifications of methods with operational instructions which are valid in $K_T$. Through our construction of the three topological spaces the following key observation is made clear: the retrieval of information from the given data set for $\\Delta$ consists essentially in mining domain objects and relations, and the discovery of knowledge from the retrieved information consists essentially in applying the induction and deduction principles to generate propositions, synthesizing and modeling the information to generate specifications of methods with operational instructions, and validating the propositions and specifications. Based on this observation, efficient approaches may be designed to discover profound knowledge automatically from simple data, as demonstrated by the result of our study in the case of geometry.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Nov 2014 04:50:45 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1497v1", "14 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["xiaoyu chen", "dongming wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.1497"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.1497.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Xiaoyu Chen", "Dongming Wang"], "emails": ["franknewchen@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 141 1.14 97v1 [cs.AI] 6N ov2 014We examine the data space D of any data set X and explain how functions and relationships are defined via D.

Some characteristics and characteristics of the three spaces are presented and their correlations clarified. Further characteristics about the spaces of knowledge and their subspaces are investigated further. Our study leads to a general approach to the discovery of knowledge, which is implied in data.Data space D can be simple and small, while the knowledge space K, which was constructed from D for the given domain, can become very rich because the application of metaknowledge (mainly the principles of induction and deduction) and domain knowledge to information space I can produce many new and valuable objects of knowledge, which are connected to D under interpretation or can be induced or derived from it. Therefore, profound knowledge from D can be discovered by constructing knowledge objects from K according to specially designed domain-dependent procedures."}], "references": [{"title": "An introduction to scientific research", "author": ["B.
