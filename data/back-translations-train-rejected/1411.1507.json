Sub-trees in the search space of the branch and prune is unbalanced but can be independant: there is no confluence of multiple branches, and we have no shared information between branches. Distribution of the search space among workers is done in preprocess and postprocess as described in the following subsections. The pre-process distributes the parts of the search space to the other workers, and the post-process balances the burden of each worker during the search."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Results", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people are able to decide for themselves what they want and what they do not want.

We achieved accelerations up to 32.3 times using 40 cores of the common storage machine and up to 119 times using 256 cores of the cluster machine.However, the best acceleration of 119 times was achieved with the process. The process facilitated and accelerated the distribution of workload in the early stages of the search process. This was because the load balancing process was too infrequent for the specified number of workers and the workload diffusion became too slow when many cores were used (e.g., sp2-4 with ns = 1000 and the experiments on the cluster).This was because the load balancing process was too low for the specified number of workers and the labor force diffusion became too slow. When comparing the right graphs for the instance sp2-4, ns = 1000, in Figure 4, we can find that the point of saturation shifts to the size of the search engine."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a parallel branch and prune algorithm based on a non-portfolio approach to the division of search space.
