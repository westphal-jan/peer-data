The Arabic language is written from right to left like Persian, Hebrew, unlike many international languages and from top to bottom. It should be noted that the Arabic language includes Mandarin and dialects."}, {"heading": "1.2 The Semantic Web", "text": "To solve these problems, Tim BernersLee introduced the Semantic Web as a conceptual model of the Web, in which content can be read and used by humans and intelligently by machines [2]. He mentioned that \"the Semantic Web (SW) is not a separate Web, but an extension of the current one, in which information acquires a clearly defined meaning. Adding semantics to the Web involves allowing documents that have information in machine-readable forms, and creating links with relationship values.\" [3] Tim Berners-Lee introduced the fourth version of the Semantic Web Architecture with eight layers in 2006 [4]. The RDF and ontology are considered the most important layers of this structure. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is considered the key infrastructure for the construction of the Semantic Web because it enables sectarian interoperability.It is a standardized foundation for the exchange of web resources that will be used on a large scale in 2001 DF code when it is structured."}, {"heading": "1.3 The Lexical Ontologies", "text": "WordNet is a lexical database for the English language. It collects English words into groups of synonyms called synsets, gives short definitions and usage examples, and records a number of relationships between these synonyms. These relationships include: hypernym, hyponym, coordinate terms, meronym, holonym [7]. WordNet can be interpreted and used as lexical ontology. It has been used for a number of different purposes in information systems, including word sense disambiguation, information recovery, automatic text classification, automatic text aggregation, machine translation, and even automatic crossword generation [8]. The success of WordNet in the English language stimulated similar projects aimed at developing WordNets for other languages, making many WordNets an important resource for a wide range of natural language processing applications."}, {"heading": "2.

Ontology development was based on the ontological development approach UPON (Unified Process for ONtology) [13]. Ontology was limited to time nominations that occurred in the Holy Quran. Ontology consisted of 18 classes and comprised a total of 59 words. Hikmat Ullah Khan and others [14] suggested that the ontology concept could be applied to the development of semantic search in the Holy Quran. They presented a domain ontology based on living beings, including animals and birds mentioned in the Holy Quran. Authors in [15] examined the representation and classification of the Holy Quran knowledge using ontology. The ontology model for the Al-Quran was developed according to Al-Quran knowledge topics as described in Syammil Al-Quran Miracle Reference."}, {"heading": "2.2. Linguistic Ontology", "text": "The authors in [16] described the Semantic Quran Dataset as a multilingual RDF representation of the translations of the Quran. The dataset was created using two different semi-structured sources (The Tanzil Project, The Quranic Arabic Corpus Project), which focused on an ontology that represents multilingual data from sources with a hierarchical structure, and the resulting RDF data included 43 different languages that are among the most under-represented languages in linked data, including Arabic, Amharic and Amazigh. The authors presented the ontology developed for structuring the data, covering four basic classes: Chapter, Verses, Word and LexicalItem.

Research is conducting a pilot study on a number of randomly selected Arabic blogs in computer technology.

It groups Arabic words into groups of synonyms called synsets and records some relationships between words such as: synonym, antonym, hypernym, hyponym, meronym, holonym and association relationships.
