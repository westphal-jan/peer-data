Fire weather indices are a widely-adopted method for measuring fire danger and they play a significant role in issuing bushfire warnings and in anticipating demand for bushfire management resources. Existing systems that calculate fire weather indices are limited due to low spatial and temporal resolution. Localized wireless sensor networks, on the other hand, gather continuous sensor data measuring variables such as air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and wind speed at high resolutions. However, using wireless sensor networks to estimate fire weather indices is a challenge due to data quality issues, lack of standard data formats and lack of agreement on thresholds and methods for calculating fire weather indices. Within the scope of this paper, we propose a standardized approach to calculating Fire Weather Indices (a.k.a. fire danger ratings) and overcome a number of the challenges by applying Semantic Web Technologies to the processing of data streams from a wireless sensor network deployed in the Springbrook region of South East Queensland. This paper describes the underlying ontologies, the semantic reasoning and the Semantic Fire Weather Index (SFWI) system that we have developed to enable domain experts to specify and adapt rules for calculating Fire Weather Indices. We also describe the Web-based mapping interface that we have developed, that enables users to improve their understanding of how fire weather indices vary over time within a particular region.Finally, we discuss our evaluation results that indicate that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, precision and query performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 9 Nov 2014 02:37:52 GMT  (888kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2186v1", "20pages, 12 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "20pages, 12 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI", "authors": ["lianli gao", "michael bruenig", "jane hunter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.2186"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.2186.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["DATA STREAMS", "Lianli Gao", "Michael Bruenig", "Jane Hunter"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "DOI: 10.5121 / ijwest.2014.5401 1Forest fires are frequent, devastating events in Australia that regularly cause significant loss of life and widespread property damage.

It is located about 96 km south of Brisbane, Queensland, and is a site of exceptional natural beauty and ecological importance. The Springbrook WSN Project [6], run by CSIRO, the Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management, and the Australia Rainforest Conservation Society, employs more than 180 sensor nodes connected to several hundred solar-powered sensor devices in the Springbrook National Park region (limited by 28 \u00b0 14 '1512 \"- 28 \u00b0 13' 138\" S latitude and 153 \u00b0 15 '60 \"-153 \u00b0 16' 43\" E longitude) (see Figure 1).

Data preprocessing and storage: A data preprocessing step was applied to detect and eliminate outliers within the collected data streams; 2. Semantic conclusions: 241 fist-based logical rules were collected and converted to SPARQL conclusion rules using the defined FWI ontology and other OWL ontologies; and 2. A rule-based sequencing algorithm was applied to create fire weather indices and inverse distance weighting (IDW) -based prefabrication algorithms for the Earth-time system."}, {"heading": "4.

This multiple storage consists of an RDF graphene catalog repository and a series of RDF graphics subpositories. The catalog repository is used to store catalog information about the sub-repository repository (e.g. sub-repository repository ID, sub-repository diagrams, graphics maximum time, graphics minimum time, sub-repository data type, etc.) There are four sub-repository repositories: relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed, and relative wind speed to the wind speed of the repository."}, {"heading": "5. SEMANTIC INFERENCING", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Fire Weather Index Ontology", "text": "Next, we developed a Fire Weather Index (FWI) ontology to define Fire Weather Index classes and relative characteristics. Fire Weather Indices can be divided into five high categories: fwi: Low, fwi: Moderate, fwi: High, fwi: VeryHigh and fwi: Extreme. For the fwi: Low category, fires can be easily controlled and there is no risk to life or forest. For the fwi: Moderate category, fires can be easily controlled but still pose a threat. For the fwi: High category, fires can be controlled but pose a threat. For the fwi: VeryHigh category, fires can be difficult to control and pose a real threat, while for the fwi: Extreme category fires are likely to be uncontrollable and fast moving with flames that can be higher than roofs. In addition, these five high classes can be further subdivided: High: fwi: VeryHigh: (fwi: Min-Low, fwi: Mid-Extreme, fMax: Low-Low), Mid: (Mid:), Mid: (Mwi: me: Mid:), Mid: (Mid:: Mid:::)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Defining SPARQL Inference Rules", "text": "This year it is as far as it has ever been until the next round."}, {"heading": "5.3 Inference Algorithm", "text": "The Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index system uses the noon weather indices as input, so it produces the daily Fire weather indices only at noon local time, limiting its accuracy and usefulness in decision-making. Our approach (Figure 6) allows users to retrieve and query the Fire weather indices in real time and at 10-minute intervals. In addition, our system only executes the follow-up process when it receives a query from a user. If users enter their query time parameters into the system, the system scans the FWI repository where all historically inferred Fire weather indices are stored. If the FWI repository contains the requested Fire weather indices, it returns them. If not, the system retrieves the time domain information for the missing Fire weather indices and creates a temporary RDF repository as a data hub for estimating Fire weather indices to upload the SPARB next time system visits all the Sub and the Fire weather indices."}, {"heading": "5.4 IDW-Based Neighborhood Region Prediction", "text": "In Section 4.1, we have described the pre-processing step to remove outliers within sensor data streams. However, data loss often occurs in WSNs due to accidental linkage errors, hazard node malfunctions, measurement inaccuracies, calibration errors, and decreasing signal strength. [9,10] Another goal of this study is therefore to reduce inaccuracies in the inference results resulting from data loss. Therefore, we propose a neighborhood prediction approach based on assumptions that the fire-weather index of a particular location is largely influenced by the nearby sensor nodes and less by the more remote sensor nodes. This approach uses a commonly used technique - Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) [15] for interpolation between a known set of points. Let's allow the fire-weather index at the sensor node to be influenced less by the remote sensor nodes."}, {"heading": "6.

In addition, we apply Semantic Web Technologies (RDF, OWL ontologies, SPARQL and RDF Sesame Repository Stores) to enrich sensor data with domain-specific semantic metadata to discover implicit knowledge such as the fire weather index."}, {"heading": "6.2 User Interface", "text": "The user interface (shown in Figure 8) (accessible via a Firefox or Chrome web browser) allows the user to interactively search and retrieve the fire weather indices for a specific region and time span. For example, show me the fire weather indices between \"09 / 01 / 2012 12: 00: 00\" and \"13 / 02 / 2012 12: 00: 00.\" Search results are superimposed over the specified region using Google Earth layers (see Figure 8 (a)). Statistically analyze the fire weather indices to compare day and night results. Results are presented as pie charts (see Figure 8 (b). Google Earth animations dynamically show how the FWI values change over time. The pie charts on the right show the statistical information about the average, the time of day and the night fire weather indices. From the pie charts we can confirm that the FWI indices are typically lower than 2.5% during the day time (i.e. 2.5%, during the day time, we can confirm that during the 62.5% of the day time is probably lower than during the 615%)."}, {"heading": "7. EVALUATION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7.1 Evaluation of the Accuracy and Precision of Fire Weather Index Calculations", "text": "We evaluate the accuracy and accuracy of our approach by comparing our results with the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) and the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) Daily Fire Weather Index (based on the Canadian Fire Weather Index).First, we collected data from the Springbrook Project for 6 months (from 01 / 01 / 2012 00: 00: 00 to 01 / 07 / 2012 00: 00: 00), which consists of three weather parameters: air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. This assessment was to calculate the similarity between our System Fire Weather Indices and FFDI estimates for the same region. The similarity results for each month are shown in Figure 9. They show that our method and FFDI have produced similar results: indicator January 2012 similarity between 98%, February 2012 similarity to 99%, March 2012 similarity to the SFDI value of 96%, April 2012 similarity to 97%, May to W00."}, {"heading": "7.2 Evaluation of the RDF Triple Stores and SPARQL Query Performance", "text": "In addition, we have stored a copy of the triples in an RDF repository (1R), which is the typical approach and a copy of the triples in our Multiple Repository Storage (MR) approach. To perform this evaluation, we executed 8 new SPARQL queries over different periods of time (e.g. 1 hour, 6 hours, etc.) on the single RDF repository (1R) to derive fire weather indices. The corresponding execution time results are calculated and presented in Figure 11 called \"NQ-1R\" (New query - 1 repository). Secondly, we have executed these 8 SPARQL queries again on the single RDF repository."}, {"heading": "7.3 Evaluation of System Usability", "text": "Finally, the usability of the system was assessed through feedback from eight users via a questionnaire and by observing user behavior during the tests. Eight users were asked to answer the following questions on the questionnaire after completing a specific set of tasks using the system: Q1 - I found the user interface easy to use for searching / querying fire weather indices; Q2 - I found the Google Earth visualization and animations useful; Q3 - I found the timeline visualization useful; Q4 - I found the day, day and night time maps useful; Q5 - I could better understand the spatial and temporal patterns of fire weather indices after using the system. Users were asked to give an answer to each question from a five-point-click scale: 1 = strongly agree; 2 = agree; 3 = neither agree nor agree; 4 = disagree; 5 = disagree; 5 = strongly disagree with the visualization of fire."}, {"heading": "8. FUTURE WORK AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In summary, many microclimate WSNs collect observations and measurements of environmental physical parameters that provide ideal data for estimating bushfire risk. However, the quality of WSN data largely depends on the configuration of the sensor network. Therefore, we developed the Semantic Fire Weather Index (SFWI) system, which overcomes the limitations of the existing fire weather index by estimating the fire weather index from microscale WSN data streams. Specifically, we integrated semantic thinking with expert knowledge in the domain to estimate the fire weather index for a specific region and time. Data pre-processing and an IDW-based algorithm were developed to support and enhance the accuracy of the data underlying our system."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The work presented in this paper is supported by the China Scholarship Council.

devastating events in Australia that regularly cause significant loss of life and widespread property damage. Fire weather indices are a widely-adopted method for measuring fire danger and they play a significant role in issuing bushfire warnings and in anticipating demand for bushfire management resources. Existing systems that calculate fire weather indices are limited due to low spatial and temporal resolution. Localized wireless sensor networks, on the other hand, gather continuous sensor data measuring variables such as air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and wind speed at high resolutions. However, using wireless sensor networks to estimate fire weather indices is a challenge due to data quality issues, lack of standard data formats and lack of agreement on thresholds and methods for calculating fire weather indices. Within the scope of this paper, we propose a standardized approach to calculating Fire Weather Indices (a.k.a. fire danger ratings) and overcome a number of the challenges by applying Semantic Web Technologies to the processing of data streams from a wireless sensor network deployed in the Springbrook region of South East Queensland. This paper describes the underlying ontologies, the semantic reasoning and the Semantic Fire Weather Index (SFWI) system that we have developed to enable domain experts to specify and adapt rules for calculating Fire Weather Indices. We also describe the Web-based mapping interface that we have developed, that enables users to improve their understanding of how fire weather indices vary over time within a particular region. Finally, we discuss our evaluation results that indicate that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, precision and query performance.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
