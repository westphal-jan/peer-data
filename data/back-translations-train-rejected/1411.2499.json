We show that knowledge base dynamics has interesting connection with kernel change via hitting set and abduction. The approach extends and integrates standard techniques for efficient query answering and integrity checking. The generation of hitting set is carried out through a hyper tableaux calculus and magic set that is focused on the goal of minimality. Many different view update algorithms have been proposed in the literature to address this problem. The present paper provides a comparative study of view update algorithms in rational approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Nov 2014 16:43:24 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2499v1", "this http URLarXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1407.3512,arXiv:1301.5154"]], "COMMENTS": "this http URLarXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1407.3512,arXiv:1301.5154", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB cs.LO", "authors": ["radhakrishnan delhibabu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.2499"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.2499.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Radhakrishnan Delhibabu"], "emails": ["delhibabu@kbsg.rwth-aachen.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 141 1.24 99v1 [cs.AI] 10 Nov 2Keyword: AGM, Faith Revision, Knowledge Base Dynamics, Kernel Change, Abduction, Hyber Tableaux, Magic Set, View update, Update Propagation."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "It is only a matter of time before there is a new information base that may become inconsistent.

On the one hand, if an update is applied to the database, integrity constraints may become incompatible with the request, then stop the process. On the other hand, if an update request consists of updating some derived predicates, a view update mechanism must be applied to translate the update request into correct updates of the underlying base factors. Our work does not focus on the approach of maintaining integrity. In this section, we expand Mayol and Teniente's [83] survey for updating and integrity constraint. The most important aspects that need to be taken into account during the process of updating and integrity constraint of the view are the following: enforcement of the problem is addressed, the permitted update requirements, the technology applied, update changes, and the solutions received by each of these six dimensions."}, {"heading": "7 Related Works", "text": "It is indeed the case that we are able to set out in search of new paths to follow in order to achieve our objectives."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion and remarks", "text": "We argued for the generalization of belief dynamics theory in two ways: to treat certain parts of knowledge as immutable and to abandon the requirement that the belief must be deductively closed. We achieved the intended generalization by introducing the concept of knowledge base dynamics and generalized contraction for the same thing. Furthermore, we also investigated the relationship between knowledge base dynamics and abduction, which results in a generalized algorithm for revision. We also successfully demonstrated how knowledge base dynamics can provide an axiomatic characterization for updating an atom (literally) in order to update a stratifiable database. In bridging the gap between belief dynamics and viewpoint actualizations, we observed that a balance between computational efficiency and rationality must be achieved."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The author confirms the support of RWTH Aachen - no, where he attends school - yes, yes, but no, yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"}], "references": [{"title": "Automated selection of materialized views and indexes in SQL databases, Intl", "author": ["S Agrawal"], "venue": "Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB),", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2008}, {"title": "On the logic of theory change: Partial meet contraction and revision functions", "author": ["C.E.

autonomous system that should be able to incorporate new pieces of information. We show that knowledge base dynamics has interesting connection with kernel change via hitting set and abduction. The approach extends and integrates standard techniques for efficient query answering and integrity checking. The generation of hitting set is carried out through a hyper tableaux calculus and magic set that is focused on the goal of minimality. Many different view update algorithms have been proposed in the literature to address this problem. The present paper provides a comparative study of view update algorithms in rational approach.
