INTRODUCTION", "text": "The identification of speakers differs in two categories: text-dependent and text-independent. Essentially, we are more interested in researching the text-independent speaker identification / verification and participate in it because it does not require or require the utterances received from the speaker, which means that there are no words restrictions, it can all be in any order, so the first basic steps include the extraction of traits from the language sample in the registration process of a speaker, extracted traits are collected in the database as training data expressions. In order to achieve better accuracy, the feature vectors of the verification of utterances are updated each time while the training data set is prepared for new utterances with data previously stored in our database, in this way the model of each speaker is trained. Now, in the identification process, with the help of a probability model, a measurement of identification must be carried out, whereby the characteristic vectors of the verification of the speaker are made by a group of expressions with the characteristics of the data characteristics of the speaker and whether they need to be measured by a data dataset or not."}, {"heading": "2.

MODELING USING VECTOR QUANTIZATION AND IDENTIFICATION", "text": "Vector Quantification (VQ) is one of the simplest text-independent loudspeaker models. VQ is commonly used for computer-aided acceleration techniques and lightweight practical implementations. Vector quantization (VQ) is a well-known quantization capability from signal processing that allows the modelling of probability density functions by classifying prototype vectors. VQ is generally used by classifying a large (MFCC) feature vector set in small group vectors that have the same number of points as the denser value, i.e. means of the Training DatasetFor Identification code book average quantization distortions are used for the test characteristics vectors by X = {x1, x2.... xT} and the reference vectors by = {r1, r2.... rk}.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced a text-dependent speaker identification system, we have investigated that Gaussian mixing models (GMMs) have proven to be extremely successful in text-dependent speaker identification for long data sets of different loudspeakers. Gaussian mixing model identification performance is insensitive to the method of model initialization, but we have evaluated the parameter using expectation maximization and identification rate very sensitive to number of clusters and number of iterations of expectation maximization that we have performed in Matlab R2014a (The Language of Technical Computing), which is currently evaluated based on the expressions of a 75 speaker, and the results suggest that Gaussian mixing models provide robust representation for the difficult task of speaker identification using corrupt, unrestricted speech of cocktail party or YouTube datasets."}], "references": [{"title": "Likelihood normalization for speaker verification using a phoneme- and speaker-independent model", "author": ["T.Matsui", "S.
