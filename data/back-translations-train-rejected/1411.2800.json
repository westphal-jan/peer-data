It is worth noting that Alg. 1, in conjunction with Alg. 2 and 3, are meta algorithms that implement the SCC recursive scheme regardless of the chosen semantics. Although we have decided to consider preferred semantics in order to provide a direct comparison with more recent work [CGVZ14] - essentially equivalent to P1 - the same algorithms can work for any semantics that is SCC recursive [BGG05]. Furthermore, empirical analysis shows that there is a considerable statistically significant increase in performance due to the partial parallel execution of the proposed algorithms. This leads to: 1. an increase (approximately 50%) in the number of AF solutions we can select before we can semantically solve the semantic problem."}], "references": [{"title": "On Input/Output Argumentation Frameworks", "author": ["Pietro Baroni", "Guido Boella", "Federico Cerutti", "Massimiliano Giacomin", "Leendert van der Torre", "Serena Villata"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Computational Models of Arguments (COMMA", "citeRegEx": "Baroni et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baroni et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "On the input/output behavior of argumentation frameworks", "author": ["Pietro Baroni", "Guido Boella", "Federico Cerutti", "Massimiliano Giacomin", "Leendert van der Torre", "Serena Villata"], "venue": "Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "Baroni et al\\.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baroni et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Automata for Infinite Argumentation Structures", "author": ["Pietro Baroni", "Federico Cerutti", "Paul E.
