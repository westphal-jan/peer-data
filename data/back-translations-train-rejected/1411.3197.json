Failure rate analysis of components plays a key role in this problem. Data source used for failure rate analysis has traditionally been past failure data of components. However, failure rate analysis can be improved by means of fusion of additional information, such as symptoms observed during after-sale service of the product, geographical information (hilly or plains areas), and information from tele-diagnostic analytics. In this paper, we propose an approach, which learns dependency between part-failures and symptoms gleaned from such diverse sources of information, to predict expected number of failures with better accuracy. We also indicate how the optimum warranty period can be computed. We demonstrate, through empirical results, that our method can improve the warranty cost estimates significantly.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 08:23:55 GMT  (403kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3197v1", "Selected for publication in Poster Proceedings of \"Industrial Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2014)\"this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "Selected for publication in Poster Proceedings of \"Industrial Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2014)\"this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["karamjit singh", "puneet agarwal", "gautam shroff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.3197"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.3197.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Warranty Cost Estimation Using Bayesian Networks", "authors": ["Karamjit Singh", "Puneet Agarwal"], "emails": ["karamjit.singh@tcs.com", "puneet.a@tcs.com", "gautam.shroff@tcs.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction and Motivation", "text": "In fact, we will be able to get to grips with the problems of the past."}, {"heading": "1.1 Overview", "text": "To get an overview of our approach, we need to address the question of whether we will be able to find a solution that meets people's needs."}, {"heading": "2 Data Description", "text": "We consider data for the duration t1 to t2 for n products indexed from 1 to n, with each product having m parts.

In the next section, we will introduce our Bayesian network, which is used to learn the dependence between partial failure and DTCs. A Bayesian network is a representation of the common probability distribution. This representation consists of two components. The first component G is a directed acyclic graph whose vertices correspond to the random variables X1, X2,..., Xn. The second component describes a conditional distribution for each variable in relation to its parent G. Together, these two components give a unique distribution to X1, X2,..., Xn. Graph G encodes the assumption of independence by which the Xi variable is independent of its non-descendants, since its parents in G [1], [8].By applying the chain rule of probabilities and properties of conditional independence and the common probability distribution, which Marcov assumptions fulfill, the Xyesian network can not be classified as the Xyesian network (Xyesip) structure (Xyesip)."}, {"heading": "4 Modeling Dependence Using Bayesian Networks", "text": "As discussed in Section 1, the Bayesian network is used in Fig. 1 to explain the dependence between the part DTC and the part DTC.

Our goal is to learn the dependence between Dj, k and Pj, j, j and k = 1 to r.The Bayesian networks combine the Bayesian probability theory and the concept of conditional independence to represent dependencies between variables [20].

The scale and shape parameters \u03b2j and \u03b1j for the part Pj are used to determine the expected number of errors (explained in 5.1). We learn these parameters using the method of the MCMC [7] implemented by the Metropolis Hastings algorithm [10]."}, {"heading": "5 Failure Rate Analysis Using Bayesian Networks", "text": "In this section, we first introduce an approach to calculating the expected number of errors based on the scale and shape parameters of the Weibull distribution.

The expected number of errors for n cars (each car has m parts) in the time interval t3 to t4 is derived from the equation = n \u2211 i = 1 m \u00b2 j = 1 Fj (T) (17), where Fj (T) is the probability that the part will fail in the time interval t3 to t4."}, {"heading": "5.2 Expected Number of Failures Using Bayesian Networks", "text": "In this section, we will only use partial failure data to analyze the failure rate; in the second case, we will use partial failure data and service records; and in the third case, we will use partial failure data and sensor data to analyze failure rates; in the first case, we will only use partial failure data to analyze the failure rate; and in the second case, we will use partial failure data and service records to analyze failure rates."}, {"heading": "5.3 Warranty Cost Estimation", "text": "The warranty costs are the product of the cost of spare parts and the estimated loss during the warranty period. However, there are other costs incurred by the company in relation to customer dissatisfaction, which are referred to as penalty costs. These penalty costs relate to the parts that fail after the warranty period and decrease over time. Thus, the warranty costs Cj for the third part with the warranty period are given as wj below. Cj = RjF (wj) + Rjbe \u2212 cwj (1 \u2212 F (wj))) (20), with b, c > 0 R, F (wj) corresponding to a fraction of the parts that fail before wj and Rj being the replacement costs for the part Pj.

Simulation data for partial failure data, sensor data and service logs are as follows: Partial failure data: In order to generate partial failure data, we assume that the number of miles preceding the failure of a part of Pj follows the Weibull distribution with form and scale parameters \u03b1j or \u03b2j, where j-data {1, 2,..., 9}. Number of miles where Pj fails is generated using an inverse transformation method [11]."}, {"heading": "6.2 Observations and Results", "text": "In this section, we compare the results of three cases discussed in Section 5.2.

Also, in Step 2, instead of predicting the errors we make, we form the Fail \u2032 j sentence with the actual number of future errors as represented in the simulated data. Steps 3 and 4 are the same as in Case 3. Best Scenario assumes that our Bayesian network model can predict the actual number of miles for each error. In Figure 5, the first column lists the names of nine parts. In Actual Parameters column, we have shown the scale and shape parameters used to simulate partial failure data for each part. We compare these actual parameters with the parameters we learned from our model, using three different approaches in Case 2 and Section 6."}, {"heading": "7 Related Work", "text": "There are many studies that use statistical methods to integrate data sets from different sources, using the interaction and correlation between them to obtain more refined information. In [17], a common probability model is used to combine gene expression and upstream sequence data to find significant gene clusters. Similarly, in [18], we propose a model for merging data from multiple sources such as partial failure data, telediagnostic data, service records using an approach based on the Bayesian network that can learn conditional dependence on symptom data at partial failure rate, leading to an improvement in the predictability of warranty costs. We also support our claims with empirical results based on simulated data inspired by real data. Bayesian network has predicted many real-world applications [15]. In [8] Bayesian network, we will use better prediction of heart failure components [14]."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We have also described how our approach learns the dependencies of symptoms derived from different sources of information about the actual failure rate of parts. We have also shown that predicting future failures using these dependencies can contribute to a better estimation of warranty costs. We have tested our approach using simulated data for vehicles that have data on past partial failures and data from gas stations and telediagnosis. We have shown that our approach can capture the information provided by leading indicators and predict future failures with better accuracy. In addition, our estimation of partial failures from symptom data by comparing it to the best-case scenario is almost identical to actual partial failures. Therefore, we conclude that error rate analysis can be improved using service records and sensor data, using our predictive data as a basis. In the future, we plan to expand the proposed model by using more information than actual information such as geographic areas or seasonal variations to predict current costs."}], "references": [{"title": "An introduction to Bayesian networks", "author": ["Jensen", "Finn V"], "venue": "Vol. 210.
