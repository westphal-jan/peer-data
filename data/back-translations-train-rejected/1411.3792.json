SPIN seems to be able to comprehensively verify the termination accuracy and operability characteristics for twelve main agents, and bitstate verification for eighteen main agents. The latter verification required 25 minutes of a computer with an Intel Celeron (R) CPU running at 2.6 GHz and about 1 GB of RAM. Both characteristics are satisfactory in this model. Termination characteristics have not yet been verified. At this stage of our research, we are not dealing with competition or collaboration of instance agents to resolve ambiguities. We plan to enrich the agents with capabilities for this type of interactions, develop ambiguity-resolving algorithms and verify their characteristics such as correcting interactions, etc."}], "references": [{"title": "Multi-Agent Systems for Natural Language Processing", "author": ["V.L.S. de Lima A.M.B.R.
