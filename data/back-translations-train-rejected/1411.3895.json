The proposed learning algorithm, called Iterative QuantifiedFuzzy Rule Learning (IQFRL), is based on genetic programming. IQFRL is able to learn rules with differentstructures, and can manage linguistic variables with multiple granularities. The algorithm has been testedwith the implementation of the wall-following behavior both in several realistic simulated environmentswith different complexity and on a Pioneer 3-AT robot in two real environments. Results have beencompared with several well-known learning algorithms combined with different data preprocessingtechniques, showing that IQFRL exhibits a better and statistically significant performance. Moreover,three real world applications for which IQFRL plays a central role are also presented: path and objecttracking with static and moving obstacles avoidance.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Nov 2014 13:11:32 GMT  (2250kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3895v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["i rodr\\'iguez-fdez", "m mucientes", "a bugar\\'in"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.3895"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.3895.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning Fuzzy Controllers in Mobile Robotics with Embedded Preprocessing", "authors": ["I.

Introduction", "text": "The control architecture of robots usually includes a set of behaviors that are implemented as controllers, capable of solving specific tasks such as motion control, following a moving object, avoiding collisions, etc. in real time. These behaviors are used as controllers whose results at any time (control commands) depend on the internal states of the robot and its environment. When the robot operates in real environments, both the data obtained by these sensors and the internal states of the robot are used. Therefore, it is necessary to use mechanisms that properly manage them. Using fuzzy rules is convenient to deal with this uncertainty, as they combine the interpretation and expression of the rules of the robot with the representation of uncertainties."}, {"heading": "2.

Each rule base is encoded as follows: RBi = ri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 ri # Rgp, with: rij = 0, i f j > i1, i f \u2264 i (17), where rij indicates whether the j-th rule of RBgp is contained in RBi (rij = 1) or not (r i j = 0).

The algorithm has been extensively tested with the transformative behavior both in multiple simulated environments and on a Pioneer 3-AT robot in two real-world environments.

In the first stage, sensorial data are preprocessed or transformed into high level and meaningful values of variables which are usually defined from expert knowledge. In the second stage, a machine learning technique is applied to obtain a controller that maps these high level variables to the control commands that are actually sent to the robot. This paper describes an algorithm that is able to embed the preprocessing stage into the learning stage in order to get controllers directly starting from sensorial raw data with no expert knowledge involved. Due to the high dimensionality of the sensorial data, this approach uses Quantified Fuzzy Rules (QFRs), that are able to transform low-level input variables into high-level input variables, reducing the dimensionality through summarization. The proposed learning algorithm, called Iterative Quantified Fuzzy Rule Learning (IQFRL), is based on genetic programming. IQFRL is able to learn rules with different structures, and can manage linguistic variables with multiple granularities. The algorithm has been tested with the implementation of the wall-following behavior both in several realistic simulated environments with different complexity and on a Pioneer 3-AT robot in two real environments. Results have been compared with several well-known learning algorithms combined with different data preprocessing techniques, showing that IQFRL exhibits a better and statistically significant performance. Moreover, three real world applications for which IQFRL plays a central role are also presented: path and object tracking with static and moving obstacles avoidance.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
