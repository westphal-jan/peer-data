Android Architecture", "text": "Figure 1 shows the main components and layers in the Android architecture.The basic work and functionality of each component is described as follows: [2] Linux Kernel: Linux Kernel forms the bottom layer of the architecture. It provides basic system functionality such as process management, 2 | P a g www.ijarai.thesai.thesaigdevice management and memory management. The kernel also handles functions such as networking and a huge array of device drivers to which peripheral hardware is interlinked. Libraries: There are a number of libraries above the Linux kernel that contain WebKit - an open source web browser engine, libc, SQLite databases for sharing and storing application data that record and play audio, SSL libraries above the Linux kernel that contain WebKit."}, {"heading": "C. Apriori Algorithm", "text": "Apriori is a classic algorithm for learning association rules. This algorithm successively tries to create ever larger items that appear sufficiently in the database. It starts with simple association rules of input-output mapping and tries to build more complex rules from these simple rules by increasing the size of the input and output items when they occur sufficiently often in the training data. Each Apriori algorithm requires two parameters, first, the support threshold and second, a confidence threshold. The Apriori algorithm takes a bottom-up approach because it starts with individual items in the items and successively adds several items to the item sets when they meet the support threshold.This algorithm is one of the most popular association rules generation algorithms, but the only drawback of this algorithm is its bottom-up approach, which requires a lot of processing [4]."}, {"heading": "D. Max-Miner Algorithm", "text": "The Max Miner algorithm is used to generate association rules with a complexity that is linear to the number of patterns or rules in the training data. Complexity is independent of the maximum length of these rules. The algorithm uses a set enumeration tree. It arranges items heuristically and dynamically rearranges them on a pre-node basis, resulting in improved performance. Therefore, this algorithm is preferred [5]."}, {"heading": "E. Papers", "text": "In [6] it was explained how context-sensitive systems improve the interaction of humans with computers. Since context-sensitive computing is based not only on the explicit current input of a device, but also on the history of actions performed by the device and is able to change the output with changing situations, unnecessary interaction with the user is reduced. In [7] the functioning of \"SenSay\" was described. SenSay is a mobile phone that is able to manipulate its profile settings in accordance with the environment and the physiological state of the user. Various sensors placed on the body give input about the state of the user to a sensor box mounted on the waist. Based on the sensor information, a decision module calculates the actions to be taken from it. However, SenSay does not involve machine learning, but relies exclusively on a set of predefined rules to determine the output of the device."}, {"heading": "A. Functionalities Required", "text": "Broadly speaking, the proposed Machine Learning Module should provide two important functionalities that are described below: 1) In the first case, any third-party application should be able to use the module by providing the following information: a) Inputs and / or parameters that are critical to the application.b) Valid outputs / actions that understand the application.c) Training data in the form of rules such as: Inputs and / or Parameters = > Output / Action that are used to learn and automatically generate rules with their level of confidence.2) In the second case, the Machine Learning Module works independently on a global scale and tries to learn how and in what context the user uses the interface and the Android system. Depending on the learning algorithm, it should be able to automatically generate rules. Consider an example where the user frequently uses an application near a location (such as a rain station)."}, {"heading": "B. Modes of operation of ML module", "text": "In order to provide the above functionality, the proposed machine learning module has two functionalities: Application Level Learning: The module is used in this mode whenever other applications need to use the learning module for internal application purposes. This mode fulfils the first required functionality. System Level Learning: The module continuously monitors the system and checks whether the current context, i.e. the current inputs and / or parameters, matches an already learned rule. If a match is found, the required output / action takes place. If an event occurs due to the user's intervention, such as the call of an application, the module adds the current inputs and / or parameters and the action, i.e. the call of the application as an entry in the training data. In this way, the system learns new rules at runtime."}, {"heading": "C. Steps to be followed by the third party application in order to use the ML Module", "text": "In order to use the ML modules effectively, a third-party application must follow a series of steps to ensure the correct configuration of the module and explain the type of input and expected list of outputs to the module. As several applications should be able to use the ML module, a method is required that allows a unique identification of each application, so that the module can load the correct context and use the inputs of the application. The process is as follows: In this step, the third-party request to the Register _ App API module is required to register itself."}, {"heading": "D. System Level Learning: A special case of Application Level Learning", "text": "System-level learning is a special case of application-level learning where the entire system is an application and the requests are automatically generated by the listeners on the sensors (inputs / parameters) and events (outputs such as vibrator or speaker, calling an application). If there is an event such as calling an application by the user, the state of the sensors is used as input with some other parameters such as time, etc. Current inputs are constantly monitored. At any point where the inputs correspond to a rule, the output can be used according to the rule to automatically generate an event without user intervention."}, {"heading": "E. Architectures", "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before."}, {"heading": "F. Generation of Rules", "text": "Once the application (or the operating system in the case of system-level learning) creates a training data set for the ML module using either Load _ Training _ Data or Set _ Training _ Data _ Row, it can teach the machine to generate 6 | P a g e www.ijarai.thesai.orgmodules Association rules, which can be used to predict current usage performance according to the current input state. Depending on the size of the training data, this procedure can take a considerable amount of time. At this point, the module begins to analyze the training data for the respective application and attempts to generate association rules that exceed the support and confidence thresholds. The ML module generates these association rules by using algorithms such as Apriori, ID3 or Max-Miner, which are popular association rule generation algorithms. For this application, the Max-Miner algorithm would be preferable, as it uses fewer resources to create good association rules compared to Apriori algorithms."}, {"heading": "A. Music player application", "text": "The Machine Learning module stores all the information relevant to opening the music player and playing the song, including the time it is playing and the activity of the user at that time. Input for inserting the headphones into the device and opening the player at that particular time is provided to the module. It then trains itself according to that user's schedule and generates an application ID that indicates that the music player application is running. If the same task is performed by the user at the same time each day after the training period, the module automatically provides the user with a widget to open the player at that time, saving his time."}, {"heading": "B. Automatic Profile Settings", "text": "Automatic profile settings can be extremely beneficial for both students in schools and colleges and employees in businesses, as users are familiar with the predefined time of a daily lecture or meeting. Input of these lecture / meeting times, as well as the location of the school / office, is provided as input into the machine learning module. By combining the user's location and time of use on the mobile device, the module trains itself and displays a widget, depending on the application ID provided, which suggests that the user change the phone settings to silent mode, preventing unnecessary ringing of mobile phones in important meetings and lectures, making it hugely user-friendly."}, {"heading": "C. Task List", "text": "The user experience can be dramatically improved by displaying relevant information on the device's screen, rather than spending time searching for that information. Machine Learning Module takes over the task list entry and the time it takes the user to complete the task. In accordance with the user's usage pattern, it trains itself to display a widget of this to-do list that is needed at the time of implementation. For example, if the user buys groceries at the store every Friday at 19: 00, the phone automatically displays the list of foods that the user should buy each week at that time, saving time and making it easy for the user to use."}, {"heading": "D. Messaging", "text": "Usually, the user sends the same notification to his parents / spouses at the same time every day for a week. The ML module stores a draft of this message, and the time, day and message are provided as input to the ML module. Depending on the time the user leaves school / work, the module displays an output, i.e. the designed message on the user screen with the recipients entered. The user can then simply press the send option to send the message, saving him time, instead of typing the same message every day and then searching for the recipients."}, {"heading": "E. Location Based Profile Settings", "text": "If the user travels the same route every day, for example from home to work, or vice versa, the ML module keeps a record of their regularly traveled route, which is provided as an input. If there is heavy traffic along the way on a given day, it uses Google plus to inform the user to take a different route with less traffic, saving energy and time."}, {"heading": "F.

Also, the combination of machine learning and context aware computing can enable smartphones to gauge users\u2019 requirements proactively, depending upon their environment and context. Accordingly, necessary services can be provided to users. In this paper, we have explored the methods and applications of integrating machine learning and context aware computing on the Android platform, to provide higher utility to the users. To achieve this, we define a Machine Learning (ML) module which is incorporated in the basic Android architecture. Firstly, we have outlined two major functionalities that the ML module should provide. Then, we have presented three architectures, each of which incorporates the ML module at a different level in the Android architecture. The advantages and shortcomings of each of these architectures have been evaluated. Lastly, we have explained a few applications in which our proposed system can be incorporated such that their functionality is improved.
