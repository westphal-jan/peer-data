(ROSS stands for \"Representation\", \"Ontology\", \"Structure\", \"Star\" language). ROSS is a physical symbol-based representational scheme. ROSS provides a complex model for the declarative representation of physical structure and for the representation of processes and causality. From the metaphysical perspective, the ROSS view of external reality involves a 4D model, wherein discrete single-time-point unit-sized locations with states are the basis for all objects, processes and aspects that can be modeled. ROSS includes a language called \"Star\" for the specification of ontology classes. The ROSS method also includes a formal scheme called the \"instance model\". Instance models are used in the area of natural language meaning representation to represent situations. This document is an in-depth specification of the ROSS method.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Nov 2014 22:47:35 GMT  (1237kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4194v1", "128 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "128 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["glenn r hofford"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.4194"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.4194.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Glenn R.

Each class that can function as a parent must contain a construct called a dimensional system, a definition type that consists of several attribute types that collectively represent a fixed place in space and time. Attribute types of a dimension system are used to position or locate parts of a physical structural component within their parent. ROSS is a hybrid method that combines an analog approach with a physical symbol system approach. Using an analog representation scheme within a symbolic infrastructure allows representations that are more natural - they resemble human cognitive representations. Here's an overview of what the ROSS instance model is like:"}, {"heading": "Background:", "text": "This system consists of several subsystems containing a parser and a semantic machinery.The system has two main entrances: 1) Sample text story fragment from NL: \"The two boys snuck up to the house. They broke a window at the back of the house and climbed through the opening. Suddenly, they were startled by the flash of light.\" 2) The internal ontology / knowledge base, which includes summarized star language definitions (these definitions may include classes such as HouseClass, GroundClass, WindowClass, PersonClass and ChildClass, GroundClass, PersonCrawlsBehaviorClass, PersonClimbsBehaviorClass, WindowGetsBrokenBehaviorClass).The output of the system is as follows: 1) (Intermediate class) a list of parser-generated syntax trees (one for each input set) 2) an instance model - a setic / conceptual representation of the history of the events, etc."}, {"heading": "Explanation:", "text": "The structured instance model * is the hybrid analog / symbol system representation. It contains: (1) a master 4D reference frame that covers the entire action situation, consisting of symbolic representations of: a) an area of 3D space (e.g. the house and its immediate neighborhood) and b) a timeline that makes it a 4D instance. (The structural parent instance is analogous to a diorama (with the additional dimension of time). (2) The structural parent instance has a dimension system (i.e. a spatial coordinate system + time) - for this example a basic cartesian coordinate system plus a simple timeline (with enumerated time points)."}, {"heading": "Summary", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight."}, {"heading": "An example SingularNounForm is \u201cperson\u201d; an example InfinitiveVerbForm is \u201cwalk\u201d.", "text": "Other examples are shown here: (1) / / (Unlimited word list for a value within a value system called \"ColorValueSet\") \"ColorBlue\": Dictionary (English \"blue,\" \"turquoise\"); (2) / (for the PersonObjectFrameClass) Dictionary (English \"hit,\" \"person,\" \"people,\" \"people\");); (3) / (for the PersonHitsBehaviorClass) Dictionary (English \"hit,\" \"infinitive / base\") \", hits,\" \"people,\" \"people,\" \"people\"); (past participple \"),\" \"(simple present, 3rd p.s.\") \"hit,\" punch, \"punch,\" \"\" punched, \"\" punched, \"punched.\""}, {"heading": "A ROSS object frame instance, or \u201cobject instance\u201d is a concept that may be implemented as", "text": "This year, the time has come for an agreement to be reached, and it will only take a few days."}], "references": [{"title": "Online resource at http://www.softwareengineeringconcepts.com.
