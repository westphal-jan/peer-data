In this paper machine learning techniques are used for determining the polarity of forum posts on kajgana which are written in Macedonian language. The posts are classified as being positive, negative or neutral. We test different feature metrics and classifiers and provide detailed evaluation of their participation in improving the overall performance on a manually generated dataset. By achieving 92% accuracy, we show that the performance of systems for automated opinion mining is comparable to a human evaluator, thus making it a viable option for text data analysis.

PROBLEM DEFINITION", "text": "In our experiment, we accept the classification of opinions according to their polarity, i.e. polarity classification, which is used by the majority of authors [2], [10]. Pang and Lee [10] define polarity as the point on the rating scale corresponding to our positive or negative assessment of the importance of the opinion expressed. However, not all texts are capable of opinion, so the method proposed by [13] ar Xiv: 141 1,44 72v1 [cs.CL] 1 7N ov2 0142 is used to evaluate subjectivity and polarity separately. The problem is defined as follows: When deciding whether a text is subjective or objective, and then assuming that the overall opinion contained therein is a single topic or a topic, classify the opinion in subjective contributions as being under one of the two categories: positive or negative."}, {"heading": "III. PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "This method is described as follows: \"There are a multitude of terms that relate in a certain way to the real numbers that correspond to a single characteristic.\" These values are summarised using four different characteristics. \"There are a multitude of terms that relate to the individual terms.\" \"There are a multitude of terms that relate to the individual terms.\" \"There are a multitude of terms that relate to the individual terms.\" \"There are a multitude of terms that relate to the individual terms.\" \"There are a multitude of terms that relate to the individual terms.\" \"There are few terms.\" \"There are them.\" \"There are them.\" \"There are them.\" \"There are ways that relate to different terms.\" \"There are them.\" \"There are ways that relate to different terms.\""}, {"heading": "IV. DATASET", "text": "The domain used in this study are forum posts written in Macedonian language from the Kajgana forum. Forum posts tend to be less focused and organized than other text documents such as product reviews and consist predominantly of informal text. The posts about Kajgana are grouped into 47 disjunct topics, which are then divided into subtopics (over 50,000) and are on average 60 words long. There are a total of 4 million unique words in the posts. In our experiment, we ignored words that have less than 5 occurrences in order to reduce the total dictionary size and eliminate typos, leaving us with 800,000 unique words. A total of 800 posts were marked manually, 260 of which are positive, 260 negative and 280 objective posts. This data set is used for reviews of the various classifiers and feature representations. All reviews are carried out with 10-fold cross-validation to avoid overmatching."}, {"heading": "V. RESULTS", "text": "First, the characteristic representations mentioned above are evaluated with uniques in combination with the two proposed classifiers. Inverse frequency the best characteristic representation followed by presence (Table I). As for the classifiers, SVM performs better with each characteristic representation than NB. Surprisingly, the removal of stopwords decreases the accuracy (Table II). Specifically, when using an SVM classification, the accuracy drops from 0.94 to 0.74 when using an SVM classification from 0.76 to 0.63 counting 0.72 0.56 frequency 0.70 0.60 Ifrequency 0.74 0.62 and from 0.78 to 0.62 when using an NB classifier. One possible reason is that the word origin algorithms for the Macedonian language.As mentioned above, the proposed characteristic representations can be applied to n-grams of any size, although only unigrams have been used so far."}, {"heading": "VI. STATISTICS", "text": "Using the combination of Unigram Ifrequency for feature representation and SVM as a classifier, some interesting characteristics of forum posts in general can be shown. As mentioned above, forum posts are divided into several topics: pt is the number of positive posts and nt is the number of negative posts for each topic. The general mood on mt is defined as asmt = ptpt + nt (5). Interestingly, people are most positive when it comes to food (gourmet section) and fashion, but extremely negative about global affairs and the economy (fig. 1). Similarly, posts can be grouped and their mood calculated by month as shown in fig. 2. Public sentiment is highest in spring (May and April), probably due to the good weather in these two months."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "We show that this can be achieved with great accuracy by using simple metrics to extract text properties such as the presence of unigrams and standard classifiers such as Naive Bayes. Best accuracy is achieved by using a combination of unigram frequency and inverse document frequency for a feature measurement and supports vector machines as classifiers: 0.96 for subjectivity classification, 0.96 for polarity classification or an overall classification accuracy of 0.92. In addition, we tested various techniques to improve performance, of which word stem and stop word removal had a negative effect on classification accuracy. The use of bigrams does not help with the classification task, while the use of rule rams only slightly increases accuracy in polarity classification."}], "references": [{"title": "Sentiment classification via integrating multiple feature presentations", "author": ["Y.
