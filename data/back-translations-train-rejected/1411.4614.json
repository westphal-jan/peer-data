It is part of an ongoing project that aims to develop and promote new interfaces for accessing medical information systems, including a graphical representation language, VCM [1], where medical concepts are expressed through icons, and a multilingual user interface. Graphical language is used to provide complex information in a form adapted to synthetic visual perception. To be accepted and used more widely within different medical information systems, icons must be as easy to learn and use as possible. From this point of view, it is necessary to provide users with easily accessible natural expressions of meaning conveyed by each icon, e.g. in the form of a pop-up balloon that appears when the mouse cursor hovers over the icons. Icons express meanings that arise from the combination of a finite set of elementary meaning components."}, {"heading": "2 Background: context of use, input data", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want, and that they are able to determine for themselves what they want.

Graphic language is based on minimal expression segments, the so-called icons, the description of which is given above (section 2). These icons can be combined according to a limited visual syntax to compose more complex iconic expressions: on bidimensional surfaces structured in predefined fields, they form synthetic visualization grids that display information about the complete set of contraindications or side effects of a drug or the clinical condition of a patient. A future expansion of work on natural language generation will take into account that the visual syntax, in order to be able to translate complex graphic expressions into texts in the chosen natural target language, can translate more complex graphic expressions into texts."}], "references": [{"title": "An iconic language for the graphical representation of medical concepts", "author": ["Lamy", "J.-B.", "C.
