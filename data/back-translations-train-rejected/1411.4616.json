Throughout the essay, the following extension of the basic notation of [2] is used: \u2022 P, Q, R - input / control variables, \u2022 U, V, W - intermediate variables, \u2022 X, Y, Z - output variables; X is also used as any variable (without specifying its position precisely), \u2022 [U] - a variable that is not measurable, \u2022 X, X, \u2022 - a measured variable, \u2022 X, X \u043c - a variable that is observed for misconduct, \u2022 X +, X \u2212, X \u2212 - extended notions of wrongdoing, i.e. providing information that the value is too large or too small (reserved for future use).As usual, an arrow (\u2212 \u2192) signifies causality. Families of variables are designated with cheeky sources of error."}, {"heading": "3 Causal graph", "text": "The class of causal graphs under consideration is quite general. By a causal graph we mean a series of variables (which take either numerical or symbolic values) represented by the graph nodes, and a series of causal influences defined by appropriate equations and represented by the arcs of the causal graph. Therefore, it is assumed that each causal graph is a structure of the form G = (X, B), where X is the set of all variables, and \u0439 is the set of influences / equations that allow the calculation of certain non-input variables based on the input variables. It is assumed that the equations defined by \u0442 are calculable forward and backwards, i.e. that all input variables for an influence can be calculated the output, and that with the exception of an input variable and the value of the output variable, the individual undefined input variable can be calculated backwards, i.e., that all input variables for an influence can be calculated, and that the value of the output variable is analytical."}, {"heading": "4 Basic problem formulation", "text": "In fact, it is so that it is able to hide itself in order to save the world, and that it is able to save the world, to save the world, \"he said.\" It is the way it is, \"he said.\" It is the way it is, \"he said.\" It is the way it is, \"he said.\" But it is the way it is, \"he said.\" It is the way it is. \""}, {"heading": "5 Graph restriction", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to play by the rules we have set ourselves, \"he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper."}, {"heading": "6 Strategy for conflict calculation", "text": "In order to take into account the strategies of the conflict generation, one should first answer the questions regarding the preferences of the diagnoses to be generated and diagnostic sets that are considered as \"definitive solutions.\" (Remember that each diagnosis D is only a series of components, D = {c1, c2,.., cm} in such a way that their error diagnosis is sufficient to restore the consistency of the diagnostic theory with the observations. Diagnostic sets are presented as D = {D1, D2,.) in such a way that preferences among the diagnoses must be taken into account in order to allow the risk of our diagnostic methods to be based on incomplete conflicts, i.e. a case in which not all conflicts are calculated. Intuitively, the diagnoses that are calculated in such a case will be \"incomplete\" or \"partial.\" This observation is supported by the following prognosis."}, {"heading": "7 An approach to systematic conflict generation", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "8 An outline of algorithmic approach", "text": "In summary, an algorithm for systematic conflict generation can look like this: 1. Recognizing the set of misconduct variables X *, 2. Define the limited subgraph as the analysis object to be CLO (X *); any other choice (e.g. a heuristic) is possible, but completeness can be violated; 3. For each measured variable X-CLO (X *) detect all conflicts that can be calculated without using the values of unmeasured variables; the calculation of conflicts can be ordered in terms of the number of elements in conflict sets; this step refers to conflict generation zero order; 4. For each variable X-CLO (X *) detect all PCSYM sequentially; the order of generation ranges from m = 1 to the number of variables in the sub-diagram of interest. For each variable and m established order, the PCSYY is correspondingly increasing values of j, 5. Repeated PCSYY, i.e., the ones should be abandoned with respect to the previous investigation (S)."}, {"heading": "9 An Example", "text": "A simple test program to support the direct determination of potential conflict structures has been implemented in PROLOG. The program is a meta-interpreter that uses several simple recursive rules. It calculates the potential conflict structures for a particular uncontrolled variable. An example subgraph of measured variables is shown in Fig. 6; potential conflicts calculated with the use of the program are also listed. In the calculation of conflicts, the following rules can be useful to avoid repeated calculations and improve overall efficiency, which seems to be a very important rule for achieving reasonable efficiency. Candidate variables for the heads of PCS should be preselected."}, {"heading": "10 Closing remarks", "text": "From the above considerations, one can expect that the final efficiency of conflict (not diagnostic!) generation necessarily depends on a variety of factors. Furthermore, efficient conflicts, i.e. those that lead to a small number of well-localized diagnoses, can only be achieved if the variables that are not measured are relatively sparse. If there are only a few measurements, it cannot be expected that the isolation of faulty components will be effective. In relation to this problem, the reverse propagation seems to be a crucial problem - roughly speaking, it could play a similar role to the introduction of measurements and thus help to limit the size of conflicts. Another aspect that is worth investigating is the problem of faulty behavior of components and their influence on the observed behavior of variables; a priori knowledge of possible faults of components can be used to model the faulty behavior and thus select certain possible faults when the modeled behavior is not observed."}], "references": [{"title": "Causal reasoning under uncertainty with Q/C-E networks: a case study on preventive diagnosis of power transformers", "author": ["P.
