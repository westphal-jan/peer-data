A new approach to the problem was raised which intends to match the different modal features directly. Thus, how to get rid of the heterogeneity between the different modalities and match the different modal features with different dimensions become the key points in this research. On the other hand, the metric learning shows great power to learn a distance metric to explore the relationship between data points. However, the traditional metric learning algorithms are only focusing on one modality features, which suffers difficulties to handle the heterogeneous features with different dimensions. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a heterogeneous similarity learning algorithm based on the metric learning for the cross-modal feature matching. With the nuclear penalization, an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is successfully imported to find the optimal solution with the fast convergence rate of O(1/t^2). We applied it to the image-text cross-media retrieval problem, and compared it with several popular and the state-of-the-art algorithms. Experiments on two well known databases show that the proposed method achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Nov 2014 05:53:06 GMT  (67kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4738v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 17 Dec 2015 01:25:27 GMT  (2437kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4738v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MM cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["cuicui kang", "shengcai liao", "yonghao he", "jian wang", "wenjia niu", "shiming xiang", "chunhong pan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.4738"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.4738.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Cross-Modal Similarity Learning : A Low Rank Bilinear Formulation", "authors": ["Cuicui Kang", "Shengcai Liao", "Yonghao He", "Jian Wang", "Wenjia Niu", "Shiming Xiang"], "emails": ["kangcuicui@iie.ac.cn", "scliao@nlpr.ia.ac.cn", "yhhe@nlpr.ia.ac.cn", "jian.wang@nlpr.ia.ac.cn", "niuwenjia@iie.ac.cn", "smxiang@nlpr.ia.ac.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords Multimedia Retrieval; Cross-Modality; Similarity Learning; Nuclear Norm; Accelerated Proximal Gradient."}, {"heading": "1.

[39] to learn a distance metric according to the similar points and different points. Suppose there is a set of m data points {xi-Rd} mi = 1, with each data point having a d-dimensional characteristic. In addition, we also get the binary similarity information, which indicates whether two data points are similar or not. Specifically, there are two sets of paired points, which can be described as follows: {S = (xi, xj) | xi and xj are in the same class}, D = {(xi, xj) | xi and xj are not in the same class}, (1) where S is designated as a must-link set containing the similar pairs and D is designated as the non-link set containing the dissimilar pairs.In view of the two sentences, the task of metric learning is to find a metric in the form of the following: j = xi \u2212 j (j) that \u2212 j = xi-j can be found."}, {"heading": "3.2 Problem Definition and Formulation", "text": "Suppose there is a multimedia databaseA = {x1, lx1), (x2, l x 2),.., (xm, l x m), (z1, l z 1),.., (zn, l z n)}, constructed from two modality data sets X and Z.

The lxi and l z j j are the class names of the samples xi and zj respectively. The connection between the two modalities is that they divide c classes, for example, dogs, shoes and buildings.

The Pascal VOC2007 database consists of 9963 images from 20 categories [12], which was divided into a training program with 5011 images and a test set with 4952 images. Since some of the images are provided with multi-dimensional labels, the images containing only one object were selected in the experiments [32]. As a result, there are 2808 images for the training program and 2841 images for the test set. For the functions that include the 399-dimensional word rate function, text was used, and the Convolutionary Neural Network (CNN), which was trained on the ImageNet [21], was used as an image feature."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we proposed a novel learning method of the similarity function, inspired by metric learning algorithms, which is learned in bilinear form from two different modality characteristics that can handle intermodal characteristics with different dimensions. In order to find the optimal solution with a fast convergence rate, the method of accelerated proximal gradient was successfully imported. Furthermore, we imported the nuclear standard to study the structures and connections of the two modalities. Experiments are evaluated on three famous multimedia databases for the intermodal image-text retrieval problem, which shows that the proposed algorithm performs best compared to modern algorithms."}, {"heading": "6.

attention in recent years due to the rapid increasing of multimedia data on the Internet. A new approach to the problem has been raised which intends to match features of different modalities directly. In this research, there are two critical issues: how to get rid of the heterogeneity between different modalities and how to match the cross-modal features of different dimensions. Recently metric learning methods show a good capability in learning a distance metric to explore the relationship between data points. However, the traditional metric learning algorithms only focus on single-modal features, which suffer difficulties in addressing the cross-modal features of different dimensions. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal similarity learning algorithm for the crossmodal feature matching. The proposed method takes a bilinear formulation, and with the nuclear-norm penalization, it achieves low-rank representation. Accordingly, the accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is successfully imported to find the optimal solution with a fast convergence rate O(1/t). Experiments on three well known image-text crossmedia retrieval databases show that the proposed method achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-theart algorithms.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
