Different types of deontic logic are being discussed for various fields of application such as argumentation theory, legal thinking, and actions in multi-agent systems [11]. Recently, interest in modelling human thinking and testing models with psychological insights has also been growing. Deontic logic is an obvious tool for this purpose, because norms and licenses in human societies can easily be described with it, e.g. the Wason selection task or Byrne's suppression task. In this paper, one focuses on automated thinking in deontic logic (SDL), focusing on the use of deontic logic to model certain effects that occur in human thinking, e.g. the Wason selection task or Byrne's suppression task."}, {"heading": "2 Deontic Logic as Modal Logic KD", "text": "We consider a simple modal logic consisting of the meaningful logic and the additional modal operators, as well as the additional modal operators and \u2666. Semantics is given as possible semantics, with the modal operators and \u2666 being interpreted as quantifiers of possible worlds. One such possible world is an assignment that assigns truth values to the meaningful variables. An interpretation connects different possible worlds through a (binary) accessibility ratio R. The operator states that a formula has to be kept in all achievable worlds. Thus, if v and w are worlds, we have | = P iff: v: R (w, v) \u2192 PStandard deontic logic (SDL) holds a formula derived from the known modal logic K by adding the serial axiom D: D: D: P: In this logic, the -operator is interpreted as a formal world, as \""}, {"heading": "3 Automated Reasoning for Deontic Logic", "text": "It is.

Therefore, it is not easy to determine whether a given normative system is consistent; the tester of the hypertheorem can be used to check the consistency of a normative system N. We first translate N into an ALC knowledge base \u03a6 (N), then we translate \u03a6 (N) into the defined \u03c9 (N) of DLclauses; then we can check the consistency of \u03c9 (N) by means of hyper.- Assessment of normative systems: In the face of several normative systems, we use Hyper to find out for which normative system a desired result is guaranteed. - Independence check: In the face of a normative system N and a formula F that represents a norm, we can check whether F is independent of N. If F is independent of N, F is not a logical consequence of N."}, {"heading": "4 Applications", "text": "The literature on deontic logic deals with numerous small but nevertheless interesting examples.

As an example, let us examine the well-known problem of the conflicting obligations introduced in [8]: (1) one should not steal. (2) a stolen formula. (3) If someone steals, he should be punished for theft. (4) If someone does not steal, he should not be punished for theft. (4) Table 1 shows three different formalizations of this problem. These formalizations are known from the literature [5,14,13,21]: Consistency testing of normative systems The opposite formalization of normative systems is a very small example above. In practice, normative systems can be quite complex. This makes it difficult to see whether a normative system is consistent. We will show how we use the hypertheorem prover to verify the consistency of a given normative system.As an example, let us consider the formalization N1 given in Table 1, which is inconsistent."}, {"heading": "4.2 An Example from Multi-agent Systems", "text": "It is a question of the extent to which this is a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" conspiracy, \"a\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" conspiracy, \"a\" a \"a\" conspiracy, \"a\" a \"a\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" a \"a\" conspiracy, \"a\" a \"a\" conspiracy, \"a\" a \"a\" conspiracy, \"a\" a \"a\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" a \"a\" conspiracy, \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" a \"a\" conspiracy, \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" conspiracy, \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"conspiracy,\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" conspiracy, \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" conspiracy, \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"conspiracy, a\" a \"a\""}, {"heading": "4.3 Experiments", "text": "We formalized the examples presented in this section and tested them with the hyper-theorem tester described above, since all formalizations are available in ALC.11 In the first column, we see the time in seconds that the two founders needed to represent the dissatisfaction with the formalization of the example of multi-agent systems.11 For hyper, we give two different numbers, the first number being the time that Hyper needs to represent the dissatisfaction with the set of DL clauses. In addition, the second number contains the time it takes to convert the ALC knowledge base into DL clauses; the second column indicates the runtimes for the example of multi-agent systems, using the formalization with a TBox; and in the last column, we present the runtimes for the consistency test of the normative system N1 based on the example in contradiction with the duties; the second column indicates the runtimes for the example of multi-agent systems used in the example box with a multi-agent form."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have shown that complex normative systems can be formalized easily using deontic logic, and these formalizations can be effectively verified for consistency and independence from additional formulas. Normative systems described using deontic logic have a one-to-one translation into formulas of descriptive logic. These formulas can be automatically verified by automated theory testers, which in our case is hyper.We are aware that deontic logic has several limitations, which is why future work will focus on the use of newer formalisms.For example, we want to apply deontic logic in the context of systems for answering natural questions, where normative knowledge often leads to inconsistencies in large databases, which motivates us to consider combinations of deontic logic with defect-free logic. 12"}], "references": [{"title": "Ked: A deontic theorem prover", "author": ["A.
