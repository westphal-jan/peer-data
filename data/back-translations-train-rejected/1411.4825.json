Many people spend a lot of time with computers that play games, watch movies, but of course also solve problems during their professional activity. This becomes all the more important as more data and information has to be taken into account. In fact, this amount is increasing every day. Big data and open data are keywords that refer to areas of computer science in which exactly these aspects are tackled. This paper briefly describes the term cognitive computing and shows that answering natural language questions is an example of this new computer paradigm. In the next section, cognitive computing is discussed, followed by a brief overview of answering natural language questions, then the LogAnswer system is described, and finally we conclude with current enhancements and future work."}, {"heading": "Cognitive Computing", "text": "In terms of the development of intelligent machines, IBM has twice succeeded in setting a milestone: in 1997, the chess computer Deep Blue succeeded in beating the world champion Garry Kasparov. After this match, there was a discussion about whether the IBM team cheated during the tournament. Kasparov demanded revenge, which was refuted, and, even more, Deep Blue was dismantled. In 2011, the IBM computer system Watson beat two former winners in the quiz show Jeopardy. In Jeopardy, players must understand natural language questions from different areas and give quick answers. This type of question answering and reasoning is called deep answer to questions. The Watson system used many different sources of knowledge. Watson had no connection to the Internet, Watson had access to databases, dictionaries, encyclopedias, ontologies, but also literary ontologies and newspaper articles."}, {"heading": "Natural Language Question-Answering", "text": "Until the 1980s, most systems that process natural language were based on explicit, hand-encoded rules that analyzed the syntactical structure of sentences or dependence on semantic components, where utterances were understood to have a syntax characterized by formal grammar, especially context-free grammar. Later, syntactic rules were reinforced by descriptions of syntactical components, such as grammars or semantic networks [5]. These representations can also be expressed through logical formulas that lead to so-called phrase-structure grammars."}, {"heading": "The LogAnswer System", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "As a prototype example, the LogAnswer system is described in detail and its properties are checked against criteria for cognitive computer systems. Currently, the LogAnswer system is being expanded in the follow-up project RatioLog, which aims at the inclusion of rational and human-like argumentation components. [4] demonstrates the use of deontic logic to model human thought and its automation with the LogAnswer logical machinery. [11] Another extension concerns defective reasoning [11], which is helpful in determining the best answer from the possibly contradictory candidates. [7] This paper was written as part of the project RatioLog - Rational Extensions to Logical Locking, promoted by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under the designations FU 263 / 15-1 and STO 421 / 5-1."}], "references": [{"title": "Hyper tableaux.
