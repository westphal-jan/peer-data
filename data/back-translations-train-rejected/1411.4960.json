The motif can be described as a significantly overrepresented subgraph in the network. Likewise, an underrepresented subgraph in the network is called a random number. In [10], authors define network motifs as small patterns for which the probability of occurrence in a random network is less than the probability of occurrence in the real network with the truncated value equal 01.In Fig. 2. are all 13 possible three vertex connected directed subgraphs (triads). The triad ID notation in this paper isprites the same notation as in Fig. 2 and it is the notation after [11]. In Fig. 3. are all 199 possible four vertex connected directed subgraphs H. Now we give the mathematical description of the motif in the graph or network G. There are two graphs (networks) and G with non-empty sets of real subgraphs."}, {"heading": "3 Experiment", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Datasets and networks construction", "text": "In our study, we examined five literary works. Our data set contains five different texts; four books: Mama Leone (ML), The Return of Philip Latinowicz (PL), The Picture of Dorian Gray, (DG), Bones, (BO) and a forum Narodne novine (NN). All books were written in Croatian or translated into Croatian. The web forum was chosen as a representative of another text genre to check whether the observed characteristics apply to more relaxed genres in addition to the purely literary ones. The data sets differ in both the size and the size of the vocabulary (Table 1). The texts were freed from the table of contents, biographies and page numbers of the authors. Afterwards, we constructed directed coexistence networks (word adjacency networks) in such a way that each word represents a vertex, and the two words that follow each other form the edge."}, {"heading": "3.2 Network motifs analysis", "text": "To analyze the motifs in the networks, we have used the FANMOD tool [16]. FANMOD can search for motifs from three to eight vertices using the rand-esu algorithm, which is much faster than similar tools, and the advantage is that it has a simple graphical interface and is very intuitive to use. The first step is to prepare the input data: converting words into integers, with each number representing a vertice universal in the network, so two integers in a line must form an edge. Each line must contain at least two integers and a maximum of up to five integers. FANMOD offers the possibility to choose whether the networks are directed, disordered or colored vertices."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "The frequency of all possible triads for five networks is shown in Fig. 4. Generally, the three-class frequencies behave similarly for all five networks. Therefore, the Croatian language is comparable to other languages [3], [11]. Furthermore, it is possible to identify differences between the data sources on ID3 # 1 and ID3 # 5 on the linear scale and ID3 # 9, ID3 # 11 and ID3 # 13 on the logarithmic scale.In addition, we analyze TSP to determine which triads are significantly over-represented (motives) and which triads are significantly under-represented (anti-motives) and to compare them across the five different datasets. The results are shown in the diagram in Fig. 5.There are several significantly over-represented triads (ID3 # 1, ID3 # 3 # 3, ID3 # 13)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we present the results of the analysis of the network motifs of Croatian literature. Motifs are used to determine structural similarities between the directed networks of four books and a forum. We analyze the meaning profile of triads in five different texts, which are presented as directed coexistence networks.The results show that Croatian language networks have similar meaning profiles of triads with other languages already analyzed. Generally, in all language networks, triads with two edges are over-represented, while triads with three edges.For the Croatian language, there is an exception to the triangular triads ID3 # 10 and ID3 # 13, which are over-represented. The over-representation of triangular triads is characterized by the character of the free word order of the Croatian language.It seems that a motif-based analysis of language networks is sensitive to word order and syntax rules. And perhaps it is possible to use them for the fine-grained differentiation of languages."}, {"heading": "6 References", "text": "[1] Ban, K, Martin\u010di\u0107-Ip\u0161i\u0107 S., Me\u0161trovi\u0107, A.
