To make progress on the problem of consciousness, we will need to experimentally design a system that evolves in a similar way our brains do. Recent experimental data show that the multiscale nature of the evolving human brain can be implemented by reprogramming human cells. A hybrid system can be designed to include an evolving brain equipped with digital computers that maintain homeostasis and provide the right amount of nutrients and oxygen for the brain growth. Shaping the structure of the evolving brain will be progressively achieved by controlling spatial organization of various types of cells. Following a specific program, the evolving brain can be trained using substitutional reality to learn and experience live scenes. We already know from neuroelectrodynamics that meaningful information in the brain is electrically (wirelessly) read out and written fast in neurons and synapses at the molecular (protein) level during the generation of action potentials and synaptic activities. Since with training, meaningful information accumulates and is electrically integrated in the brain, one can predict, that this gradual process of training will trigger a tipping point for conscious experience to emerge in the hybrid system.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Nov 2014 23:12:25 GMT  (271kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5224v1", "15 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.ET cs.AI", "authors": ["dorian aur"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.5224"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.5224.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Dorian Aur"], "emails": ["DorianAur@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In order to make progress on the problem of consciousness, we must experimentally design a system that develops in a similar way to our brain.

However, a hybrid system can be designed to include an evolved brain equipped with digital computers that maintain a substitutional reality and provide the right amount of nutrients and oxygen for brain growth. We already know from neuroelectrodynamics that important information in the brain is read electronically (wirelessly) and quickly written into neurons and synapses."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "This effort will be comparable to the lunar landing project or the discovery of the Higgs particle. Having incorporated evolutionary relationships, the platform can achieve far more than competing projects (e.g. Blue Brain, Human Brain Project).Since almost anything can be manipulated at will from a nanoscale level, the project will offer a clear alternative to understanding how the brain functions from a molecular level. Different types of nanosensors will be able to monitor, record and then simulate any changes in the developing brain well, using digital computers.Such a project will reduce the technological barrier to understanding the evolution of the human brain, neurological processes, various neurological diseases, and will provide a reliable platform for the treatment of severe neurological disorders, drug testing, gene therapy, and nanoexperiments.In addition, it will reduce the excessive costs and inefficiency associated with animal experimentation, generate less dependence on animal models, reduce the natural forms of communication, and help to expand the natural forms of robotics."}, {"heading": "Supplementary Material: Selected Questions and Answers", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "Selected References:", "text": "The Brain Activity Project and the Challenge of Functional Connectomics.
