In this study, we report a sparse feature processing and encoding method, which improved the recognition performance of an automated object recognition system. Randomly distributed localized gradient enhanced features were selected before employing aggregate functions for representation, where we used a modular and hierarchical approach to detect the object features. These object features were combined with a minimum distance classifier, thereby obtaining object recognition system accuracies of 93% using the Amsterdam library of object images (ALOI) database, 92% using the Columbia object image library (COIL)-100 database, and 69% using the PASCAL visual object challenge 2007 database. The object recognition performance was shown to be robust to variations in noise, object scaling, and object shifts. Finally, a comparison with eight existing object recognition methods indicated that our new method improved the recognition accuracy by 10% with ALOI, 8% with the COIL-100 database, and 10% with the PASCAL visual object challenge 2007 database.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Nov 2014 15:57:02 GMT  (600kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5268v1", "Pages 13"]], "COMMENTS": "Pages 13", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["swathikiran sudhakarana", "alex pappachen james"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.5268"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.5268.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Sparse distributed localised gradient fused features of objects", "authors": ["Swathikiran Sudhakaran", "Alex Pappachen James"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want."}], "references": [{"title": "Fast image recovery using variable splitting and constrained optimization", "author": ["M.V.

signals are characteristics that relate to the ability of humans to recognise objects with high accuracy. In this paper, we report a sparse feature processing and encoding method targeted at improving the recognition performance of automated object recognition system. Randomly distributed selection of localised gradient enhanced features followed by the application of aggregate functions represents a modular and hierarchical approach to detect the object features. These object features, in combination with minimum distance classifier, results in object recognition system accuracies of 93% using ALOI, 92% using COIL-100 databases and 69% using PASCAL visual object challenge 2007 database, respectively. Robustness of object recognition performance is tested for variations in noise, object scaling and object shifts. Finally, a comparison with 8 existing object recognition methods indicated an improvement in recognition accuracy of 10% in ALOI, 8% in case of COIL-100 databases and 10% in PASCAL visual object challenge 2007 database.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
