Open Questions For Future Research", "text": "In this section we will discuss some of the ongoing work. We are interested in extending the FARDiff algorithm to a two-dimensional framework and a high-dimensional data reduction. Biclustering is a technique that performs simultaneous clustering in many dimensions, which automatically integrates feature selection to cluster formation without prior information. Two examples of good two-dimensional algorithms are BARTMAP and HBiFAM (Hierarchical Biclustering FA algorithm) [16,22].It is known that clustering is widely used in the analysis of high-throughput messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiling with microarrays. This technique is restrictive, in part, due to the existence of many uncorrelated genes in terms of example or state clustering formation, or many non-related samples or conditions in terms of gene clustering. Biclustering provides a solution to such problems by simultaneously performing cluster formation based on both-dimensional or automatic feature selection."}], "references": [{"title": "Near-optimal signal recovery from random projections: universal encoding strategies", "author": ["E.J.
