Allowing Input Restrictions to the input text", "text": "The proposed system only allows Unicode-based text as input, i.e. it only allows Gurumukhi text as input. In Punjab, the standard for writing the Punjabi language is Gurumukhi writing. The range of Unicode text is given. The system checks the first character, if it lies between the Unicode character ranges, it accepts input, otherwise it refuses input and checks the next character again, etc."}, {"heading": "B. Removal of Useless Symbols", "text": "This phase of pre-processing involves removing useless symbols that are meaningless. Types of useless symbols are: a. special characters and punctuation marks (<, >,:, {,}, [,], ^, &, *, (,) etc.) b. Additional tabs c. Additional spaces d. Shift e. The new line system checks the input character one by one to see if the character is a special character or a punctuation mark, skips the character and checks the next character. It only inserts the Unicode character into the file. To remove additional spaces and tabs, the system will check the character with the previous character, if the previous character matches the current character, not in the file, and will not insert that character as the previous character and check it again for the next character, i.e. if the previous and current character is a comma character, only one comma comma will be added to the file. If all terms in a file are in a new line, then replace it with a new line containing only the comma comma."}, {"heading": "C. Removal of Duplicate Terms", "text": "If duplicate terms are found, set this term to zero, otherwise it will be included in the term list. Removing duplicate terms from input prevents duplicate terms from being visible in the final output. It is absolutely necessary to omit duplicate terms from the input text, as it minimizes the number of input events and takes less time to process."}, {"heading": "D. Remove Stop Words", "text": "High-frequency terms used in input text are widely known as stop words. For example, these terms must be removed from the input text because these terms do not contain relevant information for the Punjabi ontology. We created the Punjabi language stop word list manually from the input dataset of the Punjabi. We manually analysed the dataset and identified 1500 stop words. Example: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input:: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input: Input:: Input: Input:: Input:: Input:: Input::: Input:: Input:: Input:: Input:: Input:: Input::: Input:::::: Input: Input::: Input: Input:::: Input:: Input: Input:::: Input:: Input::: Input::: Input:::: Input:::: Input:: Input::: Input::: Input::::: Input: Input:: Input::::: Input:::: Input::::: Input::::: Input::::: Input:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Input:::::::::::: Input: Input::"}, {"heading": "E. Extract Terms by matching input terms with dictionary terms", "text": "After removing useless symbols, stop words and duplicate terms, Punjabi Dictionary is used to compare terms. It contains 40,000 words. Dictionary is used to identify the meaningful terms in the input text. Terms are extracted by matching input terms one by one with dictionary terms. Terms that are matched with dictionary terms in accepted terminology file. Remaining terms that are not matched with dictionary terms are stored in the remaining terminology file for further processing."}, {"heading": "F. Extract terms by matching input terms with Gazetteer List", "text": "Permanent input terms that do not match dictionary terms are further compared with the Gazetteer list. Terms that do not match the Gazetteer list are stored in a file where dictionary terms are stored. Terms that do not match rejected terms are stored in a file. Punjabi Gazetteer list is created manually because there is no body available on the Web. Gazetteer list includes middle names, surnames, names of politicians, ISSN: 2231-5381 http: / / www.ijettjournal.org page 143Personal names of athletes, names of athletes, names of movies, place names, etc. Gazetteer list contains 4,134 terms."}, {"heading": "III.

Result of Removal of duplicate terms", "text": "It was found that 56.1% of duplicate terms are removed from documents in the field of agriculture, 52% from entertainment, 57.4% from health, 54% from politics and 53.5% from sport. The average frequency of duplicate terms in documents in the field of Punjabi is 54.6%. The following figures show the result of the removal of duplicate terms from all areas.

Result of Removal of Stop Words", "text": "The average frequency of stop words removed from each document of five domains is 98. The percentage of stop words removed from five different domains is as follows: Agricultural Domain Documents contain 34.44% stop words, Entertainment Domain Documents contain 32.7% stop words, Health Domain Documents contain 27% stop words, Domain Politics contains 30.45% stop words and Sports Domain contains 33.62% stop words. The average percentage of stop words removed from all domains is 34%, which means that 34% of text documents are eliminated as stop words. The following figures show the percentage of stop word moves from documents of five domains. ISSN: 2231-5381 http: / / www.ijettjournal.org page 145"}, {"heading": "C. Result of Dictionary and Gazetteer list matched Terms", "text": "The percentage of total terms found (i.e. dictionary terms and gazetteer list terms) of five domains is as follows: The percentage of total agrarian domain terms found is 67.3%, entertainment domain 66%, health domain 63.4%, political domain 68% and sports domain 72%. The average percentage of total terms found of all domain articles is 67.34%. The following figures show the percentage of total terms found of five different domain articles."}, {"heading": "D. Final result of pre-processing", "text": "The pre-processing was carried out on the basis of 30% Punjabi documents of the dataset. As shown in the figure, 57% of the total input items are removed as duplicate items, 14% of the total input items are stopwords, 17% terms are matched with dictionary items and 3% terms are matched with terms from the gazetteer list. This means that 20% of the total input items are matched with dictionary and gazetteer items that are used for further processing (i.e., for the processing phase). The result shows that only 9% of the total input items are remaining items that are meaningless and are not used for further processing, as shown in Figure 17.V. CONCLUSION. In this essay, we discussed the pre-processing phase of the ontology graph generation system in Punjabi. The pre-processing includes the use of xlexalic resources Punjabi Analysis items such as the Punjabi stoplist and the stoplist systems developed in Gazetteabi are not available in this list."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "I am grateful to Him.
