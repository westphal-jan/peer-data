These operations are natural extensions of the well-known \"action models\" from Dynamic Epistemic Logic. Our \"temporal action models\" may be used to define a number of informational actions that can modify the \"objective\" temporal structure of a model along with the agents' basic and higher-order knowledge and beliefs about this structure, including their beliefs about the time. In essence, this approach provides one way to extend the domain of action model-style operations from atemporal Kripke models to temporal Kripke models in a manner that allows actions to control the flow of time. We present a number of examples to illustrate the subtleties involved in interpreting the effects of our extended action models on temporal Kripke models. We also study preservation of important epistemic-temporal properties of temporal Kripke models under temporal action model-induced operations, provide complete axiomatizations for two theories of temporal action models, and connect our approach with previous work on time in Dynamic Epistemic Logic.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Nov 2014 18:33:28 GMT  (36kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6279v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["bryan renne", "joshua sack", "audrey yap"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.6279"}, "pdf": {"name": "1411.6279.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Bryan Renne", "Joshua Sack", "Audrey Yap"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 141 1.62 79v1 [cs.LO] 2 3N ov2 01"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This basic difficulty is the motivation for this paper, which presents a framework called Dynamic Epistemic Temporal Logic (ETL) [10] and Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) [3, 4, 5, 16, 17].

An explicit measure of time is one in which the time of a world w in model M can be determined exclusively by inspecting M. As we have seen, the depth of a world in a Kripke model (see definition 2.2) can provide an explicit measure of time in that world, and this can be expressed explicitly in our language (theorem 2.8). In contrast, an implicit measure of time is one in which the time of a world w in model M cannot be determined solely by inspecting M. For example, if we measure time in a world in M by the number of updates that led to M, this can be an implicit measure of time."}, {"heading": "3.1 Explicit and Implicit Representations of Time", "text": "In fact, we will be able to hold our own, we will be able to hold our own, we will be able to put ourselves in the lead."}, {"heading": "3.2 Agents Mistaken About Time", "text": "Given the fact that we measure time in a world by its depth, we can illustrate situations in which q q q is unable to distinguish between worlds that have different times.

However, in this example (U5, r) (Figure 5), the sequenced public announcement of p is followed by the asynchronous semi-private announcement of p to Agent B. This increases the time in the real world by 2, as in Example 3.4. However, in the present example it is unclear whether the time is by 1 or by 2.We are in contrast to Example 3.5, for example. Example 3.6, r) (Figure 6) links a public announcement of p with the simultaneous semi-private announcement of q to Agent B.

DETL should therefore be considered the minimal theory that brings updated mechanisms to a basic Epistemic Temporal Logic.

Our \u201ctemporal action models\u201d may be used to define a number of informational actions that can modify the \u201cobjective\u201d temporal structure of a model along with the agents\u2019 basic and higher-order knowledge and beliefs about this structure, including their beliefs about the time. In essence, this approach provides one way to extend the domain of action model-style operations from atemporal Kripke models to temporal Kripke models in a manner that allows actions to control the flow of time. We present a number of examples to illustrate the subtleties involved in interpreting the effects of our extended action models on temporal Kripke models. We also study preservation of important epistemic-temporal properties of temporal Kripke models under temporal action model-induced operations, provide complete axiomatizations for two theories of temporal action models, and connect our approach with previous work on time in Dynamic Epistemic Logic.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
