Introduction", "text": "Most of them have been used both to describe certain aspects of reality (i.e., most students are young) and to draw conclusions; that is, to obtain new information from a given set of premises. This type of reasoning is known as syllogism. Although the syllogisms have been overlaid by propositional logic, it is still a question of research. In this paper, we propose an approach to syllogism that includes fuzzy generalized quantifiers that can perform the reasoning without limits in the number of premises."}, {"heading": "2. Literature review", "text": "There are two possible interpretations taking into account quantified statements with the basic structure \"Q A are B\": (i) relative frequency rules in which the terms A and B over a particular universe and the quantifier Q denote the relationship between the two sets (e.g.: a few doctors are quantifying); (ii) conditional rules in which A is the antecedent; B is the consistent and Q denotes the power of the connection (\u2192) between the antecedent and the one that follows (e.g.; if J. Watson is a physician, then he is unlikely to be a detective consulting). It is worth noting that the typical linguistic structure of this type of rule is \"If A then B [a, b] the interpretation [a, b] the reliability or the power of the link.Both interpretations of the rules are different when applied to logistic reasoning.\""}, {"heading": "3.

Formulation of quantified statements with generalized quantifiers", "text": "The TGQ [24] analyzes quantification in natural language by combining logic and linguistic perspectives (\"Q\"). Its key concept is the generalized quantifier, which is understood as a second-order predictor that establishes a relationship between two classical propositions. As an example, we describe in detail the case of the proportional, absolute and exceptional quantifier. \"Considering the proportional interpretation of quantifiers of all,\" and the naming of E as the reference universe and P (E) as the power quantity of E, the evaluation of the quantified statement \"All Y1 are Y2\" for Y2, Y2 \"for Y2\" quantifier. \"The quantifiers of all can be modelled as: All quantified properties of Y1, Y2\" for Y2, Y2, Y2 for Y2, Y2, Y2 for Y2. \"(P)."}, {"heading": "3.2. General inference schema for syllogistic reasoning", "text": "The main feature of deductive thinking, however, is to derive new information, a conclusion, from the statements that constitute the premises of the argument. Syllogism, a kind of deductive conclusion, is based on the relationship between the propositions and their cardinalities. Therefore, the reasoning process is directly linked to the classical distribution problem [25], that is, how the elements of the referential proposition fulfill the properties or concepts in the statements. Thus, from this point of view, each of the premises of syllogism is a limitation that limits the distribution, and the conclusion is another limitation that must be compatible with the distribution described in the premises. The summary of this interpretation and the following conclusion [11] support us in transforming the syllogistic argument problem into an equivalent optimization problem that consists of calculating the extreme quantifiers of concluding."}, {"heading": "3.2.1.

Transformation into inequations", "text": "The syllogistic problem is transformed into an equivalent optimization problem, ignoring the type of quantifiers involved. In this section, we describe the transformation with quantifiers defined as crisp intervals (Q = [a, b]), since this is the basis for describing the reasoning process for blurred quantifiers (Section 4). For simplicity's sake, we assume that the Li, js are atomic; that is, they are not Boolean combinations of sets. This assumption does not limit the universality of the solution, which can easily and directly be replaced by the Boolean combination of sets. For example, for S = 2, we have the following combinations of quantifiers and quantifiers: P \u2032 1 = L1 x L2 P \u00b2 2 = Lnotation."}, {"heading": "3.2.3. Definition and resolution of the equivalent optimization problem", "text": "The basic idea of this transformation is described in [10, 11] for binary proportional quantifiers. However, our approach is more general, since we also integrate other types of quantifiers and also any Boolean combination into the constraint and scope of quantified statements. To apply the resolution method correctly (SIMPLEX), it is necessary to add three additional constraints to the set of instances obtained from the syllogistic argument. The first constraint guarantees that there are no sets with a negative number of elements; the other two constraints are only necessary if the quantifier of the conclusion is a proportional one. In this case, since the function to be optimized is a rational one."}, {"heading": "4.

To formalize the wording according to the typical form of a syllogism, the first step is to identify the number of terms involved - in this case, for the sake of simplicity and for coherence with fig. 1, let's use E = animals in my house and three terms dogs = P1, cats = P2 and parrots = P3.Table 8 shows an initial formalization of the problem taking into account the explicit information of the word choice.

How many students passed at least these subjects? In this case, in Universe E, five semesters must be taken into account: students of the sixth course = P1, students who passed physics = P2, students who passed mathematics = P3, students who passed philosophy = P4, and students who passed foreign language = P5. Table 10 shows a possible formalization, with the corresponding quantifiers being: Q1 = [0.7, 1] of PR1; Q2 = [0.75, 1] of PR2; Q3 = [0.9, 1] of PR3; Q4 = [0.85, 1] of PR4; and Q2 = [0, b] of the corresponding quantification we must take the corresponding quantification from the quantification tables."}, {"heading": "4.2.

In this model, the solution is derived from two systems of inequalities, the first of which takes KERQ as crisp interval definitions for all statements in syllogism and the second using S UPQ. The corresponding solutions define KERQC and S UPQC for the quantifier in the conclusion. We should note that this is an exact and very simple approximation to 4http: / / platea.pntic.mec.es / csanchez / olimp 1963-2004 / OME2004.pdf; p. 29for cases where the quantifiers are trapezides."}, {"heading": "4.3.

Therefore, each blurred quantifier is administered by a number of \"\u03b1\" sections defined in the universe of the quantifier's discourse. Therefore, for each \"\u03b1\" section considered, an inequality system similar to the one described in Section 3.2.2. The reasoning method consists in applying the method described in Section 3.2.3 to each of these inequality systems. Each of the solutions obtained for all of these systems defines the corresponding \"\u03b1\" section for the quantifier QC in the conclusion. By applying this general approach, it is possible to manage each generalized quantifier (such as those presented in Table 6) for three situations that are not taken into account in the previous models: \u2022 trapezoidal quantifiers where non-normalized results are not described in this case, any quantifier cannot be quantified in this case, and therefore, in this case, the quantifier cannot be obtained in this case, any of the preceding Q."}, {"heading": "4.3.1.

Example 2 (non-normalized fuzzy extension): Students of sixth course", "text": "In the second example, we illustrate a syllogism that produces a non-normalized fuzzy set as a result. We look again at the example of Table 10, but add the following premise: PR5: Between 40% and 90% of the students of the sixth course have physics or mathematics or philosophy or foreign language. Its definition is Q5 = [0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9] and the corresponding system of inequalities is added to the previous system. Results are in Fig. 4. For \u03b1-sections greater than 0.95, the system has no solution; that is, the fuzzy set that defines the quantifier of the conclusion is a non-normalized fuzzy set. Therefore, this syllogism cannot be solved by approximating fuzzy quantifiers as a pair of intervals (Section 4.2)."}, {"heading": "4.3.3. Example 3 (non-trapezoidal result): wine warehouse", "text": "In this case, we show a syllogism using the class of proportional quantifiers known as Regular Increasing Monotones (RIM) quantifiers [27] proposed in the context of a quantifier-based aggregation of combinations of criteria, a method of defining proportional quantifiers (how few, many, most.) in which the linguistic term quantifier is interpreted as a blurred subset Q of the interval [0, 1]. Its basic definition is in Equation 15Q\u03b1 (p) = p\u03b1; \u03b1 > 0 (15), in which Q\u03b1 quantifier and p quantifier [0, 1] are used. For example, Q2 (labeled as the most), Q2 (0.95) = 1 means that say 95% of the meaning we convey is fully fulfilled \"and Q2 (0.75) means that 60% of the meaning is fulfilled with the degree 0.75%."}, {"heading": "4.3.4.

Some sales relate to white wine.Let us take both statements as premises in the universe of products sold by wine cellar = E, we have a silogism with three terms: sales = P1, red wine = P2 and white wine = P3. With these two premises, for example, we can use the following disjunction pattern of Zadeh [9], whose conclusion is the form \"PQC are P1 or P3,\" where P1 are the subject of the premises and P2 and P3 are the corresponding predicates. In this example, however, we change the conclusion by the following: \"Quality sales are not from red wine or white wine,\" because this allows them to know how many sales from other products shows the complete table 12."}, {"heading": "4.3.5. Example 5 (Exception fuzzy quantifiers): wine warehouse", "text": "The last example shows a syllogism that combines blurred quantifiers that were not previously considered exceptional quantifiers in literature (i.e., all but about four,..), combined with absolute quantifiers (i.e. about four,..): All but about fifteen wine crates are for J. Moriarty. About four crates of crates that are not for J. Moriarty are for J. Watson. We can identify the following three terms in the statements: crates of wine = P1, crates of J. Moriarty = P2, and crates of J. Watson = P3. In light of this information, we can conclude how many crates are not for J. Moriarty and also not for J. Watson; that is, \"crates of wine are not for J. Moriarty and also not for J. Watson.\" In Table 14 we are given the full argument. The quantifier of PR1 is a blurred quantifier of the exception, because it indicates that there are about fifteen crates for J. Watson."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "We have formulated a general approach to syllogistic thinking that overcomes the limitation of the number of premises and is compatible with the TGQ, allowing us to manage new types of quantifiers that have not previously been considered in the literature. In addition, we show a way to turn the argumentation problem with binary quantified statements into a mathematical optimization problem in order to obtain the conclusions of syllogism. The approach can also manage different types of quantification, both crisp and vague. This model is currently implemented as a software library that is capable of managing all the quantifiers described in the paper. As a future work, we aim to expand our method of managing different quantifiers within the same syllogism and include new quantifiers of more than two (ternary and quaternary) activities. Another relevant topic that can be taken into account is logistical management and formulating information or implementing contextual reasoning."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (TIN200800040), the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Innovation and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF / FEDER) (TIN2011-29827-C02-02) and the Spanish Ministry of Education (FPU Fellowship Program)."}], "references": [{"title": "The Development of Logic", "author": ["W.
