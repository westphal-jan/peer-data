Interval syllogistics: the Dubois et al. framework", "text": "Dubois and colleagues proposed an approach to syllogistic thinking based on the interpretation of linguistic quantifiers as intervals; that is, a quantifier Q = [q, q], where q denotes the lower limit and q the upper limit [5, 8]. Since this model focuses on the management of proportional quantifiers (like most, many, some between 25% and 34%,...), we have this q, q [0, 1]. A vivid example of this type of syllogistic thinking is in Table 4.This interval approach and Aristotelian approach show methodological differences. Aristotle manages and proves all his moods using natural logic, which implies the use of natural language as a logical language [7]. The approach of Dubois et al. is based on maximizing and minimizing an interval (associated with the termination) according to other premised intervals. We are all analyzing this approach (the two parts of the theory)."}, {"heading": "2.1. Quantification theory of Dubois et al.", "text": "Three types of quantification are considered: 1. Inaccurate quantifiers: quantifiers whose values are not exactly known but have exact limits; for example, between 25% and 50% of students are young and less than 70% of young people blond. They are presented as intervals Q = [q, q].2. Precise quantifiers: quantifiers whose values are exactly known and have precise limits; for example, 10% of animals are mammals and 30% of young students are large. In this case, the lower and upper limits of the interval coincide (q = q).3. Fuzzy quantifiers: quantifiers whose limits are inaccurately defined and inaccurate and blurred; for example, most Spanish cars are new and a few elephants are pets. Fuzzy quantifiers are presented on the basis of a blurred number, which is represented by the usual four-point trapezoidal representation Qi = {q \u00b2, qi, q \u00b2, q \u00b2, Portqi = qi and SUq]."}, {"heading": "2.2. Theory of inference of Dubois et al.", "text": "The calculation method is based on minimizing and maximizing the quantifier in the conclusion. This quantifier can be modeled as an interval or as a trapezoidal function and is calculated by taking the quantifiers of the premises as constraints. The main objective is to obtain the most favorable and least favorable proportions between the terms of the conclusion according to the proportions expressed in the premises. From an operational point of view, the researchers deal with the previously stated interval pair SUPQi and KERQi. The terms A, B and C are the terms of the terminology and Q1, Q \u2032 1, Q2, Q \u2032 2, Q \u2032 2, Q \u2032 2, Q \u2032 the quantifiers, which may be precise, inaccurate or blurred, three different justification schemes or patterns are proposed. Specifically, we refer to pattern I, as it has the same syntactical structure as the classical aristelistocratic illustrations."}, {"heading": "2.2.1. Pattern I", "text": "Table 6 (left) shows the linguistic expression of this pattern for the three sets of terms A, B and C, where Q1 denotes the quantifier of the first premise and Q '1 its opposite, Q2 the quantifier of the second premise and Q '2 its opposite and Q and Q and Q's quantifier of the conclusions. Table 6 (right) shows a vivid example of this pattern. Figure 2 shows a graphic representation of the syllogistic scheme Pattern I. The circles denote the quantifiers A, B and C; continuous arrows denote the quantifiers between two sets of terms in a premise, where Qi is the quantifier of that premise; arrows with discontinuous lines denote the connections between two terms in the conclusion, where Q is the quantifier for the quantification of the quantification. Pattern I is an asymmetric syllogism, since the link between the subject and the predicate (C) occurs via the quantification."}, {"heading": "2.2.2. Other patterns", "text": "Dubois et al. have proposed other concepts based on three terms [8]. Pattern II comprises two linguistic expressions (Table 7), referred to as the general version and the respective version; the main difference between them is the information available for the set of premises. The general version is used when the information available for the terms is sufficient to complete the six premises; the special version can be used when the available information allows the completion of four corresponding statements. Table 8 shows a graphic example of a specific pattern II.1 Calculation of Q \u00b2 is identical. Details of the proof can be found at [5, 8]. Pattern III also has two linguistic versions (Table 9). The differences between them are the same as for pattern II, although the number of premises changes: The general pattern III has the same six premises, but the special one has two. Table 10 shows an example of a particular pattern Ilinguistic version. We can observe the sylogy of the symmetry, but the logic of the drafts shows that it is an Arimmetry."}, {"heading": "2.3. Comparison of the Dubois et al. and Aristotelian syllogistics", "text": "Patterns II and III of Dubois et al. cannot therefore be compared with the Aristotelian framework, since their structure is in fact a syntactical extension of the classical approach and therefore cannot be used to reproduce the classical syllogisms. Nevertheless, pattern I can be used for comparison, since it is an asymmetric syllogism, like all Aristotelian moods. In terms of the ability of pattern I to reproduce the four classical figures, only figure I is compatible, as shown in Table 11, if we take into account conclusion Q, due to the position of the middle term. Consequently, although classical figures II, III and IV correspond to this approach from a syntactical point of view, they cannot be modelled within this framework."}, {"heading": "3.

Zadeh\u2019s quantification framework", "text": "Within this framework, two types of linguistic quantification are described: absolute (about five, many, some,...) and proportional (many, more than half, most,...); for example, in the case of \"about ten students are blond,\" about ten is an absolute quantifier because it denotes the absolute quantity ten; in the case of \"most students are blonde,\" most are a proportional quantifier because it refers to a proportional quantity relative to the cardinality of the quantity designated by the subject (\"student\"); some linguistic quantifiers (e.g. some) can be absolute or proportional depending on the context; Zadeh interpreted linguistic quantifiers as blurred numbers [10]. Thus, absolute quantifiers are identified with absolute blurred numbers; and proportional quantifiers with proportional blurred numbers."}, {"heading": "3.2. Zadeh\u2019s theory of inference", "text": "Zadeh's approach manages the usual quantified statements \"Q As are Bs,\" where Q is a proportional fuzzy number (corresponding to the corresponding linguistic proportional quantifier) and A and B (fuzzy or crisp) sentences. According to the general scheme presented in Table 13, they can only be combined to conclusions with two premises and one conclusion. 2Liu and Kerre discuss the most relevant problems arising from the use of QEP and fuzzy arithmetic in Zadeh's framework [13]. The follow-up process is based on QEP, which states that if C = f (P1; P2;.; Pn), then Q = f (Q1; Q2;; Qn), (3) where C is the conclusion, P1; P2;.; Pn is the premise, f is a function, Q is the quantifier of the conclusion, Q1; 2;."}, {"heading": "3.2.1.

Table 14 (right) provides an example of the use of this pattern. Fig.3 represents a graphical representation of MC syllogism. Since the terms of the conclusion are \"concatenated\" by a medium-term, this pattern is called a concatenation pattern, where A is the subject and C is the predicate, and B is the \"link\" between these two terms that makes it possible to draw a conclusion from coherence. Furthermore, it is worth noting that there is a constraint between A and B; i.e. B A, i.e. \u00b5B (ui), this pattern is called a linkage pattern."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. Major premise reversibility (MPR) chaining", "text": "Table 15 (left) shows the general structure of the syllogistic MPR pattern, in which Q1 denotes the quantifier of the first premise, Q2 the quantifier of the second premise, and Q the quantifier of the conclusion. Table 15 (right) provides an example of how this pattern is used. Fig.4 is a graphical representation of the structure of the argumentation pattern of the MPR concatenation [4]. We can consider this model as a variant of the MC pattern in Section 3.2.1, in which the constraint \"B A\" is replaced by the reversibility of the first premise; i.e. \"Q1 as B.\" Q1 and Q1 Bs are As. \"Zadeh points out that this semantic equivalence is approximate rather than accurate; the calculation of how\" approximate \"it can be remains a non-trivial open question [16]. Nevertheless, there is a notable obstacle to this constraint.\" For quantitative cars, most of them are not proportionately large (most of them are American)."}, {"heading": "3.2.3. Other patterns", "text": "Apart from the models described above, Zadeh proposed an asymmetric conceptual scheme (intersection / product, Table 16) and two symmetrical schemes (preceding conjunction / disjunction, Table 17; consequent conjunction / disjunction, Table 18). The difference between the preceding and consequent pattern lies in the position of the logical operator in the conclusion: if it occurs for the subject, we get the preceding pattern (and for the conjunction; or for the disjunction); if it occurs for the predicate, we get the resulting pattern (as in the preceding pattern, the operator is used for the conjunction and or for the disjunction)."}, {"heading": "3.3.

Conclusions and future work", "text": "We have shown that the two most relevant blurred approaches behave very differently with regard to the management of Figure I of Aristotelian sillogistics, which is one of the classic approaches to this kind of reasoning. While the model of Dubois et al. is consistent with all six moods in Figure I, Zadeh's MPR scheme is consistent for only one of six moods and his MC approach is not consistent with any of the six moods. Furthermore, none of the models is compatible with the other classical figures II, III and IV, which contain 18 moods. Therefore, the proposal of Dubois et al. can be regarded from this point of view as a plausible blurred extension, which includes some of the classical cases as special cases. Therefore, this proposal could be considered as the basis for defining a more general approach to syllogistic arguments, which, for example, could use the other currently excluded moods and / or other types of quantifiers in the linguistic field, for example [17 persons are approximately the same size]."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "This work was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (TIN2008-00040), the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Innovation and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF / FEDER) (TIN2011-29827-C02-02) and the Spanish Ministry of Education (FPU Fellowship Program)."}], "references": [{"title": "The Syllogism", "author": ["P.
