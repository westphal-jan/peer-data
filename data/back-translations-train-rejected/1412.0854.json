USING SEMANTIC HMC TO DERIVE VALUE IN BIG DATA CONTEXT", "text": "Our approach is to harness the value of very large volumes of data that are constantly generated using a semantic HMC approach. Once this learning phase is completed, the classification system gradually learns the Tbox from the newly incoming items (Aboxes) to provide and respond to the velocity (and the other V) dimension (s). The result of this semantic HMC process is a rich ontology with the items (instances) classified according to the learned concept hierarchy (i.e. the taxonomy of ontology). Companies repeatedly use concept hierarchies as taxonomies to present their valuable information [10]. Our vision is to use the company concept hierarchies to validate the valuable Xiv concepts: 141 2.08 54v1 [cs.AI] 2D ec2 01of the learned concepts for a better equivalence between the corporate values ultimately used by the company and the objectives-1."}, {"heading": "III. SEMANTIC HMC PROCESS", "text": "Our Semantic HMC process is generic for a wide variety of unstructured data elements (e.g. text, images) and scalable for a large number of data. The process is such that no previously described / classified examples or rules exist. The label (i.e. concepts) is automatically learned from the data to draw conclusions."}, {"heading": "C. Hierarchization", "text": "The hierarchization step selects relevant terms as relevant concepts and also generates the broader and closer relationships between these concepts. To select the concepts in the hierarchy, a quality yardstick must be used. There are several methods to establish hierarchical relationships between concepts, including [16], [17]: \u2022 Hierarchical clustering that begins with a cluster and gradually merges clusters that are closest to each other. \u2022 Submission methods that construct the concept of closer relationships based on the simultaneous appearance of concepts. Each of these methods can be used to establish hierarchical relationships. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are thoroughly examined in [16]."}, {"heading": "D. Resolution", "text": "The resolution process will create the ontology rules that will be used to correlate the hierarchical concepts with the elements that use term frequency vectors.The rule-making process will use thresholds, as proposed in [18], to select the most relevant terms for each hierarchical concept used in the rules.The main difference is that these rules will not be translated into logical limitations of an ontology that is captured in the description logic, but into rules in the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL).The main interest in using SWRL rules is to reduce the burden of argumentation and thus improve the scalability and performance of the system.Our goal is to use a huge set of simple SWRL rules that apply to ontology to classify elements."}, {"heading": "E. Realization", "text": "The implementation phase fills the learned concept hierarchy with data elements. First, the ontology is populated with new items, which are labeled in an assertion level (Abox). To perform the classification / labeling of the items, the SWRL rules generated in the resolution step are used. Subsequently, a rules-based inference engine uses the SWRL rules and the hierarchy to derive the most specific concepts for each data element and all summarizing concepts. This leads to a multi-label classification of the documents based on a hierarchy of labels (Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification)."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we present our vision to extract values from big data through a semantic HMC process and propose a scalable five-step architecture for automatic classification of unstructured items. We use machine learning to learn an ontology with SWFL rules to automatically classify items from big data. A prototype of the semantic HMC process is under development and we expect the implementation and results to be demonstrated in further work. Our current work is to evaluate the resulting ontology taking into account three different aspects: the scalability (performance) of the process, the quality of the hierarchy and the quality of the classification process (i.e. concept marking of items)."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This project is being created by Actualis SARL, the French agency ANRT and the Portuguese COMPETE programme within the framework of the AAL4ALL project (QREN13852)."}], "references": [{"title": "Data Mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques", "author": ["I.H.
