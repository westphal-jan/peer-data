Morphological study of Astell's words with NooJ", "text": "After studying the word length, we record the morphological changes observed and described with NooJ.

A large number of Latin and Greek words were imported into the English language during the Renaissance. Astell's text is a literary work, and we wondered if we could find the percentage of long words in her text thanks to NooJ. To do this, we created a graph that allows NooJ to locate them. We determined their number and occurrence of each lexicon in a very simple way. The following graph can highlight the words in the text according to their length. To then search for the occurrence of an N-letter word, we use the command < LETTERS + NUMBER >. Our results are presented in Table 3: The total number of long words is 3659 out of 18,759 words in the text, i.e. a percentage of about 19.5%. This graph allows us to determine the percentage of long words and to find very long words (e.g. 16: uncharitability and some double words)."}, {"heading": "2.2.

Figure 3: Syntactic graph for compoundsThis resulted in 28 results or occurrences of the NooJ-approved formula1-wort2 (for example, god-like for god-like or prefix for preengage). During the search, NooJ also relies on another graph that allows it to take into account the conversion of the prefix -in -en or -en into -in (as we saw in a related article, Piton and Pignot, 2008). Sometimes, a merging of two separate words also needs to be performed, such as in \"where-J\" always this conversion is made by our request to \"Noostein.\""}, {"heading": "2.2.2. Juxtaposed words", "text": "Some words result from the concatenation or merging of two lexemes, as in the case of personal pronouns (myself for myself). In 17th century English, these words were spelled as adjacent words instead of a single entity. We came across a few occurrences of this type of word in Astell's text; the second way in Figure 3 allows us to systematically search for them. Besides personal pronouns such as \"her self,\" \"our self\" (whose spelling suggests that \"self\" was perceived as a noun), we found 11 connections: any body, every day, forever, each, each, each thing, often, as wisely, to this day, no body, backward. However, this connection also produces a lot of noise and comical results: are one, area; be one, a bean; direct or, director; not able to be remarkable; and yet I, yeti! Some connections in contemporary English are still generated by hyphens, while verb (except when the prefix and adjective do not end with the first)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Words with apostrophes", "text": "There are more apostrophe than full points (356) and three times fewer than commas (1334). In 17th-century typography, many words could be written with an apostrophe indicating the omission of a letter, usually the mute e. In addition to 118 previous participle in \"d or\" t, some \"s and some familiar contradictions, we have extracted other contracts not included in the NooJ dictionary because they are not used in contemporary English. These contradictions had to be adequately described and added to our dictionary.

The following graph can locate superlatives and comparatives; in Astell's text, it can locate the archaic form word (a double comparative bad expression). Figure 4: Recognition of the comparative and the superlative Astell only uses the comparative in -er and the superlative in -est for short words. Among the grammatical appendages typical of 17th-century English, the verb inflections in -est and -th (st, 2nd-person singular, -th or -st singular) should be mentioned in the present and in the preterit. They can be discovered thanks to the following graph and are recognized as valid verb forms when s or it is added to the root.

Introduction In our previous articles, we have studied the singularities of 17 century English within the framework of a diachronic analysis thanks to syntactical and morphological graphs and thanks to the dictionaries we have compiled from a corpus that may be expanded overtime. Our early work was based on a limited corpus of English travel literature to Greece in the 17 century. This article deals with a late seventeenth century text written by a woman philosopher and essayist, Mary Astell (1666\u20131731), considered as one of the first English feminists. Astell wrote her essay at a time in English history when women were \u201cthe weaker vessel\u201d and their main business in life was to charm and please men by their looks and submissiveness. In this essay we will see how NooJ can help us analyse Astell's rhetoric (what point of view does she adopt, does she speak in her own name, in the name of all women, what is her representation of men and women and their relationships in the text, what are the goals of education?). Then we will turn our attention to the morphology of words in the text and use NooJ commands and graphs to carry out a lexicographic inquiry into Astell's lexemes. I. About the Author and Remarks on the Text 1. 1. Who was Mary Astell? In A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, part I, first published anonymously in 1694, Mary Astell makes a rather odd suggestion (for the period!): women should withdraw from the world in a \u201cblest abode\u201d that she even dares to call a convent (in a country where all convents had been closed down). There they might enjoy each other\u2019s company, spend their time in study, good works and prayer (without forgetting daily church attendance). This place could also be a refuge for heiresses and unmarried women who need to escape the assiduities of adventurers and fortune seekers. Her book was widely discussed in her day and satirised by the moralist Richard Steele in the Tatler in 1709, calling Astell the leader of \u201can order of Platonick Ladies\u201d bent on celibacy and \u201cresolv'd to join their Fortunes and erect a Nunnery\u201d in Steele (1709). According to the historian Antonia Fraser (1984, 404), what inspired Astell to write her proposal was the life of her friend Hortense Mancini, Duchesse de Mazarin, King Charles II\u2019s ex-mistress, who was the subject of numerous scandals, such as \u201cthe running away in Disguise with a Spruce Cavalier\u201d! Astell was convinced her friend\u2019s \u201cunhappy shipwreck\u201d pointed out \u201cthe dangers of an ill Education and unequal marriage\u201d (1700, 3). A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, part I, is signed \u201cby a Lover of her Sex\u201d and was first published anonymously in 1694 when the author was only 28. Part II (which will not be tackled here) is an application of Descartes\u2019 and Malebranche\u2019s philosophy to the education of women. 1. 2. From the Text to the Digital Text OCR software could not be used for this text so we had to type the text preserving the original spelling and punctuation. NooJ does not keep the italics, hence the literary effects created by Astell\u2019s use of italics are lost. In 17 century printing, most nouns are capitalised. The last word (or its last syllable) on the page is repeated at the top of the next page: here \u201cous\u201d and \u201chome\u201d in illustration 1. Illustration 1: Frontispiece and Excerpt from A Serious Proposal to the Ladies 1.3. Astell\u2019s point of view We first focused on the semantics, to examine how Astell builds her vindication of the female sex, which words she uses to sensitise women to their alienated condition and promote their education. As the object of this study is a literary text, it is interesting first to study point of view, which can be examined by focusing on the use of personal pronouns and possessive adjectives in Astell\u2019s text. 1.3.1. Personal pronouns. The study of personal pronouns highlight different aspects of Astell\u2019s rhetoric: she exhorts with the personal pronoun \u201cyou\u201d, denounces with \u201cthey\u201d, creates complicity with we, and seldom uses the first person \u201cI\u201d. The hortatory aspect of the text may be highlighted when we extract the sentences in which the pronoun \u201cyou\u201d is used (locate pattern you): \u201cHow can you be content to be in the World like Tulips in a Garden, to make a fine shew and be good for nothing; have all your Glories set in the grave...\u201d This functionality enabled us to extract expressions such as \u201cI pray you\u201d, \u201cI entreat you\u201d, \u201crender you\u201d, \u201cpersuade you\u201d, I \u201cwould have you\u201d, \u201call that is required of you\u201d. The text is a protrepsis, an exhortation to women to change their lives and shake off the yoke of ignorance and superficiality. The frequent use of the pronoun \u201cwe\u201d is meant to encourage identification with the author and with a community of women sharing the same fate in a male-dominated society. By contrast, the occurrences of \u201cI, me, my\u201d account for 4.56 % of pronouns. Astell does not use the pronouns \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme\u201d very much: these self-references (84) account for only 0.44% of the words of the text, which points to her self-effacement as an author, to be linked with that of the female author in the 17 century. Incidentally, it should be noted that her book is signed \u201cby a Lover of her Sex\u201d, and not under her own name. In her preface to Letters Concerning the Love of God (1695,4), Astell says she wants \u201cto slide gently through the world without so much as being seen or taken notice of.\u201d Personal pronouns occurrences Total by group Me/ my self / my / I 12 / 5 / 15 / 52 84 Thou / Thy / thine 0 0 She / her 129 / 183 129 He / him / his 18 / 24 / 24 631 We / us / our 141 / 88 / 144 373 You / your 125 / 81 206 They / them / their 148 / 111 / 159 418", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
