A split and bound algorithm starts by dividing the search space into individual sub-areas. A sub-space could then be divided into smaller sub-areas when a sub-space can no longer be divided (a leaf is reached in the search tree), or when the upper limit is lower than the value of a solution already achieved (i.e., a leaf already reached in the search tree). A branch and a bound approach can therefore avoid exploring a large part of the search space."}, {"heading": "3 Results and Discussion", "text": "We followed the protocol presented in [6] to identify the pesticides and used the same data sets they used: 101 cationic antimicrobial pentadecaptides (CAMPs) from the synthetic antibiotic peptide database [8]. Peptide antibacterial activities, however, are expressed as a logarithm of bacterial potency. As in [6], we used kernel-based regression as a learning algorithm. Apart from the fact that all hyper parameters for the GS kernel (k, \u03c3c, \u03c3c) and kernel-based regression (f) were chosen by standard cross-validation, we learned two predictors of antimicrobial potency, one uses unnormalized kernel values (i.e. the same predictor used in [6]."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "Empirical results show that the method proposed by [6] may suffer from a dominance of the norm for certain strings, a problem present in many string nuclei. In these situations, it could be shown that the proposed method overcomes this problem. Narrower limits should exploit the proposed framework and allow the discovery of new peptide inhibitors. Finally, applications for medicines based on cyclic peptides and other structured output applications are expected."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank Prudencio Tossu for his help with the experiments carried out on the supercomputer Colosse of Universite \u0301 Laval (resource allocation project: avt-710-aa) under the auspices of Calcul Que \ufffd bec and Compute Canada.
