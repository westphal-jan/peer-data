Accordingly, our task in this section is to introduce a simple theory of reason-based belief in which we formalize this distinction. An important caveat is that we are not trying to break down the concept of \"adequate reason\" into more fundamental concepts. For example, one might wish to analyze appropriateness in terms of reliability, counterfactual sensitivity, or other concepts. We consciously avoid such examples.
