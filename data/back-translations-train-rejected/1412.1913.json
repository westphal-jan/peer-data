Introduction", "text": "The discrete time cost compression problem (DTCTP) is an important aspect in the planning of construction projects based on research costs. In project planning and planning, the selection of suitable resources, including crew sizes, equipment, methods and technologies, to carry out a project does not require complex solutions. These decisions ultimately affect the duration and cost of the project. However, in practice, when the project is running behind the planned plan, acceleration of activities becomes essential by allowing additional resources that ultimately incur additional costs (De et al., 1997). DTCTP is a process to identify an appropriate activity to accelerate and decide \"how much\" to achieve the best possible savings in time and costs (Zheng et al., 2005). Such an optimization process closes hidden trade relationships between time and costs. This will create complex situations for decision makers to predict whether the total costs (i.e. the direct and indirect costs would rise) or fall as a result of time compression."}, {"heading": "2. Mathematical Formulation", "text": "To model the DTCTP, we start from the standard assumption for modeling the project network: the project network has no cycles, the start activity (activity 0, dummy activity) is the only activity that is not an immediate successor of any activity, and the target activity (activity N + 1, also dummy activity) is the only activity that does not succeed. In the time-cost optimization study, project completion time and implementation costs are considered as the main objectives in determining the best possible option for each activity in the project network."}, {"heading": "2.1. Project completion time", "text": "The project time is determined by planning the activities using the assigned activity duration. It can be expressed as follows: min max. number of activities in the project network Duration of activity, for 1,...,, 1,... If 1 then activity performs option, while 0 does not path activity sequence 1, 2,..., sets all paths of a network 1, 2,..., number of paths in a project network Number of time cost options for each activity, for 1,...,"}, {"heading": "2.2. Project cost", "text": "The total cost of the project is composed of direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are considered as the sum of the direct cost of all activities within a project network. On the other hand, the indirect costs are composed of the expenditure for the management during the project implementation, which strongly depends on the project duration, i.e. the longer the duration, the higher the indirect costs. They can be expressed as follows: min. MINIMUM STATES2Wo, direct cost of the option for the activity, for 1,..., 1,...,..., indirect cost of the option for the activity, for 1,...,, 1,...,..., material cost of the option for the activity, for 1,...,...,..., duration of the activity for the option, for 1,..., 1,..., daily rate in $per day for the use of the option for the activity, for 1,...,, 1,...,...,...,...,...,"}, {"heading": "2.3. Constraints", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.3.1. Network logic constraints", "text": "The termination time of a project can be limited by one of two methods (Crowston, 1970). The first method allows precedent constraints for any immediately preceding relationship in the project network. The second method allows a constraint for each path from the first activity to the last in the project network. In this formulation, the first method is appliced.The logical relationship between two successive activities i and their immediate successor k is expressed as follows: 1,...,, 3 Where, scheduled beginning of the immediate succession of the activitiesThe scheduled termination time of the activitiesThe SFi corresponds to the scheduled start time (SSi) plus its duration. The logical relationship constraint can be expressed with the following equation, where Si is the amount of subsequent activities to activity i."}, {"heading": "2.3.2.

Benchmark instances of DTCTP", "text": "In this paper, the data sets of the DTCTP are characterized by the number of activities, possible schedules and the number of total paths in the project network. Table 1 shows the benchmark instances of the DTCTP with their characteristics mentioned above. In this study, a total of six data sets of the DTCTP of very large to very small size were considered, including problems 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 from (Ozgen, 2009), (Chassiakos and Sakellaropoulos, 2005), (Feng and Liu, 1997), (Pour et al., 2010) and (Zheng et al., 2004), and problem 4 was hypothetically generated with a maximum of 4 and a minimum of 2 execution modes for project activities. Solving these problems was attempted by integrating them into an algorithm portfolio working on the strategy to minimize the risk in terms of computing costs and the solution quality achieved."}, {"heading": "4.2. Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs)", "text": "In this paper, four MOEAs are established, namely NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002), SPEA-II (Zitzler et al., 2001), NPGA-II (Erickson et al., 2001) and PAES (Knowles and Corne, 1999), to design and implement the algorithm portfolio. The following discussion gives a brief overview of these four MOEAs."}, {"heading": "4.2.1. Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II)", "text": "This algorithm is a revamped version of the non-dominated Sorting Genetic algorithm (NSGA) proposed by Srinivas and Deb (1995) and criticized mainly for its high computational complexity. To find the first non-dominated front, each solution in the population is compared with each other to find all members who are non-dominated compared to others. These individuals initially comprise non-dominated front. To find the members of the next front, all members of the previous fronts are temporarily abandoned and the above procedure is repeated, resulting in a high O (MN3) computational complexity, with M being the number of targets and N the population size."}, {"heading": "4.2.2. Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm II (SPEA-II)", "text": "It is a revised version of SPEA, proposed by Zitzler and Thiele (2001). SPEA was developed on the basis of a prior comparative study and establishes the multi-objective techniques used in Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) in a single meta-heuristic skeleton (Zitzler and Thiele, 1999). SPEA-II, an improved version of SPEA, uses an external memory to store the non-dominated individuals. Each individual in the extended memory and in the current population is assigned a strength value based on dominance and density information. An individual's rank is determined by the sum of the strength values of the individuals that dominate it. Each individual's density is estimated based on the kst nearest adjacent density estimation method. The final fitness value is then calculated as the sum of rank and density values. Additionally, a hierarchical cluster method (Morse 1980, preserved from the archive) is used to versify the parcel."}, {"heading": "4.2.3. Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm-II (NPGA-II)", "text": "Erickson et al. (2001) proposed a revised version of the NPGA (Horn et al., 1994) called NPGA-II. This algorithm uses the Pareto ranking but maintains tournament selection (resolving ties through fitness sharing as in the original NPGA), in which case no external memory is used and the elitist mechanism is similar to that of the NSGA-II. Niche counts in NPGA-II are calculated based on individuals of the partially filled next generation rather than on the current generation. This is called continuously updated fitness sharing and was proposed by Oei et al. (1991)."}, {"heading": "4.2.4. Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES)", "text": "This algorithm was introduced by Knowles and Corne (1999). PAES consists of a (1 + 1) evolutionary strategy (i.e. a single parent producing a single offspring) in combination with a historical archive that records previously found non-dominated solutions, which serves as a reference set to compare each mutant individual. Such a historical archive is the elitist mechanism used in PAES. However, an interesting aspect of this algorithm is the process of maintaining diversity, which consists of a crowding process that divides objective space in a recursive way. Each solution is placed in a specific place based on the values of its objectives (used as \"coordinates\" or \"geographical location\")."}, {"heading": "4.3. Computational Analysis", "text": "As we know, MOEAs do not always achieve the optimal solution, even with long calculation times. Furthermore, it is often impossible to make an analytical prediction of the solution achievable within a certain calculation time or the time it takes to find a solution for a particular quality. Analysis of these metrics is crucial for comparing MOEAs II. In the literature, statistical analysis of these metrics is known as the \"Univariate Model\" (Chiarandini et al., 2007). Specifically, Univariate Model is the one in which either the solution cost or the runtime are taken into account when analyzing the various metaheuristics. In this paper, our concern is the runtime, which means that the solution is measured with a desired property. We assume that the runtime corresponds to the number of iteration criteria required to achieve the desired solution quality."}, {"heading": "5. Algorithm Portfolio", "text": "In this section we present the design of the algorithm portfolio and its implementation on DTCTP."}, {"heading": "5.1. Algorithm Portfolio Design", "text": "These experiments were conducted with portfolios containing 2 and 4 algorithms on 2- and 4-processor systems.The detailed list of algorithm information embedded in different portfolios is in Table 3.The following criteria were taken into account in the creation of these portfolios: These algorithms were combined and placed in the same portfolios that performed differently. Strategies that use external memory to store non-dominated particles are linked to the ratings that store such particles in the current population.Portfolios were designed with the requirement of analyzing the relative performance of different strategies used to maintain diversity in the population.Strategies for maintaining the strategies are also considered. The poorer performance of the portfolio compared to other metrics used to maintain diversity in the population.Maintaining strategies for maintaining the dominion is not foreground."}, {"heading": "5.2. Implementation of Portfolio Approach", "text": "In practice, the portfolio can be implemented after a few steps. First, a number of portfolios for different processors and their constituent algorithms should be identified. In this paper, we have developed three portfolios, namely 2 algorithm-2 processors (2A-4P) and 4 algorithm-4 procedures (4A-4P). We have then identified the constituent algorithm for each of these portfolios as indicated in the table."}, {"heading": "6.1. Experimental Runs", "text": "The average number of iterations required by the portfolio to achieve the desired level of quality (10% of the best) of the Pareto-optimal front is again used as a performance criterion. Various combinations of algorithms executed on the processors and used in the experiment are given as follows: Case 4A- 4P Case 4A- 4P 1 4 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 9 0 / 3 / 1 / 0 2 3 / 1 / 0 10 0 / 4 / 0 3 3 3 3 / 0 / 1 / 0 11 1 / 0 / 3 / 0 / 1 12 1 1 / 2 / 0 / 1 5 2 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 4"}, {"heading": "6.2. Interpreting the Results", "text": "After considering the experimental results on six different problems as different attributes, a first JiJix solution is defined. (Generally, the availability of the processor for parallel runs in an organization is limited; therefore, the selection strategy must be executed separately for each of the two types of systems (2 processor, 4 processor), taking into account the different performance of the different algorithms and ultimately the portfolios, in order to obtain the high-quality solution with minimum risk. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has long been used as a tool for decision makers to select the best alternatives from the given alternatives in such situations. AHP deals with hierarchical pair comparisons to induce the weights of alternatives that compare their pair relationships. This paper also deals with the selection of the best portfolio problem from an AHP perspective. Each type of portfolio is recognized as an alternative for the respective processor system to which the portfolio belongs and the results are considered as different attributes."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion and Future Research", "text": "The proposed algorithm portfolio of NSGA-II, PAES, NPGA-II and SPEA-II will be used to minimize the risk associated with selecting the algorithm. Six benchmark instances of DTCTP of varying dimensions and complexity will be included to analyze the performance of the portfolio approach; the four algorithms will be processed in parallel on two and four processor systems; the results showed insight into the application of portfolios to select the best algorithm for computationally costly optimization problems; and the result shows a significant reduction in computing time due to parallel processing of algorithms. As a perspective for future work, detailed analysis is required before any suggestion to use the algorithm portfolio."}], "references": [{"title": "Non-dominated Archiving Multicolony Ant Algorithm in Time-Cost Trade-off Optimization", "author": ["A.

Instead of using single algorithm to solve DTCTP, we use a portfolio approach that takes multiple algorithms as its constituent. In this paper, we proposed portfolio comprising of four MOEAs, Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 (NSGA 2), the strength Pareto EA 2 (SPEA 2), Pareto archive evolutionary strategy (PAES) and Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm 2 (NPGA 2) to solve DTCTP.
