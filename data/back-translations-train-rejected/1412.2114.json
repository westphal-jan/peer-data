One of the earliest problems is to find the path of the pursuer who is following an evasive who is moving in a circle at constant speed. A condition is that the pursuer is also moving at constant speed, with his speed vector pointing to the position of the evasive. Unfortunately, this problem cannot be solved analytically. Another area is called \"discrete search games\" [3], where a pursuer is also circular (Fig.1). Interest in these problems has grown in different directions. One area is a combination with game theory, which leads to a field called \"differential game theory\" [2]. Another area is called \"discrete search games\" [3], where a pursuer is looking for an evasive who is hiding behind one of the discrete number of locations."}, {"heading": "2 DESIGN OF ALGORITHM", "text": "Against the background of the general design concepts described in the previous section, we would like to describe one of our algorithms here. First, we will prepare two states, one is the tracker, the other is the tax evader. Then, we will change these two states according to the following rules. The tax evader updates his state so that the cost function is reduced. Typically, this is done by randomly selecting a local part of the state and changing it when the new state has the lower cost, but does not change it otherwise. Thus, the tax evader's updating rule aims to minimize the cost function. However, the tracker does not take into account the cost function and updates its state, so that he becomes \"closer\" to the state of the tax evader in some way in the state. Thus, the tracker has the possibility to update a state that has higher cost. We will add two more rules. The first is the change of the roles."}, {"heading": "3 APPLICATION TO TRAVELING SALESM", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "AN PROBLEM", "text": "Here we give a concrete example of our algorithm, which is applied to a \"Traveling Salesman problem,\" which is a representative combinatorial optimization problem. There are N cities on a two-dimensional map. The problem requires finding the shortest way to visit all cities, each of them only once. Although seemingly simple, this problem is one of the most difficult combinatorial optimization problems. If we name the cities by integers (1, 2, 3,... N), then its permutation represents a path with associated distance, which we identify as \"cost.\" The task is to find the optimal state of N! permutations. Let's describe our algorithm. We create two initial states and designate one with the shorter path as an evader and the other as a chaser. Then we randomly select two cities for the evader and exchange them in its permutation. If this exchange produces the state with the shorter path, we update the new state with the new state."}, {"heading": "4 SIMULATION RESULTS", "text": "We have tested our algorithm on the 52 cities Traveling Salesman problem available on the web [6] with a known shortest path of approximately 7,544 (Figure 3).Of 52! ~ 8 \u00d7 1067 permutations, we have set our parameters to be random at most (A) 8 x 107 and (B) 6 x 108 permutations. The parameter for the adjacent search is R = 3. We have shown a representative example as a result of our algorithm (Figure 4).We repeated our attempts 100 times to obtain the average path length (Ave. path) and standard deviation (SDV).We compare the result (C and E) with the steepest descent with the adjacent search algorithm (Simple), which takes a comparable time (sec) on the same computer. The result is summarized in Tables 1 and 2."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSION", "text": "First, although the improvement in the Traveling Salesman problem has been modest, there are signs that car chases and escape mechanisms can be helpful. Second, it is easy to create this algorithm in parallel. For example, we can change the algorithm so that there is a single escapee and multiple pursuers. It is interesting to see how such an extension can show improvements over simple parallelizations without chases and escapes. The author thanks Profs.
