ANN's are at the forefront of computational systems designed to generate or mimic intelligent behavior. Unlike traditional artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which aim to directly mimic rational and logical thinking, ANN's are designed to reproduce the causal processing mechanisms that give intelligence results as a developmental characteristic of complex systems. ANN systems are designed for areas such as capacity planning, business intelligence, pattern recognition, robotics. In computer science and technology, ANN techniques have gained a lot of ground and are widely applied in areas such as prediction, data analysis, and even data mining. The science of raw data investigation with the aim of deriving workable conclusions can easily be defined as data analysis, describing new data sets on the other side of the data mining process."}, {"heading": "3 Model Process", "text": "In this section, we present the entire process of modeling. - The implementation of the ANN model in Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, Spain, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, France, France, USA, USA, USA, USA, Spain, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, Turkey, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, Spain, Spain, USA, USA, USA, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, USA, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain"}, {"heading": "4 Performance Evaluation", "text": "The forecasting model was simulated to obtain results of energy consumption in Gaza in 2012 and 2013.
