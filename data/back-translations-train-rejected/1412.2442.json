Throughout human civilization, philosophers and scientists have been able to answer - or at least speculate on - many basic questions, such as: Where did life come from? What is the age of the universe? How did it all start? And many others. However, one question has long puzzled humans: Language. They say language is the most important evolutionary contribution of humans to the cosmos and perhaps the most interesting feature that has emerged in the last 500 million years (Nowak et al. 2002). How did it all begin? Was language genetically inherited from other species? Do we even share language with other species? And how is language constructed from its basic building blocks? All of these questions can be answered if we define language rigorously."}, {"heading": "Language and Universal Grammar", "text": "A language is a set of sentences; a sentence is a string; and an alphabet is a finite set of symbols. Some languages are finite and some are not. There are infinite finite languages, as many as whole numbers. There are also infinite languages, as many as real numbers. Therefore, the set of all languages is not countable (Nowak et al. 2002). A grammar is a finite set of rules that specify a language. Natural languages are infinite. However, learning theory and common sense suggest that no algorithm can learn a set of languages (Nowak et al. 2002). Authors can at y-kaadan @ hotmail.com and asaad.kaadan @ ou.edu each have a \"superfinite\" language (Nowak et al. 2002), i.e. one that contains all finite languages and at least an infinite environment."}, {"heading": "Historical Perspective", "text": "It is worth noting that the ads do not express the full capabilities of people in their early stages, such as having a whole set of letters to represent them."}, {"heading": "Universal Grammar is Unique", "text": "Most living beings strive for immortality. At the cellular level, impregnation is considered a process of communication in which knowledge or information, DNA and RNA stored in chromosomes are exchanged. This biological language has only a four-letter alphabet and is capable of generating all complex life forms. We believe that language is a process of communication in which knowledge or information, DNA and RNA stored in chromosomes are exchanged. This biological language has only a four-letter alphabet and is capable of generating all complex life forms. Since language is a process of communication, basic rules governing language apply, these rules are what defines universal grammar (UG). Methods of communication in nature range from chemical compounds in insects to air vibrations (sounds) and signals in human beings. The process of communication is independent of the principles that we understand as the Medium (UG)."}, {"heading": "From Communication to Universal Grammar", "text": "Nouns are the most important parts of the language, and usually the naming process is non-descriptive, i.e. we use any code or idiom to name a particular object. That's what we do most of the time when we name our children, we use arbitrary names. Also, when we transfer a word from one language to another, we also use arbitrary names, and the transferred word becomes an idiom. Nevertheless, a language is exhausted with all idiomatic nouns. Man will have to memorize an extensive dictionary when that language is a little rich and intelligible. As the main purpose of any language is to facilitate simple and precise communication, the easier way is to give each object a descriptive name, i.e. to define that object from a short list of known, already defined objects; just as we do in numerical systems."}, {"heading": "Basic Definitions", "text": "In fact, it is such that most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to dance, to dance, to dance, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to dance, to dance, to dance, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to dance, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to go, to go, to move, to move, to move, to go, to move, to go, to move, to move, to go, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to go, to move, to move, to move, to go, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to go, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to go, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move,"}, {"heading": "Universal Grammar is Cosmic", "text": "In fact, most of them are not in a position to assert themselves, but in a position to trump themselves.

The following examples explain the composition process in detail: If (x 1 y) was the brother of y and (y is the mother of z), then (x is the uncle of z) is (x z), where 1 2; we read \"1 composition 2.\" If (x is the mother of y) was (x is the brother of z) was (y is the mother of z), then (x is the mother of z) is (x z), where 2 1 1; we read \"2 is the composition of y.\""}, {"heading": "General Structure of Linguistic Expressions", "text": "We are now ready to study the general structure of any linguistic expression.

We say language is a set of formulas and not the set of all formulas; because mathematically speaking we do not have a set of all sentences (or formulas).No matter how many formulas are contained in a sentence, we can always find other formulas that are not contained in it (note the agreement with our previous language definition.) Since language is used to convey knowledge, i.e. to formulate this knowledge in a formulation fully understood by the listener, we can describe it with a formulation principle. If we find the formula with its components 1, 2,..., then we get the general expression for the formulation principle, i.e. the general expression for the listener, which is the structure for (formerly) (1): (formerly):"}, {"heading": "Communication States and the Alphabet", "text": "The formula that defines an element is both the speaker and the listener, i.e. each of them can identify only the form, or only the attributes, or both forms and attributes of that element. They could also misdefine the form and attributes of each element. This definition is relative because there is an unlimited number of components for each element and an unlimited number of relationships between them."}, {"heading": "UG-compatible Natural Languages", "text": "The important question would be whether there really are formal natural languages or not, we believe that some or many natural languages should be at least approximately formal, since nature always strives for optimality. A formal natural language is the optimal solution for communication and hundreds of thousands of years of Homo Sapiens theory. The 32 digital codes in communication philosophy are what we call the digital alphabet. It is fascinating whether this digital alphabet is applied partially or fully to existing natural alphabets."}, {"heading": "Results and Examples", "text": "It also applies to Arabic formulations written with multiple letters, which are the subject.

Instead of researching the human brain, natural languages, genetics, history and psychology for a UG, we decided to go another way and look for the basic logic behind an UG and a language that is communication and knowledge transfer. We developed a theory for communication and knowledge dissemination through language. This theory offers a rigorous mathematical definition of UG that coincides well with many other great theories in physics, astronomy, philosophy, mathematical logic and informatics. Thus, we were able to fully analyze, decipher and understand every language governed by this unique UG. After formulating our UG and what we call the digital alphabet, we set out to search for the possibility of any natural language that meets our UG requirements. By a stroke of luck, our first study with Arabic was so far positive."}], "references": [{"title": "Aspects of the Theory of Syntax Cambridge, MA: MIT Press", "author": ["Chomsky", "Noam."], "venue": "Daniels, Peter T. 2013.
