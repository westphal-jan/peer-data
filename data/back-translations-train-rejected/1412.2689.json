Approach by programmed instruction", "text": "One approach to applying the learning hierarchy in real educational environments is to arrange the contents in small steps or information frames. These steps lead the learner in a carefully ordered sequence from the simple to the complex, and most importantly, the learner has to give an answer at each step, i.e. write or select an answer. This is called programmed instruction (Skinner, 1986; Molenda, 2008) and, in its simplest form, called linear programming, is a linear graph made up of a series of frames, each frame on the left being a prerequisite for the frames on the right. However, this view of programmed teaching had an important flaw: all students, regardless of their suitability or knowledge of the subject, had to go through the same frames and there were no remedies."}, {"heading": "2. Approach by Branching Programming", "text": "The development of branching or intrinsic programming is a technique that enabled learners to skip www.ijera.com 59 | P a g eahead through material that was easy for them, or to branch out into remedial frameworks when they had difficulties (Crowder, 1962; Roe, 1962; Molenda, 2008).The ultimate goal of branching out programming is to take into account the individual differences of learners in subject knowledge and other skills that the learner has (Roe, 1962), and provide personalized learning paths. As with linear programming, the frameworks of branching out programming, including remedial frames, must be designed a priori. This proved to be a very difficult task and led to the design of very complex branched out programming diagrams and procedures such as: branching backwards into forgotten elements, branching into branched elements, branching out into branching elements, backwards into branching elements, retroactively retroactively retroactively retroactively retroactively retroactively retroactively reviewing whole elements, retroactively retroactively retroactively retroactively retroactively retroactively reviewing elements."}, {"heading": "3. Approach by Fuzzy logic", "text": "Multiple learning systems build their learning hierarchies by using a number of different methods of Fuzzy Logic (Al-Sarem et al, 2010 and Chu et al., 2010 and Chen and Bai, 2008). Sue et al., 2010, used a two-phase method that extracts the rules of association between skills by applying Fuzzy Logic to transform learners into three levels of difficulty and construct a learning hierarchy. Bai and Chen, 2010, simplified and improved the latter method in an adaptive way. These methods view the notes acquired by learners during process learning as a blurred notion, but do not take into account the possibility of using a learning hierarchy predefined by one or more experts in a particular field. Before introducing our approach, the following section describes some concepts of Fuzzy Logic that we will use later in this paper."}, {"heading": "III. FUZZY SETS THEORY (FST)", "text": "Since 1965, fuzzy sets theory has evolved in many ways and in many disciplines. Fuzzy sets were introduced by Zadeh to mathematically represent the blur of certain object classes and to form the basis for fuzzy logic. Fuzzy sets were introduced to model the representation of human knowledge, improving the performance of systems using this modeling decision. Fuzzy sets allow gradations like all tones between black and white. A fuzzy set has a graphical description that expresses how the transition from one to another takes place. This graphical description is called a membership function. A fuzzy part (or fuzzy set) of a set E is an application \u00b5A (x): E [0, 1]:"}, {"heading": "IV. OUR PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "In our approach, we describe a new approach to the practical application of fuzzy logic techniques to the construction of learning hierarchies. For this purpose, we use a learning hierarchy predefined by one or more experts in a particular field. However, the relationships of the prerequisites between the skills in the learning hierarchy are not final and they are fuzzy relationships. In fact, we are trying to answer - using fuzzy logics - the following question: Are the relationships of the prerequisites in the initial learning hierarchy correctly defined or not? To answer this question, we follow the following phases: The first phase determines a predefined learning hierarchy, the second phase measures the variation of the learning grades, the next phase transforms the data by the fusion technique, then the next phase mines the association rules between the skills. In the last two phases, we propose to build the final learning hierarchy."}, {"heading": "1.

The skills in the hierarchy have an orderly relationship to each other and the hierarchy as a whole is in some way related to a plan for effective teaching. In the end, we have an initial learning hierarchy, as shown in the following figure: Figure 2 shows an example of a learning hierarchy of a course containing 10 relevant skills, and conditions for relationships with each other. From the links of the learning hierarchy, we define an initial learning hierarchy as shown in the figure below: Figure 2 shows an example of a learning hierarchy of a course containing 10 relevant skills, and conditions for relationships among each other."}, {"heading": "2.
