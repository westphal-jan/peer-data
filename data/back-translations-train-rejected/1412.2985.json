A more refined definition is then considered, which takes into account issues of normality and typicality, which are well known to affect causal ascriptions. Causality is typically an all-or-nothing notion: either A is a cause of B or it is not. An extension of the definition of causality to capture notions of degree of responsibility and degree of blame, due to Chockler and Halpern, is reviewed. For example, if someone wins an election 11-0, then each person who votes for him is less responsible for the victory than if he had won 6-5. Degree of blame takes into account an agent's epistemic state. Roughly speaking, the degree of blame of A for B is the expected degree of responsibility of A for B, taken over the epistemic state of an agent. Finally, the structural-equations definition of causality is compared to Wright's NESS test.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Dec 2014 14:58:58 GMT  (57kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2985v1", "To appear, Law, Probability, and Risk"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear, Law, Probability, and Risk", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["joseph y halpern"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.2985"}, "pdf": {"name": "1412.2985.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Structural-Model Approach", "authors": ["Joseph Y.

Once we have a probability on contexts and causal models, we can talk about the probability of causality and the expected degree of responsibility. The latter notion is referred to as (degree of) guilt by Chockler and Halpern [2004]. Obviously, if we add the probability to the picture, we must ask ourselves where the probability comes from. In some cases, it could be objective; that is, it could come from a source with an agreed probability, such as a coin flip. Or we can have statistical information that determines the probability.

Perhaps the best-developed approach does indeed seem to take the NESS approach as unnecessary, since it does not provide a mathematical formalization of the NESS test; what I am giving here is my understanding that it was elaborated in much more detail by Wright [1985, 1988, 2001]. So I compare the HP approach to the NESS approach. Wright does not provide a mathematical formalization of the NESS test; what I am saying is a cause for the NESS test when there are a number of causes, the S = {A1, Ak} of events, each of which actually occurred, where A = A1, S is sufficient for B, and S \u2212 {A1} is not sufficient for B."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "Perhaps the central point of HP's definition is that causality is relative to a model, which allows us to adjust the model accordingly. Suppose a drunk 18-year-old is killed in a traffic accident with a single vehicle. Many people may focus on drunkenness as the cause of an accident. We all know that you shouldn't drink and drive, but a road engineer may want to focus on the too sharp curve on the road, a politician may want to focus on the fact that the law allows 18-year-olds to drink, and a psychologist may want to focus on the recent separation of youth from his girlfriend. 13 To the extent that causality attributions are intended as a guide to future behavior - we attribute causes so we know what to do and not to do next - it is perfectly reasonable for different communities to focus on different aspects of a situation. Drink and don't drive; don't build roads with sharp curves; don't allow 18-year-olds to drink; and don't drive after you've broken it with your girlfriend, it may all be useful."}], "references": [{"title": "Culpable causation", "author": ["M.

However, if the doctor had no idea that the treatment had adverse side effects for people with high blood pressure, he should perhaps not be held to blame for the death. Actually, in legal arguments, it may not be so relevant what the doctor actually did or did not know, but what he should have known. Thus, rather than considering the doctor\u2019s actual epistemic state, it may be more important to consider what his epistemic state should have been.
