APPROACH OF DOMAIN MODEL BASED ON FUZZY PREREQUISITE RELATIONSHIP", "text": "In this approach, we use a domain model (learning hierarchy) that has been predefined by one or more experts in a particular field. In the first phase, we determine an initially predefined domain model, in the second phase, we measure the variation in the learning notes, then we transform the data using the fusion technique, in the next phase, we elaborate the rules of association between the concepts. In the last two phases, we propose to create the final model."}, {"heading": "IV.
