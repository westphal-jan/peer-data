An invention should be at an adequate distance beyond its prior art in order to be patented. Fulfilling a minimum measurement limit would enable a patent applicant to have its invention patented. Based on this fact, we proposed a method for nonobviousness analysis of a patent over its prior arts, based on highest court\u2019s precedents, called the FSTP Test [1] [2].", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}}
