In these disciplines, the rules often appear under different names (e.g., attribute implications, functional dependencies, or e-mail: jan.triska @ upol.cz, telephone: + 420 585 715, fax: + 420 585 411 643 \"rules\") with semantics defined in different structures (e.g., transactive data, Boolean matrices, or n-ary relationships), but, as shown in [21], the rules can be regarded as propositional formulas semantic deciphering defined in propositional logic, possibly extended by additional measures of meaningfulness."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "In database systems and knowledge engineering, isolated approaches appear that suggest a temporal semantics of the if-then-rules. Here, we present a brief overview of the approaches and highlight the differences between our approaches and the existing ones.Formulas called temporal functional dependencies originated in databases with time granularities [7]. In this approach, a temporal granularity is a general division of time such as seconds, weeks, years, etc., and a temporal granularity is associated with each relational schema. Furthermore, each tuple is related to a part (so-called granulum) of granularity. In this setting, temporal functional dependencies such as the ordinary dependencies are like the ordinary functional dependencies on dependencies."}, {"heading": "3 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section we present the basic concepts of closure systems (also known as Moore families) and closure operators, which are further used in the essay. Further details can be found in [8, 18]. If Y is a quantity, we use 2Y to denote its range of performance. A closure operator on Y is a card c: 2Y \u2192 2Y as A c (A), (3) A B implies c (A) c (B), (4) c (A) c (A), (A), (5) for all A, B Y. Conditions (3) - (5) are referred to as extensivity, monotony and idempotence of c or. Note that (3) and (5) c (A) for all A (A), (A) for all A Y. A closure operator c: 2Y \u2192 2Y is always referred to as an algebraic closure when the closure system is closed."}, {"heading": "4 Formulas, Models, and Semantic Entailment", "text": "In this section, we present a formalization of the formulas whose interpretation and semantic entities we conceive each as \"A.\" We assume that Y is a non-empty and finite series of symbols that are regarded as attributes in time. (7) In addition, we use integers to designate points in time. (7) We can now formalize rules such as (1) as follows: Definition 1) An attribute implication of Y annotated by points in time in Z is a formula of the form A, B are finite subsets of TY. As we outlined in the introduction, the purpose is encoded of points in time that appear in antecedents and consequent formulas."}, {"heading": "5 Deduction Systems and Complete Axiomatizations", "text": "In this section, we present a derivative system for our formulas and a related concept of probative force that represents the syntactical dissociation of formulas (A). (A) The probative force is based on an extension of the Armstrong system [3], which is mainly known in database systems [42]. (A) The extension we propose takes into account the fact that points in time in formulas are relative. (A) The deductive system we use consists of the following derivative rules. (A) The following derivative rules are introduced: (A) derivative rules are derivative rules from A) A) B (B) and B (C) derivative rules. (Shf) D) from A (B) derivative rules."}, {"heading": "6 Computational Issues", "text": "In this section, we will show the limitations of the computational complexity of deciding whether an attribute implication over attributes commented by points in time is provable by a finite set of other attribute implications. Then, we will focus on a sub-problem that typically occurs in applications. For the sub-problem, we will provide a pseudo-polynomial problem that is a finite time [27] decision algorithm. We formalize the decision problem of deciphering as the language of deciphering finite many formulas, i.e., we putLENT = {< B > is a finite theory and a finite solution."}, {"heading": "20 end", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "21 end", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "22 end", "text": "There is a subset of clues that are justified by the following observation: \"Theorem,\" \"Theorem,\" \"Theorem,\" \"Theorem,\" \"Theorem,\" \"Theorem\" and \"A.\" The arguments are completely analogous to those of classical LinClosure, so here we present comments on topics that are annotated only in the context of attributes. Technical details can be found in [6]."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "Logic expands the classical logic for dealing with if-then-rules by taking discrete points of time as an additional component. We have investigated both the semantic entanglement, which is based on maintaining validity in models at all points of time, and the syntactical entanglement, which is represented by a relation of evidence. We have shown a characterization of semantic entanglement, which is based on the fewest models and the syntactic-semantic completeness of logic. We have shown that the problem of entanglement is NP-hard, can be decided in exponential space, and its simplified variant, which includes only predictable formulas that can be deciphered in pseudo-linear time."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "Supported by the scholarship no.
