Therefore, we only change the medium through which the \"entertainment\" takes place by replacing the computer terminal with a \"thing\" (e.g. an electric kettle (Figure 2).To add the I / O capabilities, we add a remote on / off control (which controls the on / off switch) to the kettle (similar to the keyboard in Thear Xiv: 141 2.38 02v1 [cs.

It could be suggested that the original interface (e.g. on / off switch) could be used for binary encryption of a text conversation. Another option is to add an interface for a text conversation. However, even if the interface allows the textual conversation, other related challenges remain unanswered: Would the device be mathematically able to conduct an intelligent conversation (Section III-B), and is the conversation the appropriate method to evaluate the intelligence of a device (Section III-D). The answer to these questions could dictate the shape of the interface. Our proposal is to leave the interface as it is: 3 I: Tag1: 8: 00: T: Day1 Day: 12: 00: Day 2: Day 2 Day 2: 2 Day 2: 2 Day 2: 2 Day 2: 2 Day 2: 2 Day 2: 2: 3: 2."}, {"heading": "B.

Evaluation Criteria", "text": "Turing test evaluates conversation intelligence. However, it is not clear whether this criterion makes sense in another context; for example, is it appropriate to measure how \"intelligent\" a kettle is by having a conversation with it; what if it speaks well but does not perform well as a kettle (begins to think about the meaning of life for an hour while deciding whether to boil the water)? On the other hand, the focus on assessing the operational performance of humans and computers does not necessarily reflect how \"intelligent\" the 4 thing is. Below, we suggest some of the approaches that could be used (in combination or independently). 1) Interaction intelligence: To overcome some of the operational speed capabilities of humans and computers (Section III-C), we can evaluate intelligence through a form of dialogue. However, the dialogue is not textual, but operational (Figure 4). Both the questioner and the participants can simulate the time stamps to control the flow of time."}, {"heading": "E. Multiple Participants", "text": "Turning Test requires interaction with a single participant at a given time (be it a human or a computer). Internet of Things assumes, as the name suggests, that several units are involved, so the challenge is to apply Turing Test to several participants. Assuming that several participants raise more questions about the evaluation: \u2022 collective / distributed intelligence \u2022 mixed groups - different devices - different types of units (people & non-people) \u2022 multiple assessment instances \u2022 many - many or many (e.g. one - many: one person who controls several things) \u2022 participating versus non-participating units (in judging) Naive approach would be to simply apply the one-sided version of the test to multiple objects and aggregate the results. More interesting approaches could be achieved by being a bit creative, e.g. mixing human-controlled things with computer-controlled etc."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "It has been more than 50 years since the Turing Test was proposed to evaluate artificial intelligence. TT has stood the test of time very well and is still by far the most widely used way of evaluating artificial intelligence. However, new attitudes, especially the Internet of Things, pose a challenge to the traditional definition of the Turing Test (Section III). We show that the Turing Test could be adapted to these new attitudes with some modifications (Section IV)."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "This research is being carried out in conjunction with the ThingTank project [3], which is part of the Ideas Lab MIT-Skoltech initiative."}], "references": [{"title": "Artificial Intelligence: A Philosophical Introduction", "author": ["J.
