In particular, it is quite easy to redefine a revision operator on the basis of qualitative algebra (QA, like the Allen algebra) by reusing the work of (Condotta et al. 2010) on the related problem of faith fusion. The result of such a faith revision is a set of faith foundations that must be interpreted disjunctively and that are not necessarily depicted as a single basis of faith: QAs do not come under disjunction.This gives an initial motivation for the study of faith revision in the foreseeable conclusion of a QA."}, {"heading": "Preliminaries", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Qualitative algebras", "text": "The question that arises is whether the question of the meaning of knowledge can play a role at all in our examples, whether the question of the relationship between the relations between time and time is asked (Allen 1983). A formula of Allen algebra can be regarded as a combination of constraints, in which an expression of the relation between time and time (Allen 1983) is used. A formula of Allen algebra can be regarded as a combination of constraints, in which an expression of the form x r y is used in which the intervals are related."}, {"heading": "Belief change", "text": "Belief in a change of faith is an operation of faith change (after the names of the authors of Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors and Makinson 1985), but the resulting series of beliefs is noted by the agent and depends on the choice of a revision operator. In (Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors and Makinson 1985) the principle of minimal change is formulated as follows: \"The principle of minimal change is minimally changed, so that the linkage of the two beliefs is consistent, and the result of the revision is this constellation. Hence, there is more than one possible operator, since the definition of the change of faith depends on how\" is measured. \"More precisely, the minimal principle of change has been formalized by a series of postulates known as the AGM postulates (after the names of the authors of Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors and Makinson)."}, {"heading": "An algorithm for computing \u2214d in L\u0302QA", "text": "The principle of the algorithm is based on the following proposition.Proposition 3 (Revision of disjunctions): Let it be two formulas of L-QA and {\u0445i} i and {\u00b5j} j about two finite families of L-QA, so that the two formulas for each i and j are such that they are the same for each i and j, that they are the same for each i, j, d, ij, d, ij. Furthermore, the algorithm for L-QA roughly consists in applying the formulas E and E in DNF-w / oN and then applying Proposition 3 to them, using the L-QA algorithm for the calculation of L-QA.

Then, proposal 3, which reduces a revision of disjunctions to a disjunction of the cheapest revisions, is applied. REVISOR / PCQA is an implementation of this revision operator for the Allen algebra, INDU and RCC8.A first direction of research following a disjunction of the cheapest revisions.
