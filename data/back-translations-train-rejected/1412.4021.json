Our approach is based on an incremental knowledge acquisition methodology where rules are stored in an exception-structure and new rules are only added to correct errors of existing rules; thus allowing systematic control of the interaction between rules. Experiments on 13 languages exhibit that our method is fast in terms of training time and tagging speed. Furthermore, our method is able to attain state-of-the-art accuracies for relatively isolating or analytic languages whilst reaching competitive accuracy results on morphologically rich Indo-European languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 Dec 2014 15:26:43 GMT  (220kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4021v1", "13 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables.

SCRDR methodology", "text": "A SCRDR tree [15, 49, 57] is a binary tree with two different types of edges. These edges are typically called \"except\" and \"if-not edges.\" Associated with each node in the tree is a rule. A rule has the form: if \u03b1 is then called \"exception\" (exception) and \u03b2 is called the conclusion (exception rule). Cases in SCRDR are evaluated by passing a case to the root of the tree. At each node in the tree, the case \"exception\" is met (exception rule) (exception rule) (exception rule) (exception node of the node is evaluated using the exception rule if it exists. Otherwise, the case is passed to the non-child node of the system. The completion of this process is given by the node that is the last to be triggered."}, {"heading": "3. Our approach", "text": "In this section, we present a new error-driven approach to automatically construct a SCRDR tree of transformation rules for POS tagging. (The learning process in our approach is illustrated in Figure 2. The initialized tag is generated by using an initial tag to perform POS tagging on the raw body, which consists of the raw text extracted from the most commonly associated tag in the gold standard corpus, without using POS tags.) In addition, the initial tag uses a lexicon to assign a suffix to each word. The lexicon is constructed from the gold standard corpus, where each word type is coupled with its most frequently associated tag in the gold standard corpus. In addition, the character 2, 4, and 5 gram suffixes of the word types are also included in the lexicon. Each suffix is coupled with the most commonly associated word types in this suffix, the one of which is included."}, {"heading": "4.

Related work", "text": "From the early session onwards, the rules-based eyeglass wearer [10] approaches most known ones. [10] The key idea of the Brill Method is to compare a manually annotated gold standard corpus with an initialized corpus generated by executing an initial uncommented corpus. Based on the predefined rule templates, the method then automatically produces a list of concrete rules that are misplaced. For example, the \"Transferring the current word from A to B\" template can produce concrete rules, such as transferring the current word from JJ to NN when the next word is misplaced."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion and future work", "text": "In this paper, we propose a new error-driven method for automatically constructing a Single Classification Ripple Down Rules tree of transformation rules for POS and morphological marking. Our method allows for interaction between rules where one rule only changes the results of a limited number of other rules. Experimental evaluations for POS marking and combined POS marking and morphological marking in 13 languages show that our method achieves very promising accuracy results. Furthermore, we successfully achieve fast training and marking processes for all experimental languages. This could help to significantly reduce the time and effort required for machine learning tasks on big data by using POS and morphological information as learning traits. An important point is that our approach is suitable for involving domain experts to add new exemptions in the face of specific cases that are misclassified by the tree model. This is particularly important for undermedium languages where obtaining a large corus is difficult."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research is supported in part by the research project \"VNU-SMM: An automated system for monitoring online social media to assist management and support decision making in business, politics, education, and social areas\" of Vietnam National University, Hanoi.

Experimental results on 13 languages show that our approach is fast in terms of training time and tagging speed. Furthermore, our approach obtains very competitive accuracy in comparison to state-ofthe-art POS and morphological taggers.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
