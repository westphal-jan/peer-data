BACKGROUND", "text": "The BN B could be defined by (G, {PX1,, PXn}) that G = (X, E) is an acyclically directed graph. Each Xi is associated with a probabilistic variable and PX1, PXn is the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of the graph nodes. CPDs could be defined as: PXi (Xi | Pag (Xi)) that Pag (Xi) indicates the parents of Xi. In a BN, the common probability distribution is defined as Equation 1 [12]. PB (X1,..., Xn) = \u0441n i = 1PXi (Xi | Pag (Xi)) (1) A vivid example of a BN is shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "IV. PROPOSED METHOD", "text": "The BN contains useful information and relationships between nodes, but it suffers from complexity resulting from the complete relationships between all nodes. The BN contains a lot of information, but most of them could not be used, because in BN all events are presented with different probabilities, but most of the time we look for the most likely events. In these networks we find the chains with higher probabilities, which could be useful for experts or classifications. In this article we will identify effective chain rules, which could be helpful to understand the events and predict the future events. For example, in the medical field, this knowledge could help the physician to predict the future events caused by present symptoms and by knowing the rules to prevent the fatal disease in the meantime. Finding the optimal chain rules in BN is a NP complete problem, so we use genetic algorithms to find these chain rules. To achieve this goal, we first extract rules from the BN with genetic algorithms and then we extract the rules by extracting the N."}, {"heading": "A. Genetic Algorithm", "text": "The proposed genetic algorithm is based on [2]. This algorithm has two parts with different mutations and crossovers, structural and local. The structural crossover method is applied and only the rules are exchanged between the chromosomes. The genetic algorithm starts with the initialization of the population. Then, the fitness of the chromosomes could be calculated and the parental chromosomes are selected based on the tournament selection method. Children are generated by crossover and mutation to the parental chromosomes. The surviving population is selected by the best children and parents. Finally, a part of the best of the population is sent to the next generation to improve the local search methods and the improved population. In this part, we will introduce the steps of the genetic algorithms used."}, {"heading": "B. Generating Graphical Chains", "text": "Each rule specifies that different nodes affect the target node with which states. To extract the chain, we use the unification of all rule sets in the chromosome. For each effective node, we add an edge with specified labels from that node to its child in the path of that node to the target node (equivalent to BN). Therefore, each rule specifies some effectively labeled edges and their unification is a set of effective chain rules in the BN. The pseudo-code of the Creating Algorithm 2 Local Search INPUT: Population, GenMaxLocal OUTPUT: modified population Genlocal 1, while Genlocal is lower than not fulfilled, GenMaxLocal do a local crossing on parent for each parent in the population and generate child Local mutation on child, if Fitness (Child) > Fitness (Parent) then replace child with Parent, if End Genlocal is + 1end, if Genlocal is subordinated to each parent in the GenLocal group."}, {"heading": "V. EXAMPLE", "text": "In order to better understand the proposed method, we will describe the various steps of the proposed method on a sample network. Asia BN was selected for this purpose. Asia BN, which was generated from real medical data [18]. This network contains 8 nodes, which are described in Table I. We apply the genetic step of the proposed method to this network and extract the rules for the effective nodes on the dyspnea (target node) with higher probabilities. Some of these rules are illustrated in Table II. The result of the extraction of effective chains is in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 4, the path (Asia (no), the tub (yes), either (no), then dyspnea (yes))) shows that being non-Asian and not having tuberculosis is not likely to cause either tuberculosis or lung cancer (Asia (no), no tuberculosis (Asia (no), no chispnoe (yes), then dyspnea)."}, {"heading": "VI. EVALUATION", "text": "There is not enough knowledge of adequate rules, we use Asia, Cancer, Earthquake, Sachs and Survey Networks [18]. These networks are small enough that we could analyze them with Brute Force Method. Table IIIn the Brute Force Method, the rules are generated with all possible values. on the other hand, the rules are generated from all subsets of nodes and the application of this method is possible for small networks. To eliminate the inadequate rules from the entire extracted rules, we choose the rules that P (B) is greater than the specified threshold. The following table shows the average probability of the rules for the proposed method and the Brute Force Method. For the Brute Force Method, we use the threshold of 0.7. As shown in Table IV, the proposed method works better than Brute Force (except survey) in most cases, which means that we could extract the optimal rules for the proposed method and the Brute Force Method. Note that for this survey, we use only 0.7 of the threshold, but for this survey we have a weakness."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we propose a new method based on genetic algorithms to extract graphical chain rules, which due to their complexity cannot be extracted directly from the BN. These rules could be useful to analyze the effects of various factors on the disease and help experts to explore more focused factors, as well as to predict the future events caused by the current situation and symptoms. Evaluated results show that the proposed method works in the same way as brute force in small networks. Therefore, this proposed method could also be used for large networks, as it does not suffer from the high complexity of calculating other methods."}], "references": [{"title": "Fuzzy rules extraction from support vector machines for multi-class classification", "author": ["F Chaves Adriana da Costa", "Marley Maria BR Vellasco", "Ricardo Tanscheit"], "venue": "Neural Computing and Applications,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2013}, {"title": "An evolutionary memetic algorithm for rule extraction", "author": ["Ji Hua Ang", "KC Tan", "AA Mamun"], "venue": "Expert Systems with Applications,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Eclectic rule-extraction from support vector machines", "author": ["Nahla Barakat", "Joachim Diederich"], "venue": "International Journal of Computational Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2005}, {"title": "A probability estimation based strategy to optimize the classification rule set extracted from bayesian network classifiers", "author": ["Glaucia M Bressan", "Vilma A Oliveira", "ERJ Hruschka", "Maria C Nicoletti"], "venue": "VIII Simpo\u0301sio Brasileiro de Automac\u0327ao Inteligente,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Biomass based weed-crop competitiveness classification using bayesian networks", "author": ["Glaucia M Bressan", "Vilma A Oliveira", "Estevan R Hruschka", "Maria C Nicoletti"], "venue": "In Intelligent Systems Design and Applications,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Using bayesian networks with rule extraction to infer the risk of weed infestation in a corn-crop", "author": ["Gl\u00e1ucia M Bressan", "Vilma A Oliveira", "Estevam R Hruschka Jr.", "Maria C Nicoletti"], "venue": "Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Bayesian network models for environmental flow decision making in the daly river, northern territory, australia", "author": ["Terence U Chan", "Barry T Hart", "Mark J Kennard", "Bradley J Pusey", "Will Shenton", "Michael M Douglas", "Eric Valentine", "Sandeep Patel"], "venue": "River Research and Applications,", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Extracting rules from neural networks as decision diagrams", "author": ["Jan Chorowski", "Jacek M Zurada"], "venue": "Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on,", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Orthogonal search-based rule extraction (osre) for trained neural networks: a practical and efficient approach", "author": ["Terence A Etchells", "Paulo JG Lisboa"], "venue": "Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on,", "citeRegEx": "9", "shortCiteRegEx": "9", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Creating rules from trained neural networks using genetic algorithms", "author": ["Ed Keedwell", "Ajit Narayanan", "D Savic"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "10", "shortCiteRegEx": "10", "year": 2000}, {"title": "Wrappers for feature subset selection", "author": ["Ron Kohavi", "George H John"], "venue": "Artificial intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "11", "shortCiteRegEx": "11", "year": 1997}, {"title": "Probabilistic graphical models: principles and techniques", "author": ["Daphne Koller", "Nir Friedman"], "venue": "MIT press,", "citeRegEx": "12", "shortCiteRegEx": "12", "year": 2009}, {"title": "A search technique for rule extraction from trained neural networks", "author": ["R Krishnan", "G Sivakumar", "P Bhattacharya"], "venue": "Pattern Recognition Letters,", "citeRegEx": "13", "shortCiteRegEx": "13", "year": 1999}, {"title": "Rules extraction from constructively trained neural networks based on genetic", "author": ["Marghny H Mohamed"], "venue": "algorithms.
