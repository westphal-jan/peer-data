We focus in this paper on the ontological query answering problem, which consists of querying data while taking ontological knowledge into account. More specifically, we establish complexities of the conjunctive query entailment problem for classes of existential rules (also called tuple-generating dependencies, Datalog+/- rules, or forall-exists-rules. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce the class of greedy bounded-treewidth sets (gbts) of rules, which covers guarded rules, and their most well-known generalizations. We provide a generic algorithm for query entailment under gbts, which is worst-case optimal for combined complexity with or without bounded predicate arity, as well as for data complexity and query complexity. Secondly, we classify several gbts classes, whose complexity was unknown, with respect to combined complexity (with both unbounded and bounded predicate arity) and data complexity to obtain a comprehensive picture of the complexity of existential rule fragments that are based on diverse guardedness notions. Upper bounds are provided by showing that the proposed algorithm is optimal for all of them.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Dec 2014 07:46:19 GMT  (615kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4485v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["sebastian rudolph", "micha\\\"el thomazo", "jean-fran\\c{c}ois baget", "marie-laure mugnier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.4485"}, "pdf": {"name": "1412.4485.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Query Answering for Greedy Sets of Existential Rules Worst-case Optimal Query Answering for Greedy Sets of Existential Rules and Their Subclasses", "authors": ["Sebastian Rudolph", "Micha\u00ebl Thomazo", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Baget"], "emails": ["sebastian.rudolph@tu-dresden.de", "michael.thomazo@tu-dresden.de", "baget@lirmm.fr", "mugnier@lirmm.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "\u043a.

Once we have defined these basic components, we will focus on obtaining structural knowledge of the derivative trees that can be created based on a fact and a set of rules: rules of creation and rules of evolution are defined. In the final step, we will use these rules to calculate a complete blocked goal. We will start by defining abstract pockets that can be considered canonical representatives of a class of structural equivalence relationship.

(The first is that the query is necessary at the time the fully blocked tree is completed.) In scenarios where different queries are evaluated against the same data, one would like to process data and rules independently of the query and then evaluate the query on the pre-processed structure. (This is not possible if we express the query on a rule.

There are at most p2 rules of evolution and p2 \u00b7 bf rules of creation. We must therefore limit the number of abstract patterns upwards. There are at most | R | 2aB subsets of rules, and btBmappings of terms of a rule body to terms of a bag.

In the simplest case (as in some descriptive logic), such configurations could therefore be sets of simple predicates {p1,.., pn}, where {p1,., pn} occurs in a model. However, it might be noteworthy that it is possible to achieve a polynomic translation into gfr1 rules by materializing the subsumption hierarchy of binary predicates in advance and, whenever a binary atom is \"generated\" by a rule, all subsumed atoms at the same time. \"means that there is an individual that is in the extension of each pi.

Note that generic semantic tableaus for first-order logic only lead to a semi-decision process. To obtain a decision process for a restricted logic, termination must be guaranteed, typically by defining a tree-like (-like) model property and recognizing repetitions during the course of tablet construction, leading to the idea of blocking as soon as repetitive types occur (depending on the expressivity of logic, 1-types, 2-types, or even larger types must be considered)."}, {"heading": "7.5 Relationships to other work on guarded existential rules", "text": "In fact, we are able to play by the rules that we have set ourselves, and we are able to play by the rules that we have set ourselves, \"he said.\" We have to play by the rules, \"he said.\" We have to play by the rules that we have set ourselves. \""}, {"heading": "7.6 Combined Approach", "text": "The combined approach (Lutz et al., 2009; Kontchakov, Lutz, Toman, Wolter, & Zakharyashev, 2010), designed for EL and the DL-Lite family, bears some similarities to our approach. First, the combined approach is a two-step process: First, some materialization is carried out. Therefore, to ensure the finiteness of this step, an overspecialization of the canonical model is calculated. Therefore, this overspecialization requires a rewriting of the query in order to restore its solidity. This rewriting may require ontology. In comparison, our approach calculates a materialization that is less specific than saturation, so it is the completeness that needs to be restored by modifying the query operation, which is no longer a simple homomorphism, but is based on the notion of APT homomorphism."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced the concept of greedy bounded-treewidth sets of existential rules, which encompass cautious rules as well as their known generalizations, leading to a generic and inferior optimal algorithm for deciding conjunctural queries. Furthermore, we have classified known gbts subclasses in terms of their combined and data complexity.The existential rulebook is young and combines techniques from different fields of research (such as databases, description logic, rules-based languages).A lot of work still needs to be done to deepen its understanding, design efficient algorithms and develop its application.It remains an open question whether gbts is recognizable. We suspect that the answer is yes, if this question is interesting from a theoretical point of view, we remember that gbts is no more expressive than wfg, and furthermore, any gbts set of rules can be polynomically translated."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Michae l Thomazo appreciates the support of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation."}], "references": [{"title": "The theory of joins in relational databases", "author": ["A.V.

More specifically, we establish complexities of the conjunctive query entailment problem for classes of existential rules (also called tuplegenerating dependencies, Datalog\u00b1 rules, or \u2200\u2203-rules). Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce the class of greedy bounded-treewidth sets (gbts) of rules, which covers guarded rules, and their most well-known generalizations. We provide a generic algorithm for query entailment under gbts , which is worst-case optimal for combined complexity with or without bounded predicate arity, as well as for data complexity and query complexity. Secondly, we classify several gbts classes, whose complexity was unknown, with respect to combined complexity (with both unbounded and bounded predicate arity) and data complexity to obtain a comprehensive picture of the complexity of existential rule fragments that are based on diverse guardedness notions. Upper bounds are provided by showing that the proposed algorithm is optimal for all of them. \u2217. This work has been partially realized while S. Rudolph was working at AIFB, KIT, Germany and M.
