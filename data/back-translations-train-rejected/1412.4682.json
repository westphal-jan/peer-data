Human emotions move far beyond these simple metrics and are much more diverse, implying that such subjectivity or polarity analysis provides only limited information about the actual intent of a message writer. Although several researchers have attempted to define standards in this area (Parrott, 2001; Plutchik, 1980; Schroder et al., 2011), there is still no consensus on a complete and clear set of emotions that can be generally accepted and objectively verified."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Few examples can be found where new methods are being introduced to capture more information than polarity, such as the work of (Socher et al., 2011), where a recursive auto-encoder is used to predict emotions in five dimensions. (Cambria and Hussain, 2012) and (Cambria et al., 2012) promote affective computing using a frame they call SenticNet. The sentiment dimensions of this frame are modeled in an hour glass model that is a derivative of Plutchik's emotion wheel (Plutchik et al, 1980). In (Mohammad, 2We expect a revised and expanded version of this manuscript describing RBEM emo to appear in (Tromp and Pechenizkiy, 2015) ar Xiv: 141 2.46 82v1 [cs.CL] 1 5D ec2 0142012)."}, {"heading": "3 Approach to Emotion Detection", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Plutchik\u2019s Wheel of Emotions", "text": "To address the problem of emotion recognition, one must have an idea of emotions. As with text mining, for example, the problem can be formulated differently, depending on whether we have only two classes, as in spam filtering, or several categories, as in topic classification, or a large number of categories, as in automated tagging. We choose the Wheel of Emotions, which is defined by Robert Plutchik (Plutchik, 1980) (see Figure 1), because it defines only eight basic emotions, making the problem manageable for conceivable applications, and RBEMEmo is a good match to perform a classification according to this emotion model. These eight emotions are considered complete in the sense that each emotion expressed is related or subsumed with one of the eight. In his work, Plutchik finds that these emotions are culturally independent. Given this assumption, we can apply this model to any language that we consider a strong point. Another reason for using this model is that each of these eight fundamental opposites of emotions are the other emotions."}, {"heading": "3.2 RBEM for Emotion Detection", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Evaluation", "text": "With this experimental study, we want to evaluate the proposed RBEM emo algorithm, which is tailored to Plutchik's emotional model."}, {"heading": "4.1 Experiment Setup", "text": "We compare our method against a majority class baseline, support vector machines (SVMs), regression and the recursive auto-encoder of (Socher et al., 2011) and evaluate the accuracy. In (Socher et al., 2011) five-dimensional sentiment models resulting from the Experience Project4 are introduced. It would be reasonable to evaluate on this dataset, but the five labels used to express emotions in this dataset are quite arbitrary and ambiguous, as the authors suggest. Furthermore, these labels are produced by users who read an actual confession from another person and rather than capture the emotions of the actual message using an external reader.Due to the impracticability of the Experience Project Dataset for our experiments, we benchmark on another, well-accepted datasets introduced in (Alm, 2008)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Datasets Description", "text": "The Affect Dataset we use in (Alm, 2008) and is publicly available7. This dataset consists of snippets of text from books written by three different authors. For each snippet, each sentence is commented by two commentators. These commentators each offer two different captions, one for the prevailing emotion in the sentence and one for the mood found. The available captions are the six basic emotions of Ekman's universal emotions, angry, disgusted, anxious, happy, sad, surprised. In addition, the authors could also point to neutrality. We only use the messages for which both commentators agree on emotions and we discard the mood label produced by the commentators. Furthermore, 85% of all sentences in the dataset are neutral, and many general classification techniques suffer from class imbalances, we produce two different datasets, one where neutral judgments are removed and only emotionally stressable emotions are found. In addition, 85% of the sentences in the dataset are neutral, and many general classification techniques suffer from class imbalances."}, {"heading": "4.3 Results", "text": "The accuracy of the best performing general classification techniques on the Affect Dataset is compared to that of the RBEM emo in Table 1. The accuracy of the majority class classification is given as a baseline. We report accuracies both in case neutral messages are held in our dataset and when they are filtered out. We do this because the neutral messages make up 85% of the total original dataset, and generic classification techniques are expected to suffer from class imbalance and find distortions relative to that data8http: / www.win.nl / \u02dc mpechen / projects / smm / en actual emotions, reflected in the accuracy of the SVM and regression classifiers, which are marginally higher than the majority class baseline."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this work, we introduced a new rules-based classification technology called RBEM-Emo for the classification of emotions in social media, which is closely linked to the Plutchik emotion model. We proposed to use this model because it is relatively compact and yet complete, and models emotions as opposites from each other, a trait that is well connected to RBEM-Emo.The results of our experimental study show that RBEM-Emo is competitive in the classification of emotions and emotions compared to the current state of the art. Every year, new approaches for the classification of emotions appear. It is important to enable a simple benchmark and to compare their performance.In order to investigate the classification of emotions with Plutchik's model, we developed a new benchmark with carefully annotated Twitter messages in three different languages. In order to increase the reproducibility of our work and facilitate further development in this area, we published this benchmark to the public."}], "references": [{"title": "Affect in text and speech, PhD thesis", "author": ["E.C.O.
