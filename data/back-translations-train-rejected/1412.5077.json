The problem of supplier selection on which decision maker has usually vague and imprecise knowledge is a typical example of multi criteria group decision-making problem. The conventional crisp techniques has not much effective for solving MCDM problems because of imprecise or fuzziness nature of the linguistic assessments. To find the exact values for MCDM problems is both difficult and impossible in more cases in real world. So, it is more reasonable to consider the values of alternatives according to the criteria as single valued neutrosophic sets (SVNS). This paper deal with the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach and extend the TOPSIS method to MCDM problem with single valued neutrosophic information. The value of each alternative and the weight of each criterion are characterized by single valued neutrosophic numbers. Here, the importance of criteria and alternatives is identified by aggregating individual opinions of decision makers (DMs) via single valued neutrosophic weighted averaging (IFWA) operator. The proposed method is, easy use, precise and practical for solving MCDM problem with single valued neutrosophic data. Finally, to show the applicability of the developed method, a numerical experiment for supplier choice is given as an application of single valued neutrosophic TOPSIS method at end of this paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 18:39:06 GMT  (547kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5077v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["r{\\i}dvan \\c{s}ahin", "muhammed yi\\u{g}ider"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5077"}, "pdf": {"name": "1412.5077.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Multi-criteria neutrosophic group decision making metod based TOPSIS for supplier selection", "authors": ["R\u0131dvan \u015fahin", "Muhammed Yi\u011fider"], "emails": ["mat.ridone@gmail.com", "myigider@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "1 Keywords: Neutrosophical Sets, Individually Rated Neutrosophical Sets, TOPSIS Method, Multi-Criterial Decision Making, Distance Measurement The process of Multi-Criterial Decision Making (MCDM) is the determination of the best choice among all the likely alternatives. The supplier selection problem, which the decision maker usually has vague and inaccurate knowledge about, is a typical example of multi-criterial group decision problems. Conventional clear techniques are not particularly effective in solving MCDM problems due to the inaccurate or blurred nature of linguistic assessments. Finding exact values for MCDM problems is in more cases both difficult and impossible in the real world. Therefore, it makes more sense to consider the values of the alternatives as individually rated Neutrosophical Sets (SVNS) according to the criteria.

Conclusions", "text": "In this thesis, we have expanded the TOPSIS method, which is one of the familiar methods for multiattribute-based decision problems in individual neutrrosophic sets. As solving a decision problem expressed through crisp data is more difficult in uncertain environments, monovalent neutrrosophic sets are more useful to overcome such situations. In the evaluation process, the weights of decision makers, the aggregation of criteria, and the effects of alternatives on criteria relative to decision makers are very important for the proper conduct of the evaluation process. To do this, the evaluations of each alternative according to each criterion and the weights of each criterion have been given linguistic terms expressed by single-value neutrrosophic numbers. SVNWA operator is also able to aggregate the opinions of individual decision makers in determining the importance of criteria and alternatives."}], "references": [{"title": "A unifying field in logics.

alternatives. The problem of supplier selection on which decision maker has usually vague and imprecise knowledge is a typical example of multi criteria group decision-making problem. The conventional crisp techniques has not much effective for solving MCDM problems because of imprecise or fuzziness nature of the linguistic assessments. To find the exact values for MCDM problems is both difficult and impossible in more cases in real world. So, it is more reasonable to consider the values of alternatives according to the criteria as single valued neutrosophic sets (SVNS). This paper deal with the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach and extend the TOPSIS method to MCDM problem with single valued neutrosophic information. The value of each alternative and the weight of each criterion are characterized by single valued neutrosophic numbers. Here, the importance of criteria and alternatives is identified by aggregating individual opinions of decision makers (DMs) via single valued neutrosophic weighted averaging (IFWA) operator. The proposed method is, easy use, precise and practical for solving MCDM problem with single valued neutrosophic data. Finally, to show the applicability of the developed method, a numerical experiment for supplier choice is given as an application of single valued neutrosophic TOPSIS method at end of this paper.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
