A multi-criteria decision making method based on the developed score-accuracy functions is established in which criterion values for alternatives are single valued neutrosophic sets and interval neutrosophic sets. In decision making process, the neutrosophic weighted aggregation operators (arithmetic and geometric average operators) are adopted to aggregate the neutrosophic information related to each alternative.

To demonstrate the correlations, we will use the same examples taken from [32] and [30]. Score and accuracy functions are extremely important for the process of decision-making according to several criteria, but until now there have not been many studies on multi-criterion decision-making methods based on accuracy score functions, the criterion values for alternatives are single-value neutrosophic sets or interval neutrosophic sets. Ye [30] defined the similarity measures between INSs based on the relationship between similarity measures and distances and proposed the similarity measures between each alternative and the ideal alternative in order to establish a multi-criterion decision-making method for INSs. After Zhang et al. [6] presented a method based on the aggregation operators for multi-criterion distances and distances [suggested by the SVN], [suggested similarity between each alternative and the ideal alternative, in order to establish a multi-criterion decision-criterion method for INSs [6] decision-neutral conditions, the result proposed in the SVIVN is less predetermined in this section [30]."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusions", "text": "Currently, many technical score accuracy functions are applied to problems based on intuitionistic fuzzy information or interval-weighted intuitionistic fuzzy information, but they could not be used to solve the problems based on neutrosophic information. Therefore, this paper proposes two measurement functions that provide score and accuracy functions for monovalent neutrosophic numbers and interval neutrosophic numbers, and establishes a multi-criteriterial decision method based on these functions for neutrosophic information. In the decision process, the neutrrosophic weighted aggregation operators (arithmetic and geometric average operators) are used to aggregate the neutrosophic information associated with each alternative. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the application of the proposed approaches."}], "references": [{"title": "Intuitionistic fuzzy sets", "author": ["K.

general platform, which can be used to present uncertainty, imprecise, incomplete and inconsistent. In this paper a score function and an accuracy function for single valued neutrosophic sets is firstly proposed to make the distinction between them. Then the idea is extended to interval neutrosophic sets. A multi-criteria decision making method based on the developed score-accuracy functions is established in which criterion values for alternatives are single valued neutrosophic sets and interval neutrosophic sets. In decision making process, the neutrosophic weighted aggregation operators (arithmetic and geometric average operators) are adopted to aggregate the neutrosophic information related to each alternative. Thus, we can rank all alternatives and make the selection of the best of one(s) according to the score-accuracy functions. Finally, some illustrative examples are presented to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
