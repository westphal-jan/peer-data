The employed technique is unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). In addition, it is proposed, to use LDA in conjunction with recently developed method of unsupervised keyword extraction. Such an approach improves the interpretability of the automatically obtained topics and allows for better computational performance. The described analysis illustrates a potential of the method in detecting recurring themes and discovering temporal trends in lodged contract appeals. These results may be in future applied to improve information retrieval from repositories of legal texts or as auxiliary material for legal analyses carried out by human experts.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 22:00:52 GMT  (96kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5212v1", "\"Legal Knowledge and Information Systems, JURIX 2014: The Twenty-Seventh Annual Conference\", series Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications, Volume 271, edited by Rinke Hoekstra, IOSPress, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "\"Legal Knowledge and Information Systems, JURIX 2014: The Twenty-Seventh Annual Conference\", series Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications, Volume 271, edited by Rinke Hoekstra, IOSPress, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["micha{\\l} {\\l}opuszy\\'nski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5212"}, "pdf": {"name": "1412.5212.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Application of Topic Models to Judgments from Public Procurement Domain", "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "Application of Topic Models to Judgments", "text": "from the field of public procurement Micha l LOPUSZYN \u0301 SKI"}, {"heading": "Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling, University of Warsaw, Pawin\u0301skiego 5a, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland", "text": "This year it's at the stage where it will be able to put itself at the top, \"he said."}], "references": [{"title": "Latent dirichlet allocation", "author": ["D.

In this work, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is used [1]. It operates on documents in the bag-of-words representation and returns a set of detected topics (i.e., groups of words and their probabilities reflecting the importance in particular topic). In addition, the topic proportions for each document can be determined. In this paper, I demonstrate the utility of the LDA method for analyzing judgments from public procurement field. In addition, I propose combining LDA with a keyphrase extraction scheme, as it improves topics interpretability and computational performance. For this study, a corpus of 13 thousand judgments of the National Appeal Chamber was used. National Appeal Chamber is competent for the examination of the appeals lodged in the contract award procedures in Poland. The judgments covered the period between 12.2007 and 05.2014. For LDA, the Gibbs sampling method implemented in the MALLET package (http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/) was applied. After preliminary tests, the number of topics was adjusted to 20. Lower values yield many overly broad topics, and higher values increased granularity and provided many topics without a clear interpretation. Sample themes detected by the LDA method within the analyzed corpus of judgments are presented in Figure 1. Initially, the LDA procedure was performed on the bag-of-words representation. The obtained themes looked promising. E.g.,", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
