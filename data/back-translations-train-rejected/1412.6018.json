INTRODUCTION", "text": "Handwriting recognition is a field of research that is strongly associated with processing natural language. Its goal is to convert character images into text that the computer can process. However, although various input devices are designed to offer users such as keyboard, mouse, digital pen, pen and touch screen options, most people prefer to write notes on paper with handwriting. To bring them into the computer, users have to waste their time typing them again. Therefore, the development of a handwriting recognition system allows the user to easily grasp and bridge the gap between experienced computer users and those who are not. In the past, there has been a lot of successful research on handwriting recognition with a high recognition accuracy of approximately 90%. Different approaches have been used in many languages such as English [1-3], Chinese [4,5], Japanese [6], Arabic [7] and Thai [8] which are characterized by individuality."}, {"heading": "2. EXISTING APPROACHES SOLVING INSUFFICIENT TRAINING DATA", "text": "In 2000, M. Mori, et al. [13] proposed a dot recognition technique to generate new samples, assigning a character as a template and then randomly selecting a character from the training dataset, projecting matches between the two characters, generating the generated characters by different parameters in the defined distortion function, as shown in Figure 1 (a). In 2005, Kambar, Sapargali [14] applied morphing transformation to generate synthetic data for handwritten numerical recognition, randomly selecting two characters from the training dataset, then extracting three characteristics, i.e. gradient, structure, and concavity, from each character. Finally, he applied morphing transformation to generate different character shapes, as illustrated in Figure 1 (b). In 2007, Buyoung Yun, et al. [15] applied different tang modification factors to represent different variations."}, {"heading": "3. STRUCTURAL CROSSING-OVER TECHNIQUE", "text": "Since the characters generated in previous works are largely derived from the initial characters by looking at the character structure of individual characters. Whether a character is distorted at different angles, its overall structure is not significantly different from the original. In this essay, a few characters are selected, some common structures are extracted, differences between two characters are taken into account and finally some new hybrid characters are produced. Pre-processing, crossing point search, structure grouping and character reproduction."}, {"heading": "3.1 Preprocessing", "text": "In order to generate the new training data, at least two characters are required, which, as shown in Fig.3., are pre-processed by binarization and thinning."}, {"heading": "3.2 Crossing-Over Point Finding", "text": "In this step, the common points are found between two characters, which are called crossingover points. Consider in Fig. 4 that two original characters, L and R. The coordinate of L is set to (0,0) and the coordinate of R can be varied in both X and Y axes. The number of generated training data depends on the times and the gap size when two characters overlap. Each overlapping frame provides one or more intersections. We call it \"Crossing-Over-Point.\" In Fig. 4, there are two points. These points are used as separators, which results in three fragments of each character."}, {"heading": "3.3 Structure Grouping", "text": "We believe that these different parts can produce different character patterns. However, when we make a combination of these small fragments, some strange signs can occur. To ensure that the synthetic signs are identical to the original sign, the structure of the character should be obtained. Therefore, these fragments are overlapped again to find the meaningful structure of each sign. From Structures. Stretching process is then used to make the structures clear."}, {"heading": "3.4 Characters Reproduction", "text": "After the structure fragments of the original characters have been preserved, the character reproduction step is activated and the new characters are synthesized using three parts, i.e. a fragment of L, intersections and a fragment of R. The fragment L and R should have different structures. Figure 6 illustrates how new \"3\" are created. The left \"3\" character is synthesized by combining the first structure in L, intersections and the second structure in R, while the right \"3\" uses the second structure in L, intersections and the first structure in R. to enlarge the new characters."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "text": "We hypothesize that the proposed \"Structural Crossing-over\" technique can generate the new characters with a greater variety of patterns than previous research. We select the character patterns and experiment with recognition accuracy. In Figure 7 (a), ten characters are generated from the left character in the right column. Figure 7 (b) leads to the newly generated characters derived from the proposed technique. Character patterns are more diverse. Assuming that handwriting recognition is trained by a large variety of patterns as training data, recognition accuracy would be increased. We continue the experiments by building a benchmark handwriting recognition system that uses the histogram of the gradient (HOG) as character characteristics, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel functionality, and against all applied characteristics, we will build a benchmark handwriting testing system that uses the Meriker."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The proposed technique can provide a greater variety of training data than the existing approaches; the affine transformation tangent vectors [15] are used as a competitive approach; the comparison of character pattern variation and recognition accuracy is experimented with the MNIST corpus [16]; and the support vector machine (SVM) with histogram of gradient (HOG) features, linear kernel function and one-on-one approach for classifying multiple classes is implemented as a recognition system."}], "references": [{"title": "Offline handwriting recognition with multidimensional recurrent neural networks", "author": ["A.
