This paradigm is characterized by using annotations as multifunctional carriers and making them portable. The testing grounds we have chosen are two significant enterprises, one in the history of science, and one in Hebrew scholarship. The first one (CKCC) focuses on the results of a project where a Dutch consortium of universities, research institutes, and cultural heritage institutions experimented for 4 years with language techniques and topic modeling methods with the aim to analyze the emergence of scholarly debates. The data: a complex set of about 20.000 letters. The second one (DTHB) is a multi-year effort to express the linguistic features of the Hebrew bible in a text database, which is still growing in detail and sophistication. Versions of this database are packaged in commercial bible study software. We state that the results of these forms of scholarship require new knowledge management and archive practices. Only when researchers can build efficiently on each other's (intermediate) results, they can achieve the aggregations of quality data by which new questions can be answered, and hidden patterns visualized. Archives are required to find a balance between preserving authoritative versions of sources and supporting collaborative efforts in digital scholarship. Annotations are promising vehicles for preserving and reusing research results.

The matter is not academic, in this particular case, the queries are expressed in QL."}, {"heading": "Features as Annotations", "text": "In the case of the DTHB, the characteristics are linguistic characteristics of the form key = value that apply to text objects of almost all grains, from morphemes to speech passages to books. These characteristics are the product of years of manual work combined with automatic processing. They have been reviewed and revised and represent a treasure trove. They live in the same implementation of text databases, emdros, as the above queries. By transforming the characteristics into annotations, we potentially tap into the value that is hidden here. In this case, we simply chose as body strings of the form key = value. The targets are the objects that carry this characteristic value. In our demo application QFA, we give the user 70 keys = value combinations at the word level with which he can play. As an example, a user can explain the application to interpret all verbs with tension = imperfect in blue and all verbs with tension = masculine, although it is very difficult to interpret structures in red."}, {"heading": "Topics and Keywords as Annotations", "text": "It's not that we're looking for a solution, but it's as if we're looking for a solution.

There are good reasons for this: neither the sources nor the notes resulting from CKCC and DTHB are currently web resources. Nevertheless, there is a sense in which we are OAM compliant: the notes are in a database other than the sources, and the link between the notes and their objectives is purely symbolic, independent of database modeling and technology (no foreign key constraints). It could be said that we force modularity between sources and notes, in the sense that notes can be ported from one source to a comparable source."}, {"heading": "Usefulness of Porting Annotations", "text": "Many sources are available in multiple versions, in many copies, in different formats, in several languages, 15 tinyurl.com / wiki-taa-topics. 16URI: Uniform Resource Identifier, which can be dereferenced using the HTTP protocol. The definition URI is available at tinyurl.com / ietf-uri.and in various media. Many comments on a resource are still useful when dereferencing other variants. Here are some examples: (1) (from DTHB): There are various authoritative versions of the Hebrew text. We have compared the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS) 17 with the Westminster Leningrad Codex (WLC) 18. Most of the differences are different word divisions and different diacritical trademarks, which means that the vast majority of the attributes and query attributes based on the BHS can also be applied in English."}, {"heading": "URIs, Anchors, FRBR", "text": "In practice, however, there are several scenarios in which resources are not addressed in a stable manner. This happens, for example, when resources are harvested from the same sources. This is an organizational principle that is fairly new and from which enormous advantages for data management and visualization can be expected. In practice, however, there are a number of scenarios in which resources are not addressed in a stable manner. This happens, for example, when resources are outsourced to an archive. In the event that we want to recover these resources later, the means of addressing have been altered externally."}, {"heading": "Statement", "text": "There are deeper reasons for discrepancies and deeper reasons for identification as sequences of surface shapes. If we ignore these reasons, and if we fail to base our identifiers on them, we will not have truly portable annotations.Annotation Management: Metadata, Origin, and Types The role of metadata for annotations is (at least) twofold: Firstly, they enable the assessment of the quality, meaning, and meaning of a comment. Quality judgments can be made on the basis of provenance: Who made the remark, for which project, when? Significance can be derived from a list of publications associated with this (series) annotation. Meaning can be retrieved from pointers to reference materials. Since OAM is firmly integrated into the semantic web effort, there are no conceptual limitations in linking metadata to metadata. The second role of metadata is to recognize the problem of notation itself."}, {"heading": "Annotation-driven applications", "text": "How difficult is it to develop an annotation-based application that handles significant amounts of data and annotations and provides a usable interface for the end user? 21 tinyurl.com / wiki-pa. Be careful that this is ongoing work."}, {"heading": "Design", "text": "The QFA and TKA demo applications are powered by a database of the source materials and a separate database of the annotations. There is no mixing or close linkage between the sources and the annotations. The only links are the anchors: symbolic expressions in the annotation targets that refer to fragments of the sources."}, {"heading": "Functionality", "text": "Both applications display the source material in a wide column and the annotations in narrower columns next to the sources. The objectives of the annotations can be highlighted in the sources, and the user has some control over the highlighting, depending on the type of annotation. We invite the reader to explore these applications to get a more detailed picture. In short, these applications visualize the annotations and the sources in a simple, not too rough way, adapted to the different types of annotations."}, {"heading": "Implementation", "text": "In order to quickly implement our ideas about annotations and sources, we needed a simple but effective framework on which to build data-driven web applications. We found it in the form of Web2py (Di Pierro, 2007-2010). We needed very little code on the framework, just a few hundred lines of Python and Javascript each. Delivering these apps is fully web-based and takes only seconds. Most of the work went into the data preparation phase, where we used Perl and Shell scripts to merge data of various origins into SQL imports for sources and annotations, which were also in the range of a few hundred lines."}, {"heading": "Missing Link", "text": "What these demos still lack is full RDF capability. Once these sources are truly web resources, we expect it to be easy to create an import / export capability to convert database annotations into real RDF annotations. How to translate our fragment anchors into HTTP URIs is still an open question. Finally, work needs to be done to get the most out of the world of relational databases and associated data, see e.g. (Baron & Di Pierro, 2010)."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "We have studied the feasibility of annotations as portable carriers for different results of research in the humanities. We have found that annotations are layered enough to carry the products of digital science such as query results, features, topics and key terms. The focus remains on the data, not on the systems in which they were created. Annotations can be managed by unlimited association of metadata. Annotation development is feasible. The focus remains on the data, and it does not shift to the software. However, the web-based annotation model is not fully compatible with the process of archiving and reuse."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Walter Ravenek (Huygens ING) for helpful comments on modeling; Eko Indarto (DANS) for helping to develop a first version of QFA in a very short time; Andrea Scharnhorst (DANS) for providing additional time for research; Joris van Zundert (Huygens ING) for supporting an inspiring Interedition Bootcamp22 that put me (Dirk) on the path to rapid development."}], "references": [{"title": "Forget Footnotes.
