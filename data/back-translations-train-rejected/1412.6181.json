{"heading": "6 DISCUSSION", "text": "In Section 1 we have seen that from a theoretical point of view, it is possible to learn about encrypted data as well as apply networks to encrypted data. However, we have seen in Section 5 that from a practical point of view, some applications of cryptographic networks are not feasible with the current construction. Therefore, it is useful to study different use cases and discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these scenarios. Doing inference with cryptographic networks is a promising direction. In this scenario, the network is learned about simple data and is applied to encrypted data. Consider, for example, a dentist who can take X-ray images of suspicious tooth and send them to be classified in a cloud service. With cryptographic nets, the dentist can encrypt the image and send it for evaluation without affecting the privacy of the customer, since not only the image is encrypted, but also the prediction is visible only to the dentist and not to the owner of the predictable models. Another example of a bank would like to include a financial loan."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper we have presented crypto networks: a way to learn and apply neural networks to encrypted data. We have discussed the theoretical aspects of learning and the conclusion about encrypted data as well as the practical implications. We suspect that crypto networks could be practical for medical and financial applications during the inference phase and perhaps even for limited learning. Implementing crypto networks requires careful work both on the side of machine learning and on the side of cryptology and is the subject of ongoing research."}], "references": [{"title": "Do deep nets really need to be deep", "author": ["J.

A homomorphic encryption scheme (Rivest et al., 1978) allows a certain computation to be performed on the encrypted data by manipulating the corresponding ciphertexts without the need to decrypt them first. A fully homomorphic encryption scheme (Gentry, 2009) allows arbitrary operations over encrypted data and therefore, any function can be computed. However, fully homomorphic encryption schemes are still too inefficient for practical use. One way to obtain better efficiency is to only use so-called somewhat homomorphic schemes that only allow the evaluation of functions up to a certain complexity. Such schemes are often the cores of corresponding fully homomorphic encryption schemes. They usually provide operations corresponding to addition and multiplication of encrypted integer values, and therefore, are suitable to evaluate polynomial functions up to a certain maximal degree. The required degree of the polynomial function along with the desired security level determines the scheme parameters and thus has great implications on the size of the ciphertext as well as the computational complexity of the cryptographic operations.

To achieve high accuracy, we use neural networks, which have been shown to outperform other learning models for many tasks.

The model operates on these ciphertexts and sends back the encrypted prediction. In this protocol, not only the data remains private, even the values predicted are available only to the data owner.
