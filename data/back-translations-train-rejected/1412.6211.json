Unlike the other three novels, there is no author controversy. So, if our method is indeed robust, we should expect negative answers to the hypotheses of the two authors by not finding chronological divisions. As in the Dream of the Red Chamber, we divide each of the three novels into training samples and test samples. Both novels of the Three Kingdoms and the Water Marge have 120 chapters. In both cases, we designate the first 30 chapters and the last 30 chapters as the two classes of educational data, and the middle 60 chapters as test data."}, {"heading": "5.

In addition, we have applied our method to the Cheng Gao version of Dream of the Red Chamber, which has provided unexpectedly strong support for the hypothesis that Chapter 67 is not the work of Cao Xueqin either.The methodology in this paper is rather e-ective in selecting the most important features for classification by a new ranking system based on relative frequency. A number of future experiments should result in the application of this methodology to a wider range of works.It is worth mentioning that there are several attempts for Red."}], "references": [{"title": "Authorship of The Dream of the Red Chamber: A Computerized Statistical Study of Its Vocabulary", "author": ["B.C.
