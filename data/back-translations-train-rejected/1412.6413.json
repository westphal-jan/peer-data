CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE", "text": "A quality dimension is an attribute or characteristic feature of a given concept. Quality dimensions are assumed to be linearly independent, but this need not always be the case [2]. Interdependence between quality dimensions has a covariant influence on quality dimensions. Nevertheless, for the sake of simplicity, dimensions are assumed to be independent. In conceptual vector space, quality dimensions can be scalar or vector or a series of ISSN: 2231-5381 http: / / www.ijcttjournal.org page 62 vectors [11]. Conceptual space therefore covers a number of domains and subdomains. Conceptual vector space of concepts Cn is defined as 1 2 {(,...,)."}, {"heading": "III. CONSISTENCY, SOUNDNESS, COMPLETENESS OF CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE", "text": "Conceptual knowledge, as already mentioned, encompasses concepts and links between concepts that are usually confined to a particular area. [11] The area limits the meaning of concepts to a specific subject matter, since a concept can exist in several areas and may have multiple meanings or interpretations. [11] The accuracy of conceptual knowledge ultimately trickles away to the extent that it is able to replicate human understanding. Therefore, the efficiency of conceptual knowledge can be tested by feedback from end users. However, this is only possible after knowledge has been designed and used for practical use. Since the shaping of knowledge follows a formal basis, it is possible to verify its accuracy by setting some standards and testing the conformity of the definition of knowledge with this standard. Since conceptual knowledge is strongly based on the definition of concepts, it is worth noting here that in mathematics definitions can either be intense or broadening."}, {"heading": "A. Consistency", "text": "Consistency implies that the definition does not allow for contradictions. In the realm of conceptual knowledge, this means that a concept should not have contradictory properties. It could also imply that concepts must not be ambiguous in its definition, which ensures that knowledge is well defined and does not contain paradoxes that could impair the efficiency of the work of knowledge."}, {"heading": "B. Soundness", "text": "Solidity means that nothing invalid can be derived from the intensive definition. This means that the definition is correct only if it is valid and all premises are actually true. The definition applies if the premises that lead to the conclusion are logical and can be verified. Premises of the definition of concept are the quality dimensions or attributes mentioned in Section II that actually describe a concept."}, {"heading": "C. Completeness", "text": "Completeness means the opposite of solidity, i.e. all valid concepts must be derived from the intensive definition. This ensures that knowledge is designed to accept only valid concepts, and if a concept is considered valid, it should have a corresponding intensive definition with characteristics describing it. After the definitions of consistency, solidity and completeness have been clarified, it is worth noting that some of the central design elements may have an impact on these factors. For example, consider that a concept with certain characteristics and the same concept with contradictory characteristics exists in knowledge. This might appear to be a violation of the consistency of knowledge, but let's say if the concept has a temporal or contextual dimension that leads to a copy of the same concept but with a modified definition."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The ideas postulated in this paper are intended to reinforce the need for comprehensive conceptual knowledge, which is an area of active research. A strong theoretical foundation not only gives stability to conceptual knowledge, but also helps to guide research in this area in a disciplined way. These criteria can also be used as guidelines when improvements are made to conceptual knowledge concepts in order to maintain integrity."}], "references": [{"title": "Cognitive Science \u2013 An Introduction to the Study of Mind", "author": ["J.
