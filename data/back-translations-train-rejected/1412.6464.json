KEY-POINTS SEARCH", "text": "In the computer image, each classified object consists of points that have a particular position and characteristics. Below, one can name saturation, sharpness, brightness and more. All these characteristics result in an image of the input object that is visible to our eyes. An example model is in Fig. 1. By analyzing such characteristics, it is possible to identify objects. However, the detection of objects depends on the selection of significant key parts of the image. Therefore, it can be said that the position of each pixel (each has measurable coordinates x = (x, y) = (xi, 1, xi, 2) and its characteristics (such as brightness) are important aspects in order to make a correct decision. We choose to recognize some parts or important areas that can be defined for a computer system. Thus, Key-Point is a pixel in the 2D input image that has special characteristics that make it important for object identification. Key-Area contains many key points that all put together an object in order to recognize the item that we are looking for in certain words in the object."}, {"heading": "A. SURF - Classic Attempt", "text": "The classical methods used for the detection of key areas are the SURF (Speed-Up Robust Features) algorithm, which describes the input image by selecting characteristic key points. Let's just give a brief description here, for further details see [30], [31], [32], [33] or [34]. In this thesis, we used the SURF combination of key points with the calculation of the 64-element vector (descriptor). In the SURF algorithm, the integrated image and filter approximation of the Block Hessian determinant is applied. To detect points of interest, we used a certain Hessian matrix approximation (for details see [30] and [31]. The implemented SURF algorithm defines the Hessian matrix H (x, \u03c3) for the point x (x), y-gypsum."}, {"heading": "B. SIFT - Classic Attempt", "text": "SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) transforms the image into scale-invariant coordinates relative to local aspects, generating characteristics that can cover the image densely for the entire range of scales and locations, see [35] and [36]. SIFT idea is based on [37] where the possibility of Harris corners agreeing over a large image was discussed (see also [38] and [39] for details. This idea was developed in [40] for general image recognition, where Harris corners were used to select key points by rotationally invariant descriptors of local image regions. However, Harris corner detectors can be sensitive to changes in image scale, making it inefficient in processing images of different sizes. Therefore, [41], [35] and [42] extended local approach to achieve scale invariance. Then, some special features such as multi-dimensional histograms, which distribute shapes of textile objects are useful for measurement."}, {"heading": "C. Simplified Firefly Algorithm - A Novel Approach", "text": "It is a very efficient method that can also be applied in key areas (see [52]) or multimodal optimization (see [53])."}, {"heading": "III. RESEARCH RESULTS", "text": "SFA is used to search for 2D key areas. Each firefly represents a single pixel (dot in the 2D input image according to the coordinates in Fig. 1). Therefore, in this paper, we simultaneously change names: pixel, 2D pixel and firefly. In each iteration, we move the entire population to search between all pixels. Fireflies move from pixel to pixel and search for specific areas according to a specific criterion. In our experiments, we used simplified fitness function that reflects the brightness and sharpness of the input pixels (xi) = FT pixels (xi, xi, 2)) = {0.1. 1 saturation 0 others, (8) where notation (xi) denotes the quality of the rated pixels. This measure reflects a value in the range from 0.0 to 1.0, where the color saturation is changed from black to white."}, {"heading": "A. Dark areas in 2D images", "text": "First, let us present research results on the localization of dark objects. Dark objects are present in many different images. They can represent objects in the landscape (trees, blocks, different constructions, etc.), natural phenomena (tornadoes, shadows, etc.), human figures or human appearance (facial features, hair, eyes, etc.).Fig.2 - Fig.5 presents research results for dark key areas in input images. We see that SFA can easily find dark objects of different shapes such as human posture, human features (hair, eyes, etc.).It is also Fig.2: Search for dark key points in sharp and human postures: simplified SURF results in the first row on the left, simplified SIFT results in the second row, and SFA results that are efficient in finding some aspects in landscapes in the second row. Fig.4 and Fig.5, research results from searching for shadows under trees, buildings, bridges, or other natural phenomena have all been presented correctly by SFA."}, {"heading": "B. Bright areas in 2D images", "text": "Let us now present research results for bright objects localization. Bright objects are present in various images. In addition, they can represent landscape (light or bright constructions, boats, sails, etc.), natural phenomena (clouds, sun, stars, etc.), human figures or human appearance (gray hair, eyes, makeup, light-colored clothing, etc.).Fig.6 - Fig.9 presents research results for light key areas in 2D input images. We see that SFA can find light objects in various shapes such as human faces or light colored clothing (see Fig. 7). It is also efficient, light or light constructions such as bridges or buildings in Fig.6 and Fig.9. Compared to SURF, the SFA results are better. This method can find more areas that meet certain criteria, such as human faces or light colored clothing (see Fig. 7). This task is more complicated than searching for dark areas such as bridges or buildings, Fig.6 and Fig.9."}, {"heading": "C. Conclusions", "text": "The application of SFA allows us to find key areas in examined 2D input images easily and reliably. SFA is efficient in searching for areas such as human postures, the appearance of the human face (hair or eyes), construction or natural elements (trees, dark constructions or natural phenomena such as shadows). Table I presents comparisons and assessments of the methods studied. The grade was given on a scale of - (which is a weak mark) to + + (which is a high mark). Comparing the research results, we come to the conclusion that the calculations performed by SFA are simple. We only use formulas (5) - (7) to calculate and perform the position and motion of each point in examined 2D input images. SURF and SIFT can represent better precision in recognizing input object boundaries as it is one of their original purposes. SFA covers whole detected objects with dots. However, SFA is simplified in the final series of SFA-2FT applied to the second specified landscape result in SFA based on SFA."}, {"heading": "IV. FINAL REMARKS", "text": "The research results presented in this paper show that EC methods are an excellent tool for carrying out the process of detecting key areas in 2D images of any kind. It is possible to improve object detection by applying an ingenious fitness function that can accurately describe the properties of objects and the introduction of image filters. However, search objects are not easily detected, as discussed for some examples in Section III-B, e.g. due to wear (effort) of elements that are not high enough in contrast and environmental conditions (brightness, rain, fog, etc.).Therefore, we will continue the research on the application of EC methods in the process of 2D image classification to develop the final 2D detection system based on smart and sobel filters for SFA input images."}], "references": [{"title": "Creating learning sets for control systems using an evolutionary method", "author": ["M.
