Firstly, a brief priming of the eOPRAm calculation itself. 2.1 The eOPRAm calculation [15] exists as an extension of the OPRAm calculation. Under OPRAm, the point objects are extended by a local reference direction to create \"oriented points\" or O-points. Using these local reference directions, together with a series of binary relationships, one can express the idea of a relative direction between the O-points. The OPRAm calculation also includes a granularity parameter m that defines the resolution of these relative directions by dividing the plane into 4m sectors.The eOPRAm calculation expands the OPRAm calculation by adding the concept of relative distance to the O-points and yields eo-points."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 Qualitative Directions", "text": "To calculate the pairs of qualitative direction matrix, one must first find the quantitative anti-clockwise rotation angle between each pair of joined edges or ordered triangular angles. In view of two edges v1 and v2 sharing a common vertex, the positive (anti-clockwise) rotation angle \u03b2 is defined as: \u03b2 = arctan2 (vy2, vx2) \u2212 arctan2 (vy1, vx1) \u03b2 = {\u03b2 if \u03b2 0 \u03b2 + 2\u03c0 if \u03b2 < 0 (1) A sketch of the process used to generate all possible linked triangular angles and calculate their rotation angles is shown below. \u2212 Algorithm 1 Generating Pairwise Turn AnglesInput: Simple polygon of n n n circles, p0 to pn \u2212 1O blank n matrix for i,."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Qualitative Distances", "text": "The next step in creating our qualitative eOPRAm description is to translate the absolute distances between adjacent nodes into qualitative reference distances. As with the instructions, the eOPRAm reference distances are calculated by dividing a plane into 2 m sections and assigning quantitative values to a qualitative representation. Qualitative distances are calculated by comparing the length of each edge with the length of the previous edge as a \"control length.\" Under eOPRAm, a control length is used to convert a series of distance ratios into a series of qualitative distances. The sequence of distance ratios is defined by the granularity parameter m, which is used to indicate that there are 2 m partitions of these ratios: the first half are marked distances \u2264 2 m marked at even distances of 0 m, 2 m, 2 m m m m \u2212 1 m, 1. The second half of the distances sent again >."}, {"heading": "3 Initial Reconstruction and Refinement", "text": "The first step of the reconstruction process is simply to \"trace\" the hull of the eOPRAm descriptions generated in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. First, we turn the hull list of eOPRAm direction intervals of eq. 3 back to rotation angles (by multiplying each value by the angular resolution, eq. 4) and use the qualitative distances generated in algorithm 2 as edge lengths to place the vertices. This process gives us a rough representation that we will refine in the next steps."}, {"heading": "3.1 Initial Reconstruction", "text": "In the current implementation, the input polyline xy0 (p0) is used to help orient and anchor our reconstructed polyline. Traceability of the eOPRAm hull is done as follows: Algorithm 4 Tracing the Qualitative Hull of an n-side PolygonT \u2190 List of n eOPRAm statements back to the angle D \u2190 List of n eOPRAm qualitative edge lengths P \u2190 empty list to hold reconstructed points P0 \u2190 Input Polygon's p0.

Successor polylines are created by applying a series of four adjustments to each of the reconstructed polar lines (minus the endpoints): \u2022 to lengthen the outgoing edge length \u2022 to increase the angle of rotation and \u2022 to decrease the angle of rotation. Successor polylines are only passed on to the next steps if: the resulting polar line does not increase the closing gap or the eOPRAm directional difference."}, {"heading": "4 Preliminary Results", "text": "With an eOPRAm granularity of m = 8, all polylines of the sample can be successfully translated into qualitative eOPRA8 descriptions and reassembled into roughly similar polylines that achieve both closure and 0-difference descriptions of the shell of eOPRA8, with differences in the pairwise direction of nearly 0 eOPRA8. While the refimenent process allows arbitrarily up to 100 iterations and up to 20 adjustment refinements, most samples tested reach closure well before these limits. Here are three sample results using input polylines with 7, 9 and 10 corners. For each input polyline of the sample, three shapes are shown: from left to right, the input polyline, the initial reconstruction and the final adjusted polyline. In all the following cases, the input polylines and the final polylines exhibit identical OPRA8 descriptions."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Outlook", "text": "In order to test for this cognitive appropriateness, qualitative mold representation must be reversible.With our approach, we can take qualitative mold representation and generate prototypical specific shapes that match the abstract description.Our work, as described in this report, is the first-ever QSR-based mold description that is capable of generating prototypical shapes based on abstract QSR-based representation.The results presented in this report are produced by a small group of python programs designed to perform the de- and reconstruction tasks.Future work will include conducting empirical studies with human subjects to test the cognitive appropriateness of our new qualitative mold representation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The authors would like to thank Jan Oliver Wallgru \ufffd n for the helpful discussions on the topic of this paper.
