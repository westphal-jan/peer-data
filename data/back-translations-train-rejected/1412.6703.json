Generally, for an intelligent robot, for example, it is desirable to avoid the two extreme cases. A robot that shows no signs of behavior or response to external stimuli, or that behaves in a random manner, should not and will not be considered intelligent, regardless of the observer. There are also robots designed to perform very repetitive tasks, whose behavior will indeed be simple, though generative of the structure or system, but a reasonable condition is to be expected to respond to its environment, which is a solid requirement for intelligent behavior, in the spirit of the turning test itself, for example, the behavior definition of behavior based."}, {"heading": "5 A Turing-test like test for computation and in-", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are in a position to move into another world, to move into another world in which they live, in which they live, in another world in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live."}, {"heading": "6 A measure for robot behavioural complexity as-", "text": "An example of this is a dishwasher, in which instead of a machine that mimics the way a human would wash dishes, an artificial friendly environment is created that envelops a very simple machine (e.g. a rotating stick) that does the job.

They can potentially be applied to machine performance evaluation, where adaptability and sensitivity to the environment must be taken into account, where the importance and sensitivity of the environment are critical."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "H.
