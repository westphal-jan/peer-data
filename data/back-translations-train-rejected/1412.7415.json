(Dasgupta and Basu (2008)) Unlike other languages, there is no written form of sign language. Current methods require human intervention to convert text to sign language, which is a challenge given the scarcity of sign language interpreters. Information technology can be used effectively for this purpose. Another major challenge from a Malaysian perspective is the lack of standardization, which is why practitioners in different parts of Kerala are using different approaches to sign language. The aim of this paper is to submit a prototype of automatic Malaysian text for the Sign Language Machine Translation System. It is output as a three-dimensional computer model. The user can type Malaysia's text into the text field and the au-tomala sign system is primarily used by sign language interpreters."}, {"heading": "2 Sign Language in Kerala", "text": "Like any other sign language, the sign language practised in Kerala uses visual signs in parallel with hand signs. Indian sign language also follows this approach. Malayalam, which follows the Subject Verb (SOV) structure, follows the same structure as ISL. (Crystal (1998); George (1972))) According to users, Kerala does not have sign language as such. Most features are derived from ISL. Even people in different parts of Kerala use sign language in different forms. This requires the development of a standardised form of sign language for use in Kerala. Our system could be used as a standardised tool for learning sign language."}, {"heading": "3 Existing Research", "text": "Our study shows that there are currently no systems for converting Malaysian text to sign language. However, there are systems for converting text to ISL in other languages. Projects such as ViSiCAST use this notation to generate gestures. (Elliott et al. (2000) Elliott et al. (Elliott et al.) Elliott, Glauert, Kennaway and Marshall) Our system follows an approach of directly converting user input to animation, without using interim notes. TESSA is a system for translating language into British Sign Language. (Elliott et al. (2000) Elliott et al. (Elliott, Glauert, Kennaway and Marshall.)

Our system follows an approach of directly converting user input into animation, without using interim notes."}, {"heading": "4 System Architecture", "text": "The proposed system works with Malaysian text as input. The first step is the POS tagger. Morphological analysis is performed to achieve this. During this step, different parts of the speech are identified, which is then fed to the optimizer, which removes unwanted words. The output of this module is then sent to the root module, which finds the root word, which is then fed to the animation module. The animation module animates the 3D human character based on the input received from the Emming module. The following image illustrates the entire process. Figure 1: DesignDuring the conversion of text to ISL, all inputs are not translated directly into the corresponding sign language. After this step, we omit certain words. This task is done with the help of the optimization module. The words in the input text must be converted into the basic form before they are converted into sign language."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "Animations are executed in free software tools running on Debian GNU Linux. Animations are modeled as a sequence of key images. Based on user input, various key images merge beautifully to create the appropriate animation. Except for complex facial expressions, other features are currently being modeled. Unlike systems that use a double notation to denote sign language, we directly convert input into sign language, which reduces the complexity of converting between different formats. Figure 2: Animation Page ViewThe animation can also be exported to run on smartphones."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "This paper is a prototype of a Malaysian Sign Language Translation text. It highlights the need to develop a standardised system for sign language learners in Kerala. The system proposed in this paper can be used as a system for standardising sign language usage in Kerala, which can easily be transferred to mobile phones and tablets, and can also be extended to convert text from websites into sign language forms. As one of the first attempts in Malay text to convert to ISL, we hope that this work will lead to further developments in the social and technological spheres, leading to the development of a standardised system for sign language learners."}], "references": [{"title": "Tessa, a system to aid communication with deaf people", "author": ["Cox et al.(2002)Cox", "Lincoln", "Tryggvason", "Nakisa", "Wells", "Tutt", "Abbott] Cox", "Stephen", "Michael Lincoln", "Judy Tryggvason", "Melanie Nakisa", "Mark Wells", "Marcus Tutt", "Sanja Abbott"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "al..2002.Cox et al\\.,? \\Q2002\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "al..2002.Cox et al\\.", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Prototype machine translation system from text-to-indian sign language", "author": ["Dasgupta", "Basu(2008)] Dasgupta", "Tirthankar", "Anupam Basu"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 13th international conference on Intelligent user interfaces", "citeRegEx": "Dasgupta et al\\.,? \\Q2008\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dasgupta et al\\.", "year": 2008}, {"title": "The development of language processing support for the visicast project", "author": ["Elliott et al.(2000)Elliott", "Glauert", "Kennaway", "R.
