ESWN is commented by WordNet by automatically adding the terms \"positivity,\" \"negativity\" and \"neutrality\" for each synset. In SentiWordNet, Synset is a set of synonymous terms. A synset is defined as a tuple containing 6 fields, including POS (part of the speech), ID (synset identifier), PosScore (positive score), Negative Score (negative score), Term (a word representing a concept), Gloss (a definition of the term and an example sentence using the term) delimited by a < tab >.

Generating VSWN", "text": "After examining the construction of ESWN 3.0, ISWN, in conjunction with the available resources for Vietnamese, we consulted the following assessments: (1) the method of creating ESWN 3.0 is a prominent method when the WordNet is available, and (2) the method of building ISWN is only appropriate with the construction of the original SentiWordNet, as it depends entirely on machine translation, but there are major problems in applying the method of ESWN 3.0: (1) There are no available seed sets, as Turney and Littman [9] (TLSeeds) have contributed in Vietnamese, and (2) WordNet for Vietnamese is not available at the time of this essay. Finally, we propose to use translation methods to replace TLSeeds, and then the method of machine learning to generate VSWN from Vdict. Here we describe in detail our approach to constructing VSWN."}, {"heading": "3.1 Framework overview", "text": "The overview of our approach is illustrated in Figure 2. In our approach there are two main phases: (1) construction of the VSWN core phase and (2) semi-supervised learning phase.

In the second phase we construct two classifiers using the VSWN core to calculate opinion-related properties for all synsets.

Experiment", "text": "To get the most effective SentiWordNet, the two classifiers must have the highest performance.

These data are divided into three sets, including (1) training set, (2) development set and (3) test set in a ratio of 3: 1: 1. Specifically, we perform a quadruple validation of the training set and development set to select the most appropriate parameters that would then be applied to the test set to obtain the final classification performance. As the positive classifier and negative classifier use the same combination method from the same training data, we only measure the classification performance of the positive classifier thanks to the performance of the negative classifier, would change the same or slightly, but not be too different from the positive classifier. As shown from the outset, without Vietnamese resources, a standard sentiment wordlist is not available for gold-manually controlled voice-6."}, {"heading": "4.2 Evaluate classifiers", "text": "In Table 1, the classification performance in the sense of F1 values of the positivity classifier is with different values from in SVM for token-based and word-based model. Therefore, these options are selected to train the positivity classification (or negativity classification).4.3 Valuation of VSWN After examining the two evaluation methods of building ESWN and building ISWN, we have found that the former is better than the latter for a reason. The evaluation step should focus only on how good the SentiWordNet is, rather than performing the evaluation task at application level. Therefore, we have decided to use a gold standard to measure our contributing SentiWordNet. In the evaluation step, Kanddall tau () distance is used to measure the resulting VSWN. Table 2 reports the values for thepositivity and negativity classifications, measured against the standard wording list."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have presented a thorough examination of SentiWordNet's construction methods for generating VSWN. Our main contributions to this work are three: (1) building a semantic wordlist for the Vietnamese gold standard for evaluation; (2) generating VSWN without using Vietnamese WordNet; and (3) proving that the resulting VSWN is worth another study. Since the glosses in Vdict are short texts, performance easily suffers from a problem of thrift. Therefore, solving the thrift problem to achieve better performance is our essential further study."}], "references": [{"title": "Sentiwordnet: A publicly available lexical resource for opinion mining", "author": ["Andrea Esuli", "Fabrizia Sebastiani"], "venue": "LREC - Language Resources and Evaluation", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Sentiwordnet 3.0: An enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining", "author": ["Stefano Baccianella", "Andrea Esuli", "Fabrizio Sebastiani"], "venue": "LREC - Language Resources and Evaluation,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Recognizing contextual polarity in phrase-level sentiment analysis", "author": ["Andrea Esuli", "Fabrizia Sebastiani"], "venue": "North American Chapter of the Association for Computation Linguistics-NAACL,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2005}, {"title": "A high-coverage lexical resource for opinion mining", "author": ["Andrea Esuli", "Fabrizia Sebastiani"], "venue": "Technical Report 2007-Tr-02.
