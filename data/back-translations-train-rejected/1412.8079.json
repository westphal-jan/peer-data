PROPOSED MODEL FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS", "text": "In the proposed sentiment analysis model, after preprocessing, a stemming step is used to remove redundancy from the feature space, then we use a feature select method to achieve better performance with the features and reduce computing costs, and finally we use a classifier learning algorithm as a training step. To describe the proposed sentiment analysis model, we will discuss the stemming and learning steps in this section and present the proposed feature select approach among other feature select approaches."}, {"heading": "3.1. Stemming", "text": "Parentage or lemmatization is the reduction of a word to a more general form, possibly its root. For example, the origin of the term \"interesting\" can give rise to the term \"interesting.\" The Persian language has a complicated morphology. In the Persian language, suffixes and prefixes are linked to words to change meaning. Like English nouns, Persian nouns are added to signify possession and plurality. On the other hand, Persian verbs are modified more comprehensively than English verbs. Persian verbs vary according to tension, person, negation and mood. Therefore, a particular verb can have different forms and variations. In this study, we have reimplemented Taghva-Persian tribe based on the algorithm presented in (Taghva, Beckley and Sadeh, 2005)."}, {"heading": "3.2.

In this problem, we use a vector model to represent the attribute space.

Therefore, the challenges of Persian sentiment analysis are discussed first, followed by data collection, evaluation metrics, the use of cross-validation, and important experimental results."}, {"heading": "4.1. Persian language", "text": "One of the biggest challenges is the lack of comprehensive solutions or tools for tasks such as stemming, POS tagging and feature selection. One of the consequences is the achievement of a very large vector space, so the process is very time consuming and leads to weak results. Another challenge of the Persian language is the use of a variety of declensional suffixes. Tables 2 and 3 show examples of different suffixes in the Persian text. Another common problem of the Persian text is the word spacing. In addition to the white space as intermediate spaces, an intra-word space called pseudo-space separates the part of the word. The use of white space or the non-use of a space instead of pseudo-space is a major challenge in Persian reviews. For example, in the sentence \"The word is used as a formal space in the Persian language."}, {"heading": "4.2. Data", "text": "To test our methods, we compiled a dataset of 1020 online customer reviews in Persian language from various brands of mobile phone products such as Nokia, Apple, Samsung, Sony, LG, Motorola, Huawei and HTC (Saraee and Bagheri, 2013). We commissioned two annotators to mark customer reviews by selecting a positive or negative polarity at the review level. After the comment, the dataset reached 511 positive and 509 negative reviews."}, {"heading": "4.3. Cross validation", "text": "A supervised learning algorithm requires some data, which must be referred to as training data and some as test data (Hu and Liu, 2004b) These two sets of data must be separated to prevent false results in evaluating the results of the methods. Therefore, it usually requires multiple runs of experiments with different sets of data per revolution. One of the approaches that splits the data set and performs the experiment is N-fold cross-validation. N-fold cross-validation consists in dividing the data set into N-subsets of the same size. At each turn, one set is used for the test and the rest for training the system. In our case, 5-fold cross-validation is used. At each turn, 4 folds are used for training and learning and one for the test, so that each subset is used once for testing purposes. Afterwards, the average of all 5 experiments is used as an estimate of the performance of the classifier."}, {"heading": "4.4.

With n-gram traits and pedigree table 6, we show the F-score results in the two phases. From the results, we can deduce that the use of n-gram traits and pedigree of sensations show 4% and 0.3% improvements in the negative and positive classes. In this work, we applied four different traits, MI, DF and MMMI with the Naive Bayes learning algorithms in the online assessments. In the experiments, we found that the use of traits with learning algorithms can trigger improvements in assessments."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS", "text": "This paper presents a study on four approaches to feature selection in the sentiment analysis of Persian documents. In this work, we have proposed a new approach to feature selection, MMI, in sentiment classification. In addition, we have applied three additional feature selection approaches, DF, MI and TFV, using the Naive Bayes learning algorithm to online reviews of Persian mobile phones. As the results show, the use of feature selection in sentiment analysis can improve performance. In our future work, we will focus more on the sentiment analysis of Persian text. We will focus our classification model on word-level analysis broadening approaches and opinion-identification and opinion-targeting approaches for Persian text. In addition, we will apply the Naive Bayes learning algorithm to online reviews of Persian mobile phones. Based on the definition of MMI, this is a promising approach that can be used in other applications of data mining."}], "references": [{"title": "Cultural algorithms: emerging social structures for the solution of complex optimization problems, International", "author": ["Ali M.

sentiment analysis has received more and more attention between information retrieval and natural language processing researchers. Sentiment analysis aims to use automated tools to detect subjective information from reviews. One of the main challenges in sentiment analysis is feature selection. Feature selection is widely used as the first stage of analysis and classification tasks to reduce the dimension of problem, and improve speed by the elimination of irrelevant and redundant features. Up to now as there are few researches conducted on feature selection in sentiment analysis, there are very rare works for Persian sentiment analysis. This paper considers the problem of sentiment classification using different feature selection methods for online customer reviews in Persian language. Three of the challenges of Persian text are using of a wide variety of declensional suffixes, different word spacing and many informal or colloquial words. In this paper we study these challenges by proposing a model for sentiment classification of Persian review documents. The proposed model is based on lemmatization and feature selection and is employed Naive Bayes algorithm for classification. We evaluate the performance of the model on a manually gathered collection of cellphone reviews, where the results show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "creator": "ABBYY PDF Transformer 2.0"}}}
