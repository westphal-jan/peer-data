QANUS is a framework on which new QA systems can be developed easily and quickly. QANUS makes it easy to build new QA systems because only a minimal set of components need to be implemented in addition to the provided framework. To demonstrate the usefulness and practicality of QANUS, a reference implementation of a QA system QA-SYS has been developed, with QA-SYS also being made available to the community. When it is ready, QANUS can provide a system to ensure availability to everyone that it is available to everyone."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "There have been previous efforts to generalize the architecture of QA systems. Hirschman and Gaizauskas (2001), for example, described a pipelined approach to QA (HG-01), in which different stages are combined in series to form a QA system. Figure 1 highlights the different stages in their pipeline compared to the stages found in QANUS. Informal correspondence between the different stages of the two pipelines is also shown in the figure. HG-01 \"s architecture is tilted toward state-of-the-art QA systems. (IR) techniques involve manipulating the lexical and syntactic form of the nature text and do not attempt to understand the semantics of the text. Systems that use these techniques to retrieve information (Hickl et al)."}, {"heading": "3 QANUS Framework", "text": "This year, more than ever before in the history of the city, where it has come to the point where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, where it is a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a, a, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a, a place, a place, a, a, a place, a, a, a place, a, a, a, a place, a place, a, a, a place, a, a, a place, a place, a, a place, a, a place, a, a, a, a place, a, a, a, a, a place, a place, a, a, a, a, a place, a, a, a, a place, a, a, a, a, a"}, {"heading": "3.1 Additional Components", "text": "The four stages of the QP system establish the data flow through the entire QP pipeline and form the backbone of any instantiated QA system. To realize the framework and maintain a fully functional QA system, additional components, as shown in the lower half of Figure 2, must be included in the framework. To get a better picture of how these components can be incorporated into the QP system, we need to go through an example of question processing (QP)."}, {"heading": "4 Implementation of QA-SYS", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one is able to go in search of a solution."}, {"heading": "5 Future Work", "text": "QANUS and QA-SYS are currently in the development phase. QANUS is relatively mature, has undergone several iterations of improvements and is now focused on improving the performance and functionality of QA-SYS.Performance. Over the years, the results from the QA track are compared and irrelevant. There is also a trend towards using the web as a tool for QA. The web is dynamic and such a QA system is unlikely to generate the same results in different periods of time."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "The lack of collectively available QA systems makes it difficult to create new QA systems and perform comparisons across published studies. This motivated our work on an open source QA framework QANUS. The framework implements much of the code required for a QA system and reduces the development effort required to build new systems. It is carefully designed to be flexible and supports the use of a wide range of QA techniques. In order to demonstrate the usefulness and practicality of QANUS, we have also implemented a fully functional factoid QA system QA-SYS. Our goal is to improve QA-SYS so that it serves as a useful and accessible starting point for comparing future QA systems and technologies."}], "references": [{"title": "AskMSR: Question answering using the worldwide Web", "author": ["Banko et al.2002] M.
