So far, the solutions have been primarily manual which elicit human observation of entities to discern the hostility of the situation. To cater to this problem statement, a number of fully automated and partially automated solutions exist. But, these solutions lack the capability of learning from experiences and work in conjunction with human supervision which is extremely prone to error. In this paper, a generalized methodology to predict the hostility of a given object based on its movement patterns is proposed which has the ability to learn and is based upon the mechanism of humans of learning from experiences. The methodology so proposed has been implemented in a computer simulation. The results show that the posited methodology has the potential to be applied in real world tactical scenarios.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 Jan 2015 09:07:45 GMT  (282kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00653v1", "To appear in IEEE Xplore as a part of the proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing, 2014, at Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in IEEE Xplore as a part of the proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing, 2014, at Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["souham biswas", "manisha j nene"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.00653"}, "pdf": {"name": "1501.00653.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Hostile Intent Identification by Movement Pattern Analysis: Using Artificial Neural Networks", "authors": ["Souham Biswas", "Manisha J.

Basis of Hostility Detection", "text": "One of the most striking features of the human brain is the tendency to correlate between new information and previous \"experiences\" in order to draw conclusions. [7] The degree of this correlation and the subsequent processing of it allow us to make fuzzy predictions [6] or, in one way or another, form an intuition. [7] The term hostility in general is based on previous experiences of such situations endured by an individual. When presented with a scenario for detecting hostility, the brain attempts to detect the degree of similarity between the new situation and a catalog of \"hostile\" situations that have occurred before. A great similarity requires evasive action. In summary, steps are taken to ensure that the sequence of events that led to the previously sustained events of hostility are not repeated. To model this as an automated solution, we consider neural networks."}, {"heading": "B. Assumptions & Parameters Involved", "text": "In order to parameterise a given situation for neural network formation, we have to consider the locations of the objects as multiple.

Other parameters derived from the locations of objects such as the speed and direction of the object, density of objects in a particular area, etc., are also compiled and added as inputs to the neural network.

Generation of Normalized Training Data", "text": "The normalization refers to the generation of all permutations of the sets & for all from 1 to 1. This process is important because the same object index must not be assigned to an enemy object every time it is located within the observation area. Let us assume, for example, that the neural network is assigned using and in the data set is assigned to an object index for some; then the system will not be able to successfully identify this enemy object because it has been trained to identify the hostile properties of the object at the index and not at the index. Although, if the system is also trained using all permutations of and as input or output, the enemy object will always be identified independently of the object index assigned to it. To explain the normalization process, we consider a scenario with 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5."}, {"heading": "C.

Similarly, the hostility of the object with an index. During the training, we set and move the value from 1 to. In each iteration, the system is trained on the basis of backpropagation and gradually the certainty with which the system predicts the hostility probability of each object increases. We repeat this process for each training data set, i.e. for all 1. But in each data set, only 70% should be used for training, 20% for validation and the remaining 10% for testing purposes.
