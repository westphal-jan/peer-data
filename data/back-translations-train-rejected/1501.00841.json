This study also found that the two translations were also very distinct from each other. Burrows (2002) also examined English translations of Juvenal using the Delta Method. The results of this work suggest that some translators are more adept at hiding their own style when translating works by another author, while other authors tend to imprint their own style more strongly in the work they translation.Our work examines the writings of a single author, the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, and these writings, which translate both into German and English to examine the distinguishable characteristics of the texts defined here."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "Kenners & Tweedie (2003) conducted experiments with pastiche, the author in question was Lewis Carroll, and the pastiche was a modern children's fable written by Gilbert Adair called Alice through the Needle's Eye, in which the author attempted to imitate Carroll's style in works such as Through the Looking Glass and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Various techniques used in attributing authorship were used in the task, including methods of lexical riches, principal component analysis, cusum technique1, and others. Some methods distinguished the pastiche from the original and somstiche, unless the original method of assigning texts was called into question."}, {"heading": "3 Experimental Setup", "text": "These experiments used three works by Henrik Ibsen, A Doll's House (1879) Ghosts (1881) and The Master Builder (1892) 2. Electronic versions of these plays were sourced from Ibsen.net3 and Project Gutenberg. Contributions from each character are extracted using PlayParser4. All stage instructions are discarded in this step, leaving only the remaining character dialog. The method splits all texts associated with a category (here persona or play) into chunks of the same size. In pairs, similarity metrics are calculated for all chunks. The metric is just the average chi-square calculation of the distribution differences between the pairs of files that appear in both files. Different types of tokenization capture different linguistic characteristics for which distributions within and between text categories could be taken into account."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 First Experiment", "text": "The first experiment attempts to compare character homogeneity in different languages; the second experiment compares two different translations of the same play to quantify the similarity between parallel translations; Table 1 shows the plays and their respective translators; as mentioned above, the first 10k text per character was examined and this was divided into 5 sections; therefore, the criterion for inclusion in the study was that the character should contain at least 10k text and 11 characters, as detailed in Table 2; in the first experiment only the version of ghosts translated by Archer is used; the results mentioned in the next section have statistical significance; the results of the first experiment showed that character homogeneity varies to some extent across the translations; the character dioleects are not necessarily preserved to the same extent as the originals; when letter frequencies are measured, the Norwegian original language characters prove to be more homogeneous than the translations; examples include Engand's character, but are not necessarily found to be homogeneous in the English and Norwegian categories."}, {"heading": "5 The Second Experiment", "text": "The second experiment attempted to determine whether two translations of the same original text into the same language are distinguishable by the translator, as in Rybicki's work, which delineated the work from each page, observing the preservation of the idiolect in each. The experimental setup was similar to the first experiment with the character contributions, which were separated and divided into five files each. However, this time, the characters from the two translations of Ghosts by William Archer and Robert Farquharson Sharp were compared with each other. Our results were that the characters from Archer's translation were generally more homogeneous than those from Sharp's translation. Of the characters that were not homogeneous, the text segments were more similar to the segments of the same character by the corresponding author than any other writings by the same author. Sharp's characters tended to be more similar to the corresponding character of Archer than vice versa, indicating that both authors managed to perform faithful translations that were not strongly influenced by their own style."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In the course of this research, character diolects in the translation were researched. In future work, various parameters will be compared, as well as the comparison of different text selections of the characters considered and the comparison of translations of different authors by the same translator.Notes 1See Farringdon (1996) for a detailed explanation of the origins of this technique, including detailed examples of the use of the method in a legal context. 2For the English versions of the plays, the printed versions are collected in Ibsen, Archer, Aveling, Archer & Archer (1890), Sharp's translations can be found in Sharp (1911), Ibsen's collected works in German are found in Ibsen (1898) and the collected Norwegian works can be found in Ibsen & Bull (1957) 3 http: / www.ibsen.net, the last verified on 6 January 2015, which contains comprehensive information about Ibsen's life and work together with his theatre first translations."}], "references": [{"title": "The Englishing of Juvenal: Computational Stylistics", "author": ["J.
