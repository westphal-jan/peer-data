INTRODUCTION MUSEUMS are no longer just institutions that acquire, store and expose our heritage. Going to a museum is a learning activity, but also a pleasure for visitors. With the advent of the Web, curators and cultural intermediaries have decided to engage in collaborative and numerical culture to attract a wider public. Today, almost all museums have a website, but only a few of them allow visitors to prepare their visit in the best conditions. Some art, science and social museums collaborate with research laboratories to develop new technologies that improve services in museums in response to the wishes of existing and potential visitors. However, there are still difficulties in studying epistemological barriers to the expectations and intentions of different audiences, including online visitors. Knowing why people want to come and visit museums could suggest automated systems to save their tour and give them the best knowledge of the exhibited works."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "A first model [1], developed in 2010, proposes to formulate the problem of visitor guidance as an extension of the planning problem in open business (in which each group of visitors is a job and each interesting room is a machine); each group of visitors must go through all the rooms, but it is impossible for two groups of visitors to be in the same room at the same time; this limitation may lead to less than optimal or unfeasible solutions if there are more groups of visitors than rooms in the museum (which is the case if we consider each individual visitor as a group); relying on the limited programming model [2] we propose to reduce the number of variables used; in [2] they create a route by calculating the smallest number of steps required to pass through the museum (to visit all the rooms); this model requires that each work of art be presented as K variables (one per step); due to the fact that museums often have several thousand works of art, it leads to a huge number of variables."}, {"heading": "III. ARTWORK DESCRIPTION ANALYSIS USING TEXTUAL ENERGY", "text": "By analyzing the description provided by the museum, we have tried to differentiate them. Automatic Text Summary (ATS) techniques by extraction [4], [5], [6] allow to classify a series of text segments (sentences, paragraphs, etc.) according to the measure of similarity. The Textual Energy Algorithm (Enertex) converts a text document into a physical object and uses statistical physics to measure its energy [7]. This energy, to which we should refer as Textual Energy, is then calculated and applied to the summary. The physical model of Textual Energy results in a single non-iterative algorithm of low complexity. Therefore, Textual Energy enables the redefinition of the sentence sequence in simple and efficient matrix operations. The resulting algorithms are easily applicable to obtain larger texts without major post-processing results."}, {"heading": "A. Starting point: Hopfield Model", "text": "Hopfield's approach [8], [9] was based on the magnetic Ising model to build a Neural Network (ANN) with pattern learning capacities; the capacities and limitations of this ANN (associative memory) were well established within a theoretical framework [8], [9]: the patterns must not be correlated to obtain free error recovery, the system saturates quickly and only a small fraction of the patterns can be stored correctly. Despite these major disadvantages, Hopfield contributed to the ANN theory by introducing the concept of energy by analogy with magnetic systems; a magnetic system is a series of N-spins like small magnets that can assume multiple orientations; the simplest model is the dipole one or Ising model, in which there are only two opposite possible orientations: above (\u2191 or + 1) or below (\u2193 or 0). Ising magnetic model has been used in a wide variety of systems that can be fully described by a series of possible configurations [10]."}, {"heading": "B. Energy as a document similarity measure", "text": "The vector-space model (VSM) is also applied to texts, because [12] after a bag of sentences word representation (vectors represent sentences and3Hebb [9] suggests that synaptic connections change according to the correlation between neuronal states. However, a document leads to a matrix of P-lines \u00b7 N-columns. We have used VSM to represent documents in our model: a sentence (a row vector) corresponds to an exhibiting spin chain and a document (a magnetic system) is represented by a matrix of P-lines \u00b7 N-columns. Therefore, sentences can be studied as issuing spins in our magnetic system. More formally, with a vocabulary of N-words (terms) it is possible to represent a sentence as a chain of N-spins, i = 1, \u00b7 N. A document with P-chains is formed by P-chains in the vector space of the N dimension."}, {"heading": "IV. PERSONALIZED TOUR RECOMMENDATION PROBLEM", "text": "The Personalized Tour Recommendation Problem (PTRP) can be considered an optimization problem and solved by optimization techniques. To this end, we first model the museum topology as a graph and then formulate the problem under investigation as an Integrated Linear Programming (ILP) example. Therefore, the optimal personalized tour can be achieved by solving the ILP model we propose."}, {"heading": "A. Museum modeling", "text": "A museum is modeled as a 7x G = < V, A, E, X, P, r >, where: \u2022 V is the set of vertices, each vertice is an exhibition room, an entrance or an exit of the museum. \u2022 A is the set of arches that connect different rooms. \u2022 This is an arc series of A between two vertices i and j, if we can go directly from room i into room j without going through other rooms. \u2022 E is the set of entrances of a museum, which is a subset of V, i.e. E-V. \u2022 X is the set of exits of a museum, which is also a subset of V, i.e. X-V is the set of all artworks in the museum. \u2022 r is a mapping function P \u2192 V. For each artwork p-P, r (p) is the room in which the corners are located. Some large museums may have multiple entrances and exits, which is why E and X are two subgroups of V."}, {"heading": "B.

We used Enertex as follows: 1) We created an XML file with the following information for each work of art: the title, the name of the artist, the description of the artwork and the description of the artwork."}, {"heading": "C. Evaluation", "text": "To evaluate the output tour, we measure the relevance portion, which is defined as follows: rp = 100 \u0445 \u0445 p-T f (p) \u2211 p-P f (p) (21), where T is the number of artworks proposed in the tour (i.e. T P) and f is the interest rate function used (as seen above). The relevance portion rp denotes a visitor satisfaction rate."}, {"heading": "D. Results", "text": "For each function f, we ran the program with different time limits of 30 to 330 minutes (the time needed to visit the entire collection) in increments of 15 minutes. For f2 and f3, we randomly created 5,000 combinations of 2, 3, 4 and 5 artists (i.e. the same combinations are used for f2 and f3) and calculated the arithmetic mean relevance percentage for each duration. Figure 4 shows the evolution of rp for each function f. As expected, the first interest function f1 generates a linear evolution of the relevance percentage (since all artworks have the same interest, the tour includes the largest number of artworks).With Enertex, we are able to offer visitors efficient tours that want to discover the museum (without special preferences).The combination of visitor preferences and intrinsic preferences leads to the best results up to a 49% improvement in relevance."}, {"heading": "VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS", "text": "This research addresses the problem of optimizing museum visits according to visitors \"preferences and the importance of the artworks. As a first milestone for the next works, taking into account individual behavior during museum visits, an original model is created that combines computer optimization and automatic learning using artificial intelligence. We first designed the optimization framework based on graph theory to depict the spatial organization of the museum (including spaces and paths), which requires Integrated Linear Programming to maximize overall visitor satisfaction and generate an optimal path, i.e. a series of spaces and artworks to be viewed by the visitor. In addition, we calculate an analysis of the artworks through natural language processing based on textual energy (using an algorithm called Enertex), which results in a ranking of the various artworks according to the descriptions given by the museum related to their artistic significance."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The authors thank the Department of Vaucluse (France) and FR Agorantic for their financial support (projects @ MUSE and InfoMuse)."}], "references": [{"title": "The museum visitor routing problem", "author": ["V.F.
