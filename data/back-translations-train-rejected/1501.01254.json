BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM OF UNKNOWN WORDS", "text": "The occurrence of unknown words is one of the most common problems that arise in part of the process of language tagging, i.e., the words that appear in sentences but are not included in the training corpus. New words are constantly entering the language, acronyms and proper names are very often created, and new nouns and verbs are added to the language at a surprising rate. Thus, it is impossible to train the tagger for every possible word in the language. Therefore, unknown words are not negligible in POS tagging. Thus, in order to build a full tagger, taggers must be created with some knowledge of the keyword for an unknown word. There are two approaches to treating unknown words in the language: the first approach is to construct a complete lexicon, then treat unknown words in a simple way. The second approach is to reject input. The second approach is to attempt to analyze the word at the time of encounter with a set of humanly defined rules: the first approach is to construct a complete lexicon, then treat unknown words in a simple way."}, {"heading": "III. OPEN CLASS VS CLOSED CLASS WORDS", "text": "Traditionally, the definition of POS is based on morphological and syntactical functions. Similar to most other languages, POS in Sinhalese can also be divided into two broad categories: closed classes and open classes. Closed classes are those that have relatively fixed members. Closed classes are generally function words: usually very short, common, and play an important role in grammar. In contrast, open classes are the type to which each language can include a larger number of words, and new words are constantly coined or borrowed from other languages. Words that normally contain the main content of a sentence belong to the category of open word classes. In Sinhalese, all nouns and verbs can be placed under open word classes. However, Nipatha and Upasarga behave different behavior in Sinhalaic grammar. Words belonging to Nipatha and Upasarga are not changed according to time and gender, but Upasarga always combine with nouns and provide additional (improved) meanings."}, {"heading": "IV. ANALYSIS OF MORPHOLOGICAL AND SYNTACTICAL", "text": "Language analysis based on FEATURESNLP is based mainly on morphological and syntactical characteristic analysis of a language, and the availability of lexical resources is crucial for these tasks. Therefore, a corpus for a language is an important lexical resource in the field of NLP. In order to make the corpus more useful for linguistic research, they must comment with appropriate knowledge sources so that they are suitable for processing with linguistic applications. An example of the annotation of a corpus is the version of the corpus developed by the UCSC as part of the PAN Localization project in 2005, in which information about the part of the speech (verb, noun, adjective, etc.) is added to the corpus in the form of daily sentences. The corpus we use in this research is the beta version of the corpus developed by the UCSC as part of the PAN Localization project in 2005."}, {"heading": "A. Most Frequent Words in Sinhala Text Corpus", "text": "In order to observe the most common words, a unique word list with frequencies and a possible part of the language names was extracted from the corpus. For simplicity, only the top 20 words were taken into account in the analysis. Table I contains the word list with frequencies and possible parts of the language categories. It is observed that the most common words in the Sinhalese language are functional words belonging to the category of closed classes. 11 out of 20 words belong to Nipatha, which are all functional words, 6 common verbs are also included in the list. It is also observed that there is an ambiguity of marking with highly frequent words, although they are functional words. Among the top 20 words, there are two words, \"hang\" and \"hang,\" which are not properly placed in the respective parts of the language categories."}, {"heading": "B. Zipf\u2019s Law Analysis", "text": "Zipf's law states that the frequency of occurrence of an instance of a class is approximately inversely proportional to the rank of that class in the frequency list, for example, occurrence of words in a document. Thus, the purpose of this test was to observe parts of the language distribution within the Sinhalese language that show the Zipf law behaviors. Suppose a word occurs f times and has a certain rank r in the list of word frequencies, if Zipf's law states that we have f = a / rb (for all words), where a and b are constants and b is close to minus 1 (-1). If you take the logarithm of each side of the equation, you get:"}, {"heading": "THE TOP 20 MOST FREQUENT WORDS IN SINHALA LANGUAGE (REFER", "text": "Table II contains the frequency of markers that occur in the corpus and are ordered in descending order, rank one has been assigned to the uppermost. Fig. I shows the graph of log (r) vs log (f) calculated for the data presented in Table II. From Fig. I we can observe that the marking frequencies roughly form a line from the upper left corner to the lower right corner of the chart, with the slope being close to -1. This indicates that the parts of the language distribution of the sine neck language also represent Zipp's legal behavior."}, {"heading": "THE TAG FREQUENCY WITH RANKING", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "C. Maximum Likelihood Estimate of the Tag Distribution", "text": "The purpose of this test is to observe the likelihood distribution of parts of speech markers in the Sinhalese text corpus and to understand which markers appear most likely. Table III contains the markers distribution obtained from the corpus. Marker frequency and number of different words related to each marker were counted in the corpus.The likelihood estimation (MLE) was calculated for each marker based on the number of markers occurring in the corpus against the total number of markers in the corpus.The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was calculated using the following methods:"}, {"heading": "TAG FREQUENCY IN THE CORPUS", "text": "Here c (t) is the number of a certain element and c (w) is the total number of words in the corpus. According to Fig. II, NNN (main word neutrum) seems to be the most common element in the corpus and seems to appear about three times more frequently than VP (verb participle). It is also noted that more than 50% of the words are nouns in the corpus, about 10% belong to verbs / verbs. In general, therefore, we can say that about 60% of the words in the Sinhalese language belong to the open class type, while about 40% of the words belong to the closed class type."}, {"heading": "D. Words distribution by Tag", "text": "The aim of this test is to analyze what kind of words exist mainly in the Sinhalese language. Fig. III is based on data from Table III, which shows the distribution of the number of different words by POS category in the corpus. It is observed that most words in the Sinhalese language are nouns, i.e. 13047 words out of a total of 18957 unique words in the corpus, which is almost 68% of the total number of words in the corpus."}, {"heading": "V. GUESSING PART OF SPEECH FOR UNKNOWN WORDS", "text": "In fact, we are in a position to go in search of a solution that enables us, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in a position, puts us in the position we are in."}, {"heading": "LIST OF CLOSED CLASS PARTS OF SPEECH CATEGORIES", "text": "In this research, we assume that every new word found in the part of the linguistic marking process of the Sinhalese language belongs to the category of open word categories, so the algorithm of the unknown word should dictate that every unknown word among all open class elements of the language elements is equally likely to be ambiguous. Subsequently, the tagger calculates the probability of the tag sequence and the maximum probability based on the text corpus and suggests the right tag. Furthermore, foreign words and numbers have been treated separately as they do not form a syntactic relationship with other language categories in the language."}, {"heading": "VI. EVALUATION", "text": "The evaluation of the system was mainly driven by training the system using the Sinhala text corpus, which consisted of 2754 sentences and 90551 words, and which contained data from newspaper articles of different genres.For the test data set, the data was carefully selected to test three different versions of the tagger.The first sentence was collected from the training corpus to test version 1 of the tagger, which consisted of 621 words known only to the system, and 36 sets. The second test set was also collected to test version 2 and 3 of the tagger.The data was drowned out of the Sinhala text corpus outside the trained dataset. The second test set consisted of 51 sentences, 1024 words. Of 1024 words, 171 words were unknown to the system. To evaluate the performance of the tagger, two gold standard test sets were created."}, {"heading": "LIST OF OPEN CLASS PARTS OF SPEECH TAGS", "text": "The tagger evaluated the tagged output by comparing it to the gold standard test set. Accuracy was calculated based on the number of correct tags suggested by the system and the total number of words in the sentence (s) using the following formula."}, {"heading": "VII. RESULT AND DISCUSSION", "text": "The performance of the tagger was measured using three different versions of progressively improved tagging mechanisms. Version 1 is the simplest form of the tagger that works only with known words that reject all unknown words as tagging errors. Version 2 is a slightly updated version that treats all unknown words as nouns and suggests NNN to any new word that occurs in the tagging process. Version 3 is the full version of the tagger that uses statistical techniques to guess the best tag for unknown words by taking into account the context of the surrounding words.Table VI shows the performance of our system for these three different versions of tagging mechanisms, and the experiment confirms the effectiveness of our unknown word-guessing techniques. As the performance of each tagging approach shows, version 2 shows a decrease in accuracy compared to the other two versions. This shows that the approach followed in version 2 when guessing parts of speech for unknown words is not a reliable method for the Sinhalal language version, which shows that most of the IV is divided between 1.950% accuracy for most of the words."}, {"heading": "PERFORMANCE OF THE TAGGER", "text": "However, the overall accuracy of the tagger has shown that the distinction between closed class and open class word categories is a powerful tool for handling unknown words for the Sinhalese language. However, tagging accuracy is still close to 92%, and this shows that more work needs to be done to refine the accuracy of the tagger. Therefore, the tagger can be recommended to improve its handling of unknown words. Mainly, morphological recognition can also be helpful in predicting possible language parts for many unknown words. Therefore, the overall performance of the tagger can be improved by using a hybrid approach, with the system gaining more knowledge through a set of handwritten rules. To ensure that this approach is more accurate, the results generated by the system need to be manually verified and the tagger retrained to ensure that the word is correctly tagged later."}, {"heading": "VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we have described two types of methods for handling unknown words in the POS marking of the Sinhalese language: The application of the methods in the Hidden Markov model based part of the approach to language marking (which we have already developed [1]) was evaluated and the results presented; implementation was tested on 90551 words, 2754 sentences of the Sinhalese text corpus and showed an accuracy of 91.5% in the tagging process of predicting tags to unknown words. Thus, the performance of the tagger proves that the distinction between closed-class and open-class words, as well as syntactical knowledge, are reliable sources of information for handling unknown words in parts of the Sinhalese language. Although this research suggested a reliable approach to handling unknown words in the POS marking, further improvements are needed to improve and optimize the algorithm. Therefore, several directions for future work are proposed here. Language-specific morphological characteristics can be helpful in predicting possible parts of the language."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We express our immense gratitude and thank Dr. Harsha Kumara for his invaluable support in providing an initiative for this work.
