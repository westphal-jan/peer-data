INTRODUCTION", "text": "In any case, however, it is a way in which people are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "In 2004, Liu and Hu made one of the early attempts at mining and summarizing customer reviews. They proposed a system for summarizing opinions using NLP (Natural Language Processing), which marks the parts of the speech for each word in the sentence. However, they used the association algorithm to break down common features to noun / noun phrases, analyzed adjective words for classification of positive and negative opinions, and used WordNet [6] dictionary to orient words. They also used the same system and attempt to break down opinions that have some specific characteristics of the product in question. [7] Another system called OPINE was proposed by Popescu et al. [8] OPINE is unattended information extraction systems that are able to identify the characteristics of the products and the opinions associated with them."}, {"heading": "3. ARCHITECTURE OF RUOMIS", "text": "This website contains detailed information about mobile phones of well-known mobile phone companies in Pakistan. This page also offers the possibility to post comments on each mobile phone page. Most of the comments are written in Roman Urdu, but some users also comment in English. The architecture of the RUOMiS is based on Figure 2. The system consists of four main steps. Browsing the website, translating Roman Urdu reviews into English, identifying opinion polarity and rating in graphical form. However, each step has some sub-steps. The details of each step and sub-step are given below.

After retrieving the data, it is passed to the Review Translation Module. Review 1 http: / / www.whatmobile.com.pk / Translator module queries the comments via Microsoft Bing Translation Service using the API. After the translated text is recovered, the next step is to analyze and highlight it."}, {"heading": "3.2 Parts of Speech Tagging", "text": "Since the identification of opinion polarity is based on the adjective used in the sentence, it is important at this point to identify the adjectives in the sentences. A portion of speech tagging is used for this identification purpose. SharpNLP [17] is used for POS tagging. It is a C-Sharp port of Java OpenNLP tools. OpenNLP is a library of machine learning tools [18]. It has built-in word processing capabilities such as tokenization, segmentation of sentences, PoS tagging, parsing chunking and many others. It is a very powerful tool, even if it can be used to extract triplets from the text [19]. In this case, the SharpNLP performs all the pre-processing of data such as tokenization, sentence segmentation and part-of-speech tagging. The following sentence shows a sentence with POS tags. \"The images are very clear.\""}, {"heading": "3.3 Opinion Words Extraction", "text": "Opinion word expresses the subjectivity of a sentence, whether it is positive, negative or neutral. These words help with the orientation of the sentence. Mostly, people show their opinion about a product based on opinion words. Adjectives describe words that classify its object or noun in the sentence. Adjective words are extracted from the review database using their adjective used by the POS tagger. Example: \"The images are very clear.\" In this sentence, word is clear adjective that describes the image quality."}, {"heading": "3.4 Opinion Sentence Identification", "text": "Each sentence that contains an opinion word is considered an opinion sentence. In order to examine the optimism and pessimism of the opinion word, an opinion word dictionary is designed manually. First, it consists of 200 positive and negative adjectives. The semantics of the opinion word is identified by comparing each opinion word with the local opinion dictionary. If the opinion word is positive, it is assigned to the positive category of this sentence. The opinion sentence depends mainly on the semantic orientation of the opinion words. If the sentence does not belong to either category, it is considered neutral."}, {"heading": "3.5 Rating / Recommendation", "text": "After identifying the opinion polarity, the system generates a summary of all comments and gives the output evaluation of the product. The evaluation of the product can then be integrated into the site-specific product. The evaluation of the product could be displayed in figures, pie charts or bar charts."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "Comments are divided into three categories: Positive Comments and Neutral Comments. Positive Comments are those where the user only replicates some of the features of the product, or a user only replies to other comments that have no polarity. However, it should also be noted that there were some comments that were not relevant to the product at all. These comments were posted either by a machine or by a user that contains some kind of comments. These comments are considered neutral comments. Table 1 contains different types of comments that were observed during the crash. Table 1 contains some of the negative comments that were found during the crash. Table 1 shows that the weather these comments are relevant to the product and also the weather."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "text": "The aim of this research was to help non-Urdu speaking customers to take advantage of the comments posted about some products in Roman Urdu. As the Romanagari is also supported here, this makes the tool more versatile. This research suggested an architecture that uses Natural Language Processing technology to find the polarity of opinion. In addition, a dedicated lexicon will be developed that contains positive and negative adjectives. The plan is to make this lexicon available to the public and give the public a way to insert new words into the database, but the lexicon will be maintained in the SQL database, where data cannot be stored semantically. Thanks to WordNet, it is a semantically maintained and easily accessible lexicon. The results of the experiment are satisfactory, as the memory of relevant results is 100% contained in the SQL database, where data cannot be stored semantically."}], "references": [{"title": "Mining and summarizing customer reviews. in Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "author": ["M.
