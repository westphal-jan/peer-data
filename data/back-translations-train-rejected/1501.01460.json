Centrality and dissimilarity", "text": "The problem of mapping centrality values to nodes in graphs has been widely studied because it is important to identify influential nodes [48]. Gao et al. [15] presented Evidential Semi-Local Centrality (ESC) and pointed out that it is more reasonable than existing centrality measures such as Degree Centrality (DC), Betweenness Centrality (BC) and Closeness Centrality (CC). When applying ESC, the degree and strength of each node are expressed first by bbas and then the merged meaning is calculated using the combination rule in the theory of belief. The higher the ESC value is, the more important the node. The detailed calculation process of ESC can be found in [15]. The similarity or dissimilarity of the index indicates the extent to which the proximity between two vertices of a graph is. The dissimilarity considered in this paper is the one that the distance of a network chain [49] may refer to a particular time chain."}, {"heading": "2.4.2.

For example, on the Twitter network, if all members of the community of fans of the Real Madrid Football Club (RMC) follow the official account of the team, and RMC must be the center of that community. RMC follows the famous football player at the club who is sure to be the center of the community of his fans. In fact, RMC has 10382777 followers and 30 followers (the data of 16 March 2014).

There are two types of correct decisions made by the clustering result: a true positive (TP) decision assigns two similar objects to the same cluster, while a true negative (TN) decision assigns two different objects to different clusters. Accordingly, there are two types of errors we can make at the same time: a false positive (FP) decision assigns two different types of objects to identical classes (each assigned different classes), while a false negative (FN) decision assigns two similar objects to different clusters. Let a (or b) be the number of pairs of objects assigned to identical classes (each assigned different classes) by the default reference partition and the class obtained.

As analyzed earlier, for MECM only discrepancies between objects are needed and only the intuitive assumptions need to be satisfied for the discrepancies.

This type of data is very common in the social sciences, psychology, etc., where all metric assumptions about the similarities / discrepancies cannot be guaranteed. Freedom for the data set leads to the limitation that the objects should be themselves. Nevertheless, this limitation seems reasonable for social networks, as the center of a community usually contacts the person (node) frequently with others.

Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced a median variant of the Evidential C-means (MECM) as a new prototype-based cluster algorithm in the present paper. The proposed approach is an extension of the median C-means and the median fuzzy C-means. It is based on the framework of faith function theory. The median-based clustering applied only requires the definition of the inequality between the objects. Therefore, it is not limited to a metric application in space. The prototypes of the clusters are limited to the data objects themselves. MECM offers us not only creative partitions, but also hard and blurred partitions as by-products by calculating pignistic probabilities. Furthermore, it could distinguish ignorance from uncertainty, while the fuzzy or crisp partitions could not be distinguished. By introducing inaccurate clusters, we could find some overlapped and indistinguishable clusters in the world to determine the mevidices for related nodes."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors thank the anonymous reviewers for all their comments that helped us to clarify and improve the quality of this work, which was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.61135001, 61403310)."}], "references": [{"title": "Community detection in complex networks: Multi\u2013objective enhanced firefly algorithm", "author": ["B.

The median variant relaxes the restriction of a metric space embedding for the objects but constrains the prototypes to be in the original data set. Due to these properties, MECM could be applied to graph clustering problems. A community detection scheme for social networks based on MECM is investigated and the obtained credal partitions of graphs, which are more refined than crisp and fuzzy ones, enable us to have a better understanding of the graph structures. An initial prototype-selection scheme based on evidential semi-centrality is presented to avoid local premature convergence and an evidential modularity function is defined to choose the optimal number of communities. Finally, experiments in synthetic and real data sets illustrate the performance of MECM and show its difference to other methods.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
