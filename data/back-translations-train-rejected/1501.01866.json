Ground work: WIVU and ETCBC", "text": "Since the 1970s, Eep Talstra, Constantijn Sikkel and a group of researchers at the VU Amsterdam have compiled a text database of the Hebrew Bible. This database began as a series of files containing the transcribed Hebrew text of the Bible after the Biblia Hebraica edition (Kittel 1968-1997). To this text, they added files with their observations of linguistic patterns to them as coded annotations, they tested the individual words, phrases, clauses and sentences, they refined the timid patterns against the data and added manual exceptions, resulting in a complex network of files containing the semi-automatically generated annotations. They have summarized these annotations in a form of annotations that are centric."}, {"heading": "3.
