PROBLEM FORMULATION", "text": "There, N targets move in a two-dimensional working area called asW, where N denotes the unknown number of total targets. For simplicity, there is no obstacle in the working area. The aim of the sensor is to designate the state estimate for all targets called Xk and the estimate of the target number called Tk, time step k. The states for the total targets at k are denoted by Xk = [x1k, x 2 k, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, xNk], which has N state vectors. The estimate of the total target state at k is denoted by Xk = [x1k, x 2 k, \u00b7 \u00b7, xT k. Let T k specify the estimate of the total target number at tk. The ith target is denoted as asxik = Fkx i \u2212 1 + p \u2212 k, (1), where the environmental state at k \u2212 k, (1) where the sensation of the sensation is not visible at Fk and Fk (2)."}, {"heading": "III.

Particle Filter Methods", "text": "The particle filter is a recursive estimation method based on Monte Carlo sequential simulations. Due to its recursive nature, particle filters are easily applicable to online data processing and variable inferences. More importantly, it is applicable to nonlinear system dynamics with non-Gaussian noise. PDF functions are presented with correctly weighted and displaced point mass, known as particles. These particles are scanned from a meaning density that is critical to the particle filtering algorithm and also referred to as suggestion distribution.

Kalman Filter Methods", "text": "The well-known Kalman filter is also a recursive method for estimating the system / target state based on a measurement sequence that minimizes the uncertainty of estimation.The measurement of the system state with an additive Gaussian noise is made by the sensor. In each iteration, the Kalman filter then consists of two precisions: i) it predicts the system state and its uncertainties; ii) it updates the system state and uncertainties with the measurement that becomes newly available.The system dynamics are given asxk = Fkxk \u2212 1 + Bkuk + \u03bdk (8), where subscript k and k \u2212 1 denote the current and previous time index, while Fk is the discrete transition matrix of the system and Bk and uk the control matrix and input. bsk is the white noise defined as Sik- and k-state, defined as Sik- x Byk state, with variance (N, Qk) being predetermined as Kk state."}, {"heading": "IV. METHODOLOGY", "text": "This paper uses a novel particle filtration technique where each particle filter is a potential problem.

SIMULATION AND RESULTS", "text": "As shown in Figure (1), the N cells, represented by blue dots, move in the two-dimensional working area. < k = k The entire working space is visible to a stationary sensor (not shown) and the working space is discredited in 12 \u00d7 12 cells, each cell representing a 1 \u00d7 1 rectangular area. The ith cell, referred to as Ci, i \u0445 C, is defined by [xuli, y i, x dr i], where C is the cell index set and (xuli, y ul i) and (x dr i), the right corner coordinates of the ith rectangular area are respected. 5 Only M cells can be measured in each time step k, and they do not have to be adjacent. The goal of the sensor is to estimate the target states and the target number at time k. In this paper, the information function based on divergence is used to measure the best M cells at each step."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "A Gaussian particulate filter, which combines Kalman filters and particulate filters, is presented in this paper to estimate the number and state of the total targets based on the measurements obtained online. It is represented by a series of weighted particles that differ from classical particle filters, where each particle is a Gaussian instead of a point mass. The weight of each particle represents the probability of the presence of a target, while its Gaussian indicates the state distribution for that target.6This approach is efficient for the problem of estimating the number of total targets and their state."}, {"heading": "VII.
