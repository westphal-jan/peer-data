First, we show that GreedyTree produces a tree whose maximum cost is selected within O (log n) of the optimal maximum cost for all DFEP functions. (F) Before starting the analysis, we first define the following conditions: for a given impurity function F (G) the impurity function is based on objects G; DF is the family of decision trees with F (L) = 0 for each of its Leaf L; OPT (S) is the minimum maximum cost among all trees in DF for the given input set of objects S; CostF (S) is the maximum cost of the tree built by GreedyTree based on functionality."}, {"heading": "4 Trade-off Bounds", "text": "Up to this point, we have focused on the construction of error-free trees. Unfortunately, the maximum cost criteria are very sensitive to outliers, and therefore often to trees with unnecessarily large maximum depth to accommodate a small subset of outliers in the datasets. Let's refer to the synthetic experiment in Section 5 for such an example. To overcome the sensitivity to outliers, we present an approach to constructing near-optimal trees with non-zero error rates. Instead of requiring all leaves to have zero impurity (F (L) = 0) in Section 1, we can stop recursion as soon as all leaves have impurity below a threshold (F (L)."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Results", "text": "We show the effect of outliers using a simple synthetic example in which a small group of outliers increases the maximum cost of the tree. We show that a small number of errors in the tree drastically reduces the cost of the tree, resulting in a small number of errors in trees at a significantly lower cost. We observe similar behavior with respect to the synthetic data for many of these data sets, where a small number of errors in trees is associated with significantly lower costs. We also see the impact of inadequacies on tree performance."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We characterize a broad class of permissible contamination functions that can be used in a greedy algorithm to provide O (log n) guarantees for the optimum maximum cost. We give examples of such permissible functions and show that they have different empirical properties, although they all enjoy the O (log n) guarantee. We continue to design permissible functions to facilitate an accuracy / cost compromise and demonstrate a cross-border classification error at cost. Finally, using real data sets, we show that our algorithm can actually censor the outliers and achieve high classification accuracy at a low maximum cost. To visualize such outliers, we construct a synthetic 2-D experiment and show that our algorithm successfully identifies them as outliers."}], "references": [{"title": "Group-based active query selection for rapid diagnosis in time-critical situations", "author": ["Bellala et al", "G. 2012] Bellala", "S.
