INTRODUCTION", "text": "A key area of research in educational technology and evaluation is modelling the likelihood that a student will respond correctly to a particular question; this modelling is used to analyze test responses, as in item response theory; in adaptive learning technologies, as in the use of Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (Corbett and Anderson, 1995) in smart tutoring systems; to analyze the areas studied by students, such as studying task transfer (Pavlik et al., 2011); and to understand student behaviors, such as gaming the system (Baker et al., 2004).Our work promotes this field by exploring alternative representations of reciprocity. Intuition is simple: as students practice an ability, we expect their understanding to increase and their performance to improve. Having recently succeeded in a task, it may become more likely that learning has occurred, and such a moment of learning should contribute to our prediction of successful performance."}, {"heading": "2. PRIOR WORK IN PERFORMANCE MODELING", "text": "In order to predict whether a student will successfully complete a task or not, we should therefore consider some characteristics of the student and the task. There are two main approaches to such modeling in the literature: graphical models, especially Bayesian knowledge tracing, and logistic regression models. A refinement of this approach is Linear Logistic Test Models (LLTM) (Fischer, 1973; de Boeck and Wilson, 2004). These logistic regression models replace the predictor in terms of the student's ability and the difficulty of the task. One refinement of this approach is Linear Logistic Test Models (LLTM) (Fischer, 1973; de Boeck and Wilson, 2004). These logistic regression models replace the predictor in terms of the difficulty of each task with a predictor that shares a basic skill or knowledge component (KC)."}, {"heading": "3.

RECENT-PERFORMANCE FACTORS ANALYSIS", "text": "The most recent Factor Analysis (R-PFA) focuses on recent history, not the complete practical history of a student (Galyardt and Goldin, 2014). The first intuition behind this model is that it is more likely that the student, having learned a skill, gets the next item right; if he has not learned that skill, a wrong reaction is more likely than a correct one. The second intuition is that the recent practice history with a KC may contain all the necessary information about whether a student has acquired the KC or not. We can associate this idea with a \"moment of learning.\" If a student has been successful with the most recent practice, then a moment of learning is likely to have already occurred. If the most recent attempts have not been successful, then the student has most likely not yet learned the KC."}, {"heading": "3.2. FORMAL MODEL DESCRIPTIONS", "text": "To comprehensively examine the R-PFA models, we examine a number of alternative models. The notation we use differs from other publications of some models, but we hope that our consistent use of notation in all models will facilitate the comparison.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "4.3. INTERPRETING THE BEST-PERFORMING MODEL", "text": "The best overall model for predicting future success from a student's history is R-PFA with 3 parameters for each KC: \u03b2j, the \"ease\" of the KC; \u03c1j, the effects of recent failures with the KC, and \u03b4j, the effects of recent successes with the KC. To study model parameters in detail, we must take into account that in a logistic regression model with random effects, estimates of coefficients may not be normally distributed when the data is sparse. This means that it may be inappropriate to use the estimated standard errors to obtain confidence intervals for the parameters. To address this problem, we need to recalibrate the most powerful model using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, as implemented in the MCMCglmm package in R (Hadfield, 2010).We are investigating the 95% posterior credible intervals (CI) for each KC parameter (Figure 6), with no limitations estimated on these coefficiencies."}, {"heading": "5. SIMULATION STUDY", "text": "The purpose of the simulation study was to compare R-PFA with other performance models without the limitations of real data sets. Two features of the wizard dataset examined above make thorough model comparison difficult. Firstly, the scarcity of data in the wizard data (Section 4.) precludes the use of cross-validation for model ranking. Nevertheless, cross-validation is a popular tool model comparison because holding data during model training can help prevent overmatch. Therefore, we compare R-PFA with other models both after cross-validation and after AIC. By using simulated data, we show that AIC is not only an appropriate measure for model selection, but that it is better than cross-validation with the frequently used 0-1 loss function, and it can absorb sparse datas.Secondly, the hold criterion used in the skill build function of aids leads to data being uncontrollable."}, {"heading": "5.1.
