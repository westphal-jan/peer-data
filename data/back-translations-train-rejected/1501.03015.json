This is typically a feature vector where each feature indicates the presence or absence of a molecular fragment. While the traditional approach to SAR modeling employed size restricted fingerprints derived from path fragments, much research in recent years focussed on mining more complex graph based fragments. Today, there seems to be a growing consensus in the data mining community that these more expressive fragments should be more useful. We question this consensus and show experimentally that fragments of low complexity, i.e. sequences, perform better than equally large sets of more complex ones, an effect we explain by pairwise correlation among fragments and the ability of a fragment set to encode compounds from different classes distinctly. The size restriction on these sets is based on ordering the fragments by class-correlation scores. In addition, we also evaluate the effects of using a significance value instead of a length restriction for path fragments and find a significant reduction in the number of features with little loss in performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 14:24:58 GMT  (1860kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03015v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.LG", "authors": ["albrecht zimmermann", "bj\\\"orn bringmann", "luc de raedt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.03015"}, "pdf": {"name": "1501.03015.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Exploring the efficacy of molecular fragments of different complexity in computational SAR modeling", "authors": ["Albrecht Zimmermann", "Bj\u00f6rn Bringmann", "Luc De Raedt"], "emails": ["name.lastname@cs.kuleuven.be", "bbringmann@deloitte.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of the people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance"}, {"heading": "II.

Similar search strategies can be used to find all substructures with a score above a user-defined threshold. Please note that we only use \u03c72 in this work, as previous work has shown that this leads to better results than the use of information gain [15].

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have conducted an empirical evaluation to gain insights into the reasons for the superiority of sequencers in molecular fragments as characteristics for classification, compared to complex ones. We find that the reason lies in the greater variety of sequences that lead to a more distinctive encoding of instances that effectively require better representation by the classifiers. [...] The number of fragments used is increased. [...] The worst score for fragments that have been mined with three different significance thresholds, and as length limited paths to work with. A linear way of improving the encoding is to increase the number of fragments used. However, our experiments show that there is a need for a much greater number of trees / graphics as sequences. Since these structures are also more expensive than enumeration, this leads to enormous complexity."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "We thank Kurt De Grave for his invaluable help in compiling this manuscript.
