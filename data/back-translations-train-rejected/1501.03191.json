Introduction", "text": "Automated translation lexicon induction has been studied in literature and has proven feasible for various language families and subgroups, such as Romance languages and Slavic languages (Mann and Jarowsky, 2001; Sch\u00e4fer and Jarowsky, 2002). Although there are some studies that examine the use of Swabian dictionary lists to identify Turkish language groups and loan candidates (van der Ark et al., 2007), we are not yet aware of any work on automated translation lexicon induction for Turkish languages. However, Turkish languages are well suited to explore this technology as they have many different lexical relationships both within the family and with languages outside the family through loanwords. In the case of Turkish languages, it is wise to use both cognate information and other etymological information in the automation of translation lexicon induction."}, {"heading": "2. Main Annotation System", "text": "One section of this dictionary contains English glossaries from 1996 and for each English glossary a corresponding translation into the following eight Turkish languages: Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tatar, Turkish, Turkmen, Uyghur and Uzbek. Table 1 shows an example of the English glossary \"living.\" If a language has an official Latin script, this script will be used. Otherwise, the transliteration of the dictionary will be displayed in brackets. Our annotation system consists of annotating each Turkish word with a two-character code. The first character will be a number indicating which words are cognate with each other, and the second character will indicate etymological information. Section 2.1.deals with the definition and annotation of cognates, and Section 2.2. deals with the definition and annotation of etymological information."}, {"heading": "2.1. Cognates", "text": "Following the example of the Oxford English Dictionary Online1, which was accessed on February 2, 2012, the two related languages are described as:... \"of words: Coming naturally from the same root, or represent the same original word, with differences due to subsequent separate phonetic development; also, English five, Latin quinque, Greek \u03c0\u03b5\u03bd, are cognate words, represent a primitive * penke.\" As this definition shows, the common genetic origin is the key to the concept of cognatness. A word is considered only as cognate with other words that originate from the same history. Nevertheless, in accordance with the conventions of previous research in computer linguistics, we use the word \"cognate.\" turk, 2001 \"words in different languages that are similar in form and meaning, without making a distinction between borrowed and genetically related words.\""}, {"heading": "2.2. Etymology", "text": "The second letter in the annotation of a word indicates a presumption of etymological origin, e.g. T for Turkic. The decision to comment on the origin of the word is motivated by its value in facilitating the development of technology for the cross-linguistic search for unknown forms. We therefore take a practical approach and balance the value of the annotation for this purpose with the effort required for the annotation. We have created the following code for the annotation of etymology: T for Turkish origin. These include compound forms and attached forms, the components of which are all Turkic. For example, the Turkmen word for \"manager,\" y olbas origin, is marked with Perstency because its composite base, y ol with bas and affix -c y are all Turkic in origin. An Arabic origin to include words indirectly from another language such as Persian is the word user."}, {"heading": "2.2.1. Multi-Language Exceptions", "text": "Other etymological annotation studies, such as the Loanword Typology Project and its World Loan Database (Haspelmath and Tadmor, 2009), have instructed linguists to skip such complex words and mark them optionally as \"Loanword Included Database,\" etc. Our annotation system requires that these words, which are very common in Turkish languages, be commented on by finer-grained categories. Below are our multilingual exceptions: X compound words where the components are of different origin, etc. The Tatar word for \"truck\" (yo \"k\" mashinas\u0131 \") must be marked as X because it is Russian-speaking (mashina),\" machine, vehicle \"associated with Tatar (yo\" k \"),\" luggage, etc."}, {"heading": "3. Inter-Annotator Agreement", "text": "We tested our annotation system with two annotators for 400 etymological annotations. [3] Both annotators studied linguistics. Both annotators are native English speakers with experience in learning or speaking several Turkish languages, Persian and Arabic. The training consisted of studying the authors \"annotation manual and asking possible follow-up questions. [3] Both annotators made approximately 240 annotations per hour. [4] Table 8 has 392 entries because the annotators claimed that eight entries had multiple translations for the same English gloss.Table 8 shows the contingency matrix for annotating the 400 centres.4 Table 8 immediately shows that the match is significant, and if there are discrepancies, it is mainly for the difficult cases of ambiguous origin and the multilingual exceptions: Q, X, V and N. We measured the interannotator match using Cohen's Kappa (1960) and found 1962 = 660.527 Kappa = 590.59."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "A necessary step in this direction is the creation of annotated data for relatives and etymology. However, this remark is not easy, as Turkish languages have extensive and varied etymological relationships between words. Some distinctions are difficult for annotators to make and some are easier. Furthermore, some distinctions are expected to be more useful than others for automating cross-language applications between Turkish languages. We presented an annotation methodology that balances the research effort of the annotator with the expected value of the annotations. We examined and explained the wide range of key relationships observed in Turkish languages and how to comment on them. When we finish the annotations, we would like to provide the annotated data as long as legally permitted. Finally, we hope that our annotation system and the related discussion can be useful for other teams."}, {"heading": "5. References", "text": "J. Cohen. 1960.
