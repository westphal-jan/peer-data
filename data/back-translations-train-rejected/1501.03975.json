A stability criterion based on Lyapunov approach is used to prove both asymptotic stability of estimation error and stability in the estimated parameters suitable for identification of nonlinear dynamic systems. The developed algorithm not only guarantees stability, but also reduces the computational demand compared to the OS-ELM approach based on recursive least squares. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on a real-world scenario, an advanced combustion engine identification problem is considered. The algorithm is applied to two case studies: An online regression learning for system identification of a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) Engine and an online classification learning (with class imbalance) for identifying the dynamic operating envelope of the HCCI Engine. The results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed SG-ELM is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art but adds stability and a reduction in computational effort.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Jan 2015 13:18:34 GMT  (5914kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03975v1", "This paper was written as an extract from my PhD thesis (July 2013) and so references may not be to date as of this submission (Jan 2015).

HCCI is achieved by compression ignition of the gas mixture in the cylinder; the fuel is injected early into the intake stroke and there is sufficient time to mix with air that forms a homogeneous mixture; a large proportion of the exhaust gas from the previous cycle is retained to increase the temperature and thus the reaction rates of the fuel and air mixture."}, {"heading": "A. Experiment Design", "text": "In order to identify both models of HCCI state variables and models of dynamic operating limits in transient operation, an appropriate experiment design is required to obtain transient data from the motor. Modelled variables such as motor states and operating envelope are dynamic variables, and in order to capture both transient and stationary behavior, a series of dynamic experiments at constant speeds and naturally sucked-in conditions (no charge / turbocharging) is performed by varying FM, IVO, EVC and SOI in a uniformly random manner. In each input step, the motor makes a transition between two set conditions and the transition (transient or dynamics) is recorded as time data. To capture multiple such transients, an amplitude modulated pseudo-random binary sequence (ACCBS) has been used to design the excitation signals. APRBS enables the drive unit to determine the frequencies to be suitable for the operation of the amplituator and the incoming amplituators in the 15 \u00b0."}, {"heading": "B.

As already mentioned in [38], the HCCI operating range is conceptually limited to a small range of permissible unburnt (pre-combustion) and burnt (post-combustion) charging temperature states. As previously mentioned, sufficiently high unburnt gas temperatures are required to achieve ignition in the HCCI operating range without complete misfiring occurring. If the resulting combustion cannot achieve sufficiently high combustion temperatures, which often occurs under low fuel conditions, in order to cause these dilution ratios or late combustion resistances to occur in the HCCI operating range, which can lead to various oxidisable gas temperatures, which may lead to high grassiness and high temperature."}, {"heading": "C.

APPLICATION CASE STUDY 1: ONLINE REGRESSION LEARNING FOR SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION OF AN HCCI ENGINE.", "text": "As already mentioned, a key requirement for model-based control of the HCCI engine is the ability to accurately predict the state variables of the engine for multiple operating cycles in advance, so that a control action with known effects on the engine can be applied. State variables of a motor are the basic variables that represent the state of the engine. Consequently, these variables also affect engine performance such as fuel efficiency, emissions, and stability, and must be monitored / regulated. In this section, the NMEP and CA50 are considered as indicative of engine state variables and estimated solely on the basis of control inputs, so that the resulting models can be used for predictive control. In this section, experiments, model training, and validation of the identified models will be elaborated.For rule-oriented modeling of the HCCI, an online learning framework for regression is developed. In contrast to the existing linear system identification [6], non-linear identification will be used as a non-complex identification of the features of the elimination."}, {"heading": "A.

CONCLUSION", "text": "The SG-ELM algorithm requires less calculation compared to the OS-ELM algorithm as the covariance estimation step is eliminated and a stability test based on the Lyapunov approach is developed. However, the SG-ELM algorithm could involve a lengthy adjustment of step size parameters and suffer from slow convergence. The SG-ELM and OS-ELM algorithms are applied to develop models for state variables and dynamic operating conditions of an HCCI motor to support model-based control.Although the results of this article suggest that good generalization performance can be achieved using both OS-ELM and SGELM methods, the SG-ELM algorithm may have an advantage in terms of stability, which is critical for the development of robust control systems.Although the SG-ELM in identifying the HCCI problem may be good for future measurement research, it seems to be a comprehensive assessment of several areas of benchmarking and benchmarking."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This material is based on work supported by the Department of Energy and as part of the ACCESS project consortium (Robert Bosch LLC, AVL Inc., Emitec Inc.) led by PI Hakan Yilmaz, Robert Bosch, LLC.
