Nurses can have several skills, and for each skill we get different coverage requirements. Given the multi-stage nature of the overall process, the input data for the problem comes from three different sources, the so-called scenarios, week dates and history, as explained in the following sections. Appendix A. The way the information in the files is organized."}, {"heading": "2.1 Scenario", "text": "The scenario presents the general data common to all phases of the overall process. It contains the following information: Planning horizon: The number of weeks that make up the planning period. Skills: The list of skills involved in the problem (chief nurse, regular nurse, trainee,...). Each nurse has one or more skills, but each shift covers exactly one qualification requirement. Contracts: Each nurse has a specific contract (full-time, part-time, on-call,...). The contract sets limits on the distribution and number of tasks within the planning horizon. In detail, it includes: \u2022 minimum and maximum total number of tasks within the planning horizon; \u2022 minimum and maximum number of consecutive days off; \u2022 maximum number of working weeks within the planning horizon; \u2022 a Boolean value representing the presence of the full weekend limit for the nurse, stating that the nurse should work on both days of the week."}, {"heading": "2.2 Week data", "text": "The weekly data contain the specific data for each week. It consists of the following information: Requirements: For each shift, for each skill, for each day of the week, the optimum and minimum number of nurses necessary to perform the work tasks is given. Nurse requests: A series of three requests is given, each consisting of the name of the nurse, the day of the week and a shift. The presence of a given triple request represents the request of the nurse not to work on the given shift on the given day. The special shift name Any represents the request not to work on any shift of the day, i.e. to have a day off. The above information varies from week to week due to the variability of the number of current patients and specific preferences of the nurses. Normally, every week starts with Monday, so that the data is stored in the order Mo, Di,..., Sun."}, {"heading": "2.3 History", "text": "The story contains the information that must be transferred from one week to the next in order to evaluate the restrictions correctly. Specifically, for each nurse, the following two types of information are given: Limit data: The limit data is used to verify the restrictions on consecutive assignments: \u2022 Shift work on the last day of the previous week or the special value None if the nurse had a day off; \u2022 Number of consecutive shifts of the same type and number of consecutive shifts in general (both are 0 if the last shift is none); \u2022 Number of consecutive days off (0 if the last shift is none). Counters: The counters collect the cumulative value over the weeks of certain interest variables that need to be verified only at the end of the planning period. These are: \u2022 Total number of shifts performed; \u2022 Total number of weekends performed. The story is computed after each week based on the solution provided by the solver and based on the previous story. The values that the story may have on the first week passed to the solder during the first week."}, {"heading": "2.4 Solution", "text": "The complete solving process is a loop that performs the solver for a week at each step, iterating for all weeks during the planning period (4 or 8 weeks). After each week, the history information is calculated based on the solution and the previous story and provided in a new file. This is done through the provided simulator, while the solver only has to provide the solution itself. The complete process is outlined in Figure 1 (a), assuming a scenario of 4 weeks. Input files are colored in different cyan shades and the output files in different shades on Magenta. In addition to generating a solution file after solving each stage, the solver may want to store some more prediction information in a custom file (in yellow in Figure 1) and pass it on to the next solution call to better guide the solution of the next step. The content and format of this file is free, but its name is specified by the nurse, which is specified in the 1.section of the output for the nurses, which is produced on Tuesday."}, {"heading": "2.5 Constraints", "text": "According to the setting outlined above, we divide the constraints into two groups: those that can be calculated separately for each week, and those that are only calculated globally at the end of the planning period. As usual, they are also divided into hard and soft constraints. The former must always be met, and the latter contribute to the objective function. The weight of each individual soft constraint is shown before its subsequent description."}, {"heading": "2.5.1 Constraints on the single week", "text": "Below is the list of hard (H) and soft (S) limitation types: H1. Single assignment per day: A nurse may be assigned a maximum of one shift per day.H2. Understaffing: The number of nurses required for each shift must be at least the minimum requirement.H3. Shift assignment: The shift assignment of a nurse for two consecutive days must be one of the legal successions envisaged in the scenario.H4. Lack of required skills: A shift of a given skill must necessarily be performed by a nurse with that skill. S1. Insufficient staffing for optimal coverage (30): The number of nurses required per shift must be the optimal requirement.H4. Any nurse lacking skills will be punished according to the weight provided. Additional nurses above the optimum value will not be factored into the costs.S2. Successive assignments (15 / 30): Minimum and maximum number of consecutive tasks per shift, per shift, or globally, or the respective weight, should include the corresponding assessment or the appropriate weight.4."}, {"heading": "2.5.2 Constraints spanning over the planning horizon", "text": "The following (soft) restrictions will only be assessed at the end of the planning period: S6. Total orders (20): For each nurse, the total number of assignments (working days) must be within the limits (minimum and maximum) enforced by her contract. The difference (in each direction), multiplied by her weight, will be added to the objective function.S7 Total work weekends (30): For each nurse, the number of working weekends must be less or equal to the maximum. The number of overworked weekends will be multiplied by the objective function. A weekend is considered \"working\" if at least one of the two days (Saturday and Sunday) is occupied by the nurse. Of course, the solver should take into account the restrictions S6 and S7 in each individual phase. However, their injury values show a decreasing degree of uncertainty that shifts from one week to the next, and only in the last week can they be assessed accurately. It is up to the model to decide the costs in the previous phase."}, {"heading": "3 Instances", "text": "A complete solution process requires entering a scenario, an initial history, and 4 (or 8) weeks data, and it produces 4 (or 8) weeks solutions and a final history. Scenario, week data, history, and weekly solutions are written in separate files, each with its own syntax. For easy processing, all files are provided in XML, JSON, and text-only formats, and each participant can use the format he / she deems most convenient for his / her implementation. File formats are grouped in Appendix A. Files belonging to the same case are grouped into a data set consisting of the following data sets: \u2022 1 scenario file; \u2022 3 initial history files; \u2022 10 weeks data files. An instance is thus a specific scenario, an initial history, and a sequence of 4 (or 8) weeks records, all belonging to the same data set. The same data collection may also be used several times in the same instance."}, {"heading": "4 Tools", "text": "We provide participants with a range of software tools. The simulator manages the multi-step solution process. The validator certifies the quality of a given instance. The executable benchmark calculates the permitted runtime for each computer.

Second, we illustrate all the necessary infrastructure do be used together with the participant\u2019s solver, including the testbed, the file formats, and the validation/simulation tools. Finally, we state the rules of the competition. All update-to-date information about the competition is available at http://mobiz.vives.be/inrc2/.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
