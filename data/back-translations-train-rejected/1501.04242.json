We start by arguing that passing the Turing test is a trivial computational problem and that its pragmatic difficulty sheds light on the computational nature of the human mind more than it does on the challenge of artificial intelligence. We then review our proposed algorithmic information-theoretic measures for quantifying and characterizing cognition in various forms. These are capable of accounting for known biases in human behavior, thus vindicating a computational algorithmic view of cognition as first suggested by Turing, but this time rooted in the concept of algorithmic probability, which in turn is based on computational universality while being independent of computational model, and which has the virtue of being predictive and testable as a model theory of cognitive behavior.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 17 Jan 2015 22:55:48 GMT  (44kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04242v1", "21 pages.

Such a tool, together with classical Shannon entropy [Wang et al. 2014], has recently been used in neuropsychology to investigate the complexity of EEEG or fMRI data [Maguire et al. 2014] and [Casali et al. 2013]. Indeed, the size of a compressed file gives an indication of its algorithmic complexity. The size of a compressed file is, in fact, an upper limit of true algorithmic complexity. On the one hand, compression methods are a fundamental error; they can only detect statistical regularities and are therefore implementations of variations of entropic measures based only on the rate of entropic convergence convergence."}, {"heading": "2.3 The Block Decomposition Method", "text": "ACSS provides researchers with an easy-to-use tool for assessing the algorithmic complexity of very short strings. Despite the huge sample (billions) of Turing machines used to build m (s) and K (s) using the coding theorem method, two strings of length 12 were never produced, but ACSS can safely be used for strings up to length 12 by assigning the missing two the greatest complexity in the set. The same method used with two-dimensional turing machines produced a sample of binary patterns on grids, but even here of limited range. Not all 5 \u00d7 5 grids are present in the output, but one can decompose any square grid n \u00d7 n by decomposing it into 4 \u00d7 4 squares, for which there is a known estimate of two-dimensional coding properties. The method simply involves running turing machines on lattices instead of tapes, and then all the theory around the coding could be applied."}, {"heading": "3 Cognition and complexity", "text": "An early example of an application to cognition of the coding theorem and block decomposition methods was able to quantify the short sequence complexity in Reznikova's communication experiments and confirm their results [Zenil 2013]. In fact, ants were found to communicate simpler strings (associated with instructions on how to get to food in a labyrinth) in a shorter time, establishing an experimental link between animal behavior, algorithmic complexity and time complexity. The idea was pursued to establish a relationship between information content and energy (both in research and in communication) in order to establish a fitness landscape based on the thresholds between these currencies as reported in [Zenil et al. 2012a]. As shown in [Zenil et al. 2012a], if the environment is too predictable, the cost of processing information is very low. In contrast, when the environment is more randomly distributed, therefore, the cost of these algorithms is the highest for achieving the results."}, {"heading": "3.1 Working memory", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to decide for themselves what they want to do, and they are not prepared to decide what they want to do."}, {"heading": "3.2 Randomness perception", "text": "When we are confronted with 1, 2 or 3 objects, we will immediately perceive many phenomena in terms of mathematical facts, biology, physics and na\u00efve psychology. This core knowledge [Spelke 2007] is found primarily in babies as young as a few months old. However, in the field of na\u00efve mathematics, for example, it has been shown that people share some basic knowledge or intuitions about numbers and geometry. Humans and other animals both show the ability to distinguish quantities based on an \"approximate number of balls,\" thanks to which one can immediately feel that 3 objects are more than 2, or 12 than 6 [Dehaene 2011]. Since this numerical sense is only approximate, it does not allow us to distinguish quantified quantities, for example. There is much evidence that we have an innate sense of quantity. For example, both children and adults are able to count quantity \"quantities not larger than 4, whereas quantities require a larger strategy."}, {"heading": "3.3 Culture and structure", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "4 Concluding remarks", "text": "We have most of what has been formally done to connect and explain cognition by computation. Turing has linked human intelligence to computation. Searle has indirectly linked understanding (and consciousness) to programming complexity (soft AI). Tononi et al. have recently linked consciousness to information theory, and we have linked cognitive theory to a very useful normative tool that sheds light on several cognitive processes, and the emergence of structure in language is groundbreaking. In these three areas, we have made contributions from algorithmic complexity, which seems very useful."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "We survey concepts at the frontier of research connecting artificial, animal and human cognition to computation and information processing\u2014from the Turing test to Searle\u2019s Chinese Room argument, from Integrated Information Theory to computational and algorithmic complexity.
