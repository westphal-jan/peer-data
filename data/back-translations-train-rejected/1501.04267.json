[2] suggested the method for calculating the potential of each point using the Gaussian function in the array. For a dataset {1, 2, 3, the equation for calculating the potential of each point is ultimately: () = () 2) Equation (1) very similar to the equation used to calculate the density in 1. In the array, data points with greater potential are located in the dense region. As shown in Figure 1, (a) the distribution of the potential array shows dark areas should have a greater potential. This is the same with the density distribution of the original data as shown in (b)."}, {"heading": "2 Experimental results and comparison", "text": "Our method is used to repeat the experiments in [1] on the same experimental datasets used in [1]. Original datasets are in the second column of Figure 3: No original dataset clustering results with [1] clustering results with the array (a) (b) In Figure 3, there are four datasets with the names (a), (b), (c), (d). For the same dataset, we first use the estimated threshold for clustering in [1], then we use the threshold for clustering calculated by the array. The only difference between them is how the threshold is chosen. In Figure 3, the third column is the clustering results with the estimated threshold in [1]. The fourth column is the clustering results with the threshold calculated by the array. According to Figure 3, the method for calculating the threshold with the array noisy points can be removed better than the estimated threshold in [1]."}, {"heading": "3 Conclusions", "text": "Our proposed method solved the problem that the threshold value cannot be calculated.
