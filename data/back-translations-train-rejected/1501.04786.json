Some combination rules are used with the assumption of their sources independence whereas others combine beliefs of dependent sources. Therefore, the choice of the combination rule depends on the independence of sources involved in the combination. In this paper, we propose also a measure of independence, positive and negative dependence to integrate in mass functions before the combinaision with the independence assumption.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 12:48:41 GMT  (88kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04786v1", "in French"]], "COMMENTS": "in French", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mouna chebbah", "mouloud kharoune", "arnaud martin", "boutheina ben yaghlane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.04786"}, "pdf": {"name": "1501.04786.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Conside\u0301rant la de\u0301pendance dans la the\u0301orie des fonctions de croyance", "authors": ["Mouna Chebbah", "Mouloud Kharoune", "Arnaud Martin", "Boutheina Ben Yaghlane"], "emails": ["Mouloud.Kharoune@univ-rennes1.fr,", "Arnaud.Martin@univ-rennes1.fr", "Mouna.Chebbah@univ-rennes1.fr", "boutheina.yaghlane@ihec.rnu.tn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Consid\u00e9rant la d\u00e9pendance dans la th\u00e9orie des fonctions de croyanceMouna Chebbah *, Mouloud Kharoune * Arnaud Martin *, Boutheina Ben Yaghlane *, UMR 6074 IRISA, Universit\u00e9 de Rennes1 / IUT de Lannion, Rue Edouard Branly BP 3021, 22302 Lannion cedexMouloud.Kharoune @ univ-rennes1.fr, Arnaud.Martin @ univ-rennes1.fr, LARODEC, ISG Tunis, 41 Rue de la Libert\u00e9, Cit\u00e9 Bouchoucha2000 Le Bardo, Tunisie Mouna.Chebbah @ univ-rennes1.fr, Arnaud.Martin @ univ-rennes1.fr, LARODEC, IHEC Carthage Pr\u00e9sidence 2016, Tunisieboutheina.yaghlane @ ihec.rnu.tnR\u00e9sum\u00e9sum\u00e9sum\u00e9sum\u00e9."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "It is a question of time before a decision is made whether it is a question of reason or a question of reason.
