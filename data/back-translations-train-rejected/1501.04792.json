These guidelines cover a wide range of disabilities (visual, auditory, physical, linguistic, cognitive, etc.) and provide several levels of management: \u2022 4 general principles: perception, usability, comprehensibility & robustness; \u2022 verifiable success criteria: verifiable success criteria are required for each guideline. Each criterion is linked to one of the three defined conformity levels (A, AA and AAA), each of which requires accessibility for the user. Several automatic accessibility assessors, based on different accessibility standards, have been developed for IT professionals [5]. Their limits depend on the automatic tests. As it is currently not possible to verify some criteria regarding the quality of some pages, some of the assessments will not match with existing results (although the inconsistency of the assessments is a reality)."}, {"heading": "3 Proposed accessibility indicator", "text": "Following a request, the indicator must provide users with information describing the accessibility level of each website proposed by a search engine. Presented at the same time as these pages, the information of the indicators covers two aspects: \u2022 accessibility for categories of deficiencies: as previously proposed for the assessment of accessibility [6] we use four main categories: visual, hearing, motor and cognitive deficiencies as defined in [15]. They are referred to as \"deficiency frameworks\"; \u2022 the level of accessibility for each deficiency framework. By collecting the results of several assessment bodies, we can benefit from each of their performance. Furthermore, it strengthens the assessment of accessibility for similar outcomes and overcomes conflicts in the event of inconsistencies. Automatic assessment mechanisms review a number of criteria that correspond to many deficiencies. Since our assessment of accessibility for each deficiency framework differs (our method consists of selecting the relevant criteria for each deficiency and then taking into account each criterion the problems that exist at the AA level, the most important of the rating of the AA)."}, {"heading": "4 Defect detection and accessibility evaluation", "text": "After collecting the Uniform Resource Locators (URLp) web page selected by a search engine from a request, these addresses are transmitted to the accessibility assessors and one by one for each page, we identify accessibility deficiencies, then assess the level of accessibility based on each assessor's accessibility frames before merging the data into deficiency frames and deciding on each deficiency frame [7]."}, {"heading": "4.1 Assessor evaluations of selected pages", "text": "Each URLp is subjected to accessibility tests by each assessor i, who checks all criteria k of the WCAG 2.0 standard, and the following data is collected by a filter, which extracts the required data for each deficiency frame: \u2022 Nek, i: errors observed for a criterion k by an assessor i; \u2022 Nlk, i: correct control points for a criterion k by an assessor i; \u2022 T lk, i: tests that can cause errors for a criterion k by an assessor i; \u2022 Nlk, i: probable problems detected for a criterion k by an assessor i; \u2022 T lk, i: tests that can cause probable problems for a criterion k by an assessor i; \u2022 N pk, i: potential problems suspected for a criterion k by an assessor i; \u2022 T pk, Nei: tests with an assessor + K (K)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Accessibility indicator level of the pages", "text": "In order to model initial information, including uncertainties, the reliability of assessors considered sources of information, and their possible conflicts, we use the theory of belief functions [4] [13]. Our goal is to define whether a website is accessible (Ac) or inaccessible (Ac) and to provide an indication framework (deficit framework). (Consequently, these questions can be treated independently for each deficit framework h = {Ac, Ac}. We can calculate any performance occurring within this framework h = {/ 0, Ac, Ac, Ac, Ac (for a deficit framework h and a source i). (The estimate of the accessibility framework Ac for a deficit framework h and a source i (Ac, source i) is represented by the number of criteria occurring within this framework k = {/ 0, Ac, Ac, Ac, Ac, Ac, Frame c} for a deficit framework h and an estimate of the probability (Ah)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Merging assessor results and decision-making", "text": "Once the masses for each assessor are determined, the results are merged using a deficiency framework, using the conjunctival rule [14] to combine them and provide information in the form of a mass function. In this context, these rule properties, which strengthen common results and manage conflicts between sources, are particularly relevant to deal with discrepancies between assessor ratings. To calculate the final decision Dh (URLp) for a page by deficiency frame, we use the pignistic probability [14]. There are several ways to present the indicator of accessibility to users. To visualize the deficiency frames, existing specific pictograms are effective. To calculate the accessibility of a page by deficiency frame, we break the decision down into 5 levels (very good, good, moderate, poor or very bad) based on thresholds and visualize them by an \"arrow\": \u2022 if Dh < 1, < the web accessibility < < 1 if the content < < 1 (very bad)."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "In order to confirm the results, we have to restrict ourselves to a series of 100 news sites, all of which are visited by the OJD Group, which offers certifications and publications for websites. We test their homepages and conclude that their usability depends on the entire website. We have chosen two types of ratings, which relate to the attainment of objectives."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We present an indicator for estimating the accessibility of websites for different categories of deficiencies in order to provide users with easily understandable accessibility information on pages proposed by a search engine. Our method, based on the theory of the belief function, brings together the results of several automatic evaluators and takes into account their uncertainties. An accurate modeling of the rating characteristics and the influence of error guidelines criteria on accessibility is proposed. An experiment conducted on a number of 100 news websites confirms the method that benefits from the performance of each individual evaluator in certain criteria tests. Our future research will focus on implementing a user's personal weighting to balance the importance of criteria."}], "references": [{"title": "The use of guidelines to automatically verify web accessibility", "author": ["J.
