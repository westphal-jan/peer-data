However, with the development of connection rates and collaborative technologies that are constantly changing, the Internet provides access to new networks that are broader, and also less easily recognizable. In addition, an important part of the incomplete and imperfect information is disseminated on the network. Therefore, the management of uncertainty is fundamental in several domains, especially in social networks.

This representation does not take into account the uncertainty of the nodes and edges. In fact, graphic models combine graph theory with any theory dealing with uncertainty such as probability [6], [3] or possibility or theory of faith to provide a general framework for an intuitive and clear graphical representation of real-world problems [4]. The distribution of messages in networks has been modeled using the theory of faith functions, combined with other theories such as hidden Markov chains [7]. In this context, we present our model: the social network, which has the role of representing a social network using the theory of faith functions. In fact, we will assign a priori mass to each node, link and message, and observe the interaction within the network to determine the mass of the message received in a well-defined node."}, {"heading": "4 Fusion of masses on belief social network", "text": "In the second half of the last decade, the number of people able to remain in the region has multiplied in recent years.

In the second section, we briefly introduced the basic concepts used in the theory of faith functions. Then, we focused on the introduction of our model and the different spelling used. In fact, we covered step by step the development of the construction of the graph. Finally, we introduced in detail the process of merging the information flowing through the network. We also showed how the process of merging is carried out and explained how we can make a decision about the type of messages received using pignistic probability. In fact, in many cases, we can make a new decision about the nature of the topic received by a well-defined node. This idea was explained in the second example in the illustration part."}], "references": [{"title": "Fusion de sources d\u2019information d\u00e9finies sur des r\u00e9f\u00e9rentiels non exhaustifs diff\u00e9rents", "author": ["F.
