A large source of difficulty comes from the fact that the development of skills in infants results from the interactions of multiple mechanisms at multiple spatio-temporal scales. The concepts of \"innate\" or \"acquired\" are not any more adequate tools for explanations, which call for a shift from reductionist to systemic accounts. To address this challenge, building and experimenting with robots modeling the growing infant brain and body is crucial. Systemic explanations of pattern formation in sensorimotor, cognitive and social development, viewed as a complex dynamical system, require the use of formal models based on mathematics, algorithms and robots. Formulating hypothesis about development using such models, and exploring them through experiments, allows us to consider in detail the interaction between many mechanisms and parameters. This complements traditional experimental methods in psychology and neuroscience where only a few variables can be studied at the same time. Furthermore, the use of robots is of particular importance. The laws of physics generate everywhere around us spontaneous patterns in the inorganic world. They also strongly impact the living, and in particular constrain and guide infant development through the properties of its (changing) body in interaction with the physical environment. Being able to consider the body as an experimental variable, something that can be systematically changed in order to study the impact on skill formation, has been a dream to many developmental scientists. This is today becoming possible with developmental robotics.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 13:03:26 GMT  (912kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04796v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["pierre-yves oudeyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.04796"}, "pdf": {"name": "1501.04796.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "What do we learn about development from baby robots?1", "authors": ["Pierre-Yves Oudeyer"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "What do we learn about the development of baby robots? 1"}, {"heading": "Pierre-Yves Oudeyer Inria and EnstaParisTech, France", "text": "To understand the world around them, people throw wooden sticks into rivers. Jean Piaget, one of the pioneers of developmental psychology, extensively investigated this central role of action in learning and discovering infants (Piaget, 1952). Scientists do the same: to understand ocean waves, we build huge aquariums. To understand cells, we break them down into their components. To understand the formation of spiral galaxies, we emanize them in computer simulations. Constructing artifacts helps us construct knowledge. But what if we want to understand ourselves? How can we understand the mechanisms of human learning, emotions and curiosity? Here, too, the physical fabrication of artifacts can be useful. Researchers can build baby robots with mechanisms that model aspects of the child's brain and body, and compare these models to explore a complex behavior that we can now systematically compare with the development of robots."}, {"heading": "EXPLORING COMPLEX SYSTEMS", "text": "We now know that genes are not a static program that unfolds independently of the environment. We also know that learning in the real world can only work if there are adequate constraints during development: they result from the dynamic interaction between cells, organs, learning mechanisms and the physical and social properties of the environment.

A major difficulty arises from the fact that the development of abilities in infants results from the interaction of multiple mechanisms in multiple spatial (molecules, genes, cells, organs, bodies, social groups) and time scales. Like spiral galaxies, which are neither the programmatic unfolding of a plan nor the result of learning, the evolution of infants is permeated by patterns spontaneously formed by a complex, distributed network of forces. Concepts of \"innate\" or \"acquired\" galaxies are not more adequate tools for explanations that require a shift from reductionist to systemic accounts."}], "references": [{"title": "The Self-Made Tapestry: Pattern Formation in Nature", "author": ["P.
