Often, knowledge representation is necessary in a context of incomplete information, where inductive processes are additionally necessary. Thus, there are two facets that are common to a large number of works in knowledge representation, especially in the contexts of inductive inferencing, machine learning, or data analysis, both of which are understood as logical and probable concepts. There are a variety of approaches that enhance their expressivity and usefulness, but pay high prices in terms of computer difficulties. Even without the probability of being known to be incompatible with certain degrees of expressivity and computational feasibility, and this is reflected in the indecisiveness of the results of many logic. In other cases, the balance between expressivity and feasibility is reflected in often open complexity theories."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries and notation", "text": "We use the terms propositional variable and attribute interchangeable. Thus, attributes take partial Y = \u2192 dual values, true or false. For a fixed set of propositional variables or attributes, we use the terms truth-mapping, propositional model and transaction interchangeable. Thus, a transaction is simply a subset of attributes that would be set to true if we consider it a truth-mapping. Typically, our set of attributes is simple [n]: = {1,., n}, for a natural number n, so transactions are subsets of [n]. Fix is such a set of attributes. If Z is a transaction and X is a set of attributes, say that a set of transactions is when X Z. A record is a multi-set of transactions: formally a mapping from the set of all transactions to the natural numbers. If D is a set of attributes, and X is a set of attributes, we write a set of attributes."}, {"heading": "3 Entailment with up to two premises", "text": "The study begins with a detailed comparison of the consequences as defined in Section 2, and most of the work assumes that the confidence parameters are strictly positive if and only if they are everywhere and strictly below 1; otherwise we fall back on the classical confidence as defined in Section 2.
