The retrospective paper revisits several issues that geo-information sciences had to face from the early stages on, including: structure ( to bring some structure to the data registered from a sampled signal, metadata); processing (huge amounts of data for big computers and fast algorithms); uncertainty (the kinds of errors, their quantification); consistency (when merging different sources of data is logically allowed, and meaningful); ontologies (clear and agreed shared definitions, if any kind of decision should be based upon them). All these issues are the background of Internet queries, and the underlying technology has been shaped during those years when geo-information engineering emerged.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 14:57:11 GMT  (750kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04832v1", "Conference \"AutoCarto 6\", revisited 30 years later in a \"Retrospective book\", edited by Barry Wellar, the same chair as the original conference. 12 pages, 6 figures. see: AutoCarto Six Retrospective, 2013.

Reason for paper?", "text": "In 1983, while working on the above title, the purpose of my sponsorship at the time was to prepare for the launch of the SPOT satellite and the imminent commercialization of its products, with an emphasis on monitoring vegetation. It may look incredible today, but we were not equipped with imaging screens, only alphanumeric consoles: everything had to be printed to be displayed. However, there was data, large data matrices that could not easily be turned into images."}, {"heading": "C. Data structure: From ancillary data to metadata.", "text": "The Remote Sensing Imagery has introduced the use of metadata as soon as the first images are registered, superimposed and when different sensors are used. Basically, we only have two types of data: words and numbers. And if we have a number, we also need words: if 24, 24 what? Natural or physical sciences deal with numbers, with signal or image processing, with geometry, time series, etc. But word processing is the most important approach in big data: \"In principio erat Verbum,\" the first words of the Gospel of John. The two did not fit well 30 years ago, but nowadays the difference is not as drastic as the structure of image processing is today the widespread use of metadata. I remember that we do not use the word metadata, but \"ancillare data\" to name the data associated with remote sensors: for example, the resolution of the ground, wavelength, etc."}, {"heading": "D.

For example, remember the hierarchical classification algorithms used for pixel classification in Landsat images (Jeansoulin 1981), and the use of more complex approaches for unattended classification, such as the \"dynamic clusters\" (Diday 1973) related to data processing; the descending operation attempts to divide the data domains into relevant subclasses at each level, resulting in a structure that is applied to an average intelligence for unattended classification (see Onxel Database of 1998). Data processing is an experimental field for experiments in innovative analysis, statistical data processing, data processing, such as 19stostic data transmission burepositories, or IGS, etc."}, {"heading": "E. Data uncertainty: From precision to quality indicators.", "text": "Geo-information deals with the \"real world\": without arguing about the philosophical truth, it is at least one and only \"world,\" which can be modelled and measured by different means, at different levels, from several points of view, etc., and everything must be logically consistent. Therefore, geo-processing does not only talk about a certain aspect of reality, but also about a uniform framework for this reality. Initially, the measurement quality focused on precision: which particular location on earth does a certain pixel represent? What is the real radiometric contribution of this place actually represented in pixel value? Image recording and sensor fusion were the first and most difficult tasks at that time. Soon afterwards, the big problem was trust in the classification of data, for example, how much wheat is the USSR really harvested? Issues of this kind were examined by ISSR with relatively the same amount of computational power that the NSA can use today for processing trillions of emails."}, {"heading": "F. Data consistency: Uncertain but rational knowledge.", "text": "Understanding the many causes of data uncertainty sheds light on the many approaches that have been made throughout the process of collecting and measuring even the simplest data: for example, ground temperature. Given the fact that data is always somewhat inaccurate, and given the fact that data always depends on a model that imperfectly represents a reduced aspect of reality, it is important to provide guidelines or constraints. Any time we can provide some constraints, we can confront the data and issue a warning for any conflict detected. Figure 2 is a snapshot of a successful experiment developed during the European project REVIG! S3: How to use - by logical means and tools - very uncertain flood data using the direction of water flow as constraints (Jeansoulin and Wilson 2002).In big data, predicting the annual flu wave by looking at \"medical queries\" through the Internet has a lot of media attention, but it is not necessarily an IBM analytic."}, {"heading": "G. Ontologies: Data are acts, not facts.", "text": "Geo-scientists classify and zoning, but much more attention is paid to the importance of the process, the interpretability of the result and the ability to use it within a decision-making process. Furthermore, geo-information also raises the question of what is contained in data, common concordance, external quality, data usability, etc., which are various aspects of a more general question often summarized in the word \"ontologies\" (plural!), and the subsequent problem of \"ontology alignment\" (Gruber 1994; Halevy 2005).Again, terminology has been brought to public attention by the widespread use of the Internet and subsequent mainstream studies, but here too, geoinformation developed its research when questioning the problems of global data quality, managing different levels of quality for different types of information, and geomatics was one of the first to provide a systematic and comprehensive approach, with the above-mentioned ISO 191xx series of standards, in 2002 in particular \"Ontologies 197\" and \"ISO 197."}, {"heading": "H. Conclusion.", "text": "About 30 years ago, the linkage of remote-sensing image multiplication (Landsat 1976, then SPOT), the early stages of desktop image processing, the automation of cartographic processing, and rapidly increasing computing power - doubling every two years, according to Moore's Law, Version 2 - provided the opportunity to collect, merge, and process an enormous amount of data greater than that ever collected and processed by machines. Consequently, the engineers and researchers involved in geo-information have led the development of tools and methods that are ultimately part of what is now called big data. Finally, it is appropriate to acknowledge the expertise that geo-information specialists have developed in data processing. Decision-makers increasingly rely on numbers to prepare and make decisions."}, {"heading": "I. References.", "text": "In Communications of the ACM. 26 November 1997: 832-843.Cavarroc, M.-A., B.
