However, the enforcement of seemingly appealing concepts of rationality can ultimately lead to decisions that are incompatible with what real people consider reasonable. For example, the observed behavior under unquantifiable (Knightian [14] / strict [15]) uncertainties, such as the one in the Ellsberg paradox [8], shows how appealing concepts of rationality can lead to inconsistencies with human decisions. Alternative decision rules, such as maximum usefulness [25] and minimax regret [20] provide rationally plausible decisions in ambiguous situations and can be used to resolve them."}, {"heading": "1.1 Relative Preferences and Regret", "text": "It is not difficult to imagine situations in which performance is more important than absolute performance in relation to other possible outcomes.

same way minimax regret seeks to minimize distance from the best. We argue that maximin safety is valuable both descriptively and normatively. Descriptively, maximin safety explains the well-known decoy effect, in which the introduction of a dominated option changes preferences among the other options. Normatively, we provide an axiomatization that characterizes preferences induced by maximin safety, and show that maximin safety shares much of the same behavioral basis with minimax regret.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
