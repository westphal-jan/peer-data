Sources Identification within Q&AC", "text": "An optimal answer is selected either by the questioner or by other users through a voting process. In [12], the author focused on selecting the questions a user would choose to answer. On the basis of these studies, experts prefer answering questions where they have a higher chance of making a valuable contribution. Recently, in [13], the authors proposed a framework for evaluating both the reliability and expertise of an information provider. Taking into account some cognitive and behavioral criteria of users, they succeeded in establishing a trust system."}, {"heading": "C. Uncertainty within Q&AC", "text": "Gjergji et al. have proposed three levels for Q & AC [11]: the first refers to the extraction and integration of uncertainty, the second to the uncertainty of information sources and finally to the knowledge inherent in the information itself. In our case, we are more interested in the evaluation of the sources and the part of uncertainty associated with them. The main problem in these communities is that we are dealing with users about whom we do not always know in advance. We ignore everything that has to do with the credibility, reliability, relevance, objectivity and expertise of the sources. In this context, we will use the entire mathematical background and the large panel of sepcificities provided by the theory of faith functions to help us look at this problem from an uncertain point of view."}, {"heading": "III. THEORY OF BELIEF FUNCTIONS", "text": "This section recalls the necessary background to the Faith Function Theory developed by Dempster in his work on higher and lower probabilities.

To make a decision, we are based on an uncontrolled classification method introduced by McQueen [19] and implemented by Forgy [20] in its current form. Kmeans algorithm aims to construct clusters of partitions (clusters) concentrated from the objects of training group K. In our case, we will divide the users into two partitions: K = 2. Since the value of the conflict of the troll is greater than the conflict of the other users: - Trolls belong to the group with the highest value of the centre. - The other users belong to the group with the lowest value of the centre."}, {"heading": "VI. EXPERIMENTATION", "text": "In order to demonstrate the compatibility of our proposed method, we have tested it on various simulated data. In this section, we will present two different examples."}, {"heading": "A. Example 1", "text": "As we have presented our method, it has three main steps. In fact, we will present the results of each step: 1) User messages: Our assumption is the integration of trolls into the successful discussion strands. From this point of view, we simulate the data of the analysis of messages, as shown in Figure 1. In this example, our differentiation framework consists of 4 elements: Relevant = X1, offtopic = X2, meaningless = X3, Controversial topic = X4. As shown in Figure 2 of each line: the owner of the message, the order of the message in the discussion strand and the mass function of this message ll: Utility = X2, senseless = X3, Controversial topic = X4. The order of the message in the discussion strand and the mass function of this message (as mentioned in Section III. B of each bba, must equal 1).In this example, the first message of the troll (U4) will be a conflict."}, {"heading": "B. Example 2", "text": "For this simulation, we assume that we are dealing with 8 users, including two trolls. The discussion thread contains 31 messages. The result of the total conflict of each user expressed in Equation 14 is shown in Figure 2.The first troll U4 published 2 controversial messages and the second troll U8 published 3 messages: the first two are taboo, and the last one is controversial. - U1 published 3 relevant messages and 2 controversial messages to respond to the first troll. - U2 published 7 relevant messages and 2 controversial messages to respond to the first troll. - U3 published 4 relevant messages and an off-topic message to respond to the second troll. - U5 published a relevant message. - U6 published 3 relevant messages. - U7 published 2 relevant messages. The overall conflict of the troll U4 is greater relative to the other troll U8 because it published its posts after a large number of reliable messages from other users."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "Our work is based on a measure of conflict in the belief function theory used between messages from the various users of the thread. Firstly, this method aims to analyze messages in relation to the question or topic posted, but recognizing irrelevant messages is not enough to determine whether or not that user is a troll. Thus, not only the content of messages that can characterize the trolls, but also their behavior. Next, we measured the conflict between different users based on the results of this analysis. Finally, after calculating each user's conflict, we used the Kmeans method to distinguish trolls from other users. In fact, we classified users into two clusters according to their conflict outcomes. This method was tested in various simulated data to verify its feasibility. As our proposed method of detecting this malicious method aimed to detect only one thread within the community."}], "references": [{"title": "Upper and Lower probabilities induced by a multivalued mapping", "author": ["A.P.
