We propose this rule for their ability to make decisions on compound hypotheses, as well as for their convenience in our field of application, namely the semantic network, and in particular ontology, in which decision-making is an important step. Ontology matching is the process of finding for each unit of a source ontology O1 its corresponding unit in a target ontology O2. This process can focus on finding simple mappings (1: 1) or on complex mappings (1: n or n: 1). The first consists of comparing only one unit of O1 with only one unit of O1, while the second consists of finding for one unit of O1 its multiple correspondence of units in O2 or mapping several units of O1 with only one unit of O2."}, {"heading": "2 Ontology Matching", "text": "The openness of the semantic web [2] tends to foster the development of heterogeneous ontologies that differ from each other on a terminological and / or representative level. In order to mitigate the effect of semantic heterogeneity and ensure interoperability between applications that use these ontologies, a key challenge is to define an efficient and reliable agreement between ontologies [7]. Formally, ontology agreement is defined as function A = f (O1, O2, A ', p, r). In fact, function f leads from an ontology pair to agreement between O1 and O2, to an input orientation A', to a set of parameters p, a set of oracles and resources r, to a correspondence A between these ontologies.

We are interested in this section to present some of where probability theory [11] and the DempsterShafer theory ([3], [10], [16]) are the most important mathematical models. In [11], the authors proposed an approach for matching ontologies based on Bayesian networks, which are an extension of BayesOWL. BayesOWL consists in translating an OWL ontology into a Bayesian network (BN) by applying a set of rules and procedures. To assign two ontologies, the source and target ontologies are first translated into BN1 and BN2."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion and Perspectives", "text": "This decision rule helps in selecting the most likely hypothesis for a given problem. It is based on the calculation of the distance between a combined bba and a categorical bba. We apply this rule in our proposed creditology decision-making process for ontology matching. First, we coordinate two ontologies. Subsequently, the obtained agreements are modeled under the theory of faith functions. Based on the results obtained, a decision-making process is carried out by applying our proposed decision rule. In the future, we aim to apply other matching techniques. We are also interested in constructing an uncertain ontology based on the results obtained after decision-making and the use of experiments to assess the relevance of our approach qualitatively."}], "references": [{"title": "Approche G\u00e9n\u00e9rique de la Gestion de l\u2019Incertain dans les Processus de Fusion Multisenseur", "author": ["A.
