However, due to the nature of human beings, there are many cases where the traditional approach is not the fully appropriate one. For example, a teacher is often unsure which particular numerical degree to assign. Fuzzy logic, by its nature of characterizing a case with multiple values, provides more comprehensive and richer resources for such cases. General facts about fuzzy sets can be found in the book [1]. Within the last decade, some useful applications based on the fuzzy centroid method (see for example [2]) have been developed by the author and his collaborators in [3-11] and then implemented in some recent research (see for example [12-14]). In the current article, we construct a new Generalized Rectangular Model (GRM) for evaluation and discuss its place among other previously developed models (Rectangular Model, Triangular Model and Trapezoidal Model)."}, {"heading": "1. THE RECTANGULAR MODEL", "text": "The main idea of the rectangular model was developed in [3, 4]. (From an unclear subset A = {(x, m (x)): x x \u00b2 of the universal set U of the discourse with the membership function m: U to [0, 1] we correspond to each x U an interval of values from a given numerical distribution, which actually means that we replace U with a series of real intervals. (Then we construct the graph F of the membership function y = m (x).There is a commonly used approach to measure performance with the pair of numbers (xc, yc) as coordinates of the center of gravity (centoid), say, the graph F, which we can calculate using the following known formulas: (1) F Fc cF Fxdxdy ydy ydy x dxdy = = = high."}, {"heading": "2. THE GENERALIZED RECTANGULAR MODEL", "text": "In this case, we represent each of the five centers of i = 1 = 2 points of the boundary power, which is limited to two adjacent levels. In this situation, we also deal with this situation. Here, we use the rectangular bar chart, in which we allow the rectangles with some overlapping intersections. In this case, we allow two adjacent rectangles, each of which we consider to be 30% of their bases. In this way, we cover the situation of uncertainty in assessing the limits described above. In this case, since the marginal individual values are considered to be common parts of the adjacent rectangles, it is logical to count these parts twice by setting the ambiguous values in both adjacent regions."}, {"heading": "3.
