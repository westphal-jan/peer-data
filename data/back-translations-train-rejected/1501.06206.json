In order to apply the rationality result of belief dynamics theory to various practical problems, it should be generalized in two respects: first it should allow a certain part of belief to be declared as immutable; and second, the belief state need not be deductively closed. Such a generalization of belief dynamics, referred to as base dynamics, is presented in this paper, along with the concept of a generalized revision algorithm for knowledge bases (Horn or Horn logic with stratified negation). We show that knowledge base dynamics has an interesting connection with kernel change via hitting set and abduction. In this paper, we show how techniques from disjunctive logic programming can be used for efficient (deductive) database updates. The key idea is to transform the given database together with the update request into a disjunctive (datalog) logic program and apply disjunctive techniques (such as minimal model reasoning) to solve the original update problem. The approach extends and integrates standard techniques for efficient query answering and integrity checking. The generation of a hitting set is carried out through a hyper tableaux calculus and magic set that is focused on the goal of minimality. The present paper provides a comparative study of view update algorithms in rational approach. For, understand the basic concepts with abduction, we provide an abductive framework for knowledge base dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate how belief base dynamics can provide an axiomatic characterization for insertion a view atom to the database. We give a quick overview of the main operators for belief change, in particular, belief update versus database update.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Jan 2015 20:48:53 GMT  (397kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06206v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1411.2499,arXiv:1405.2642,arXiv:1407.3512,arXiv:1301.5154"], ["v2", "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 09:59:49 GMT  (397kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06206v2", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1411.2499,arXiv:1405.2642,arXiv:1407.3512,arXiv:1301.5154"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1411.2499,arXiv:1405.2642,arXiv:1407.3512,arXiv:1301.5154", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["radhakrishnan delhibabu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.06206"}, "pdf": {"name": "1501.06206.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Dynamics of Belief: Abduction, Horn Knowledge Base And Database Updates", "authors": ["Radhakrishnan Delhibabu"], "emails": ["delhibabu@kbsg.rwth-aachen.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Annual General Meeting, Faith Revision, Faith Update, Horn Knowledge Base Dynamics, Kernel Change, Abduction, Hyber Tableaux, Magic Set, View update, Update Propagation."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "We live in an ever-changing world, and consequently our beliefs need to be revised when there is new information.

For a full introduction, the reader is referred to fundamental books on faith change (Gurdenfors 1992 and 1998), (Hansson 1997a), (Rott 2001) or the current special issue of the Journal of Philosophical Logic on Theory (Ferme 2011)."}, {"heading": "5 Horn Knowledge base dynamics", "text": "While these sentences are infinite, they cannot always be infinite, but it is not always easy to implement them either on the basis of a partial revision or a generalized core revision.

Table 5.3, shows an example of a database applying this convention.

information. In order to apply the rationality result of belief dynamics theory to various practical problems, it should be generalized in two respects: first it should allow a certain part of belief to be declared as immutable; and second, the belief state need not be deductively closed. Such a generalization of belief dynamics, referred to as base dynamics, is presented in this paper, along with the concept of a generalized revision algorithm for knowledge bases (Horn or Horn logic with stratified negation). We show that knowledge base dynamics has an interesting connection with kernel change via hitting set and abduction. In this paper, we show how techniques from disjunctive logic programming can be used for efficient (deductive) database updates. The key idea is to transform the given database together with the update request into a disjunctive (datalog) logic program and apply disjunctive techniques (such as minimal model reasoning) to solve the original update problem. The approach extends and integrates standard techniques for efficient query answering and integrity checking. The generation of a hitting set is carried out through a hyper tableaux calculus and magic set that is focused on the goal of minimality. The present paper provides a comparative study of view update algorithms in rational approach. For, understand the basic concepts with abduction, we provide an abductive framework for knowledge base dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate how belief base dynamics can provide an axiomatic characterization for insertion a view atom to the database. We give a quick overview of the main operators for belief change, in particular, belief update versus database update.
