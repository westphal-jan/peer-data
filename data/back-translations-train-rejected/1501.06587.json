However, treating all citations with equal weight ignores the wide variety of functions that citations perform. We want to automatically identify the subset of references in a bibliography that have a central academic influence on the citing paper. For this purpose, we examine the effectiveness of a variety of features for determining the academic influence of a citation. By asking authors to identify the key references in their own work, we created a data set in which citations were labeled according to their academic influence. Using automatic feature selection with supervised machine learning, we found a model for predicting academic influence that achieves good performance on this data set using only four features. The best features, among those we evaluated, were those based on the number of times a reference is mentioned in the body of a citing paper. The performance of these features inspired us to design an influence-primed h-index (the hip-index). Unlike the conventional h-index, it weights citations by how many times a reference is mentioned. According to our experiments, the hip-index is a better indicator of researcher performance than the conventional h-index.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Jan 2015 21:06:02 GMT  (51kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06587v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["xiaodan zhu", "peter turney", "daniel lemire", "r\\'e vellino"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.06587"}, "pdf": {"name": "1501.06587.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Measuring academic influence: Not all citations are equal", "authors": ["Xiaodan Zhu", "Peter Turney", "Daniel Lemire", "Andr\u00e9 Vellino"], "emails": ["Xiaodan.Zhu@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Measuring Academic Influence: Not All Quotes Are the Same"}, {"heading": "Xiaodan Zhu and Peter Turney", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "National Research Council Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada.", "text": "Email: Xiaodan.Zhu @ nrc-cnrc.gc.ca"}, {"heading": "Daniel Lemire", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "TELUQ, Universite\u0301 du Que\u0301bec, Montreal, QC H2S 3L5, Canada.", "text": "Andre Vellino"}, {"heading": "School of Information Studies, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.", "text": "The importance of a research article is routinely measured by counting how many times it has been cited.

If our goal is to distinguish references by their degree of academic influence, then we need to be precise about the meaning of academic influence.

A paper written by an evolutionary biologist is likely to have been influenced by Darwin's On the Origin of Species, but we are more interested in the direct influences on the paper. A good research paper contributes to a new idea in the literature. What previous work was the immediate cause, the impetus for this new idea?

The task is to create a model that includes a pair consisting of the work of a particular author (the quoter) and a reference in the given work (the work cited), as input and generate a label (influential or non-influential) as output. Our goal is to create a model that can predict the designations assigned by the authors in our gold standard dataset. Our approach to this task is to use supervised machine learning. For supervised machine learning, we need to generate feature vectors that represent a variety of properties of each paper reference pair.

In other words, if there is a high degree of semantic similarity between the text of the quote and the text of the cited paper, it seems likely that the cited paper has a significant impact on the quote. Accordingly, we have examined a variety of characteristics that attempt to capture semantic similarity. We assume that the text of the quote cannot fall back on the text of the cited paper. The cited paper may not be readily available online due to the age of the paper. All of these characteristics can be efficiently implemented: all characteristics can often be compressed from a single document, even if the titles of the references are not included by the journal itself."}, {"heading": "Context-based features", "text": "The context in which they move could indicate in other ways that they are people who are deluding themselves and others.

If a reference appears more than once in the quoting work, we calculate the percentages; for example, if a reference is cited three times in the paper and two of the three appear at the beginning of the sentences, the posInSent initial characteristic takes the value of 0.667. The next four position-based characteristics are based on the position of a quote in the entire quoting work: 4.

To investigate this question, we are interested in understanding its usefulness in deciding the academic influence (in a particular essay). That is, if it is cited in a particular essay, a higher-quoted paper is more likely to have an academic influence on the citator? To examine this question, we have collected the raw citations of each reference in a scholar (we are likely to include a more general connotation of an earlier phenomenon)."}, {"heading": "Contextual normalization", "text": "Many of the above features are sensitive to the length of the quoting paper. < k > The number of occurrences of each reference pair in the whole quoting paper (countsInPaper whole) tends to exceed larger values in a long paper than in a short paper. To predict whether a reference is influential, it is useful to normalize the raw characteristics for a particular paper reference pair by taking into account the range of values in the given quoting paper. & k > Normalization is a form of contextual normalization (Turney, 1993, 1996) in which the quoting paper represents the context of a feature. We normalize all of our characteristics so that their values are in the range [0, 1]. This type of normalization is common practice in data mining as it improves the accuracy of most monitored learning algorithms (Witten, Frank, & Hall, 2011). For example, consider the characteristics as normal, not normal."}, {"heading": "Experiments with features", "text": "Using a marked dataset, we first identify the characteristics that correlate most strongly with academic influence, and then combine some of these characteristics to achieve a good classification."}, {"heading": "Gold-standard dataset", "text": "We believe that the authors of a paper are in the best position to determine whether a particular reference has had a strong impact on their research.

Instructions on the form were as follows: We believe that most papers are based on 1, 2 or 4 essential references. Other references only support the work of authors who have been very influential or inspiring to the core ideas in your paper.

For each group, we calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient between the conventional counts and the influence-based counts. For example, papers 1-100 are the 100 most frequently cited citation counts. The Spearman correlation between these two vectors is 0.67.12 For the 100 most cited papers, the count is one. For these 100 papers, we have a vector of 100 conventional citation counts. We also calculate a vector of 100 influence-based citation counts.

This is confirmed by an earlier finding by Hou et al. (2011), which stated: \"The citation frequency of individual articles in other papers measures their scientific contribution more fairly than mere presence in reference lists.\" Alternatively, we can count the number of paragraphs in which a paper is cited (CountsInPaper secNum). We believe that weighting citations based on these characteristics (e.g. CountsInPaper overall) would yield more robust results. It should also be used in tracking follow-up papers or recommending research papers. We have also shown that we can combine the citation frequency (CountsInPaper overall) and the semantic relationship between a reference and the cited work to derive a superior classifier."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Daniel Lemire thanks the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) grant number 26143 for their support.

However, treating all citations with equal weight ignores the wide variety of functions that citations perform. We want to automatically identify the subset of references in a bibliography that have a central academic influence on the citing paper. For this purpose, we examine the effectiveness of a variety of features for determining the academic influence of a citation. By asking authors to identify the key references in their own work, we created a dataset in which citations were labeled according to their academic influence. Using automatic feature selection with supervised machine learning, we found a model for predicting academic influence that achieves good performance on this dataset using only four features. The best features, among those we evaluated, were features based on the number of times a reference is mentioned in the body of a citing paper. The performance of these features inspired us to design an influence-primed h-index (the hip-index). Unlike the conventional h-index, it weights citations by how many times a reference is mentioned. According to our experiments, the hip-index is a better indicator of researcher performance than the conventional h-index.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
