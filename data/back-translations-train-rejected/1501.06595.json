METHODOLOGY", "text": "As already mentioned, our cluster algorithm is strongly inspired by probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) [6], with a difference in the assumption of user and cluster independence given the history of the user. In this section, we first give an introduction to the pLSA and then the difference of our model and our motivation why we chose this path. We close this section with the algorithmic and mathematical details of the model we used."}, {"heading": "3.1 Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis", "text": "That is, if we want to generate a new word from a document, we have to generate the topic first, or we have to generate the topic first. \"(1) This makes pLSA a really strong generative model.

(2) And then we have to generate the new word. (3)"}, {"heading": "3.2 Challenges of Online Advertising", "text": "As we explained in the previous subsection, pLSA works well in recommending new objects, as users are stable and we know the cluster ID for those users. However, in online advertising, we try to provide all users across the web (i.e. no subscription system), and the user IDs are much more volatile, since a web user's ID is based on the cookies on his / her device. If these cookies are deleted, his / her cluster is no longer valid, as the user ID no longer exists. Also, note that this causes many new users to enter (or leave) the ecosystem every day. What we need is a system that looks at the history of user events and assigns them to a cluster at ad time (i.e. runtime). Another problem in the online advertising domain is that we do not try to recommend new objects to users, at least not in the context of this paper."}, {"heading": "3.3 Differences of Our Methodology Compared to pLSA", "text": "The biggest difference in the cluster method we use in comparison to pLSA is in the model. Let's stick to the terms of online advertising, while pLSA assumes the independence of the beacon according to the user ID as long as the beacon ID is known, we maintain that the cluster ID is independent of the user ID, given the beacon ID. This assumption of independence in the model helps us determine the cluster of a new or existing user at runtime based on its beacon history, so we do not need to store a cluster ID for each user. Now that we can determine a user's cluster at runtime, an ad-serving system tries to determine the action or click probability of that user in the face of a specific ad on a particular website (publisher) as \"What is the action / click probability of a user belonging to that cluster i for that ad.\" Please view the difference of the models as a disk notation in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "3.4 Training the Model and Run-time Cluster Determination for Users", "text": "To determine a user's cluster, we must limit the number of these beacons to the number of users, not only the number of users, but also the way in which they executed the number of users / beacons. (We have to have the number of these beacons unique, so we can come up with a probability distribution like p (bj). (bj) n (ui) n, where the number of users / beacons must be unique, and n (ui) is the total number of beacons that the user has seen. (bj) n, ui) n (bj) n, where the number of users / beacons has been seen, and n (ui) is the total number of beacons that the user / beacons has seen."}, {"heading": "4.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we have described a methodology for focusing users in online advertising. We have explained the difficulties, such as the unstable number of users and the large amount of data we have to deal with, and how these factors shape the algorithm we use or how we implement this algorithm. We have given a brief overview of the implementation in Apache Pig, on Hadoop, as well as some initial experimental results. It is important to mention that we do not claim to have examined all the possible algorithms / models for analysis in this work, but rather that we have developed a meaningful and efficient system that solves a real problem of online advertising and improves performance. In summary, we believe that this work fills a significant gap in the literature, as it directly addresses the major problems that occur in the online advertising domain. Our future work includes expanding our results as well as an improved cluster algorithm that uses user characteristics (such as age, gender, location, etc.) alongside the items (i.e., better content)."}, {"heading": "7.
