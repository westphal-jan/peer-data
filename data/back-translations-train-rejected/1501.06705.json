THEORY OF BELIEF FUNCTIONS: AN OVERVIEW", "text": "This section recalls the necessary background to the theory of evidence. It was developed by Dempster in his work on upper and lower probability (1), on which basis he was able to present the observed data more accurately. (2) Later, in his book \"A Mathematical Theory of Evidence,\" [8], Shafer stated that any information defined by an expert has two functions: a credibility and a plausibility function corresponding to the lower and upper probabilities of Dempster. The theory was further developed by Smets in [9], [10] who proposed the transferable belief model (TBM), which presents a pignistic probability induced by a belief function that is built from each positive mass by defining a uniform probability. Furthermore, it can be regarded as the focus of probabilities that dominates probabilities in relation to upper and lower probabilities. It also introduced new tools for information fusion and decision-making after [11]."}, {"heading": "III. CONTINUOUS BELIEF FUNCTIONS", "text": "Unfortunately, these functions do not allow us to manipulate continuous data that can be provided by sensors in various areas such as search and rescue problems [13], classification issues, information fusion, etc. Some research has been interested in presenting faith functions within a continuous differentiation framework, such as Strat in [14] and Smets in [5]. In the following sections, we will present the various suggestions that allow us to describe continuous faith functions. First, we will explain how these functions can be extended to the real numbers, focusing on Smets \"approach to representing continuous faith functions through the use of probability densities. Later, we will recall the other approaches for the continuous case of faith functions."}, {"heading": "A. Continuous belief functions on IR", "text": "Smets based on the background of the TBM used the same representation as Strat and proposed the faith functions in the extended series of realities, the IR = IR = IR \u00b2, + \u221e}. However, using the faith function framework to model information in a continuous frame is not an easy task, mainly due to the complex nature of the focal elements. Compared with the discrete domain, on real numbers, in (Smets 2005) bba becomes basic faith densities (bbd) defined on an interval [a, b] of IR.1 Basic faith densities: A generalization of the classical bba into a fundamental faith density (bbd) called mI on the interval I. It defined the bbd where all focal elements are closed intervals or \u2205. In the face of a normalized bbd mI, Smets defined another function f on IR2, where {f, mb (b) is called (a), mb (b) (b)."}, {"heading": "B. Continuous belief functions induced by probability density functions", "text": "Let's look at several faith functions that characterize a unique source of information (the source is subjective and evident). Smets proposed a pignistic transformation of faith functions (which represent the knowledge of the source) to obtain probabilities, using probabilities to facilitate decision-making. Pignistic probabilities are called BetP, with densities also noted betf. For each probability density, we have a series of faith functions with which they are compatible. This group is called isopignitics. The main problem is to select a faith function from this group. To do this, let's consider the principle of least engagement proposed in [15], [16]. This principle supports the idea of selecting the faith function in which least an expert is involved. It can be considered a natural approach to select the less engaged bba from a subset."}, {"heading": "C. Continuous belief functions: other representations", "text": "Some other approaches have been proposed to describe continuous belief functions. [18] This function can contain two terms simultaneously: on the one hand, it defines both the lower probability and the upper probability, on the other hand, it considers random sets. We can say that the probability distribution of a random set is exactly the basic probability assignment. We say that there is a correspondence between belief functions on a source S and the probability distribution of random sets. This relationship can be expressed by their density to P (S)."}, {"heading": "D.

Strict inclusion", "text": "Here we will define the strict inclusion between two continuous faith functions, which are represented by two basic faith densities bbd. Let us first consider these distributions to derive a degree of inclusion between the bbds, and then we can measure the value of inclusion between our continuous faith functions.

The property of asymmetry between two continuous faith functions can be confirmed by showing the dimensions of inclusion in Table II and Table III.

These primary results confirm the distributions < in the case of inclusion of pdf1 in the primary values pdf3, pdf4 is the difference between the very important one, pdf = 4, and the very important one, in the case of inclusion \u03c31."}, {"heading": "A. Average of inclusion", "text": "Consider n distributions and \u03b1f a series of faith functions. We can measure the average of the inclusion of a bbd fi in \u03b1f.

Strict inclusion between belief densities induced by normal distributions", "text": "This strict inclusion is a natural approach that allows us to determine whether there is any intersection between two distributions, how they behave, and which parameters interfere with this process. In this case, if a degree of inclusion has binary values of 0 and 1, we will investigate this property between two continuous belief functions. The more the value of the second standard deviation grows, the greater the difference between \u03c31 and \u03c32 becomes due to the deviation of the second distribution. Otherwise, in Figure 2, relative to the strict inclusion, we notice that it is not the gap between the mean \u00b51 and \u00b52 that generates this growth. It is the difference between the two standard deviations, which is the origin of this growing phenomenon of inclusion."}, {"heading": "B.

It is possible to determine that if we are in the presence of two distributions with the same values, there is not necessarily an overall inclusion between them. We also note that the difference between \u03c31 and \u03c32 increases, due to the pdf2, the figure obtained grows faster and reaches its maximum value IncPar (f1, f2) = 1, where a curve is more curved than the strict inclusion. If the difference between \u00b51 and \u00b52 increases, due to the value of IncPar, we reach the partial inclusion of Inc2."}, {"heading": "VII. STRICT INCLUSION VS PARTIAL INCLUSION", "text": "If we compare the results of Figure 2 and Figure 3, where we have the same values for the two distributions, we find that the partial inclusion reaches the maximum value faster than the strict one. Furthermore, its area is larger and larger. Thus, we can determine that the partial inclusion prevails. In Figure 2 and Figure 3, it seems that we have the same phenomena between the two types of inclusion, which can be explained by the fact that we work with consonant faith functions (where focal intervals are nested). We can imagine that in the presence of other faith functions (categorical or Bajesian faith functions) we can obtain different behaviors between the strict and partial inclusion. We notice the same phenomena that we have seen for the strict ones, when the values of the parameters that characterize the second distribution grow, and generate a large difference between the means and the standard deviations that significantly decrease the partial inclusion and when we deal with smaller ones."}, {"heading": "VIII. CONCLUSION", "text": "We have defined two types of inclusions: strict and partial. Prior to that, we have detailed all the preliminary background information that allows us to experiment with this type of relationship. We have also provided the approach on which the evaluation of inclusions will be based. We have presented a relationship of inclusions that has normalized values that take into account the nature of the continuous faith functions described with intervals as focal elements. These two forms of inclusion respond to all properties that need to be met. We have also shown that both the mean and the standard deviation have different effects on this phenomenon, each with its specific output."}], "references": [{"title": "Conflict measure for the discounting operation on belief functions", "author": ["A.
