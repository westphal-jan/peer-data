INTRODUCTIONSyntactic analysis is the process of analyzing and determining the grammatical structure of a sentence in relation to a given formal grammar. Syntactic parsing of a sentence of natural language is considered to be an important intermediate stage of semantic analysis, which can influence many pipelines of the application of natural language processing, such as the extraction of information, word meanings, etc. The study of sentence structure is called syntax. It attempts to describe the grammatical order in a given language in the form of rules that can explain in detail the underlying structure and a transformative process. Syntax provides rules for putting words together to form sentence components and putting these components together to form meaningful sentences. Due to the considerable ambiguity present in human language, the use of which is intended to convey different semantics, it is very difficult to design the underlying structures and a transformative process."}, {"heading": "A. Rule Based Parser", "text": "In a rules-based approach, the language-specific rules are formulated to identify the best parse tree for a given grammar, but in this approach, the production rules are applied recursively, resulting in overlapping, and the problem can be efficiently solved by using Dynamic Programming Techniques (DP). The sub-parse tree cache in the DP-based parsers is referred to as a \"chart,\" and as a result, the DP-based parsers are referred to as \"chart parsers.\" The CYK algorithm and early algorithm are rule-based parsers."}, {"heading": "B. Statistical Based Parser", "text": "Statistical parsers collect statistical data from correctly analyzed sentences and replace ambiguities with experience. The advantage of the statistical approach is that it covers the entire grammar usage of the language. The performance of statistical parsers depends on the training corpus used to collect statistical information about the grammar of the language. Instead of using rules, statistical parsers choose the best parse tree from among possible candidates based on the statistical information. The disadvantage of this approach is that sometimes an invalid sequence of Parse.CFG and parsers based on Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) are examples of statistical parsers."}, {"heading": "C.
