Combination process helps us to make later decisions. Decision-making consists in selecting the most appropriate measures to be taken for a given problem. Today, we often face the challenge of making decisions in cases where information is inaccurate or even unavailable. In [12] Smets proposed the transferable belief model (TBM) as an interpretation of faith theory. TBM emphasizes a distinction between knowledge modelling and decision-making. Accordingly, we distinguish between the credal level and the pignic level. At the credal level, knowledge is presented as faith functions and then combined. Pignistic level corresponds to decision-making, a stage in which faith functions are transformed into probability functions."}, {"heading": "2 The theory of belief functions", "text": "The theory of faith functions [2,9] as a general mathematical framework for the presentation of beliefs and arguments under uncertainty (A). In this section, we recall some concepts of this theory (A). The framework of discrimination is a set of n elementary hypotheses that relate to a particular problem. (A) These hypotheses are exhaustive and mutually exclusive. (B) The power of discrimination is the proposition that contains singleton hypotheses, all the disjunctions of these hypotheses, as well as the empty set.The basic assignment of faith (bba) defined by m is a mass function defined by m. It affects any subset. It is defined as: A) 2.0m (A) = 1. (1) A focal element of 2.01 is an element that is 2.01. (A) A focal is an element of 2.0 (A) > 0."}, {"heading": "3 Decision Making in the theory of belief functions", "text": "In the transferable belief model, the decision is made at the pignistic level, where the belief functions are converted into a probability function called pignistic probability. The latter, called BetP, is defined for each X-2 probability, X-6 = 0 as: betP (X) = \u2211 Y-2 probability, Y-6. This decision results from the application of tools of decision theory [4]. If we look at an entity represented by a feature vector x, A is a finite series of possible actions A = {a1,.. aN} and a finite series of hypotheses, as well as a finite series of hypotheses, K = d-variability,... corresponds to an action aj the choice of hypotheses."}, {"heading": "4 Decision rule based on a distance measure", "text": "In [6] we have proposed a decision rule based on distance measurement. It is defined as: A = argmin (d (mcomb, mA) (12) This rule aims to decide on a union of individual elements, etc. It is based on the use of categorical bba mcomb and a categorical onemA. The minimum distance is respected and the decision corresponds to the categorical bba element with the smallest distance of two elements or three elements, etc. The rule is applied as follows: - We consider the elements of 2\u0443 mcomb and a categorical onemA. For this reason we can select some elements we are working on. For example, we can hold the elements of 2\u0445 selousa whose cardinality is smaller or equal to 2. - For each selected element we construct its categorical distance from me."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Experiments on generated mass functions", "text": "We tested the proposed rule [6] on a series of randomly generated mass functions. In order to generate the bbas, we must specify the cardinality of the differentiating frame, the number of mass functions to be created, and the number of focal elements. We then combine the generated bbas. We use the Dempster combination rule, the disjunctive rule, and the mixed rule. Suppose we have a differentiating frame represented as \u0432 = {\u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b83} and three different sources, for which we generate the corresponding bbas shown in Table 1. Once the combination is executed, we can make a decision. In Table 3, we compare the results of three decision rules, namely the pignistic probability, the Appriou rule equal to r 0.5, and our proposed decision rule based on the distance measurement. Table 3 shows the decision results obtained after applying some combination rules. We show from this table that not all the time the Appriou proposed rule is applied as a hypothesis, the decision on a Junou proposed rule based on a mixed one."}, {"heading": "5.2 Experiments on real databases", "text": "To test our proposed rule of decision, we do some experiments on real databases (IRIS1 and HaberMan's survival2).Iris is a dataset that originally comprised 150 cases, 4 attributes and 3 classes, in which each class refers to a type of iris plant.
