Although FMAP is specifically aimed at solving problems that require cooperation among agents, the flexibility of the domain-independent planning model allows FMAP to tackle multi-agent planning tasks of any type. In FMAP, agents jointly explore the plan space by building up refinement plans through a complete and flexible forward-chaining partial-order planner. The search is guided by $h_{DTG}$, a novel heuristic function that is based on the concepts of Domain Transition Graph and frontier state and is optimized to evaluate plans in distributed environments. Agents in FMAP apply an advanced privacy model that allows them to adequately keep private information while communicating only the data of the refinement plans that is relevant to each of the participating agents. Experimental results show that FMAP is a general-purpose approach that efficiently solves tightly-coupled domains that have specialized agents and cooperative goals as well as loosely-coupled problems. Specifically, the empirical evaluation shows that FMAP outperforms current MAP systems at solving complex planning tasks that are adapted from the International Planning Competition benchmarks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Jan 2015 19:38:35 GMT  (386kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07250v1", "21 pages, 11 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 11 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alejandro torre\\~no", "eva onaindia", "\\'oscar sapena"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.07250"}, "pdf": {"name": "1501.07250.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "FMAP: Distributed Cooperative Multi-Agent Planning", "authors": ["Alejandro Torre\u00f1o", "Eva Onaindia", "\u00d3scar Sapena"], "emails": ["atorreno@dsic.upv.es", "onaindia@dsic.upv.es", "osapena@dsic.upv.es"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Although FMAP is specifically designed to address issues requiring collaboration between agents, the flexibility of the domain-independent planning model enables FMAP to perform planning tasks with multiple agents of each type.

Centralized MAP involves the use of a facilitator who has full knowledge of the task. Therefore, the distributed or decentralized approach spreads planning responsibility among the actors responsible for interacting with each other to coordinate their local solutions if necessary [28,18]. Adopting a centralized approach aims to improve planners \"performance by exploiting the inherent structure of MAP tasks [22,8]. However, centralized approaches assume a single planning unit that has complete knowledge of the task, which is quite unrealistic if the parties involved in the task are unwilling to disclose their private information. In Example 1, the three actors involved in the task want to protect information relating to their internal processes and business strategies."}, {"heading": "3 MAP task formalization", "text": "Agents in FMAP operate with limited knowledge of the planning task, assuming that information not represented in an agent model is unknown to the agent. < Assigning a value d to a variable v \u00b2 V generates a fluent.

The main feature of these domains is that agents have the same planning capabilities (operators) so that each task goal can be solved individually by a single agent. That is, tasks can be tackled without collaboration between agents. Next, we offer an insight into the characteristics of these domains and the MAP adjustments. Satellite [24]. This domain offers a simple multi-agent decomposition [25,37]. The MAP domain has one agent per satellite. The resulting MAP tasks are almost decoupled, as each satellite can achieve a subset of task goals (even all goals) without interacting with another agent. The number of agents in the tasks of this domain varies from 1 to 12. The location, orientation and instruments of a satellite are private to the agent."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 Tightly-coupled domains", "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "FMAP is a universal MAP model that naturally supports distributed domains and defines an expanded concept of privacy. Agents in FMAP use an internal POP process to calculate all possible ways to refine a plan that guarantees the completeness of FMAP. Agents exchange plans and their evaluations using a communication mechanism managed by a coordinator-agent. FMAP uses the structure of distributed, state-independent domain transition graphs for heuristic evaluation of plans, thereby avoiding the need to recalculate estimates in each node of the POP search contract. Privacy is maintained throughout the search process.Agents communicate only the relevant information they share with the rest of the agents. This advanced concept of privacy is very useful for modeling real-world problems. Experiments show that dealing with privacy has a relatively low impact on the overall performance of FAP's 2013 MAPs. The MAPs in the MAPs indicate that other MAPs in the MAPs will have an impact on the overall performance."}], "references": [{"title": "Temporal planning with preferences and time-dependent continuous costs", "author": ["J.

fully-distributed multi-agent planning method that integrates planning and coordination. Although FMAP is specifically aimed at solving problems that require cooperation among agents, the flexibility of the domain-independent planning model allows FMAP to tackle multi-agent planning tasks of any type. In FMAP, agents jointly explore the plan space by building up refinement plans through a complete and flexible forward-chaining partial-order planner. The search is guided by hDTG, a novel heuristic function that is based on the concepts of Domain Transition Graph and frontier state and is optimized to evaluate plans in distributed environments. Agents in FMAP apply an advanced privacy model that allows them to adequately keep private information while communicating only the data of the refinement plans that is relevant to each of the participating agents. Experimental results show that FMAP is a general-purpose approach that efficiently solves tightly-coupled domains that have specialized agents and cooperative goals as well as loosely-coupled problems. Specifically, the empirical evaluation shows that FMAP outperforms current MAP systems at solving complex planning tasks that are adapted from the International Planning Competition benchmarks.
