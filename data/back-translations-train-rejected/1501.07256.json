Ability to define incomplete views of the world for agents allows us to deal with real problems, from inherently distributed domains - functional or spatial - to problems that handle global and centralized sources of information.The MAP solution process is a POP-based refinement approach that combines planning and coordination on an iterative basis, while for each agent only the information that is visible to the planning unit is obtained. This POP approach centers around the step-by-step creation of a common solution plan for the MAP task and highly demonstrates the solution of cooperative distributed planning problems."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This work was partially supported by the Spanish MICINN within the framework of the projects Consolider Ingenio 2010 CSD2007-00022 and TIN201127652-C03-01 as well as the Valencian Prometeo project 2008 / 051."}], "references": [{"title": "Partial-order planning with concurrent interacting actions", "author": ["C.
