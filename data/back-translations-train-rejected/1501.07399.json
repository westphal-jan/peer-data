Because of this, countless solutions have been devised but, to date, none of them seems to be fully satisfactory and flexible. In this article, we propose an innovative standpoint and present a solution coming from it: an anytime multimodal optimization algorithm for time series motif discovery based on particle swarms. By considering data from a variety of domains, we show that this solution is extremely competitive when compared to the state-of-the-art, obtaining comparable motifs in considerably less time using minimal memory. In addition, we show that it is robust to different implementation choices and see that it offers an unprecedented degree of flexibility with regard to the task. All these qualities make the presented solution stand out as one of the most prominent candidates for motif discovery in long time series streams. Besides, we believe the proposed standpoint can be exploited in further time series analysis and mining tasks, widening the scope of research and potentially yielding novel effective solutions.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Jan 2015 10:18:46 GMT  (287kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07399v1", "12 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["joan serr\\`a", "josep lluis arcos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.07399"}, "pdf": {"name": "1501.07399.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Particle Swarm Optimization for Time Series Motif Discovery", "authors": ["Joan Serr\u00e0", "Josep Lluis Arcos"], "emails": ["jserra@iiia.csic.es.", "arcos@iiia.csic.es."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "II.

Given a time series z of length n, z = [z1,.. zn], a normalized segment dissimilarity measure D, and a temporal window of interest between wmin and wmax samples, the Topk time series motifs M = {m1,.. mk} correspond to most similar segment pairs zwaa = [za,. za + wa \u2212 1] and z wb = [zb,]. zb + wb \u2212 1], for wa, wb \u2212.a, a, n \u2212 wa + 1], and b [1], where we [1, n \u2212 wb + 1], where we avoid repeated and trivial matches."}, {"heading": "B.

Consider a typical dissimilarity measurement such as the dynamic deformation of time between z-normalized segments and the time series of Fig. 1.

Particle Swarm Optimization", "text": "The continuity and readily available observations above (Sections II-B and II-C) loosen the requirements for the optimization algorithm used in the motif spaces under consideration. In fact, if we do not have to evaluate the global optimality of a solution, we have a number of approaches that can handle large, multimodal, continuous, but noisy search spaces [25] - [27]. Among them, we opt for PSO [30] - [34]. PSO is a population-based stochastic approach to solving continuous and discrete optimization problems [33] that has been applied to multimodal problems [35]. It is metaheurism [27], which means that it cannot guarantee whether the solution found corresponds to a global optimum. The original PSO algorithm cannot even guarantee convergence to a local optimum, but adapted versions of it have been proven to solve this problem [36]."}, {"heading": "E.

In some datasets, these two marginally inferior performances for short-term runs of the algorithm (small), although they gradually became equivalent to the rest for longer runs.

Final Performance", "text": "After expanding SWARMMOTIF with speed limitations and craziness, we evaluate its performance on all time series under consideration using the standard combination of parameters resulting from the previous two sections. As can be seen, the obtained motif differences are in all cases far from the random sample (Fig. 9; note the logarithmic axes). Furthermore, we see that SWARMMOTIF is already able to achieve inconsistencies with inM as soon as its execution begins. Specifically, motif differences in M begin to overlap with those in t < 10 s for virtually all time series. The only exceptions are EOG and RANDOMWALK, where M begins to overlap with t < 100 s. We assume that a smaller number of particles overlap with M may overlap."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this article, we propose an innovative approach to the task of time series discovery by formulating it as a multimodal optimization problem at all times. After a precise but comprehensive literature review, we will establish the new formulation and develop an approach based on the calculation of time series. We will then highlight the various advantages of this new formulation, many of which relate to a high degree of flexibility in the resulting solutions. To get the most out of our knowledge, such a degree of flexibility is invisible in previous work on time series motives. We will present next SWARMOTIF, an always multimodal optimization algorithm for time series motives based on the discovery of particle swarms. We will show that SWARMOTIF is extremely competitive when the best approach we can find in literature."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We would like to thank all those who contributed the data sets used in this study, and Abdullah Mueen for the additional transmission of his code.

In this article, we propose an innovative standpoint and present a solution coming from it: an anytime multimodal optimization algorithm for time series motif discovery based on particle swarms. By considering data from a variety of domains, we show that this solution is extremely competitive when compared to the state-of-the-art, obtaining comparable motifs in considerably less time using minimal memory. In addition, we show that it is robust to different implementation choices and see that it offers an unprecedented degree of flexibility with regard to the task. All these qualities make the presented solution stand out as one of the most prominent candidates for motif discovery in long time series streams.
