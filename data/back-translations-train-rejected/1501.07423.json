The definition emphasizes two aspects of MAGPs that are not present in retail planning: the coordination of planning activities and the distribution of information between individual actors. The solution of a cooperative MAGP task involves the following stages (Durfee, 2001): 1) global task distribution, 2) task distribution, 3) pre-planning coordination, 5) post-planning coordination and 6) plan execution. Some of the previous stages can be avoided or combined: Some works explicitly do not distribute the goals (Level 2) (Belesiotis)."}, {"heading": "2.3. Architectures and frameworks for MAP", "text": "The design of architectures and frameworks is another active field of research in MAP. In recent years, some relevant work has been published in MAP frameworks. Work in (Wilkins and Myers, 1998) presents a complete MAP architecture for large-scale problem solving that organizes agents into planning cells committed to a specific planning process. TAEMS's domain-independent coordination framework (Lesser, Decker, Wagner, Carver, Garvey, Horling, Neiman, Podorozhny, Prasad, Raja et al., 2004) offers planning capabilities to agents and applies the GPGP approach to coordination. Other MAP architectures are based on universal MAS platforms rather than being designed from scratch. MAS platforms such as Magentix2 (Fogu\u00e9s, Alberola, Such, Espinosa and Garcia-Fornes, 2010; Argente, Botti, Carrascosa, Julian and Rebollo, 2011 or JAP platforms such as Foxinosa, 2010 and JAP-INabilines, 2010."}, {"heading": "2.4. Contributions of our model", "text": "Our novel approach to collaborative MAGPs can be placed in the research trend that integrates planning and coordination; the MAP system achieves two main objectives: 1) it solves complex, highly interconnected problems and loosely coupled problems without losing generality; and 2) it enables heterogeneous actors to work with incomplete information by passing on only critical information that concerns other actors, and in part ignoring information from other actors about the MAP task. Our MAP approach focuses on a novel method that combines single-agent planning technologies and a refinement-based methodology. More specifically, we combine a distributed refinement planning process (Kambhampati, 1997) and individual sub-planning (Nguyen and Kambhampati, 2001; Younes and Simmons, 2003)."}, {"heading": "3. Motivating example", "text": "This section introduces the example MAP scenario, which we use below to illustrate the concepts presented in this paper. An example of the application, presented in Figure 1, describes a transport and warehousing scenario in which two agents (Ag1 and Ag2) assume the role of transport agencies and a third agent (Ag3) manages a warehouse facility. Transport agents deliver packages through a network of cities. In turn, the warehouse agent is responsible for storing and delivering packages to trucks. Packages can be either raw materials or end products. Agents in the MAP task are entrusted with two different objectives: the delivery of the end product to the city cA and the raw material p3 to the city cE. This scenario includes bi-directional links between cities that allow transport agents to move from one city to another. Transport agents can perform three different actions: they can deliver packages in the city p1 and unload them, and they can unload packages in the city cA."}, {"heading": "4.

In this way, brokers solve the MAP task cooperatively by fine-tuning an initially empty plan one after the other. In this context, the Partial Planning (POP) (Barrett and Weld, 1994) presents itself as an appropriate approach to refinement planning, focusing on the gradual resolution of the pending goals. Consequently, brokers in our MAP approach plan concurrent actions by adopting the POP paradigm.

In most cases, agents work under complete information, building complete knowledge bases. The present article introduces a general-purpose MAP framework designed to tackle problems of any coupling levels under incomplete information. Agents in our MAP model are partially unaware of the information managed by the rest of agents and share only the critical information that affects other agents, thus maintaining a distributed vision of the task. Agents solve MAP tasks through the adoption of an iterative refinement planning procedure that uses single-agent planning technology. In particular, agents will devise refinements through the Partial-Order Planning paradigm, a flexible framework to build refinement plans leaving unsolved details that will be gradually completed by means of new refinements. Our proposal is supported with the implementation of a fullyoperative MAP system and we show various experiments when running our system over different types of MAP problems, from the most strongly-related to the most loosely-coupled.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
