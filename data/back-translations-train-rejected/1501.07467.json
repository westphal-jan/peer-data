Features are divided into three categories: user-based, film-based and tweet-based. We show that, in order to achieve good results, features from all categories should be taken into account. We use regression and learning to evaluate methods to evaluate tweets and propose to collect the results of regression and learning to evaluate methods to achieve better performance. We conducted our experiments on an expanded version of the MovieTweeting data set provided by ACM RecSys Challenge 2014. Results show that learning to evaluate the approach outperforms most of the regression models and the combination can significantly improve performance.

RELATED WORK", "text": "The problem of predicting engagement or online participation has been investigated from various points of view in news websites, social networks and discussion forums. Multiple machine learning algorithms have been used in the literature for this task. To address the problem of predicting engagement, several features have been proposed for training a model. Suh et al. [28] have provided an analysis of the factors influencing the number of retweets. They have come to the conclusion that hashtags, the number of followers, the number of followers and the age of followers play an important role in increasing the likelihood that the tweets will be retweeted. Zaman et al. [34] have trained a probabilistic collaborative filter model to predict future retweets based on the history of previous Ones.Linear models have been used in some other studies to predict the popularity of videos on YouTube by observing their popularity after regular periods [29] Petrovic al Tweet al to predict whether a superalgorithmic one will be proposed."}, {"heading": "3. METHODOLOGY", "text": "In general, our idea is to extract a number of features for each tweet and then try to learn machine learning models based on the training data. We then apply the model learned for each user in test data to classify their tweets based on their engagement. In this section, we first present the features and then propose some approaches to machine learning to classify the tweets based on their engagement. We also try to aggregate the results of these different techniques to improve performance. In the following subsections, we explain our methodology in detail."}, {"heading": "3.1 Features", "text": "Each tweet contains a user's opinion on a particular movie. We break down the features extracted from each tweet into three different categories: user-based, movie-based, and tweet-based features. Overall, we extract multiple features from each tweet that user U tweeted about the movie M. User-based features give us some information about the user who tweeted his opinion about a particular movie. These features are not tweet-specific and they are the same for all tweets that user U tweeted about the movie M. The total number of followers of U about the movie M. The movie-based features only contain information about the movie M, such as the total number of tweet-based features contain specific information about the tweet T. This information may also include user U's opinion about the movie M. The time and language of a tweet are two examples of tweet-based features. The name and description of the extracted features are shown in Table 1. \"These features are also used for each tweet and we also specify the specific characteristics for each category."}, {"heading": "3.2 Machine Learning Techniques for User Engagement Ranking", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own, without being able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In the experiments, we look at an enhanced version of the MovieTweeting dataset [9] provided by the ACM RecSys Challenge 2014 [27].2 The dataset contains film ratings that are automatically tweeted by users of the iOS application IMDb.The results of this work are the results of the test set. The rating measure is the mean of the normalized discounted cumulative gain [14] calculated for each user's top 10 tweets. We call it NDCG @ 10, hereinafter. In our experiments, we used the Scikit Learn library [25] for all regression and feature selection algorithms. To select the parameters of the learning methods, we performed hyperparameter optimizations using Randomized Search [3] with 5-fold cross-validation. For learning algorithms other than AdaRank, we used an open source package called ToyBox Rankingank 3 software developed for Microsoft Research [33]."}, {"heading": "4.1 Experimental Results and Discussion", "text": "In this area, we are able to analyze and analyze the results of the study."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In order to classify each user's tweets according to their engagement, we first defined several features that are divided into three different categories: user-based, film-based and tweet-based. We showed that the features are selected from all of these categories after feature selection has been carried out. Then, we used regression and methods to classify each user's tweets according to their engagement. Finally, we aggregated the results of all regression and learning to classify methods using a monitored Kemeny approach. We evaluated our methods on an extended version of the MovieTweeting dataset of the ACMRecSys Challenge 2014. Experimental results show that feature selection significantly influences performance. The results also show that the results of most regression models, however, are much lower than learning methods, their aggregation improves performance."}, {"heading": "6.

"abstractText": "User engagement refers to the amount of interaction an instance (e.g., tweet, news, and forum post) achieves. Ranking the items in social media websites based on the amount of user participation in them, can be used in different applications, such as recommender systems. In this paper, we consider a tweet containing a rating for a movie as an instance and focus on ranking the instances of each user based on their engagement, i.e., the total number of retweets and favorites it will gain. For this task, we define several features which can be extracted from the meta-data of each tweet. The features are partitioned into three categories: user-based, movie-based, and tweet-based. We show that in order to obtain good results, features from all categories should be considered. We exploit regression and learning to rank methods to rank the tweets and propose to aggregate the results of regression and learning to rank methods to achieve better performance. We have run our experiments on an extended version of MovieTweeting dataset provided by ACM RecSys Challenge 2014. The results show that learning to rank approach outperforms most of the regression models and the combination can improve the performance significantly.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
