Introduction", "text": "With the advent of more efficient circuits and the increasing availability of new signal processing techniques (Vasegnhi 2007, Holmes & Holmes, 2001, Oppenheim & Schafer, 2010), the development of new apps that include speech synthesis, speech recognition, automatic translators for speech conversion (text-to-speech and / or spoken text) is spreading (Taylor, 2003, Santos, 1997 Sotero & de Oliveira, 2009).Application systems that include Portuguese text-to-language conversion are already promising (Fraga, 2001, Silva et al., 2009, Silva et al.), but current systems still require improvement (Neto, 2005).Some systems intended for Portuguese text-to-language, 2001), and they usually involve three steps: i) (sub) syllabic systems, ii) conversion of segments, ii) conversion of segments, iii, ios, ii, ii, ios, ii, ii, ios."}, {"heading": "2.

Acquisition and Pre-processing Speech", "text": "The data (speech) was collected in an isolated room with controlled sound level. It was assembled using an Intel HP \u00ae Atom computer, unused headset. 49 different language collections for men and women were performed. Language acquisition software was Audacity 1.3 T. The recordings were generated using. \"wav\" extension files. Figure 1 illustrates the interface of the Matlab script for the file audio corresponding to the word \"departmental.\" The pre-processing of the vocalizations was also performed using the same application, which consists of eliminating the quiet parts at the beginning and end of each recorded file. Since the files could be captured in stereo format, a mono conversion may be required. The reading syllable separator is then performed at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, with a 16-bit quantization. The window length in the algorithm was 2048 samples. This value was selected by studying the vocal behavior of the portable olive speaker in 2012."}, {"heading": "2.2 Rectification of the wave, RMS value and Linear Discharge", "text": "The equalization of the voice signal is done by means of the function signal, defined by: converting each value of the sample x [n] for x [n].

Figure 2 illustrates the GUI Matlab signal wave program, which has been rectified for the word \"batata\" (which is used for simplicity in the illustration instead of the word \"departmento\"). After the half-wave rectification, the RMS value (root center square) was evaluated. The RMS value is used later in the course of the syllable position. Together with a statistical percentage, both serve as the evaluation criterion for the position of the syllables. Envelope detection (root center square) is then performed by a linear discharge of the signal, using values from the samples obtained in the wave rectification process."}, {"heading": "3.

Identifying and breaking supersyllables", "text": "Normally, the average number of samples contained in a syllable is 6,543 samples, with a standard deviation of 5,467 samples (values limited to the statistical analysis of examined words, but representative of a general line of analysis in Portuguese - at least for the purposes of this algorithm).As long as syllables whose length exceeds the mean by an average standard deviation (i.e. 12,010 samples) are considered \"supersyllables,\" it has been observed empirically that the sequences of a number of samples corresponding to or exceeding this value have de facto more than one syllable in their composition. Furthermore, it has become necessary to use other criteria to localize the beginning and end of each syllable within a supersyllable.The criterion used to split syllables whose number is greater or equal to 12,010 samples is to compare the values of this supersyllable with a given value within a supersyllable. The criterion used to split syllable whose number is greater or equal to 12,010 samples is to compare the values of that supersyllable with a given value within a supersyllable."}, {"heading": "5. Performance of the syllabic divisor", "text": "The proposed algorithm could adequately perform an automatic syllabic separation of 43 of 49 recorded words - Batita ba - Batta ta each - among these 43 words, 20 of them were completely separated (Table III) and 23 received a partial separation (Table IV). Therefore, it is subsequently shown that the process for separating the word DEPARTMENTO, including the details of the user interface, was not fully defined for these graphics (Figures 5 to 7), the corresponding sounds and matching files can be cited in the certificate. The evaluated word, \"corresponded to a total of 76,800 keywords in the record, which take a total of 1.74 seconds.

Conclusions", "text": "A major challenge in speech processing is the design of systems for automatic speech-to-text (STT) that run in real time with acceptable quality (Huang et al. 2001). Text-to-speech (TTS) systems are highly developed, and this algorithm can be useful in the initial phase of a TTS system adapted to Portuguese. The technique presented here is much simpler compared to HMM techniques or cepstral analysis. In the case of use in embedded systems, despite the hit rate of syllables, which is not suitable for commercial applications, simple improvements can be incorporated in the handling of phonemes for which the envelope is not decisive for identification. In this case, the proposal (with open code) can function as the first base system and thus achieve better accuracy rates. A specific case of interest and application concerns the use in automated systems with command-specific voice (previously catalogued), in which case the hit rates may be much better."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "E.L.F.

A computational implementation in MatlabTM is presented and made available at the URL http://www2.ee.ufpe.br/codec/divisao_silabica.html. Due to its straightforwardness, the proposed method is very attractive for embedded systems (e.g. i-phones). It can also be used as a screen to assist more sophisticated methods. Voice excerpts containing more than one syllable and identified by the same envelope are named as super-syllables and they are subsequently separated. The results indicate which samples corresponds to the beginning and end of each detected syllable. Preliminary tests were performed to fifty words at an identification rate circa 70% (further improvements may be incorporated to treat particular phonemes). This algorithm is also useful in voice command systems, as a tool in the teaching of Portuguese language or even for patients with speech pathology.
