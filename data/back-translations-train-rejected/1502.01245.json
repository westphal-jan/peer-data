Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to another world in which they are able to live, in which they want to live."}, {"heading": "2. Methods", "text": "In this paper, the style of written texts has been quantified by measuring the topological properties of complex networks [60].The representation of a text as a coexistence (word adjacency) network is presented in detail in Section 2.1. The topological characteristics of complex networks used to analyze the stylistic variation of texts are presented in Section 2.2. An alternative model based on the spatial distribution of words is presented in Section 2.3."}, {"heading": "2.1. Modeling texts as complex networks", "text": "There are several ways to model texts as networks [52]. Whereas semantic networks capture the relationships between word meanings, parallel networks are better suited to capture stylistic attributes of written texts. Indeed, parallel networks are a simplified version of syntactic networks [16], since most syntactic connections between adjacent words occur [16, 56]. Before creating a parallel network, some pre-processing steps are usually performed. First, words that convey a low semantic context (stopwords) are removed; most of the words that are considered stopwords are articles and prepositions (see supplementary information); they are removed from the analysis because such words are largely used to connect other substantive words to each other. Once the stopwords are removed, words with a unique spelling that relate to the same concept (stopwords) are assigned to the same form."}, {"heading": "2.2. Topological characterization of complex networks", "text": "While local measurements only require information about the neighbors of a particular node, global measurements require that the global network connection be known in advance. There is a third class: quasi-local measurements. As the name suggests, quasi-local measurements require information about additional neighbors (i.e. the nodes located two or more steps away from the node to be analyzed).The following list briefly describes the measurements used to analyze the topology of texts used to model networks. In general, accessibility has proven useful for identifying the boundaries of complex networks during self-avoidance random walks [37]. In textual networks, this measurement has been used to identify keywords and create informative extractive summaries [37]."}, {"heading": "2.3. Intermittency", "text": "In linguistic models, the effects of word attraction and repulsion are a pervasive phenomenon [31, 57]. Several studies have shown that the distribution of many words along documents is irregular [29-32]. In particular, keywords are usually unevenly distributed along texts [16, 28-32]. This finding has motivated the design of keyword recognition methods based on a single document [53]. In order to analyze the spatial distribution of words, each token is assigned to an element in a time series. The first word of the text represents the first element, the second word represents the second element, and so on. In view of a word that occurs three times in the text, the return time of wi is the temporal distribution of Ti = {t1, t2, t3,.]., tfi \u2212 1}, where t1 is the distance (i.e. the number of intermediate words) between the first and second occurrence of wi. \""}, {"heading": "2.4. Pattern recognition methods", "text": "The classification task is aimed at assigning categories (or classes) to elements, taking into account the attributes (or characteristics) of those elements. Specifically, an attribute is a measurable property of objects. To illustrate the concept, one must assume that in a particular application there is a desire to classify people according to their physical attributes. In this case, most attributes used in traditional applications are either numerically (e.g. 1, 7 and 3.14) or categorically (e.g. low and high). In the current study, one of the attributes is used to characterize the intermittence of certain words."}, {"heading": "3. Results", "text": "Due to their central importance for stylistic analysis, several papers have been proposed [58]. Simple approaches include the analysis of word length and additional character characteristics [67]. Mosteller and Wallace [68] have demonstrated that the frequency of functional words (such as \"and,\" \"arbitrary,\" \"je\" or \"to\" and \"with\") can be used to quantify author style. Recently, many other approaches have been developed [58], including those based on the topological analysis of complex networks [33, 70]. Here, I use complex network and intermittent measurements to obtain potentially useful attributes to identify authors of books whose identity is missing. As this study focuses on the analysis of stylistic fluctuations, the patterns shown by the development of statistical measurements along texts will be examined."}, {"heading": "3.1. Stylistic variation along books", "text": "In this section, I will examine whether stylistic variation along texts are useful attributes for the task of identifying authorship. To quantify stylistic variations, the following methodology has been used: Each book in the dataset has been divided into subtexts containing W signs, assuming that a book has been extracted by a sequence of tokens W = {w1, w2,.} that each subtext Tj will include the sequence of subtexts (see Section 2.1) and the topological measurements of each subtext have been extracted (see Section 2.2). Thus, each topological measurement X generates a temporal series X = {x1, x2,."}, {"heading": "3.2. Authorship recognition via word intermittency", "text": "To verify whether the unequal distribution of certain words along texts provides useful characteristics for characterizing authors \"styles, the following experiment was conducted. Following styleometry research, this study focused on functional words. The 100 most common perceptrons in the corpus were considered to be functional words. As such, as attributes for the classifiers, the intermittency of these functional words was used. The best classifier, the multilayer Perceptron, yielded an accuracy rate of 65.0% (p-value = 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u2212 14). This result suggests that the intermittence of certain functional words could be useful for characterizing authors in texts. Note that discrimination with intermittent characteristics is not affected by the frequency of functional words, as there is no significant correlation between intermittence and frequency (see Section 2.3)."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusion", "text": "In this study, I investigated whether measurements that characterize time series from texts are useful for identifying authors \"styles. In light of the results, one can conclude that authors\" stylistic properties can be characterized by analyzing the fluctuations in textual statistical measurements; the statistically significant accuracy rates achieved in the assignment task to authorship confirmed that the characteristics derived from fluctuation of specific topological and intermittency-related measurements are able to distinguish different authors; an analysis of the spatial distribution of certain words showed that the relative meaning of different attributes may depend on the subtext length; however, in general, other components of Fourier deposition of topological measurements proved to be relevant characteristics for the task; an analysis of the spatial distribution of certain words yielded distinct distribution patterns for different authors. Surprisingly, the intermittence of functional words could distinguish the authority in 65% of the cases of topological measurements by correctly differentiating the attributes of the authors \"stylistic assessments, 8."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "DRA thanks the Sa'o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESPBrazil) for its financial support (grant number 2014 / 20830-0).16"}, {"heading": "Appendix A.

[66] Decision treesDecision tree algorithms employ trees [62] to summarse the pattern recognized in the dataset (see Figure A1). Typically, a decision tree includes internal and leaf nodes. While the internal nodes store the tests performed on specific attributes, leaf nodes represent classes. The edges connect nodes according to the answers given in the tests. In this case, the node representing the test F1 has two outgoing edges, namely \"YES\" and \"NO.\" During the classification phase, one can travel through the tree until one Leaf node is reached. In this case, the class associated with the Leaf node is assigned to the unknown instance. The decision process is illustrated in an illustration."}], "references": [{"title": "C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning", "author": ["R Quinlan J"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "59", "shortCiteRegEx": "59", "year": 1993}, {"title": "Probing the topological properties of complex networks modeling short written texts.
