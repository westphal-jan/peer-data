We participated in task 17 of the Semeval campaign 2015 (Bordea et al., 2015), which consisted in structuring a list of pre-identified domain terms into a list of hypernym pairs. List of terms automatically identified for four domains (equipment; food, chemistry, science) were provided by task organizers. For each domain, two lists were provided, one from WordNet and one from another source, resulting in a total of eight lists. Using all resources, participants were asked to return eight pairs of terms, the first term being a hyponym of the second term. For example, if the words airship and blimp were included in the list of terms for a domain, the system was expected to return lines such as: 25 blimp airshiper."}, {"heading": "2 Domain Lists", "text": "We have been provided with the following lists of domain terms, without explanation as they were created (although WN stands for WordNet): chemical. Terms: agarose, nickel sulphate-heptahydrate, aminoglycan, pinoquercetin, lupanin,... equipment. Terms: memory equipment, strapping, travel microscope, Minneapolis-Moline,... food. Terms: sauce concepts, botifarra, phitti, food dyes, bean, kalat,... Terms: electromechanical systems, biological and physical concepts, history of religions of eastern origin, linguistic anthropology, metaphysics, religion, semantics,... WN _ chemische concepts: abo antibodies, acaricide, acaroid-resin, aceptor, acetaldehyde, acetamide, acetamide, acetamide, etamide, etamic, acetamic acid..."}, {"heading": "2.1 Preprocessing the resource", "text": "Our only resource for discovering hypernym relationships was English Wikipedia. Starting with the Wiki Newest Pages Article.xml, we extracted the entire text between < Text > Markers and marked document borders with < Title > Markers. The text was then symbolized (Grefenstette, 1999) and output with our own programs as one sentence per line. The first English Wikipedia sentence that was extracted looked like this: \"Anarchism\" is a political philosophy that stateless societies often advocate... on the basis of non-hierarchical free associations. As mentioned above, no other information (info boxes, categories, etc.) was retained. We applied Porter Stemming (Willet, 2006) and Stopword Removal (Buckley et al., 1995) (superseded by underscores). The first sentence then looked like this: anarch _ _ _ _ _ polit philosophi _ advoc societyless societarian _ self-goversever _ author _ in _ governse.author _."}, {"heading": "3 Extracting Hypernyms", "text": "To extract hypernyms, we used the following characteristics: (i) the presence of terms in the same sentence, (ii) the presence of terms in the same document, (iii) the frequency of terms, (iv) the frequency of documents, and (v) sub-sequences."}, {"heading": "3.1 Subterms", "text": "A file in these training data, ontolearn _ AX.taxo, represents the truth for the training file ontolearn _ AX.terms and contains: 42 source code 2251 Theory of Inheritance Theory. From these validated examples, we conclude that a \"simple\" method of finding Hypernyms is to check whether one term is a suffix of the other (e.g. communication satellite as a kind of satellite) or whether a term B is the prefix of another term B A C, where A is an arbitrary word with two letters (e.g. Helm of Co\u0163ofene\u015fti as a kind of helmet; caterpillar d9 as a kind of Ca-terpillar). This heuristics has been unexpectedly productive in the chemical domain, where many hypernym pairs were similar to: Ginsenosidemc as a kind of ginsenoside. We have not tried to assign the prefix of an air merger of two different hyper pairs, which are often overlooked by two different microsymen, and two other hyper pairs."}, {"heading": "3.2 Sentence and Document Co-occurrence Statistics", "text": "For the remaining terms (which of course could contain the hypernyms found by suffix and prefix heuristics), after trying a number of alternatives described in the next section, we decided to use the statistics of the presence of documents and the simultaneous occurrence of terms in sentences to predict hypernym relations. Let's let dporter (term) be the frequency of a potter term in the ancestral version of Wikipedia. Since Wikipedia article boundaries were stored, we considered each Wikipedia article as a new document. Let's let SentCoocporter (termi, termj) be the number of times that the porter-derived versions of Termi and Termj appear in the same sentence in the native English Wikipedia."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Co-occurrence Example", "text": "Consider the following example: In the domain filescience.terms, there are 122 biblical studies. Porter's version of this term studi appears in 887 sentences. Looking at all other terms in science, we find that biblical studies occur 215 times in the same sentence as the root version of theology (theologi), 111 times in the same sentences asstemmed history (histori), 50 times with religion, 43 times with music and 42 times with science (scienc). 215 887 21977 biblical studies theologi 111 887 383927 biblical studies histori 50 887 64044 biblical studies of religious nature 43 887 412791 biblical studies of biblical music 42 887 224983 biblical studies of biblical SciencWe decided to keep the top three for simplicity, this term contributed three lines to our submitted Science.taxo file: 121 biblical studies of religious studies 121."}, {"heading": "3.3 Other Attempts at Finding Relations", "text": "We have tried a number of other methods to find hypernyms, none of which gave satisfaction by looking at the results. We have implemented a method to identify sentences that contain Hearst patterns (list from (Cimiano et al., 2005) that relate to domains. For example, tape is in equipment.terms, and we have been able to find derivative sentences of the form A, B and other C... such as todai, sticki note, 3m # tape # @ and other @ # tape # ar examples of psa (print-sensit adhes) from which we could have extracted relationships, such as 3m tape is atypical of tape, and sticky note is a type of tape. But we would have had to analyze the sentence and would have been willing to add new terms (which were allowed by the organizers to add to the derivative hypernym lists), but in our first participation in this conference in semester time we wanted to discover these processing terms that we did not have in each case as Wikipedia."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": "Each participant in Task 17 of SemEval 2015 was allowed to submit one run for each of the 8 domains (see Table 1 for domain names and the number of Hypernym pairs we submitted).The commissioners evaluated the submissions of the six participating teams using automated and manual methods and published their evaluation three weeks after the submission deadline. Our team ranked first in the official ranking of the six submitted teams. The evaluation criteria, which were not published before the submission, combined the presence of cycles in the submitted hypernyms, the Fowlkes & Mallows measure of the overlap between the submitted, the F-Score ranking, the number of domains submitted (not all teams delivered results for all domains) and a manual precision ranking (for hypernyms that are not available in the gold standard).The gold standards used by the commissioning organizations are based on published taxonomies from WordN (given above)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "Although training data was provided for this taxonomy task, we did not use it when we first participated in Semeval. We implemented some simple frequency-based statistics on the occurrence of co-events and sub-string inclusion euristics to suggest a number of hypernyms. We did not implement graph algorithms (cycle detection, branch deletion) that would be useful to build a real hierarchy. We hope to learn from the other participants which paths to explore in the future to improve memory."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research is partly funded by a research grant from INRIA and the Institut de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Num\u00e9rique Paris-Saclay, funded by IDEX Paris-Saclay, ANR-11-IDEX-0003-02."}], "references": [{"title": "Semeval-2015 task 17: Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation", "author": ["Georgeta Bordea", "Paul Buitelaar", "Stefano Faralli", "Roberto Navigli."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation.
