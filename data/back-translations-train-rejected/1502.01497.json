A temporal abstraction pattern defines an abstraction relation between an observation hypothesis and a set of observations constituting its evidence support. New observations are generated abductively from any subset of the evidence of a pattern, building an abstraction hierarchy of observations in which higher levels contain those observations with greater interpretative value of the physiological processes underlying a given signal. Non-monotonic reasoning techniques have been applied to this model in order to find the best interpretation of a set of initial observations, permitting even to correct these observations by removing, adding or modifying them in order to make them consistent with the available domain knowledge. Some preliminary experiments have been conducted to apply this framework to a well known and bounded problem: the QRS detection on ECG signals. The objective is not to provide a new better QRS detector, but to test the validity of an abductive paradigm. These experiments show that a knowledge base comprising just a few very simple rhythm abstraction patterns can enhance the results of a state of the art algorithm by significantly improving its detection F1-score, besides proving the ability of the abductive framework to correct both sensitivity and specificity failures.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Feb 2015 10:57:07 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01497v1", "7 pages, Healthcare Informatics (ICHI), 2014 IEEE International Conference on"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, Healthcare Informatics (ICHI), 2014 IEEE International Conference on", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tom\\'as teijeiro", "paulo f\\'elix", "jes\\'us presedo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.01497"}, "pdf": {"name": "1502.01497.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Using temporal abduction for biosignal interpretation: A case study on QRS detection", "authors": [], "emails": ["tomas.teijeiro@usc.es"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to"}, {"heading": "II.

AN APPLICATION TO ECG QRS DETECTION", "text": "To test the practicability of this framework, we have defined a simple knowledge base to address a well-known and limited problem = > Tb = = 600; QRS detection on ECG signals. This knowledge base proceeds from initial observations of QRS notes, which are identified by any other algorithm, and describes some of the most common rhythm patterns in terms of time intervals between beats. The knowledge base defines the following series of observables Q = {q0, q1, q2, q3, q5}, with: q0 = < Beatq0 = QRS, which are not annotated at first, QRS, the following series of observables Q = {qR2, qRS, the following QRs, the following QR0, the observations are not annotated by the Patterns.S =:"}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "We have conducted a validation study to prove that non-monotonous behaviour is capable of verifying the results of classical approaches and to try to expand a state-of-the-art QRS detector with a very simple knowledge base. The aim was not to provide a new algorithm for detecting QRS, but to prove that an anabductive approach can overcome the limitations of deductive methods. Results show the ability of our proposal to correct and improve the results of the original algorithm. Future plans include building a more comprehensive knowledge base, modelling other ECG components, such as P and T waves, explicitly taking into account the morphology of significant waves and including further rhythm patterns. This should lead to more interpretative information and help improve previous results of ECG processing at all levels of abstraction, from detection of QRS to detection of arrhythmias."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "T.
