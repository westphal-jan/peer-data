To solve this problem, the goal is to provide a decision rule for choosing, at each time step, the next action to perform in light of known requests and probabilistic knowledge on requests likelihood. We introduce a new decision rule, called Global Stochastic Assessment (GSA) rule for the DS-VRPTW, and we compare it with existing decision rules, such as MSA. In particular, we show that GSA fully integrates nonanticipativity constraints so that it leads to better decisions in our stochastic context. We describe a new heuristic approach for efficiently approximating our GSA rule. We introduce a new waiting strategy. Experiments on dynamic and stochastic benchmarks, which include instances of different degrees of dynamism, show that not only our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods, but also enables to compute meaningful offline solutions to fully dynamic problems where absolutely no a priori customer request is provided.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Feb 2015 18:11:09 GMT  (591kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01972v1", "Extended version of the same-name study submitted for publication in conference CPAIOR2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version of the same-name study submitted for publication in conference CPAIOR2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DM", "authors": ["michael saint-guillain", "yves deville", "christine solnon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.01972"}, "pdf": {"name": "1502.01972.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Multistage Stochastic Programming Approach to the Dynamic and Stochastic VRPTW Extended version", "authors": ["Michael Saint-Guillain", "Yves Deville", "Christine Solnon"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Dynamic (or online) vehicle routing problems (D-VRPs) arise when information about requirements is incomplete, e.g. when a customer is able to submit a request during the online execution of a solution.D-VRP instances usually refer to the deterministic requirements, i.e., those that are known before the online process, if at all.

Stochastic modeling approaches formally capture the stochastic nature of the problem, so that solutions are calculated in the light of a general stochastic context. Such holistic approaches usually require strong assumptions and efficient calculation of complex expected values. Sampling approaches attempt to capture stochastic knowledge through sampling, so that they tend to focus more on local stochastic decisions."}, {"heading": "4 The global Stochastic Assessment decision rule", "text": "The two-stage problem defined by eq.

(1) However, we have shown in Section 2 that we do not enforce these constraints in the calculation of optimal solutions for all the different scenarios, because the different deterministic VRPTW are solved independently of each other. (To enforce the non-anticipation constraints while activating these methods, we push these constraints into the calculation of optimal solutions: instead of calculating these different optimal solutions independently, we propose to calculate them all together so that we can ensure that two scenarios always share the same realizations."}, {"heading": "5 Solving the Dynamic and Stochastic VRPTW", "text": "GSA alone does not allow to solve a DS-VRPTW instance.

Due to its computational effort, the wait-first-wait strategy has also yielded poor results, even in relocation. Therefore, for reasons of conciseness, we do not report these strategies in the result plans. The three different versions of Algorithm 3 that we are looking at are the following: GSAdf, which stands for GSA with drive-first-waiting strategy, GSAdfr, which stands for GSA with drive-first and relocation strategies, and finally GSAro with means GSA with pure relocation strategy.

Existing related studies, such as MSA, simplify the problem as a two-step problem by using average sample approximation. In contrast, the theoretical singularity of our method is to approach a multi-step stochastic problem through Monte Carlo random samples, using a heuristic evaluation function that maintains the non-anticipatory limitations. By maintaining a unique predictive solution that is designed as flexibly as possible according to a number of scenarios, our method differs in practice from the MSA, which calculates as many solutions as scenarios, each specializing in its associated scenario. Experimental results show that GSA achieves competitive results in terms of the state of the art. This paper also proposes a new resettlement strategy that only aims at calculating the benefit and the wait-and-see strategy."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "Christine Solnon is supported by the LABEX IMU (ANR-10-LABX-0088) of the Universit\u00e9 de Lyon as part of the Investissements d'Avenir programme (ANR-11-IDEX-0007) of the French research agency ANR and is partially supported by the UCLouvain Action de Recherche Concert\u00e9e ICTM22C1."}, {"heading": "Appendix: Detailed experimental results", "text": "This appendix contains detailed experimental results for the different instance classes.

dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows and stochastic customers (DS-VRPTW), such that customers may request for services as vehicles have already started their tours. To solve this problem, the goal is to provide a decision rule for choosing, at each time step, the next action to perform in light of known requests and probabilistic knowledge on requests likelihood. We introduce a new decision rule, called Global Stochastic Assessment (GSA) rule for the DS-VRPTW, and we compare it with existing decision rules, such as MSA. In particular, we show that GSA fully integrates nonanticipativity constraints so that it leads to better decisions in our stochastic context. We describe a new heuristic approach for efficiently approximating our GSA rule. We introduce a new waiting strategy. Experiments on dynamic and stochastic benchmarks, which include instances of different degrees of dynamism, show that not only our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods, but also enables to compute meaningful offline solutions to fully dynamic problems where absolutely no a priori customer request is provided.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
