A first study showed that both killifish from a lake with predators and from a lake without predators explore a new environment to the same degree and plotting number of new spaces covered over time generates a hump-shaped curve. However, for the fish from the lake with predators the curve is shifted to the right; they take longer. This pattern was replicated by a computer model of exploratory behavior varying only one parameter, the fear parameter. A second study showed that stories inspired by threatening photographs were rated as more creative than stories inspired by non-threatening photographs.

I wrote a small computer program called \"Explorer,\" in which there were two competing desires: the desire to explore a new environment and the desire to avoid fear (Gabora & Colgan, 1990). Without the fear being at the highest level, the explorer always explored a new environment until it was completely covered. Exploration levels would first increase as it \"conquered\" its fear and then decreased as there was less new territory to cover."}, {"heading": "A STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF THREAT ON CREATIVE WRITING", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to survive on their own without there being a process in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process, in which there is a process. \""}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The author is grateful for funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada."}], "references": [{"title": "The dark side of creativity: Biological vulnerability and negative emotions lead to greater artistic creativity", "author": ["M.

We can instantly communicate with people of all cultures, and even see their homes and villages on Google maps. It\u2019s fascinating. But if you think back to when you knew so much less about the world it seemed so tantalizingly full of wonder and possibility. It seems there is a tradeoff between that sense of mystery and how much you know. This got me thinking: one good thing about fear, other than it stops you from doing stupid, dangerous stuff, is that can hold you back from learning the facts inside out, which may help keep that creatively inspiring sense of wonder alive. A STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF THREAT ON EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOR These ideas date back to a study I carried out as a graduate student with killifish from two lakes: one with killifish predators and one without killifish predators. The fish were caught and put into a relatively small section of a large tank until they had acclimatized. This small section was separated from the rest of the tank by a door that was initially shut. The larger section contained objects that were unfamiliar to them.", "creator": "Word"}}}
