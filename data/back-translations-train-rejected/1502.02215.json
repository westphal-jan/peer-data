However, due to the sheer data volume, variety, velocity and veracity of mobile subscriber datasets, sophisticated data analytics techniques and frameworks are necessary to derive actionable insights in a useable timeframe. In this paper, we describe our journey from a relational database management system (RDBMS) based campaign management solution which allowed data scientists and marketers to use hand-written rules for service personalization and targeted promotions to a distributed Big Data Analytics platform, capable of performing large scale machine learning and data mining to deliver real time service personalization, predictive modelling and product optimization. Our work involves a careful blend of technology, processes and best practices, which facilitate man-machine collaboration and continuous experimentation to derive measurable economic value from data.

Cumbersome data extraction processes, multiple handoffs between different stakeholders, long delivery times for execution, lack of response and campaign efficiency measurement all point to transformation, with implications for evolution. Our mobile marketing platform, with a variety of applications such as push marketing, interactive marketing and inventory management, focuses on enabling this transformation for a wide range of business units, including Usage and Revenue (U & R), Customer Acquisition, Customer Care and Retail. This has been achieved by implementing applications for seamless campaign execution, automation of underlying processes, upstream and downstream systems, and closing the loop by providing feedback on campaigns used in new campaigns."}, {"heading": "3 Analytics Platform Architecture", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "4 Machine Learning Applications at Scale", "text": "In this section, we present some interesting mobile marketing applications that utilize large-scale machine learning techniques that we have successfully produced."}, {"heading": "4.1 Constrained fair ad-allocation for Mobile Advertising", "text": "There are a number of advertisers with specific target criteria that are expressed in terms of subscribers KPIs.

We realized that there is not yet a single big data technology that can easily meet all CSP needs. In practice, a purpose-built hybrid architecture that enables the coexistence of multiple big data and conventional data management technologies is proving effective. The analysis platform should support multiple data organization strategies to facilitate the necessary data access patterns. Providing pluggable support for multiple distributed and non-distributed execution modalities such as mapreduce and in-memory processing gives the analysis process flexibility in selecting the appropriate execution framework depending on data volume and type of calculation. A meaningful logging strategy coupled with a centralized system that derives operational insights is more important."}, {"heading": "6 References", "text": "[1] Portio Research Ltd.
