The notion that medical literature could be degraded according to new knowledge is usually attributed to Schwanson [15]. Most approaches adopted the use of terminology frequencies and co-occurrences through dictionaries such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)."}, {"heading": "3 Proposed framework", "text": "We begin this section with a review of the relevant theory underlying the HDP blending modeling that plays a central role in the proposed framework, then turn our attention to the most important technical contribution of our work and explain how the HDP is used to discover the current content of a literature corpus and trace its structural changes over time."}, {"heading": "3.1 Hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture models", "text": "The Dirichlet process is a useful approach to blending modeling, which allows a collection of documents to accommodate a potentially infinite number of topics (1). It is the building block of Bayesia's non-parametric methods. A Dirichlet process [22] DP (\u03b3, H) is defined as the distribution of a random probability variable G across a measuring space, so that for each finite measurable partition (A1, A2,.., Ar) of the random vector (G (A1),., G (Ar))) is a Dirichlet distribution with parameters (\u03b3H (A1). An alternative view of DP results from the so-called stick-breaking process, which adopts a constructive approach using a sequence of discrete drawings [23]. Specifically, if G (GP) DP (DP), then G (GP) DP (DP)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Modelling topic evolution over time", "text": "In this section, we will show how the described HDP-based model can be applied to the analysis of temporal subject changes in a longitudinal data corpus. We begin by dividing the literature corpus by time into several epochs. Each epoch is then modelled separately using an HDP. Models of different epochs are derived from the same initial corpus basic measure and hyperparameter. Thus, if n is the number of epochs, we obtain n subject complexes \u03b8 = {\u03b8t1,..., \u03b8tn}, where \u03b8t = {\u03b81, t,..., \u03b8Kt, t} are the subject complexes describing the epoch t and Kt its number (which is automatically derived as described above). This is illustrated in Figure 1b. In the next section, we will describe how a cross-thematic similarity measures the development of various topics across epochs."}, {"heading": "3.3 Measuring topic similarity", "text": "The simplest changes in interest involve the emergence of new topics and the disappearance of others. More subtly, we are also interested in how a particular topic changes - how it develops over time in terms of the contributions of different words it includes, as well as how it splits into new topics or merges with existing ones. Obviously, this information can provide valuable insights into the refinement of ideas and results in the scientific community that come about through new research and the accumulation of evidence. The key idea behind our approach stems from the observation that topics can change significantly over time, since the change between successive epochs is limited. Therefore, we conclude the continuity of a topic in an epoch by referring it to all topics in the immediate following epoch that are similar to it by some measure of similarity."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental evaluation", "text": "After presenting the most important technical contribution of our work, we now illustrate its usefulness using the example of ASD literature analysis and describe additional contributions in the form of two free online tools that we have developed to help ASD researchers."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data collection", "text": "To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available corporations of ASDrelated medical literature. Therefore, we have compiled a comprehensive data set ourselves, which will be published upon adoption of this work. We describe our collection methodology and the pre-processing of data that we have performed to extract standard features used for text analysis. Raw Data Collection We have used the PubMed search engine, which allows users to access the US National Library of Medicine for abstracts and references from life sciences and biomedical scientific articles. We assumed that an essay is related to ASS when the term \"autism\" is present in its title or abstract, and collected only papers that are written in English. The earliest publication that meets our criteria is that of Kanner [24], and we collected all pertinent publications that will be reviewed by PubMed on July 24, 2014, resulting in a corpus of 20,138 publications."}, {"heading": "4.2 Proposed method implementation", "text": "We divided the 42-year time span of our data corpus into overlapping 5-year epochs, with a two-year lag between successive epochs, giving a total of 18 epochs, and then extracted the topics of each epoch as described in Section 3.2 and derived their dynamics as described in Section 3.3. The number of latent topics of different epochs is illustrated in Figure 2b. Note the exponential increase in the number of topics, which reflects the exponential increase in the number of publications over time in our data set. This increasing interest in ASD can be illustrated by observing that there are five times as many publications in 2013 as in 2000. For our cross-topic similarity described in Section 3.3, we used the well-known Jaccard similarity measurement; this similarity was used to obtain all the results reported in this section."}, {"heading": "4.3 Case study 1: ASD and genetics", "text": "While the exact etiology of ASD is still poorly understood, the existence of a significant genetic component is undoubtedly an important topic of research and as such a good case study to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method. We started by identifying the topic of interest as the one with the highest probability of the terms \"gene\" or \"genetic\" being associated with the topic, and tracing it back in time to the era in which it arose, leading to the discovery of the relevant topic in the epoch spanning the period from 1986 to 1991. Figure 4 shows the evolution of this topic from 1992, which was uncovered by our method (due to space constraints, only the most significant parts of the similarity curve are shown; minor changes to the topic before 1992 are also omitted for reasons of clarity, as indicated by the dashed line in the figure)."}, {"heading": "4.4 Case study 2: ASD and vaccination", "text": "The controversy arose with the publication of the work of Wakefield [27], which reported epidemiological findings linking MMR vaccination to the development of autism and colitis. Despite the complete withdrawal of the article following the discovery that it was fraudulent, and numerous subsequent studies that failed to establish the alleged link, a significant portion of the public remains engaged with the issue. As in the previous example, we began to identify the issue with the highest probability of the terms \"vaccine\" and \"vaccination\" being linked to the issue and trace it back to the era when it first appeared. Again, a single issue was readily identified, in the era that spanned the period from 1996 to 2001. Note that this is consistent with the date of the first relevant publication by Wakefield [27]."}, {"heading": "4.5 Topic browser", "text": "A thematic model can be seen as a framework for reducing dimensionality that reduces documents into a thematic space. This transformation of data can provide powerful insights and enable the search of documents in a more specialized, semantic way. By describing documents in the thematic space, documents that relate most to a particular topic of interest can be easily identified and retrieved. To make this functionality available to the research community interested in ASS, we used the framework described in this paper to model the entire corpus of literature we have collected and set up a website to facilitate the free and ready use of our model and our data. Researchers can use our online tool to search, comment on and navigate through publications by topics. The website is available at http: / / www.understandautism.tk."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "Our approach consists in discretizing time into overlapping epochs, modelling the static theme structure within each epoch using an HDP, and tracking theme evolution over time using an interdisciplinary similarity measure. The resulting similarity diagram captures connections between themes of different epochs and allows automatic inferences on the timing of the emergence and disappearance of themes, their evolution over time, merging and splitting. The power of the proposed general framework was demonstrated using the example of ASD-related medical literature. On two case studies covering two important research issues in the ASD literature, we showed that our method extracts significant themes and their temporal changes. A novel data corpus and free online tools are freely available to researchers."}], "references": [{"title": "Datamining Twitter and the autism spectrum disorder: a pilot study", "author": ["A.
