Moreover, we study how to define revision, satisfying the AGM postulates, from relaxation notions that have been first introduced in description logics to define dissimilarity measures between concepts, and the consequence of which is to relax the set of models of the old belief until it becomes consistent with the new pieces of knowledge.

The proposed generalizations also give an idea of a large family of logic that does not contain classical logic, such as DL and HCL and AGM postulates for revision with such minimality criteria. The proposed generalizations also give a similar idea of the authors \"ideas (cf. Theorem 1), but for a different minimum logic. Indeed, in Section 3.2 we showed that revisions are satisfactory to operators (G1) - (G6) are precisely the proposed generalizations that achieve an update with minimal changes in the models of the knowledge base by developing each institution the approach developed in the logic PL and [29] for the revision operators."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "The contribution of this paper is threefold: first, we provided a generalization of the AGM postulates from a model-theoretical point of view by defining this operator in an abstract model theory known as satisfaction systems, so that they become applicable to a broad class of non-classical logics. In this framework, we then generalized to all satisfaction systems the characterization of the AGM postulates given by Katsuno and Mendelzon for propositional logic with respect to minimal changes in an order between interpretations. This work generalizes the previous ones in this area. It also suggests that the theory behind satisfaction systems is a principle-driven framework for dealing with knowledge dynamics, with the growing interest in non-classical logic such as DL. We hope that bridges can be built in this way by working on the transverse of different areas of theoretical computer science in which logic is redefined. Second, we proposed a general framework for the revision of the relativization of the definition of the framework."}], "references": [{"title": "On the logic of theory change", "author": ["C.

In this framework, we generalize to any satisfaction systems the characterization of the well known AGM postulates given by Katsuno and Mendelzon for propositional logic in terms of minimal change among interpretations. Moreover, we study how to define revision, satisfying the AGM postulates, from relaxation notions that have been first introduced in description logics to define dissimilarity measures between concepts, and the consequence of which is to relax the set of models of the old belief until it becomes consistent with the new pieces of knowledge. We show how the proposed general framework can be instantiated in different logics such as propositional, first-order, description and Horn logics. In particular for description logics, we introduce several concrete relaxation operators tailored for the description logic ALC and its fragments EL and ELU , discuss their properties and provide some illustrative examples.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
