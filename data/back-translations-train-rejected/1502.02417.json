The EREON-based Semantic Services (ESS) Framework", "text": "The main purpose of EREON-based semantic services is to manage knowledge about ETS and provide automatic support for ETS analysis, regardless of the implementation of the data structures and the data management technology used for this purpose. Essentially, the ESS framework concerns ICT systems that policy makers need to use to generate long-term analysis reports: policy makers who need automatic support for policy impact analysis and decision-making; ETS experts who need to calibrate their energy and environmental scenario-based models with ETS context data in order to produce long-term analysis reports; industrial actors who have expanded their information systems with environmental data and the data required by the EU ETS (e.g. the NIMs) to quantify the impact of ETS regulations and policies on their business and consider emissions trading as a business opportunity [PriceWaterCouseEL 2006, published regularly by energy companies such as the Italian ENERGY Energy Consumption Report]."}, {"heading": "4.1 The ETS Knowledge Base", "text": "The core of our proposal for ETS is the ETS knowledge base, consisting of EREON, an ontology conceptualizing ETS-related areas, and a set of rules (i.e. ESS rules). We chose an ontology because it avoids ambiguity problems, and because ontologies are attractive because of the emerging field of cognitive computing, where they allow complex decision-making from a vast amount of information and knowledge [Magazine, A. I. (2010)]. In addition, a knowledge base consisting of ontology and rules enables logic-based services, and there are several argumentators, such as RacerPro [WR6], Pellet [WR7] and FaCT + [Tsarkov, Horrocks, 2006] [WR8], to verify the consistency of knowledge."}, {"heading": "4.2 ETS Knowledge Base Engineering", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it will be able to put itself at the top, \"he said in an interview with the\" Welt am Sonntag. \""}, {"heading": "4.3 The Service-based Architecture for ETS Data Management", "text": "We propose a reference architecture for ETS data management (Fig. 2) that includes EREON, the ESS rules and two semantic services to be used in two different phases: ETS data collection and ETS data analysis. This architecture was defined on the basis of the idea that semantic services should not replace existing systems for managing ETS data (which in Fig. 2 are represented by a state information system), but should be operated via these systems in order to provide new and more advanced functionality. Therefore, the effort required for data replication, for example, from a relational DB to an RDF triple storage, is avoided. Furthermore, this solution allows us to deploy new emerging technologies such as D2RQ [WR17], Ontop [WR18] or Virtuoso [WR19] to transform semantic queries in SQL and thus performance problems into the much more consolidated technology of the database services we have collected for both of our requirements."}, {"heading": "Data acquisition phase", "text": "EU governments currently collect information on the emissions, energy and power consumption of small-scale installations using data templates common to all EU countries, such as NIMs (i.e. NIMs _ baseline _ data.xls) [WR3]. Although each installation should provide validated documentation signed by a certified authority, such templates are filled in manually, which is an error-prone process. Once the data is collected from the installations, it is imported into a government information system to be processed. The task of data import is also vulnerable to error. The aim of the data collection phase is to detect rule violations (such as potential errors and unwanted data) for the purpose of data analysis. In fact, the rules to be applied at this stage also include user / application-dependent rules (e.g. restrictions derived from laws) and their violation may be relevant or not in accordance with the analysis that is being carried out (e.g. missing values of less than 5% of the size of installations can be considered as infringements)."}, {"heading": "Data analysis phase", "text": "Whenever a policy maker defines a new policy to improve the management of the ETS, measures to comply with this policy (e.g. raising the price of carbon) could have an impact on existing plants that cause economic losses and social consequences (e.g. rising unemployment), by identifying and quantifying the companies affected by these policies, and hence the companies that are indirectly interested in the new policy. ETS contextual data from plants is validated by the ETS data collection service, verifying the accuracy of the information by reviewing a set of semantic rules related to EREON ontology. Once imported into the ETS database, the policy maker analyses this data, supported by a set of predefined rules implemented by the ETS data analysis service. For details on EREON and in particular on the rules we implement, see sections 5 and 6."}, {"heading": "4.4 ESS adoption", "text": "The activities of potential ESS users described at the beginning of Section 4 require the management of large data sets, which are usually already stored in a specific database and / or distributed in various proprietary analysis tools. Thus, the problem of ESS adoption needs to be addressed in broader and existing ICT systems. In this case, assuming a DBMS with data to be analyzed, two types of ESS adoption can be considered: 1. ESS specification adoption: the ESS rules are adapted to the existing data structures, implemented in the query language of the DBMS and executed by the custom application; 2. ESS implementation adoption: an ad hoc mapping between the given database implementation and EREON is provided so that ESS rules can be triggered by an OWL (or RDF) -based control engine that directly accesses the data stored in the database.

In the field of energy / environmental market analysis, an ETS scenario represents a future projection of ETS achieved by means of a calculation model. For example, the concept Business As Usual (BAU) represents the analytical technique based on the assumption that current trends in the status of ETS-related entities are maintained without additional limitations. These projections allow the assessment of the impact of some policies on ETS. The scenario represents the scope of studies on impact analysis of policies in the fields of energy, environment and towards sustainable economic development. For example, these studies are regularly carried out by ENEA on behalf of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development and consist of quantitative assessments of policies through mathematical models and techniques for generating scenarios."}, {"heading": "5.1.3 Policy Making View", "text": "This category (Table 4 of Annex A) comprises five main concepts that relate to the social planning aspect of the ETS-related area of interest. Specifically, an ETS policy is a state regulation that aims to achieve one or more desired objectives in relation to the reduction of CO2 emissions through a series of measures and by taking into account a number of (national and international) restrictions. The purpose of this perspective is to present the various policies related to ETS, for example, through the following indicators: social (e.g. demographic, infrastructural, private), economic (e.g. import-export, cost of technologies, government costs) and environmental (e.g. impact on climate, energy consumption, emission coefficients) indicators. These indicators are linked to the energy, environmental and economic models used to evaluate them and belong to the scenarios."}, {"heading": "5.2 EREON Evaluation", "text": "According to [Burton-Jones et al., 2005], an ontology must be evaluated against four characteristics: syntactic quality, semantic quality, pragmatic quality and social quality. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the ontology management system, enables EREON ontology to be encoded in the correct OWL language [WR21], thus ensuring syntactic quality. EREON's semantic quality is derived from the use of the FaCT + + argument [WR8] [Tsarkov, Horrocks, 2006] to verify the absence of conflicting concepts. This tool is available with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The pragmatic quality of an ontology concerns fidelity, relevance and completeness. In EREON, fidelity is guaranteed by the domain experts who have contributed to the ontology definition, and by the fact that the majority of ontology is based on NIMs [WR3] and other references based on the ETS essentials."}, {"heading": "6.

In the ETS context, we have identified the following two different types of rules that belong to this category. ETS data mapping from different classification systems. Different classification systems exist, for example, for activities and products of plants. The EU ETS Regulation stipulates that activities must be classified by the NACE Code. However, benchmark values (in terms of CO2 allowances) per product of these activities have been defined [WR23] to ensure that the free allocation of emission allowances takes place in a way that provides incentives for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and energy-efficient techniques. Therefore, means are necessary to correlate industrial product data with activity data. One option is the use of the PRODCOM classification, which is to be defined by a list of individual CEE member states (although this list is an Industry Regulation No. 39 / 24)."}, {"heading": "NACE code.", "text": "This year, it is so far that it is only a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "6.2 Data Analysis Service", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "ETS data categorization rules", "text": "The rules belonging to this category are aimed at aggregating and classifying raw data. The categorisation of industrial electricity and / or gas consumers. These types of queries help identify the industrial sector or consumers who may be affected by a change in the direction of variable prices such as electricity / gas. Frequently, the final electricity price includes additional costs that benefit various public objectives, such as administrative costs relating to TSO (Transmission System Operator) and regulatory authority, the financial green certificates or renewable energy subsidies, energy efficiency. However, these additional costs are not the same for all consumers. The Italian Electricity and Gas Regulator (AEEG) identifies four non-household consumer groups based on consumption thresholds, and these groups pursue different charging policies. These are: consumers with monthly consumption within 4 GWh; consumers with monthly consumption from 4 GWh to 8 GWh; consumers with a monthly consumption from 1 GWh to 2 GWh; consumers with a monthly consumption from 1 GWh to 1 GWh; and consumers with a monthly consumption from 1 GWh to 1 GWh."}, {"heading": "ETS impact analysis", "text": "These types of questions relate to changes in gas / electricity prices (or other fuel prices) or a carbon tax and its impact on the ETS industrial sectors. This usually requires answering questions at a lower level. Queries based on the NIMs can include: quantifying the number of companies with emissions up to a certain threshold; identifying the industrial sectors with CO2 emissions up to a certain threshold; identifying the industrial sector with energy consumption up to a certain threshold (in which case it will be possible to study the impact of the price component of electricity or gas). Here, we offer to formalize the rule in terms of emissions from a particular industrial sector. Each industrial sector has total CO2 emissions that are smaller or equal to X. Analyses of scenarios that involve the long-term evaluation of strategies for implementing scenarios that describe hypothetical processes or sequences of events that may develop over a period of time."}, {"heading": "7. Rules Evaluation", "text": "The EREON ontology and the semantic rules library are the specification for the one in Section 6. A technical prerequisite for adopting such a specification is the accuracy of the rules and the feasibility assessment of semantic technologies in the ETS area. To this end, in this section we present the software environment we have used to evaluate rules and discuss some of the results we have achieved in this regard."}, {"heading": "7.1 Tools Support", "text": "For the purpose of this experiment, we codified the rules in SPARQL [WR13]. In general, we propose to keep the codified rules separate from the ontology in order to offer more flexibility to different users in selecting the specific set of rules that they might be interested in (in principle, not all users share the same set of rules).We developed a Java-based software environment that integrates ESS with a relational database that mirrors the ESS schema specified in SPARQL [WR3].The software was built according to the architecture described in Fig. 4. Specifically, the components of the architecture were developed as follows: Custom Application: Java component that is responsible for generating the NIMs data and executing the ESS rules according to SPARQL [WR13].To protect privacy, we decided for the purpose of this experiment to use simulated NIMs data and not the real ones in order to implement a data generator more automatically."}, {"heading": "7.2 Empirical Study", "text": "This empirical study examines the proposed ESS rules for evaluating their effectiveness and implementation. The study has two perspectives: (i) the researcher who wants to demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of semantic tools in this new field of application, and (ii) the ETS analyst who wants to evaluate the support these tools provide in their activities. In this section, the results of such an empirical study are summarized. Data on the empirical study can be downloaded at [WR26]."}, {"heading": "Context description", "text": "The selection of the rules was made taking into account the two main types of our rule classification (i.e. ETS data collection and ETS data analysis) and their applicability to NIMs data. The data sets through which the queries are conducted were generated according to two dimensions: the number of plants used to simulate the evolution / update of ETS data over time, and the number of rule violations used to obtain different outcomes. Data samples generated are among the database tables influenced by the four selected rules. Domain experts specified the ranges of these values according to the following criteria: Even if they are simulated by random poisonous and gausian distribution, data samples should be probable in real scenarios; the number of rule violations should be consistent with the specific empirical test."}, {"heading": "Objectives", "text": "The study aims to provide answers to the following research questions: RQ1. How do semantic queries work versus ETS data? RQ2. How does their performance scale after time updates of ETS data? RQ3. Is the performance of semantic queries related to their outcome (success or injury)?"}, {"heading": "Study settings", "text": "Both the software application and the database were installed on an Intel Core i7 2.8 GHz computer with 6 GB of RAM and Window 7 operating system, JDK 1.7, D2RQ 0.8.1 [WR17] and PostgreSQL 9.1 [WR25]. Response times for each rule execution were measured with the system time program, i.e. the CPU time of the user was determined. To avoid distortions caused by the randomness of the simulated NIMs data, we replicated the generation of the data sets ten times."}, {"heading": "Study results", "text": "In this subsection, we present the results of the empirical study aimed at answering the research questions previously given. To answer RQ1, we have generated 10 sets of data from 3000 plants, as this is currently the average number of Italian companies subject to the ETS regulations. Figure 10 shows box plots that synthesize the performance of the four selected queries on the given data sets. No significant differences in results were observed for the different data sets and in all cases the resulting performance is acceptable (the maximum time for an answer is about 6 minutes). To respond to RQ2, we have generated 10 sets of data for each of the following sizes: 10, 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 and 20000 plants. This choice is motivated by the fact that the number of plants is the most sensitive variable for variations over time. Figure 11 shows the performance achieved for each rule and each size, taking into account the mean values for this size."}, {"heading": "Threats to validity", "text": "In our case, we are dealing with a subset of EREON concepts and the rules to process their instances. In fact, we focused on around 8 units of EREON and their characteristics, such as: plant, industrial sector, CO2 emissions, ETS scenario, CO2 price, employment, natural gas and energy prices. However, it should be noted that in this subset we included the most common units in the rules presented in Section 6, and which have one of the most sensitive to evolution and updating processes (the plant), enough to address the objectives of our experimental analysis. To construct further threats to validity refer to the number of plants we have considered that have an impact on performance outcomes at the time, but also on the hard disk size. As our case study threats relate to the Italian ETS, which collects NIMs data from about 3000 plants and currently includes the EU ETS [Stephan et al, 2014], \"we only consider the number of 20,000 installations, which we actually refer to as our database."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions", "text": "This is due to the multidisciplinary nature of this evolving domain, which includes technological specifications and the real applicability of semantic technologies due to scaling issues. Here, we face such challenges by providing a knowledge base for the ETS domain, which consists of EREON ontology and ESS rules.
