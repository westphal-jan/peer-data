PC algorithm is the state-of-the-art method in the constraint based approach. However, the PC algorithm is worst-case exponential to the number of nodes (variables), and thus it is inefficient when applying to high dimensional data, e.g. gene expression datasets where the causal relationships between thousands of nodes (genes) are explored. In this paper, we propose a fast and memory efficient PC algorithm using the parallel computing technique. We apply our method on a range of synthetic and real-world high dimensional datasets. Experimental results on a dataset from DREAM 5 challenge show that the PC algorithm could not produce any results after running more than 24 hours; meanwhile, our parallel-PC algorithm with a 4-core CPU computer managed to finish within around 12.5 hours, and less than 6 hours with a 8-core CPU computer.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 12:15:21 GMT  (293kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02454v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 11 Jul 2015 03:03:16 GMT  (724kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02454v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 10 Nov 2016 12:23:48 GMT  (1210kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02454v3", "Thuc Le, Tao Hoang, Jiuyong Li, Lin Liu, Huawen Liu, Shu Hu, \"A fast PC algorithm for high dimensional causal discovery with multi-core PCs\", IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, doi:10.1109/TCBB.2016.2591526"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["thuc duy le", "tao hoang", "jiuyong li", "lin liu", "huawen liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.02454"}, "pdf": {"name": "1502.02454.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A fast PC algorithm for high dimensional causal discovery with multi-core PCs", "authors": ["Thuc Duy Le", "Tao Hoang", "Jiuyong Li", "Lin Liu", "Huawen Liu", "Shu Hu"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Index Terms - Causal Discovery, PC Algorithm, Parallel Computing, High-Dimensional Data, Gene Expression Data, miRNA Targets.F"}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "An example of this is the fact that one gene is not a gene, but a gene that has the goal of finding a gene that pursues the goal, or the likelihood of a third gene that regulates the two genes. Therefore, it is possible that associations between genes are not the cause of the cause. However, there has been a long controversy about whether the causality of observational data can be discovered. Many scientists have tried to design algorithms of causality of observational data in recent decades. [1], [2], [4] as a result, there is increasing evidence pointing to the possibility of discovering causal relationships of non-experimental data in different areas of research."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "The well-recognized methods of causality detection are based on probabilistic graphical modeling [1], [24]. The structure of these graphical models is a DAG (directed acyclic graph), with its nodes representing random variables and edges that represent dependencies between variables [25]. However, there are two main approaches to learning the causal structure from the data: 1) search and score and 2) constraints that are based on methods. \"The search and score methods are an NPhard problem [24], [27] search for any possible DAGs, while using a scoring function to measure the fit accuracy of each DAG to the data being exploited.\" The DAG that fits best to the data will be selected. However, learning Bayesian networks using this approach is an NPhard problem, and the proposed methods used under this approach were only able to measure datasets with a limited number of variable relationships to be exploited are the passive functions to be exploited are the passive ones."}, {"heading": "3 THE ORIGINAL-PC AND STABLE-PC ALGORITHMS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Notation, definitions, and assumptions", "text": "Let G = (V, E) be a diagram consisting of a series of nodes V and a series of edges E V \u00b7 V.

In the first step, it learns from the data of a skeleton graph that contains only undirected edges. In the second step, it orients the undirected edges to form an equivalence class of Y. As the first step of the PC algorithm, it contributes to most of the calculation costs if we focus only on modifying this skeleton learning step in this paper, and information about the edge orientation can be found in [2]. The theoretical basis of the original PC algorithm [2] is that if there is no connection (edge) between the nodes X and Y, then there are a series of depressions Z that are either neighbors of X or Y, so that X and Y are independent conditioning on Z. In other words, Z separates from Y. This basis is presented as Theorem 1.

Nowadays, it is common to have personal desktop computers and even laptops have 4 cores in their CPUs. Likewise, the number of cores in today's servers has increased to 8, 16, 32 or more. These resources offer great potential for the use of parallel computers for important algorithms, including the PC algorithm, for personal computers. Indeed, the majority of end users use their personal computers for research. Therefore, parallel algorithms would have significant implications if they work well for personal computers and do not require users \"technical knowledge of parallelism and high-performance clusters. The idea of parallelism is that we divide a large task into several different smaller subtasks and distribute them to different cores of the computer CPU in order to run in parallel. The results from all subtasks are then integrated to form the result of the original task. Theoretically, this shared and conquered approach has an algorithm to accelerate the maximum number of core tasks."}, {"heading": "4.2 The parallel-PC Algorithm", "text": "Our proposed strategy is the parallelization of the CI tests, not across different levels, but within each level of the stable PC algorithm. This approach is feasible because the CI tests at a certain level are independent of each other. However, since the graph is updated only at the end of each level, the result of one CI test does not affect the others. Therefore, the CI tests at one level can be run in parallel without changing the final result. Furthermore, this approach also has the advantage of knowing in advance the number of CI tests at each level. This allows the CI tests to be evenly distributed across different cores so that the parallelized algorithms can reach the maximum possible speeds. Within one level (depth) of Algorithm 2, we employ the parallel computing paradigm for parallelizing their execution (the parallelization of execution). At each level with the size d conditioning laws, the sequential process is replaced by a three-step process:"}, {"heading": "4.3 Implementation", "text": "We implement our ParallelPC algorithm using R [44].

Figure 4 (above) shows that the runtime of the Stable PC algorithm increases significantly when the number of variables in a dataset is increased, because the number of CI tests increases when the number of variables is increased. The Parallel PC algorithm suffers from the same problem, but the increasing trend of runtime is less significant compared to that of the Stable PC algorithm. Likewise, the runtime of both the PC and the Parallel PC increases when we increase the number of samples in the dataset, as shown in Figure 4 (below)."}, {"heading": "5.4 Impact of the memory-efficient option", "text": "As mentioned in Section 4, the memory-efficient version of the algorithm consumes less space at any point during the execution of the algorithm. We observed that the maximum memory usage in the memory-efficient options algorithm (s = TRUE) is about half that of the algorithm without using the option of the six records in Table 1. However, there is a trade-off between memory efficiency and time efficiency, as shown in Table 2. The experiments were conducted on a MacBook Pro with 8GB RAM, 2.6GHz."}, {"heading": "6 APPLICATION IN INFERRING MIRNA-MRNA REGULATORY RELATIONSHIPS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Computational methods for identifying miRNA targets", "text": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are important gene regulators at the post-transcriptional level. They regulate gene expression by promoting the degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and suppressing translation. miRNAs control a wide range of biological processes and are involved in various cancers [47], [48]. Over the last decade, increasingly promising results have been achieved in the prediction of miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships by computer-aided methods. miRNA-mRNA interactions have been identified in the first stream using sequence data [49], [50], [51], [51]. Although these methods have been proposed to identify miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships, researchers have identified miRNA-mRNA interactions using sequence data [49], [51], [51] [51] and [52]. Although these methods may contain potential RNA targets that can predict positive RNA outcomes, they can include high RNA-negative RNA outcomes."}, {"heading": "6.2 Inferring miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships with efficient-IDA", "text": "In this section, we propose to use parallel PC to modify the causal inference method [13] in order to derive miRNAmRNA regulatory relationships, based on a causal inference approach called IDA (intervention effect when the DAG is absent) [63]. IDA first learns the causal structure from data using the PC algorithm and then uses docalculations to estimate the causal effect that one variable has on the other. The estimated causal effects simulate the effects of randomized controlled experiments. Although the method proves to be effective in detecting miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships, it has a high computational complexity and suffers from the job-dependent problem. In this section, we propose to address these problems by modifying the IDA-based method by using parallel PC and not PC as the first step of the IDA algorithm."}, {"heading": "6.3 efficient-IDA discovers more experimentally miRNA targets than IDA", "text": "We applied efficient IDA and IDA to NCI-60, MCC and BR51 and compared their performance in discovering the experimentally confirmed miRNA targets. To validate the target predictions from the two methods, we used the combination of four different experimentally confirmed miRNA target databases as the basic truth: Tarbase v6.0 [64], miRecords v2013 [65], miRWalk v2.0 [66] and miRTarBase v4.5 [67]. Tarbase, miRecords and miRTarBase contain verified interactions curated manually from the literature, and miRWalk contains both the predicted and experimentally validated interactions.Respectively for Tarbase, miRWalk and miRTarBase, we used 20095 interactions with 228 miRNAs, 21590 interactions with 195 miRNAs, 1710 interactions with 226 miNAs, and a total of 3772 interactions with 28576 interactions to determine the results."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "It is very important to investigate causal relationships in high-dimensional real-world datasets. For example, the discovered causal relationships can help to clarify the causes of fatal diseases based on gene expression data. However, existing causal discovery methods do not offer practical solutions to the problem. In this paper, we have developed an efficient algorithm for investigating causal relationships in high-dimensional datasets based on the Stable-PC algorithm and the parallel computational framework. We modify the Stable-PC algorithm and group the CI tests within the algorithm so that the tests can be performed in parallel. Our method produces causal relationships that are consistent with the Stable-PC algorithm but much more efficient in terms of runtime. The experiments result from a wide range of frequently used real datasets and suggest the efficiency of the proposed method."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work was supported by the Australian Research Council Discovery Project DP140103617."}], "references": [{"title": "Causality: models, reasoning, and inference", "author": ["J.

"abstractText": "Discovering causal relationships from observational data is a crucial problem and it has applications in many research areas. The PC algorithm is the state-of-the-art constraint based method for causal discovery. However, runtime of the PC algorithm, in the worst-case, is exponential to the number of nodes (variables), and thus it is inefficient when being applied to high dimensional data, e.g. gene expression datasets. On another note, the advancement of computer hardware in the last decade has resulted in the widespread availability of multi-core personal computers. There is a significant motivation for designing a parallelised PC algorithm that is suitable for personal computers and does not require end users\u2019 parallel computing knowledge beyond their competency in using the PC algorithm. In this paper, we develop parallel-PC, a fast and memory efficient PC algorithm using the parallel computing technique. We apply our method to a range of synthetic and real-world high dimensional datasets. Experimental results on a dataset from the DREAM 5 challenge show that the original PC algorithm could not produce any results after running more than 24 hours; meanwhile, our parallel-PC algorithm managed to finish within around 12 hours with a 4-core CPU computer, and less than 6 hours with a 8-core CPU computer. Furthermore, we integrate parallel-PC into a causal inference method for inferring miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships. The experimental results show that parallel-PC helps improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the causal inference algorithm.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
