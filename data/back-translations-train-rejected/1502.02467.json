In recent years, it has been shown that a variety of constraints on the structure of CSP instances result in tractable classes of CSPs. However, most of these constraints do not guarantee traceability for CSPs with global constraints. We therefore examine the applicability of structural constraints to instances with such constraints. We show that when the number of solutions for a CSP instance is limited in key areas of the problem, structural constraints can be used to derive new tractable classes. Furthermore, we show that this result extends to combinations of instances originating from known tractable classes, as well as to CSP instances where constraints assign cost satisfactory assignments."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we define the basic concepts that we use throughout the work.

By exploiting the number of solutions for CSP instances at key points, we have identified new traceable classes of such problems, both in the ordinary and in the weighted case. In addition, we have shown how this technique can be used to combine CSP instances from known traceable classes, thereby extending an earlier result of Cohen and Green. [10] We have also shown how the existence of back doors in CSP instances can be used to extend our results. More needs to be done on this subject. In particular, we will investigate whether a refinement of the conditions we have identified can be used to show dichotomy theorems similar to those known for certain types of constraints and structural constraints [9,26,32]. Also of interest is the complexity of checking whether the search for a few instances is associated with CSP's solutions [9,26,32]."}], "references": [{"title": "Width functions for hypertree decompositions", "author": ["I.

problems can be modelled as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), that is, a set of constraints that must be satisfied simultaneously. Constraints can either be represented extensionally, by explicitly listing allowed combinations of values, or implicitly, by special-purpose algorithms provided by a solver. Such implicitly represented constraints, known as global constraints, are widely used; indeed, they are one of the key reasons for the success of constraint programming in solving real-world problems. In recent years, a variety of restrictions on the structure of CSP instances have been shown to yield tractable classes of CSPs. However, most such restrictions fail to guarantee tractability for CSPs with global constraints. We therefore study the applicability of structural restrictions to instances with such constraints. We show that when the number of solutions to a CSP instance is bounded in key parts of the problem, structural restrictions can be used to derive new tractable classes. Furthermore, we show that this result extends to combinations of instances drawn from known tractable classes, as well as to CSP instances where constraints assign costs to satisfying assignments.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
