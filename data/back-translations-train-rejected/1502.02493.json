Inappropriate Information Exchanges", "text": "Each context has its own adequacy norms that determine what information can be mentioned within each context. For example, one may not mention their political views in a work context, but it can do so in a family context. IAAs use the information that their users share with other users in a context to derive from that the adequacy norms of that context. In particular, the information that is often mentioned by members of a work context is considered appropriate, while information that is never or rarely mentioned is considered inappropriate. For example, if most people do not mention their political views at work, it might be concluded that this is not a suitable topic for sharing in a work context. In addition to the adequacy norms of each context, there are situations where people decide to exchange information that may be considered inappropriate. One of the main reasons for this is the creation and reciprocity of close relationships [34]. In fact, there are empirical studies that show that mutual communication is the dominant form of interaction in SNs."}, {"heading": "2.2. Undesired Information Disseminations", "text": "Disseminations occur when information disclosed in one context is placed in a different context; that is, disseminations are context-based disclosures, while exchanges (as mentioned above) are context-based disclosures. Obviously, disclosure of this information in these contexts cannot entail a new privacy risk if the information to be disclosed is already known in the context in which it could be disclosed. [68] Indeed, studies of remorse related to users \"posts on OSN underscore the fact that disclosure of others\" secrets is one of the main sources of regret [79]. Thus, there has recently been a case in which a person's sexuality leaked from their context with friends in their family context, where their sexuality was previously unknown, leading to them being outed and faced with threats to separate family relationships. [30] A primary defense against unwanted disseminations may consist of avoiding sensitive information in contexts in which people may live with their sexuality previously unknown to them."}, {"heading": "3.

Information exchanged between users is formalized as messages designated by tuples < g, R, T, S >; where g-U is the sender, R-U is the group formed by the recipient users, and T and S represent the information sent. Generally, messages represent any information exchange in an OSN that may be photos, comments, private messages, etc. Let's let T = {t1,..., tm} be a group of key topics or categories that can be discussed in messages."}, {"heading": "3.1.

Then, we define the appropriateness of message. Definition 1 (Individual appropriateness).

Thus, an IAA is responsible for managing the interactions (i.e. messages sent and received) of an individual user in an OSN. An IAA could be implemented on an OSN infrastructure (or a social networking service) as a social networking app running on a trusted server, or it could be implemented as a local social app that acts as a proxy for accessing the OSN (i.e. a mobile social app). Also, note that an IAA does not store messages sent / received by its users, which helps to minimize the storage space for the information model, which may be important to implement an IAA as a local app for resource-limited devices such as smartphones.

Many OSNs support a particular notion of community by allowing user groups (e.g. Facebook groups or Google + circles). There are even methods and ready-to-use tools that automatically obtain them through unattended machine learning algorithms [62]. For example, IAAs could use existing community-finding algorithms to extract the different communities, such as Infomap [62], which is known to work accurately in OSNs like Facebook [26] and is the algorithm that IAAs use for the examples and evaluations we perform, as described later in the paper.

Initially, no message was exchanged between them. Consequently, all individual adequacy values are set to 0.5 (i.e. messages about tasks, meetings, etc.) Similarly, the adequacy lists are empty (i.e., messages about sports: Ac = \u2205). From that moment on, several messages containing the work topic (i.e. messages about tasks, meetings, etc.) are exchanged between colleagues.

The social network corresponding to this situation will begin a weekly photography course in Figure 2. At some point, \u03b1 and \u03b4 will meet in the first class and become their friends on the social network. This situation is illustrated in Figure 2b. As a result of this change in the friends network, the IAA executes the community-finding algorithm. In the absence of further information about user-generated groups, the algorithm allocates the working context (i.e., Cwork = \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4,}).In the second week, the IAA decides to leave the course and participate in the second class."}, {"heading": "5.3. Distinguishing Inappropriate Information from Unusual Information", "text": "As already mentioned, the probability values of the proposed information model are estimated as frequency probabilities, which means that topics that are frequently discussed by users in a context are considered appropriate.

Suppose that the same users \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u0421.As previously mentioned, these users use the OSN to exchange work-related information. Thus, the topic of work is considered appropriate by the IAAs. Each time the IAA decides to send a message discussing work-related topics, the IAA processes the message without triggering a warning.

In our scenario, we assume that users can only share information with their friends (as is the case with Facebook and other established OSN), and a subset of these friendship relationships is randomly selected to establish close and trustworthy friendshipment.8 Users are grouped to form contexts or communities.

These messages can cover any kind of topics. Note that our first model is implicit contextual integrity, so we cannot compare the performance of IAAs with previous proposals. Consequently, we will use random users (who do not use our methods to maintain contextual integrity) as a comparison method that simulates the current situation in all OSN infrastructures (such as Facebook, Google +, etc.). \u2022 Obedient IAAs are standards fundamentalists - i.e. users who do not use our methods to maintain contextual integrity will use IAAs to simulate the current situation in all OSN infrastructures (such as Facebook, Google +, etc.). \u2022 Obedient IAAs are standards fundamentalists - i.e., users who do not comply with IAAs, are always asked to adhere to and adhere to IAAs, for example."}, {"heading": "6.1.3.

Simulation Parameters", "text": "In the previous experiments, we set the maximum number of topics discussed in a message, and the maximum quota of inappropriate topics and sensitive associations.

We repeated these two experiments by using random users instead of obedient users in each message as base simulation of messages. Each simulation was performed in 2000 steps and repeated 100 time periods. The composition of our previous experiments wanted to evaluate the performance of IAAs in a general situation, i.e. when users are allowed to select any number of topics discussed in a message. Thus, we imposed no limit on the size of messages in the impact of the maximum number of topics discussed in the messages, to analyze the topics discussed in the topics discussed in the topics discussed in the messages (i.e. to analyze the size of the topics discussed in the topics discussed in the messages discussed in the previous experiments, in the size of the topics discussed in the messages)."}, {"heading": "6.2.5.

Specifically, we set the percentage of obedient users in each context to 10%, and we varied the malicious user ratio from 0% to 90%. The rest of the users in each context were compliant users.

In contrast, this section represents a more realistic simulation in which the distribution of different types of users coincides with the results of empirical studies on privacy concerns among the general public [72, 44]. Specifically, and according to [72], we have defined the ratio of obedient and compatible users (i.e., norm fundamentalists) as 26% - of which 15% are compatible users to model the emergence of norms and the rest are obedient users; the ratio of relationship-based users (i.e. norm pragmatists) as 64%, and the ratio of random users to compatible users (i.e. norms that are not compatible) as normal."}, {"heading": "7.

Contextual Integrity Modelling and Reasoning", "text": "Previous work on computer models of contextual integrity suggested mechanisms for modelling and arguing the principles of contextual integrity. Thus, Barth et al. [4] formalized some aspects of contextual integrity on the assumption that there are a set of explicitly defined norms that determine what is allowed and what is prohibited, that interactions take place in well-known contexts and that interaction participants play a specific role in each interaction. In a recent paper, Krupa et al. [43] proposed a framework for enforcing norms for information exchange in an electronic institution in which norms, contexts and roles are explicitly defined. While these approaches seem appropriate for the type of domains described in [4] and [43], OSNs do not provide well-known contexts, but no explicit definition of the roles played by users, and information exchange is governed by implicit norms of information exchange."}, {"heading": "7.2.

While these new models represent better frameworks than other traditional access control approaches to develop tools for defining and enforcing access control policies in OSNs, it is unlikely that access control alone will be the complete and definitive solution for adequate data protection management in OSNs, since users need an awareness of access control decisions to fully understand the consequences of their access control policies.

However, these mechanisms have difficulties in dealing with scenarios in which the direct benefit of disclosure of information is a priori unknown or economically difficult to express, such as in OSNs, where disclosure is largely driven by social factors. [38] In a recent paper, Such et al. [71] have proposed a mechanism to equip agents with skills to select the personal attributes of their users that are to be disclosed to other agents during interactions, with the increase in intimacy and data losses that disclosure may cause, but that this mechanism is ultimately not considered by the IAEA."}, {"heading": "7.4. Topic Analysis", "text": "Our proposal is based on the existence of a mechanism capable of determining the topics discussed by the information exchanged in OSNs (i.e. messages).

A common problem with user-generated tags is that tagging terms are often ambiguous, overpersonalized, and inaccurate [37]. In fact, current OSNs offer little or no synonym (i.e., other words, the same meaning) or homonym (i.e., the same word, different meanings) control [33, 48]. To overcome these problems, recent advances in the field of information science have mechanisms for clustering semantically related (i.e., the tags are referred to as in our paper)."}, {"heading": "7.5. Norm Learning", "text": "Standardized learning [23] is the process of learning how to behave in a given situation. In the case of ONS, norms for information exchange are implicit (i.e. there is no explicit definition of what is sensitive or inappropriate), and supervised machine learning algorithms cannot be used to derive norms for information exchange. In the existing literature, social learning [17] is defined as the process of deriving implicit social norms simultaneously through repeated interactions with members of the social network. In most proposals for social learning, norms are derived by analyzing the results of interactions and normative decisions for the benefit. [65] As mentioned above, the benefits of information exchange can be difficult to determine in economic terms. In other proposals, norms are derived by analyzing explicit normative signals such as penalties, sanctions and rewards."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed the first calculation model for the implicit contextual integrity in OSNs. However, this model considers that in OSNs contexts are implicit, a priori unknown, and can change; user relationships evolve; and standards for information exchange are implicit, i.e., they define the behavior that is consistent with the most common behavior; this model of implicit contextual integrity includes an information exchange model that is in force in OSNs, and an information wizard model that is intended to help users avoid the exchange of inappropriate information and the dissemination of sensitive information via ONSs. Experiments we conducted show that: (i) IAAs are able to derive standards for information exchange, even if a small percentage of users follow the standards and in the presence of malicious users; (ii) IAAs help to reduce the exchange of inappropriate information and the dissemination of sensitive information that is transmitted by the users, and the situation of the system that is not transmitted by the users."}], "references": [{"title": "Sok: The evolution of sybil defense via social networks", "author": ["L.

Online Social Networks need mechanisms that help them manage their interactions by increasing the awareness of the different contexts that coexist in Online Social Networks and preventing them from exchanging inappropriate information in those contexts or disseminating sensitive information from some contexts to others. Contextual integrity is a privacy theory that conceptualises the appropriateness of information sharing based on the contexts in which this information is to be shared. Computational models of Contextual Integrity assume the existence of well-defined contexts, in which individuals enact pre-defined roles and information sharing is governed by an explicit set of norms. However, contexts in Online Social Networks are known to be implicit, unknown a priori and ever changing; users relationships are constantly evolving; and the information sharing norms are implicit. This makes current Contextual Integrity models not suitable for Online Social Networks. In this paper, we propose the first computational model of Implicit Contextual Integrity, presenting an information model for Implicit Contextual Integrity as well as a so-called Information Assistant Agent that uses the information model to learn implicit contexts, relationships and the information sharing norms in order to help users avoid inappropriate information exchanges and undesired information disseminations. Through an experimental evaluation, we validate the properties of the model proposed. In particular, Information Assistant Agents are shown to: (i) infer the information sharing norms even if a small proportion of the users follow the norms and in presence of malicious users; (ii) help reduce the exchange of inappropriate information and the dissemination of sensitive information with only a partial view of the system and the information received and sent by their users; and (iii) minimise the burden to the users in terms of raising unnecessary alerts.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
