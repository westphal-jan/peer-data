Their advantages include no need for a normal form clause, a single evidence object, and easy extensibility to other logic. The disadvantage, even in the case of normal form tableaux, is that variables are rigid, which means that substitutions must be applied to all operations of a variable within the entire tableau. Hypertableau Calculation [10] provides a more liberal treatment of variables and rejects the concept of hyperinference from positive hyperresolution. In this section, we will adopt a prolog-like notation for clauses: A1.. On B1, which we have written."}, {"heading": "2.3 Model-based Transformation of Clause Sets", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "2.4 The Model Evolution Calculus", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to assert themselves, that they are able to assert themselves, that they are able to achieve their goals."}, {"heading": "2.5 SGGS: Semantically-Guided Goal-Sensitive Reasoning", "text": "SGGS is a basic model that is based on the level of the first order. SGGS is the model of the first order. SGGS is the model of the first order. SGGS is the model of the first order. SGGS is the model of the first order. SGGS is the model of the second order. SGGS is semantically guided by a fixed initial interpretation, which I like as a semantic solution; and it is purposeful as the set of support strategy [58,71], a rule of inference that uses the most general unifier of a hyperinference, although the hyperinference in SGGS, as we will see, is an instance of inference generation inference, and therefore its closest predecessor is a hyperlinking of the rule, which uses the most general unifier of a hyperdefinition to generate instances of the parents, rather than to generate a hyperresolution. SGGS is the most important model based on the model of the first order, which is the GGS representation of the first order in the GGS."}, {"heading": "3 Model-based Reasoning in First-Order Theories", "text": "There are essentially two ways of thinking about a theory that is presented by a series of axioms: as a set of all theorems that are logical consequences of the axioms, or as a set of all interpretations that are models of the axioms. Obviously, the two are linked, but can lead to different ways of thinking, which we present by selecting methods in this section. We will discuss approaches that incorporate axioms in resolution, hierarchical and local theoretical thinking, and a newer method called Model-Constructing satisfiability calicus or MCsat."}, {"heading": "3.1 Building Theory Axioms into Resolution and Superposition", "text": "The first theory analysed was equality: since the axioms of equality were subjected to dissolution or other systems of consequence to the logic of the first order, they led to an explosion of search space, paramodulation, superimposition and transcription were developed to convert equality into dissolution (e.g. [73.48.77.4.21] and chapters 7 and 9 in [76]). After equality was conquered, research on integration theories flourished (e.g. [72.66.54.49.36.40.53.30]). Theories of equality axiomatized by equality laws, and among them permutative theories, where the two sides of each axiom are permutations of the same symbols, as in associativity and commutativity, received the most attention. A major component is the substitution of syntactical unification by a series of E-equations, e.g. by equation [485-sexialized] equations in systems of equality [484]."}, {"heading": "3.2 Hierarchical Reasoning by Superposition", "text": "Since Jose \u0301 Meseguer's work with Joe Goguen (e.g., [44]) was populated by Joe Goguen, it became clear that a major problem at the crossroads of thinking, specifying, and programming is that theories or specifications are built by expanding into hierarchies. An extended or expanded theory T adds new types (S0), new function symbols (S0), so-called extension functions, and new axioms (N0), which specify properties of the new symbols. For the basic theory, the class of models is given, while the extension is axiomatically defined."}, {"heading": "3.3 Hierarchical Reasoning in Local Theory Extensions", "text": "A series of papers starting with [81] a class of theory extensions (T0, T) is sufficient only if they are based on a complete hierarchical method of verifying the satisfaction of principles, without requiring either a sufficient completeness or that T0 is a universal theory of the first order. (The enrichment of the axioms in N is not mandatory to be clauses: if they have an extension with clauses; if N includes an extension of the form, we can have an extension of the form x (x), where the extension is an arbitrary 0 formula and D (x) is an extension of the formula, with at least an extension of the function we wish to extend. The basic assumption that T0, or a fragment of it, clearly remains a decision for satisfaction. As we have seen, the satisfaction of the universally quantified variables of the decisive first order is decisive."}, {"heading": "3.4 Beyond SMT: Satisfiability Modulo Assignment and MCsat", "text": "Like SGGS, the conflict-driven clause Learning (CDCL) generalizes to first-order problem solving and Herbrand interpretations, the model-constructing satisfaction calculation, or MCsat for short, generalizes the formula CDCL to decideable first-order fragments and their models. Remember that in DPLL-CDCL the path that partially represents the candidate model can only contain propositional letters; the follow-up mechanism that explains conflicts is a propositional solution; and learned clauses are made by input atoms [35,55]. These three characteristics are also applicable to the DPLL paradigm that applies to SMTsolvers [7], where an abstraction function maps an endless number of first-order input basic atoms to an endless number of propositional atoms. In this way, the method bridges the gap between the first-order language of the T theory and the propositional language of the DPLL-CL."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "We explored model-based reasoning methods, where conclusions build or complement sub-models that in turn lead to further conclusions, balance the search with conclusions, and look for a model with the search for evidence. We illustrated these concepts for first-order clauses and then elevated them to theoretical thinking, so to speak. Automated reasoning has made tremendous progress, and state-of-the-art systems work very sophisticated with predominantly syntactical information. The challenge of model-based methods is to move toward a semantically oriented mindset that can pay off for difficult problems or new areas.
