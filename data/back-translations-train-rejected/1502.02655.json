Types and characteristics of in-game communication, social interaction, and dynamics and patterns of communication between players are well described, but very little research has been done to date on the characteristics of text production itself in games and the game community. In our opinion, the potential of games for language learning has been largely overlooked by educators, and by intensifying research into this language - both its social aspects and large collections of text - we can know more precisely how the game language can be useful for language learning. This paper focuses on a massively multiplayer-based online game (MMOG), namely World of Warcraft (WoW).1 This research focuses on describing automated methods for analyzing the language production of the WoW community and the associated potential problems. Of course, various measures can be taken to determine language complexity."}, {"heading": "2 Background: games as a language-learning tool", "text": "MMOGs are game worlds that are characterized by their online character, which means that players can interact not only with the gaming community, but also with other players. Collaboration takes place and can be observed both outside the game in various discussion forums and fan sites, as well as within the game itself. Gaming in the MMOGs is cognitively demanding; it is about exploring complex problem areas, creating and analyzing models and negotiating meanings within the game community; it is about coordinating people, virtual tools and artifacts, and it is characterized by various forms of text."}, {"heading": "3 Measuring language complexity", "text": "We will first address the measures that emphasize lexical aspects of language production, and then present some measures that take into account syntactical complexity."}, {"heading": "3.1 Lexical measures", "text": "It is often used to describe and predict vocabulary growth [10]. Intuitively, the lexical diversity should be quantifiable in relation to different types of words. As this measure depends greatly on the text size, the number of characters is also taken into account. A measure that uses these two types of information is the way in which they are used, but even TTR depends on the text size: it is greater when the texts grow larger than the texts. Due to this fact, the comparison is only justified with texts of the same size, or with statistical approximations (corrected ratios) that take this into account, or with the help of probability models. There are several corrected measures, such as Herdans C, Guiraud's R, Yule's K and others [10]. But since the variability within the text cannot be used arbitrarily, these measures are not precise."}, {"heading": "3.2 Syntactic-complexity measures", "text": "The simplest measure of syntactical complexity (or rather its substitute) is the mean length of sentences. Although it is insensitive to structural differences within sentences, it is a reliable indicator of grade level. There are more complex measures that define the level of development of sentences (D-level, DSS scoring, IPSyn) [13], and descriptive techniques, such as comparing the frequency of POS tags for the most common n-grams between two texts [17], which are able to explain qualitatively differences in the frequency of syntactical constructions in texts. The D-level used in this essay comes from childhood language acquisition research and follows the premise that the most complex sentence types were last acquired [18]. According to Cheung and Kemper [19], the D-level is a more appropriate index for sentence complexity than other metrics, as it is able to distinguish between types of inclusion."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental setup", "text": "Compiled using the BootCat toolkit [20], the corpus therefore contains 261,000 tokens from 196 URLs. The second corpus used as a benchmark is ukWaC [21], which is composed of various web-based texts queried by the Internet domain. ukWaC's original size is 1.9 billion tokens, from which we randomly select sentences worth 261,000 tokens. Raw corpora were lemmatized and POS tagged with TreeTagger [22].Processing data In this research, the following measures were calculated: TTR; MSTTR; N, V and Adj density; Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid indices; Mean Section length; and D-level (for the WoW corpus only).We adapt a NRW model whose significance varies, although there is no comparison (to a lesser extent)."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Lexical diversity", "text": "The table (1) shows the main results for WoW and ukWaC corpus. The type-token ratio for the total \u0445 230,000 tokers5 WoW corpus is 0.09, while the TTR for the ukWaC corpus is 0.12. In other words, the probability of encountering a new type at the end of the WoW corpus is 9 percent, and in ukWaC this is only 3 percent probability.However, if you have only one quotient value for the entire corpus, only a rough picture emerges. To show the distribution of the TTRs in smaller samples, the mean segmental TTR was also calculated from samples of 100 tokens. Thus, the MSTTR (mean of 2,300 samples) for the WoW corpus is 0.73 and.74 for ukWaW corpus.The probability of encountering a new type after a 100-token sample is on average lower than the difference between the two."}, {"heading": "5.2 Probabilistic model", "text": "In our case, the vocabulary growth rate is determined by the ratio of the number of hapax legomena to the number of tokens. The results of the growth test for the two companies are growthth.rateWoW =.033, growth.rateukWaW =.059, that is, the difference between the results of the hapax legomena and the number of tokens. The results of the growth test are growth.rateWoW = 030, growth.rateukWaC =.059, that is, it is significant with the number of tokens."}, {"heading": "5.3 Lexical density", "text": "Dictionary density has been calculated separately for nouns, verbs, and adjectives (Table 1), but cumulatively for all texts in each corpus. The proportion of nouns (without proper names) in both corpora is 0.16. There are fewer verbs,.14 and.15 of all characters for WoW and ukWaC respectively. The difference is greater for the proportion of adjectives,.06 and.08. These data suggest that there is the same amount of words that carry \"nominal\" information, while the WoW corpus contains smaller proportions of verbs and adjectives, which can be interpreted as communication in WoW texts that are closer to spoken, and ukWaC texts, although the difference is minimal. Halliday has already observed that spoken texts tend to have a lower lexical density [26]."}, {"heading": "5.4 Readability", "text": "The Flesch Reading Ease Index was calculated using 1000-character samples, and Chart (2) shows that the results are considerably different.The values for WoW texts are more uniform, while the ukWaC values are more varied, SDWoW = 7.6; SDukWaC = 13. This is not surprising, since ukWaC contains more diverse and generic texts with varying degrees of readability. Compared with ukWaC, the WoW corpus is then a homogeneous mass with most texts of similar readability. The difference between the means of Flesch texts for two corpses is 13 points, MWoW = 70; MukWaC = 57. This difference is significant for p <.001 (D =.52).According to the FleschKincaid evaluation system, this finding means that WoW texts are 2.2-grades below the ukWaC corpus, MW = 7.8; MukW = 10."}, {"heading": "5.6 D-level", "text": "The summary results for the D-level of 2209 WoW sets are MWoW = 3.45; SDWoW = 7.6. At this point, it is more interesting to look at the distribution of the results, which resembles a U-shape. In Graph 4, most sentences can be described as either level 0 or 7. There are 800 simple sentences and an approximately equal number of very complex sentences. This result corresponds to the D-level distribution of the results on the in-game \"quest\" texts in Thorne et al. [2]. However, our results must be viewed with some caution, as manual verification has found several lists, incoherent productions, and errors in parsing and tagging. D-0 sentences are therefore likely to be overrepresented. 714 sentences have been analyzed as complex, i.e. they contain 7Of course, only a very rough estimate due to the topicality of Flesch's research on readability."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "The results show that language production in the WoW corpus is a little less complex, but not by all metrics. Both corpora show the same amount of information packaged in nouns, but the WoW language can be described as more spoken because its lexical density is generally lower. Lexical diversity, as measured by TTR in random samples, shows that vocabulary size differs more between texts in the WoW corpus than between texts in the ukWaC corpus, but on average, WoW texts achieve less lexical diversity. Readability analysis showed that WoW texts form a homogeneous group with less dispersion than ukWaC texts. Based on the readability of texts and average sentence length, WoW texts can be described as intermediate or \"standard language texts.\""}], "references": [{"title": "Cognition and literacy in massively multiplayer online games", "author": ["C.A.
