Quite late, the concept of relevance was quantitatively examined [31], and the concept of independence was applied to the change of faith [32], which has been a long-standing and lively topic in AI [33]. The main affected horn, krom and other fragments of propositional logic are also ubiquitous in AI [34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. Firstly, in the paper we have presented a resolution-based algorithm for forgetting CNF fragments of propositional logy. Although the algorithm is generally expensive even for the horn fragment as it is theoretically insoluble, it opens up a heuristic potentiality, e.g. the choice of different orders of atoms to forget, and the choice of different orders of solvable clauses to do the solution."}], "references": [{"title": "Propositional independence: Formula-variable independence and forgetting", "author": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang", "Paolo Liberatore", "Pierre Marquis"], "venue": "Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Reasoning under inconsistency: A forgetting-based approach", "author": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang", "Pierre Marquis"], "venue": "Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Uniform interpolation and layered bisimulation", "author": ["Albert Visser"], "venue": "In Go\u0308del\u201996,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 1996}, {"title": "Solving logic program conflict through strong and weak forgettings", "author": ["Yan Zhang", "Norman Y.
