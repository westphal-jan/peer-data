When integrating this system with mobile devices, we made sure that the image processing steps are executed in the cloud, primarily to remove the processing overhead from the user's mobile device. We used the concept of cloud virtualization, which allowed us to create a replica of our Android application that can run in the cloud. Cloud computation was done on Amazon EC2 instances. Once the user clicks on the photo of the food object, the image, along with other details (distance information and user information), is sent to the cloud for processing. Here, the image is first segmented to obtain the food portion, and the features are extracted from the target object. Once the features are extracted, it is then mapped with the model file that is associated with the likelihood and food brand."}, {"heading": "B.

We were also able to estimate the error in calculating the calorie of bread of different sizes. From this table, we were able to determine the margin of error in the estimated calorie (C \") from linear regression on the area when the estimated calorie is obtained from the circumference. From Table II, we can see that in some scenarios, the calorie difference may be smaller than 0.65 compared to the actual calories.Similar calculations were performed on each food class to achieve the best fit for estimating the calory.The reason for taking into account different baseline values for each food class is that the range calculated by bread may be larger than the area obtained from the banana, but it does not necessarily determine the linear relationship between the area and the calory.Therefore, each food class was proposed individually with different baseline values for the area I. We have proposed the calculation of the new area CLUSFORWORK in this paper."}], "references": [{"title": "Energy intake, physical activity, energy balance, and cancer: epidemiologic evidence", "author": ["SY Pan", "M.
