State-of-the-art review-level sentiment classification techniques could give pretty good precisions of above 90%. However, current phrase-level sentiment analysis approaches might only give sentiment polarity labelling precisions of around 70%~80%, which is far from satisfaction and restricts its application in many practical tasks. In this paper, we focus on the problem of phrase-level sentiment polarity labelling and attempt to bridge the gap between phrase-level and review-level sentiment analysis. We investigate the inconsistency between the numerical star ratings and the sentiment orientation of textual user reviews. Although they have long been treated as identical, which serves as a basic assumption in previous work, we find that this assumption is not necessarily true. We further propose to leverage the results of review-level sentiment classification to boost the performance of phrase-level polarity labelling using a novel constrained convex optimization framework. Besides, the framework is capable of integrating various kinds of information sources and heuristics, while giving the global optimal solution due to its convexity. Experimental results on both English and Chinese reviews show that our framework achieves high labelling precisions of up to 89%, which is a significant improvement from current approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Feb 2015 14:45:41 GMT  (136kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03322v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["yongfeng zhang", "min zhang", "yiqun liu", "shaoping ma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.03322"}, "pdf": {"name": "1502.03322.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Boost Phrase-level Polarity Labelling with Review-level Sentiment Classification\u2217\u2217\u2217", "authors": ["Yongfeng Zhang", "Min Zhang", "Yiqun Liu", "Shaoping Ma"], "emails": ["yongfeng14@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "z-m@tsinghua.edu.cn", "yiqunliu@tsinghua.edu.cn", "msp@tsinghua.edu.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Boost Phrase-Level Polarity Labeling with Review-Level Sentiment Classification - Yongfeng Zhang Department of Computer Science Tsinghua University yongfeng14 @ mails.tsinghua.edu.cnMin Zhang Department of Computer Science Tsinghua University z-m @ tsinghua.edu.cnYiqun Liu Department of Computer Science Tsinghua University yiqunliu @ tsinghua.edu.cnShaoping Ma Department of Computer Science Tsinghua University msp @ tsinghua.edu.cnSentiment analyses on user reviews could help track users \"reactions to products and provide advice to users on what to buy.

Introduction", "text": "Sentiment analysis techniques could be classified into three levels according to the different granularities on which the analysis is conducted, i.e., document-level, sentencelevel and phrase-level (Liu and Zhang 2012).

A sentiment vector x = [x1, x2,..., xr] T (xi) represents the sentiment orientation of a review, sentence or feature opinion pair.

The Framework", "text": "In general, the framework consists of two phases. In the first phase, we use an unattended algorithm to classify mood at level C to obtain the sentiment matrix X = C (T) for the verification corpus T; in the second phase, we extract feature opinion pairs from corpus T and use the sentiment matrix X and the general sentiment lexicon X0 in a uniform optimization framework to obtain the contextual sentiment lexicon X. After that, a predefined function s (X) is used to determine the general sentiment orientation of each feature opinion pair. We will present the details of the framework in the following part of the section."}, {"heading": "4.1 Review-Level Sentiment Classification", "text": "The aim of this step is to present the general sentiment polarities of user reviews through sentiment classification algorithms; the first is to avoid the manual review review process at the review level of sentiment polarities, which makes our framework adaptable; the second is to keep our framework as general as possible to ensure its independence from specific data requirements; the optimization framework in (Lu et al. 2011) uses the numerical ratings of users in online shopping or review service websites to monitor the process of phrase-level sentiment labeling; such numerical ratings may not exist in specific environments, for example, in forum discussions, e-mails and newsgroups (Liu and Zhang 2012); and finally, the relationship between sentiment orientations of ratings and user reviews is still open (Moghadam and Ester)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Sentiment Lexicon Construction", "text": "In this phase, we construct the contextual sentiment lexicon.

Experiments", "text": "In this section, we will conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed framework and examine the effects of different parameter settings in our framework.

Finally, we will evaluate the proposed framework and make some comparisons with other techniques."}, {"heading": "5.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "For the experiment in English, we use the MP3 player ratings from Amazon, which are publicly available.4 For the experiment in Chinese, we use the restaurant ratings from DianPing.com 5, a famous restaurant ratings website in China.6 Each of the ratings from the two records consists of a piece of review text and a general numerical rating ranging from 1 to 5 stars.We choose these two records from both English and Chinese, as these two languages are linguistically of very different types.We want to investigate whether our framework works in different language environments. Some statistical information about these two records is shown in Table 1.Table 1.1.Some statistics of the two datasets.Language # Users # Items # Reviews MP3 Player English 26,113 796 55,740 Restaurant Chinese 11,857 89,462 510,5514 http: / / sifaka.cus.iu / reviews MP3 Player English 26,796 55,740 Restaurant Chinese 11,810,462 510,5514 http: / / siced.ucedu / reviews of the three restaurants are required for the evaluation: http: / fact.ucedu / iu / idi.6"}, {"heading": "5.2 User Rating Analysis", "text": "Previous papers (Cui, Mittal and Datar 2006; Lu et al. 2011; Wang, Lu and Zhai 2010) refer to a review text as positive if the corresponding overall rating is 4 or 5 stars, and negative if the overall rating is 1, 2 or 3 stars. However, the overall rating may not always correspond to the emotional orientation of review texts. Our observation is that a significant number of users tend to give unchanged overall ratings, although the mood orientation expressed in his or her review text may vary. Interestingly, many users simply rate 4 stars regardless of the review text he has written. We will analyze this phenomenon in the following part of this section."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Overall and Sub-Aspect Ratings.", "text": "We start by analyzing the difference in the distribution of the review aspects of the restaurant data set. The reviews on three partial aspects allow us to examine the \"true\" feelings of a user on more specific aspects of the restaurant beyond the overall rating. For the overall rating and each of the partial reviews, we calculate the percentages that each of the 5-star reviews takes into account in the total number of reviews, as shown in Figure 2. The x-axis represents 1 star above 5 stars, and the y-axis is the percentage of each type of star rating. We see that the user reviews tend to circulate in the overall rating by 4 stars, while they tend to center around 2-3 stars on the partial reviews. This implies that the overall rating may not serve as a true reflection of the feelings of users, and the users tend to be in much more detailed parts of \"the truth tell\" the users. To represent the overall statistical total = the overall importance of the overall rating, we examine the average and the GP, where we are."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 Labelling Accuracy using Different Methods.", "text": "In fact, users could consider many other features besides taste, environment and service when giving the overall ratings, as a result, it can be argued that the difference in the distribution of ratings on different aspects is not sufficient to imply that the overall rating is inappropriate to estimate the general mood of the review texts. As a result, we evaluate the impact of the sentiment orientation of review texts with different types of numerical ratings. We randomly assigned 1000 reviews out of the 510,551 reviews of restaurant reviews that are manually labeled 3 annotators. An annotator is asked to give a single label for a review text that could be positive or negative. The final sentiment of a review is assigned by using the majority label (more than two) of the three annotators. The inter-annotator agreement is 79.76%, which is comparable to the reports of the existing sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee 2008; Lu et al 2011)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Feature-Opinion Pair Extraction", "text": "There are three experimentally set parameters in the process of feature opinion pair extraction, which are 1) the minimum term frequency (referred to by freq) of NounPhrases to be selected as the candidate feature words, 2) the minimum pointwise mutual information (referred to by pmi) of a feature word candidate to be maintained during the filtering process, and 3) the minimum co-occurrence ratio (referred to by cor) of a pair to be selected as the last feature opinion pair.Pool Lexicon: In principle, we have used relatively strict parameters to obtain a high quality feature opinion pairs, which allow us to focus on the core task of phrase evaluation polarity marking in this thesis.

However, in this subsection, we will attempt to investigate the effects of different constraints within our framework by analyzing the four main parameters \u03bb1 \u0445 \u03bb4 in objective function (13).We will first conduct a \"Knock Out One Term\" experiment with these parameters to see if all of these constraints contribute to the performance of polarity marking at the phrase level. Furthermore, we will set one of the four parameters to 0 at a time and evaluate the F measure. The results will be shown in Table 5.The experimental result shows that singling out one of the four parameters reduces the performance of polarity marking. Furthermore, the restriction of the sentiment orientation at the review level (\u03bb1) or the restriction of the general sentiment lexicon (\u03bb2) greatly reduces the performance, which implies that these two information parameters are of great importance for the construction parameters."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "Treatment of numerical star rating as a sentiment indicator for review texts is a common assumption in previous phrase analysis algorithms (Lu et al. 2011; Lu, Zhai and Sundaresan 2009; Dave, Lawrence and Pennock 2003). However, in this paper we examined the inconsistency between numerical ratings and textual sentiment orientations. Our observations in valuation analysis show that users tend to make one-sided evaluations regardless of the text ratings they apply to a particular product. In addition, evaluation results are further verified using other methods to verify the existence of such bias and show the effectiveness of leverage of sensitization on reviews."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The authors thank Prof. Xiaoyan Zhu, Yang Liu and Maosong Sun for the fruitful discussions as well as the anonymous critics for the constructive suggestions.

State-of-the-art review-level sentiment classification techniques could give pretty good precisions of above 90%. However, current phrase-level sentiment analysis approaches might only give sentiment polarity labelling precisions of around 70% \u223c 80%, which is far from satisfaction and restricts its application in many practical tasks. In this paper, we focus on the problem of phrase-level sentiment polarity labelling and attempt to bridge the gap between phrase-level and review-level sentiment analysis. We investigate the inconsistency between the numerical star ratings and the sentiment orientation of textual user reviews. Although they have long been treated as identical, which serves as a basic assumption in previous work, we find that this assumption is not necessarily true. We further propose to leverage the results of review-level sentiment classification to boost the performance of phrase-level polarity labelling using a novel constrained convex optimization framework. Besides, the framework is capable of integrating various kinds of information sources and heuristics, while giving the global optimal solution due to its convexity. Experimental results on both English and Chinese reviews show that our framework achieves high labelling precisions of up to 89%, which is a significant improvement from current approaches.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
