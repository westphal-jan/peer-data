INTRODUCTION", "text": "With advances in information technology (IT), criminals are exploiting cyberspace to commit numerous cyber crimes. Growing trends in complex distributed systems and Internet computing raise important questions about information security and privacy. Cyber infrastructures are highly vulnerable to intrusion and other threats. Physical devices such as sensors and detectors are not enough to monitor and protect these infrastructures; therefore, there is a need for more complex IT that can model normal behavior and detect abnormal threats. These cyber defense systems must be flexible, adaptable, and able to detect a variety of threats and make smart real-time decisions [1, 2]. With the pace and level of cyber attacks, human intervention is simply not sufficient for timely attack analysis and appropriate response. The fact is that most network-centric cyber attacks are carried out by intelligent agents such as computer worms and viruses; therefore, combating these threats is self-contained, and capable of building."}, {"heading": "2. CYBER CRIMES: DEFINITION, ISSUES", "text": "The rapid development of computer technology and the Internet has had a lot of positive effects and brought many conveniences into our lives. However, it has also caused problems that are difficult to deal with, such as the emergence of new types of crime. For example, common crimes such as theft and fraud are a new form of \"cyber crimes\" through information technology. Furthermore, information technology facilitates the globalization of these crimes by erasing national borders and makes it much more difficult to monitor, track, prevent or capture cyber criminals [8, 9, 10]. Information technology is increasingly being used both as a targeted tool and as a tool for committing crimes. Electronic devices and other high-tech products enable criminals to commit cheap and simple crimes. Computers, telephones, the Internet and all other information systems designed for the benefit of humanity are vulnerable to criminal activity."}, {"heading": "3.

These characteristics include the following [25]: \u2022 Real-time detection of intruders - while the attack is underway or immediately after, \u2022 False alarms must be minimized, \u2022 Human monitoring should be kept to a minimum and continuous operation ensured, \u2022 Restorability of accidental or attack-related system crashes, \u2022 Self-monitoring ability to detect attempts by attackers to change the system, \u2022 Compliance with the security policies of the monitored system, and \u2022 Adaptability to system changes and user behavior over time."}, {"heading": "4. APPLICATIONS OF AI TO DEFENSE AGAINST CYBER CRIMES", "text": "Available academic resources show that AI techniques already have numerous applications in the fight against cyber crime. For example, neural networks are used to detect and prevent intrusions, but there are also suggestions for the use of neural networks in the areas of \"Denial of Service (DoS) detection, computer worm detection, spam detection, zombie detection, malware classification and forensic investigations.\" [5] AI techniques such as heuristics, data mining, neural networks and AISs have also been applied to new-generation antivirus technology [7]. Some IDSs use intelligent agent technology, which is sometimes even combined with mobile agent technology. Mobile intelligent agents can travel between gathering points to detect suspicious cyber activity [2]. Wang et al. (2008) explained that the future of antivirus detection technology lies in the application of heuristic technology, which is \"the knowledge associated with the identification of viruses and some unknown capabilities in this section.\""}, {"heading": "4.1. Artificial Neural Network Applications", "text": "ANN is a computer mechanism that simulates structural and functional aspects of neural networks that exist in biological nervous systems and is ideal for situations that require prediction, classification, or control in dynamic and complex computer environments [26]. Chen (2008) designed NeuroNet - a neural network system that collects and processes potentially distributed information, coordinates the activities of core network devices, searches for irregularities, triggers alarms, and initiates countermeasures. Experiments showed that NeuroNet is effective against TCP-targeted distributed DoS attacks [27]. Linda et al. (2009) presented the Intrusion Detection System using Neural Network based Modeling (IDS-NNM), which proved to be able to detect all intrusion attempts in network communication without giving false alarms [28]. Barika et al. (2009) presented a detailed architecture of a distributed neural network based on artificial spatial."}, {"heading": "4.2. Intelligent Agent Applications", "text": "They have developed a \"counter-plan\" that can prevent certain cyber attack plans using multi-agent planning, along with some novel interference methods. [35] Gou et al. (2006) designed MWDCM - a multi-agent system to combat cyber attacks. Rowe (2003) developed a \"counter-plan\" system that automatically involves propagating worms that waste a lot of bandwidth and cause router crashes. Experiments showed that their system effectively prevents worm spread even at high worm infection rates. Phillips et al. (2006) presented a distributed agent coalition that maintains normal operations."}, {"heading": "4.3.

Genetic Algorithm and Fuzzy Sets Applications", "text": "They applied their algorithm to an artificial computer security system and demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting intruders. The simulation results showed that the proposed system improves performance and reduces the size of the database, the time complexity and the rate of false alarms. (Mabu et al.) They described a novel system for detecting intruders based on class aspects. (Mabu et al.) The proposed method is flexible and efficient in terms of abuse and anomaly, capable of dealing with the mixed databases, which contain both discrete and continuous attributes."}, {"heading": "4.5. Other AI Applications", "text": "In this section we give examples of various other and hybrid applications. Machado et al. (2005) presented a novel virus detection system based on mobile intelligence and AISs. They also implemented their design and showed that they are able to distinguish between different attacks, vulnerabilities and other vulnerabilities. Experimental results showed that their model offers a significant improvement compared to previous work in the field. Pei and Song (2008) focused on improving the performance of intrusion detectors of IDSs, so they proposed a hybrid approach that uses the search power of immune algorithms to generate fuzzy detectors. Experiments showed the great searchability of immune algorithms."}, {"heading": "4.6. Advantages of AI Applications to IDPSs", "text": "AI techniques bring numerous advantages to the detection and prevention of intrusions (see Table 1).Robustness; Selective response - eliminating malicious activity by the best available means; Variety - each detector node generates a statistically unique number of non-self-detectors; Resource optimization; Multi-layer structure - attackers cannot succeed in their malicious activity by circumventing only one layer, as several layers of different structures are responsible for monitoring a single point. Disposability - does not depend on a single component that can be easily replaced by other components [52, 56, 88]. Genetic algorithms Robustness; Adaptability to the environment; Optimization - providing optimal solutions even to complex computer problems; Parallelism - enabling multiple schemes at once; Flexible and robust global search [21, 86]. Fuzzy sets Robustness of their interpolative thinking mechanisms; Interoperability - human friendliness [89]."}, {"heading": "5. LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT ANOMALY DETECTION/PREVENTION SYSTEMS", "text": "Although anomaly detection systems offer the ability to detect hitherto unknown attacks, they have some important limitations that need to be addressed. The main problem is the difficulty of building a solid model of what is acceptable behavior and what is an attack; therefore, they can trigger a high number of false alarms that can be caused by atypical behavior that is actually normal and authorized, since normal behavior can easily and readily change. Further limitations include the following [25, 26, 29]: \u2022 For the anomaly detection system to characterize normal patterns and build a model of normal behavior, extensive training of normal system activities is required. Any change in the normal pattern of the system must result in a necessary update of the knowledge base. \u2022 If the detection and prevention system classifies a legitimate activity inaccurately as malicious, the results can be very unfortunate, as it will attempt to stop the activity or modify it. \u2022 A system based on detection by an attacker, no matter how efficient it may be at detecting or disabling it by an attacker."}, {"heading": "6. SCOPE FOR FUTURE WORK", "text": "Given human limitations and the fact that agents such as computer viruses and worms require intelligent, network-centric environments, smart cyber-sensor agents (or computer-generated forces) that detect, evaluate and respond to cyber attacks in a timely manner. [3] The application of AI techniques in cyber defense requires planning and future research. One of the challenges is knowledge management in network-centric warfare, so a promising area for research is the introduction of a modular and hierarchical knowledge architecture in decision-making software. Rapid assessment and decision superiority can only be guaranteed through automated knowledge management. It is also foreseeable that the big goal of AI research - the development of artificial general intelligence - can be achieved in the not-so-distant future, which would lead to a singularity described as \"the technological creation of smarter than human intelligence.\" Nevertheless, it is crucial that we have the ability to deploy cyberdefense as a better AI technology."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION", "text": "The rapid development of information technology has had a lot of positive effects and brought many amenities into our lives. However, it has also caused problems that are difficult to overcome, such as the emergence of cybercrime. As the technology evolves, so do the criminal procedures. Every day, we are faced with increasing numbers and diversity of cybercrimes, as this technology provides criminals with an easy way to achieve their goals. Critical infrastructures are particularly vulnerable. AI techniques are already used to help people fight cybercrime, as they provide flexibility and learning skills to the IDPS software. It has been shown that broad use of knowledge in the decision-making process requires intelligent decision support in cyberdefense, which can be successfully achieved with the help of AI methods. Available academic resources show that AI techniques already have numerous applications in fighting cybercrime."}], "references": [{"title": "Guest Editors' Introduction: Artificial Intelligence for Homeland Security", "author": ["H.
