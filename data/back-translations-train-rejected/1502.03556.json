Automatic weight generation is a non-trivial, however an important task in instance matching technique. Therefore, identifying an appropriate metric for generating weight for a property automatically is nevertheless a formidable task. In this paper, we investigate an approach of generating weights automatically by considering hypotheses: (1) the weight of a property is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of its distinct values to the number of instances contain the property, and (2) the weight is also proportional to the ratio of the number of distinct values of a property to the number of instances in a training dataset. The basic intuition behind the use of our approach is the classical theory of information content that infrequent words are more informative than frequent ones. Our mathematical model derives a metric for generating property weights automatically, which is applied in instance matching system to produce re-conciliated instances efficiently.

However, the efficiency of instance synchronization is often influenced by the weight of a property associated with instances. Automatic weight generation is a non-trivial but important task in instance synchronization. Therefore, determining a suitable metric for automatic weight generation for a property is still a daunting task. In this paper, we examine an approach to automatic weight generation taking hypotheses into account: (1) The weight of a property is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of its unique values to the number of instances that contain the property, and (2) the weight is also proportional to the ratio of the number of unique values of a property to the number of instances in a training dataset.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "In fact, most people, places, and things connected by concepts, attributes, and their instances in domain ontologies pose a challenge to integrate information into a domain. However, ontologies in a domain are often defined differently from others that are influenced by different creators who relate to their interest, social behavior, and ultimately their different needs. It poses a challenge to integrate information via semantic knowledge bases. A semantic knowledge base includes assertions about entities that are technically referred to as property in Resource Description Framework (RDF) and in Language (OWL) by two disjoint sets called \"C and\" relations, \"R which are technically referred to as\" property in Resource Description Framework. \"The semantic knowledge base is as follows: KB = (R)"}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "The growing demand for knowledge, data, and information within the same or the same group has recently gained new attention for ontology and instance comparison issues."}, {"heading": "3. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE PROPERTY WEIGHT", "text": "The basic intuition behind the use of this approach, however, is that the more likely a concept appears, the less information it conveys, in other words, rare words are more meaningful than common ones. Information theory approaches are well defined in some research papers by [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. They obtain their required information content (IC) value by statistical analysis of corpora. They associate probabilities with any concept in the taxonomy based on word occurrences in a given corpus. The IC value is then obtained by taking into account the negative log probability [24, 27]: icres (c) = -log p (c), (2) where c is a property and p (c) is the probability of encountering c in a given corpus. [24] was the first to consider the use of this formula derived from the work of Shannon [28]."}, {"heading": "3.1. Influence of Negative Factors", "text": "Our basic hypothesis for determining the influence of a property on instance identification is that a property has a higher weight if its values are not repeated in a semantic knowledge base, like a primary key in a database repository. Alternatively, a property has less weight if it is repeated in the knowledge base. As the value of the property repeats so often, it loses its ability to identify an instance. If a value of the property repeats, the weight is punished by a negative probability factor, np, defined as the ratio of the number of repetitions to the number of instances to which the property belongs, i.e. (3) In addition, the ratio of the repeat value to the total number of the instance also has a negative impact on the property weight. First and foremost, let us consider the fact in the following equation:"}, {"heading": "3.2. Our Proposed Property Weight Factors", "text": "As described in paragraph 3.1, there are two types of negative factors associated with our automatic weight generation for properties of the semantic knowledge base, namely np1 and np2, and these are primarily defined as: (5) (6) where | dup | is the number of value duplications for a property p in the entire knowledge base and i is an instance. Furthermore, | i p | represents the total number of instances containing this property, p and | I | the total number of instances in the knowledge base. The probability of identifying an instance with p would be referred to as Prob (p) = 1-np (p). We consider the probability to be the weight of this property. Therefore, we measure the weight of each property of an ontology scheme used as a common probability in a knowledge base as follows: weight (p) = (1.0 \u2212 np1 (p)))."}, {"heading": "4. MATHEMATICAL EXPLANATION", "text": "The primary equation 7 articulates the effects of negative factors in terms of the number of repetitions of a property. However, our measurement variable focuses on the reversal of the repetition of value, i.e. the number of unique values of a property that are available in a knowledge base. In the following section, we will focus on the mathematical derivatives and considerations."}, {"heading": "4.1. Mathematical Derivations", "text": "Let us start with the probability equation 7 for the mathematical derivative and consider the nature of the equation. (8) where | distinguishable | is the number of instances containing different values for the property p. Although the first term | distinguishable | 2 / (| I p | * | I |) in Equation 8 is quite convincing, in the second term (| distinguishable | * | I p |) / (| I p | I |) we consider that | I p | has a positive contribution to the weight factor, which is a contradiction. On the other hand, let us consider that there are 1 million instances as human beings in a knowledge base and 10 instances of them contain property values at the time of birth and unfortunately all have a certain value. Obviously, this does not guarantee that the rest intervals will contain unambiguous values. On the other hand, it is not guaranteed that most of them will end as a distinctive value."}, {"heading": "4.2.

Semantic Link Cloud (SLC) Generation Modules and 3. Instance Matching Algorithm."}, {"heading": "5.1. Ontology Alignment", "text": "A concept is neither complete nor explicit in its own words. Therefore, concepts are organized in a semantic network or taxonomy linked to a number of relationships in order to explicitly define them to avoid polysemitic problems. Our ontological schema matching algorithm [30, 13, 31] takes into account the nature of reference localization by taking into account adjacent concepts and relationships to harmonize the units of ontology.Our ontology algorithm of alignment begins with a seed point called an anchor, where the concept anchor is a pair of \"similar\" concepts from each of two ontologies. Starting from an anchor point, our scalable algorithm collects two sets of adjacent concepts across ontologies. Since our algorithm starts an anchor and examines adjacent concepts, it does not depend much on the size of the ontologies."}, {"heading": "5.2. SLC Generation Module", "text": "Semantic Link Cloud (SLC), the collection of linked information from an instance, is an important step toward instance matching. Users often describe an instance in different ways and even through different but adjacent concepts of an ontology, often resulting in undetected or misaligned pairs. ABox's collection of semantically linked resources, as well as TBox's concepts or properties, specifies an instance at sufficient depth to identify instances in a different location or with entirely different designations. Therefore, our proposed method collects all linked information from a particular instance as a reference point. The linked information is defined as concepts, properties or their values that are directly related to the reference instance, and is referred to a semantic left cloud."}, {"heading": "5.3. Instance Matching Algorithm", "text": "The strength of our instance matching algorithm mainly depends on the efficiency of generating SLC and adapting the ontological schema. The algorithm in Fig.1 represents a simple flow of the matching algorithm, because an SLC of an instance is matched with each SLC of instances of the knowledge base (lines 1 to 4 in Fig.1) if and only if there is an aligned concept between block (ins1.type) and block (ins2.type) (as there is a condition in line 5 in Fig.1). Block (concept) is a related concept block and generateSLC (ins, ab) collects an SLC against an instance in ABox. An SLC usually contains concepts, properties and their consolidated values. Each value of an SLC is compared with that of another SLC (starting from line 6 of Fig.1) by affinity measurements in Fig.1."}, {"heading": "5.4.

"abstractText": "The proliferation of heterogeneous data sources of semantic knowledge base intensifies the need of an automatic instance matching technique. However, the efficiency of instance matching is often influenced by the weight of a property associated to instances. Automatic weight generation is a non-trivial, however an important task in instance matching technique. Therefore, identifying an appropriate metric for generating weight for a property automatically is nevertheless a formidable task. In this paper, we investigate an approach of generating weights automatically by considering hypotheses: (1) the weight of a property is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of its distinct values to the number of instances contain the property, and (2) the weight is also proportional to the ratio of the number of distinct values of a property to the number of instances in a training dataset. The basic intuition behind the use of our approach is the classical theory of information content that infrequent words are more informative than frequent ones. Our mathematical model derives a metric for generating property weights automatically, which is applied in instance matching system to produce re-conciliated instances efficiently. Our experiments and evaluations show the effectiveness of our proposed metric of automatic weight generation for properties in an instance matching technique.", "creator": "Microsoft Word"}}}
