Introduction", "text": "Bankruptcy is a situation in which a company is unable to meet its monetary obligations, resulting in legal threats. Corporate financial assets are sold to pay off the debt, resulting in huge financial losses for investors. Bankruptcy leads to reduced liquidity of capital and minimized financial improvement. According to World Bank data, the Indian government resolves insolvency in an average of 4.3 years [1]. There is a need to design effective strategies for predicting bankruptcy at an earlier stage to avoid a financial crisis. Bankruptcies can be predicted using mathematical techniques, hypothetical models, and soft computer techniques [2]. Mathematical techniques are primary methods of estimating bankruptcy based on financial indicators. These methods are based on single or multivariable models. Hypothetical models are developed to support the theoretical principles. These models are statistically very complex based on their assumptions. Therefore, compression technology is used in some of the financial decision-making networks to provide compression support."}, {"heading": "2. Background", "text": "Recently, several studies have been conducted that reflect the importance of soft computing techniques, and the studies and technologies implemented are briefly discussed hereinafter. 2.1. Machine Learning is commonly referred to as Knowledge Finding in Databases (KDD). Different learning algorithms are implemented to extract patterns from data. These algorithms can either be monitored or unsupervised. Supervised learning is used when the output of a function is already known. Unsupervised learning is used when the target function is not known. The general layout for machine learning processes is described below: Data Collection: Data related to the area in question is extracted from public platforms and data warehouses. The missing values are used in raw and unstructured formats. Therefore, measures must be taken to pre-process data. The initial data set is undergone for pre-processing. Pre-processing is performed to remove the maturers and modulators and to replace the missing values."}, {"heading": "2.2 Classification algorithms", "text": "In fact, it is that they are able to be in the position in which they are, and that they are able to be able to move, to move."}, {"heading": "3. Related Work", "text": "The development of mathematical and statistical models for forecasting bankruptcy was initiated by Beaver in 1960. [9] The study focused on the univariate analysis of various financial factors for detecting bankruptcy. An important development in this area was recognized by Altman, who developed a multivariate Z-score model with five variables [10]. The Z-score model is considered the standard model for estimating the likelihood of bankruptcy. Logistic regression was also initiated for assessing bankruptcy [11]. These techniques are considered standard estimates for predicting financial difficulties. However, these models represent statistical constraints that lead to their limitations. To overcome these constraints, predictions [12] and Logit models [13] for financial applications were implemented. In later years, neural networks were implemented to assess the distress in financial organizations [14, 15 and 16]. Neural networks are often subjected to overadjustments that lead to false predictions."}, {"heading": "4. Methodology", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1. Collection of Bankruptcy dataset", "text": "The qualitative bankruptcy data set was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [23] and comprised 250 instances based on 6 attributes. The output featured two classes of nominal types which described the instance as \"bankrupt\" (107 cases) or \"non-bankrupt\" (143 cases)."}, {"heading": "4.2. Feature Selection", "text": "The function-based algorithm selects the significant attributes based on the class value. If the attribute has a high correlation with the class variable and minimal correlation with other attributes of the dataset, it is assumed that it is a good attribute. If the attribute has a high correlation with the attributes, the characteristics selected after correlational analysis are subjected to data partitioning followed by the application of various machine learning algorithms. The dataset is split into Training (2 / 3 of the dataset) and Test Dataset (1 / 3 of the dataset). During the training phase, various classifiers are used to create an optimal model. The model is validated on the basis of the test set in the test phase. Once the dataset is separated, various learning algorithms are applied to the training dataset."}, {"heading": "4.4. Developing a predictive decision support system", "text": "The prediction system was implemented in the RStudio interface, a statistical programming toolkit. To develop the prediction system, several libraries were used, including \"gWidgets\" and \"RGtk2.\" The prediction system develops a model for evaluating the bankruptcy class for user input data. Predicted classes are compared with the actual class value from the data set to calculate the percentage of the failure forecast from the system. The prediction system estimates the likelihood of customer bankruptcy. It can be used as the first screening tool to strengthen a customer's standard assessment based on his practice. Methodology of this study is shown in Figure 1.5. Results and Discussions The bankruptcy data set used for this study is available at UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data set, which consists of six different features, is described in Figure 1. The distribution of the class is shown in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "5.2. Correlation based Attribute selection", "text": "The values of the individual descriptors were scaled as P = 1, A = 0.5, and N = 0, representing the range of positive, average, and negative values, and the method was repeated for all six attributes of the dataset. Pearson correlation filter was applied to the numerical dataset to remove the redundant characteristics with a threshold of 0.7. Analysis revealed that all six attributes were strongly correlated with the result variable. To confirm the results of the correlation, a different method was used to select the characteristics of the dataset, and the algorithm found results similar to the correlation, so all six attributes from the dataset were considered for the study. Figure 3 shows the correlation plot for the characteristics: The correlational plot illustrates the importance of each characteristic."}, {"heading": "5.3. Machine learning algorithms", "text": "The characteristics extracted from the previous step were subjected to various machine learning algorithms in R. The algorithms were initially applied to the training to develop predictive models, which were further evaluated using the test set. Each model's performance was assessed using different statistical parameters such as the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristics (ROC curve).The confusion matrix is a contingency table representing the performance of machine learning algorithms [24].It represents the relationship between the actual class result and the predicted class result based on the following four estimates: a) True positive (TP): The actual negative class result is predicted from the model as a negative class from the modelb) False positive (FP): The actual negative class result is predicted as a positive class result. It leads to type 1 error (FN) False negative (FN): The actual positive class result is predicted as a negative class result from the model."}, {"heading": "5.4. SVM based decision supportive system in R", "text": "Based on the accuracy of the previous step, it was seen that the support of vector-based classifiers outperformed other machine learning techniques; the classifier was implemented using the radial base function (RBF) kernel; it is also referred to as the Gaussian RBF kernel; the kernel representation creates a decision boundary for the nonlinear attributes in high-dimensional space; the attributes are converted into linear form by using this core function; an optimal hyperplane is constructed in the feature space by taking into account the inner product of the kernel; the hyperplane is considered optimal when it creates the largest gap from the input attributes into the target class; in addition, the C optimization and the gamma parameter aremargin are generated by generating a wider hyperplane, while the value of C as larger causes the system to be reworked as a hard margin; therefore, the value of C must be selected by balancing the soft and hard margin."}, {"heading": "5.5. Developing the prediction system as a package", "text": "The bankruptcy prediction system was encoded as a package in RStudio. Developed using the interdependent libraries \"devtools\" and \"roxygen2,\" the package can be downloaded by users on their local machines, followed by the installation and execution of the package in RStudio. Once the package is installed, users can run the bankruptcy prediction system based on their input data."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "The results suggest that machine learning can be used to predict a bankruptcy. To help financial organizations identify risk-oriented customers, a prediction system has been implemented that helps predict the bankruptcy of a customer record based on the SVM model."}, {"heading": "7.
