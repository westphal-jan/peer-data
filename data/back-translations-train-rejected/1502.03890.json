THE TUG-OF-WAR DYNAMICS", "text": "In the previous studies [4, 6] we proposed the dynamics of the tug of war (TOW). Let us consider the incompressible liquid in a cylinder, as in Fig. 2. Here, the variable Xk corresponds to the displacement of the terminal k from a starting position where k \u0442 {A, B}. If Xk is greater than 0, let us consider that the liquid k the machine. We used the following estimate Qk (k, A, B): Qk (t) = Nk (t) \u2212 (1 + \u03c9) Lk (t). (1) Here, Nk is the number of gaming machines up to the time t, and Lk is the number of unrewarded (i.e. failed) events in k up to the time t, where this movement is a weight parameter. The displacement XA (= \u2212 XB) is determined by the following difference equation: XA (t) \u2212 QB (t) \u2212 especially when the author adds a certain dynamic (TOW) to a given time."}, {"heading": "1.1. The Tug-of-War Principle", "text": "In this subsection, we derive the learning rules of TOW dynamics from a thought experiment, so that we can obtain the near-optimal weight parameter \u03c90. In many popular algorithms, such as the greedy algorithm, an estimate of the reward probability is updated only in a selected arm. In contrast, we consider the case that the sum of the reward probabilities \u03b3 = PA + PB is given in advance. Then, we can update both estimates simultaneously as follows: A: NA \u2212 LA NAB: \u03b3 \u2212 LA NA, A: \u03b3 \u2212 LBNB B: NB \u2212 B: NB \u2212 LB NB. Here, the uppermost and bottom lines indicate the estimates based on the selection of A \u2212 and NB \u2212 times of selection of B. Any expected reward is based on NA \u2212 LA NA times, the selection of A and NB times of selection of B is as follows."}, {"heading": "2. THE TUG-OF-WAR BOMBE", "text": "Known as the \"tug-of-war (TOW) bomb,\" the 3-user (1, 2 and 3) and 5-channel (A, B, C, D and E) decision-making device is shown in Figure 3. Two types of incompressible fluid (red and blue) are filled in coupled cylinders; the red (bottom) fluid deals with \"user decision-making,\" while the blue (top) one handles \"user interaction,\" each user's channel selection in each iteration is determined by the height of a green adjuster (a liquid surface), and the highest channel is selected. As the movements of red and blue adjusters stabilize to achieve balance, the \"tug-of-war\" principle in red keeps fluid for each user. In other words, when one interface goes up, other four interfaces fall down, and efficient channel selections are achieved."}, {"heading": "3. RESULTS", "text": "To show that the TOW bomb certainly avoids the Nash equilibrium and regularly achieves an overall optimization, we consider a case where (PA, PB, PC, PD, PE) = (0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.9) is a typical example. A portion of the reward tensor that has 125 (= 53) elements is described as follows for the sake of simplicity; only matrix elements for which each user does not choose low ranking A and B are shown (Tables 2, 3 and 4). For each matrix element, the reward probabilities are given in the order of users 1, 2 and 3. \"The social maximum (SM)\" is a state in which the maximum amount of the total reward sum is not chosen by all users. In this problem, the social maximum corresponds to a \"segregation state\" in which users choose three different machines (C, D, E) or the six segregation states indicated by the tables."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION", "text": "We have shown that an analog decision instrument, the so-called TOW bomb, is physically implemented by using two types of incompressible fluid in coupled cylinders and achieving a general optimization of the channel assignment problem in cognitive radio. The TOW bomb enables the assignment problem for M users and N channels to be solved by repeating M-up-and-down operations of the fluid surfaces in the cylinders at each iteration; it does not require the calculation of exponentially many (O (NM)) evaluation values required when using a conventional digital computer. This suggests that an advantage of analog calculation persists even in today's digital age. The TOW bomb can also be implemented on the basis of quantum physics. In fact, the authors have used the optical energy transfer dynamics between quantum dots to construct the decision device based not only on our cognitive insights, but also on what we might expect to be a game problem [17]."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "We thank Prof. Masahiko Hara and Dr. Etsushi Nameda for valuable discussions and advice.
