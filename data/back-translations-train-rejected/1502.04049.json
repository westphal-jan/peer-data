Understanding and extracting information from EHR allows for reasoning with clinical variables and supports decision-making. Unstructured patient information is generated in the form of free text narratives. Structural data is typically collected in the form of demographics, patient names, and death sentences. Unstructured patient information is generated in the form of free text that is associated with time."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "The last decade has been marked by significant research into natural language processing (NLP) of unstructured clinical texts. 3,6-8 Fushman et al. 1 discuss how successful clinical narrative processing is in ensuring the overall success of automated clinical decision systems. They stress the importance of medical concepts using the named entities and learning relationships between the named entities for a better understanding of clinical narratives. Wang et al. 7 propose a framework for automated pharmacovigilance by applying NLP and association statistics to comprehensive unstructured clinical data from the EHR. They argue that current algorithms focus on coded and structured data, overlooking important clinical data relevant to this task."}, {"heading": "Patient Records and Clinical Trial Eligibility Criteria - Data Description", "text": "The EHR data used in this study includes the medical records of 2,060 CLL patients and 1,808 prostate cancer patients. The CLL data set contains 95 different types of unstructured reports, including omission reports, medical history and physical reports, specialist reports such as wound care, surgical notes, adrenal disease and mental evaluations, social work evaluations, referrals and progress notes. It also includes radiology reports, pathology reports and cardiology reports. The total number of unstructured clinical narratives in the CLL data set is 100,704. The structured data in this data set includes laboratory reports, procedure lists, diagnostic lists and hit lists. The prostate cancer data set includes 2,652 oncology reports, 1,582 pathology reports, 6,606 radiology reports as part of unstructured data. The structured data in this data set includes a list of 100 discharge medicines (1,708), 1,732 drug values, and one laboratory list each."}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to find a solution that is capable of finding a solution, that is able to find a solution, and that is able to find a solution that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution that extends, that is able to find a solution that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, that is able to find a solution, in order to find a solution that is able to find a solution."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The aforementioned cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated in the cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated in the cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated in the cerebral consecrated cerebral consecrated teeeteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeec\u00fcuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuiuirrrrrrrrrrsrsrsrrrsrsrrsrsrsrsrsrsrsrrsrsrrrsrsrsrrsrsrsrsrsrsrsrsrsrsrsrnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn"}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "We examined two sets of patient data - CLL and prostate cancer - and assessed the usefulness of structured versus unstructured data in recruiting for appropriate clinical trials. We observed that the type of structured data, its granularity, and the information available differ from patient data sets. While the CLL patient data set has detailed structured data in the form of diagnostic lists, hit lists, procedures, and laboratory data, the prostate cancer data set has limited structured data, consisting largely of drug lists and laboratory data. More fundamentally, the data reflect underlying tumor heterogeneity at multiple levels, which include: (1) patient referral patterns of disease treatment (3) and differences in disease stages. At OSU James Cancer Hospital, most prostate receptor patients tend to be at the referral level of oncologists or urologists."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We observed that unstructured data is critical to solving approval criteria in 59% of CLL studies and 77% of prostate cancer studies. We also demonstrated the need for cross-document learning of time relations and information fusion between structured and unstructured data sources. Although structured data is useful for solving certain criteria, it is limited by the granularity of the information and the structured data type. Structured data is therefore best suited for the initial implementation of EHR data to eliminate a criterion based on the presence or absence of a specific laboratory test or diagnosis prior to a more nuanced second run of unstructured data. Furthermore, improving the scope of structured data in the EHR would improve its ability to be used as a recruitment tool for clinical trials."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The project was supported by Award Number Grant R01LM011116 from the National Library of Medicine 04 / 2011.
