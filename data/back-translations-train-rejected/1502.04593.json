More specifically, the decision maker changes the consequence (or evaluation) of an alternative on an attribute and compensates for this change with a preferred identical change on another attribute.

A simple way of explaining it would use the calculated utility functions and issue them to the decision-maker. The difficulty of this approach is two-fold: First, commodities are fundamentally not normalized because they provide values on different scales, so it is not always easy to interpret them. A simple way to solve this problem is to impose the extreme values on each attribute, which is the fact that valuations can be compared on different criteria. More specifically, criteria should not be met at all for each minimal element of the attributes, and criteria should be fully met for each maximum element of the attributes, which amounts to transforming the additive utility model into a weighted sum in which the commodities are normalized and each criterion is assigned a weight."}, {"heading": "4.1 Explanations based on preference swaps", "text": "The idea of the explanation is somewhat different from the explanation of the swap method (see section 2.2), which is an interactive process that aims to create a sequence of different types of swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap-swap"}, {"heading": "4.2 Low order preference swaps", "text": "Although we have defined Ek for a general index k, we will henceforth consider only the case k = 2.

For example, increasing the speed of the communication channel improves throughput in the system but reduces its reliability. Thus, the speed of this channel is a trade-off point.
