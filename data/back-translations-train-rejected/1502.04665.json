First, the only focus on the workflow ignores the informational context in which the workflow is carried out. Second, the traditional approach of defining workflows turns out to be too rigid, burdened by excessive constraints, while in reality the actors who carry out the workflow are still able to break it, while the last point can also be applied to planning."}, {"heading": "2 Dynamic Knowledge Base", "text": "The Dynamic Knowledge Bases (or DKBs) are, in short, dynamic systems (more precisely, transition systems) in which the states are constituted by DL-Lite knowledge bases consisting of a TBox and an ABox, and a series of actions that further develop the system by modifying the ABox: it follows that the TBox is fixed, while the ABox makes changes by not allowing functional roles, nor allows attributes. The ABox is a finite series of assertions, i.e. atomic formulas of the form C (i) and R (i), in which C is an atomic concept, and i, is an individual constant defined by a particular universe."}, {"heading": "3 Example", "text": "We present an example that is based on a manufacturing company that manufactures electronic goods and, as in a typical situation, has different product assembly lines and a warehouse. Through the TBox T we model the structure of the company, the graphic Figure 1: solid arrows corresponds to the hierarchy of concepts, while the dashed lines indicate the inconsistency of concepts. It is a relatively simple TBox in which we represent different types of workers (the concept worker and its sub-concepts assemblyman and warehouse), the products put together by the company (cellphone and tablet concepts) and some product characteristics (such as crack to denote a product that is ready for shipment, and Stocked when it is placed in warehouse). The intial ABox A0 contains the following assertions: A0 = {assemblyman (e1), Warehouse (e1), Warehouse (e2), Parts (e2), Parts (p1), Parts (c1, parts (we), Worpy (1), we define the product (we), Stopy (1), Parts (1) (we)."}, {"heading": "4 Optimizations", "text": "Considering the specifications of a DKB, few details arise that pose a problem in order to achieve our goal. First, we consider only the totality of the knowledge available at a given time. Although such a condition is necessary to assess the consistency of the overall system, it limits us to work with details that may not be of immediate interest. In decision-making [Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier, 2011], \"heuristics is a strategy that ignores a portion of the information, with the goal of making decisions faster, more economical and / or more accurate than more complex methods.\" For our framework to be used for such strategies, it must be able to work with partial information so that users can focus on a selected subset of knowledge. This goal is crucial when we are dealing with systems described by complex ontologies and composed of millions (if not more) instances. In order to fulfill these goals, we must constitute a transition from the two types of system to the one, not the optimization, and the two types of system to the transition."}, {"heading": "4.1 Action Rewriting", "text": "In the actual specification of a DKB (and also in the framework condition Knowledge and Action Bases [Hariri et al., 2013]), actions could lead to inconsistent states.

An abstract ABox A is a finite set of non-earth facts, i.e., atomic formulas of the form C (x) and R (x, x), where C is a role name, and x \"variables taken from a countably infinite (object) universe of variables (note that here we are allowing C and R to be non-atomic, since it should be in a normal DL-LiteA ABox instead)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Abstract Transition System Properties", "text": "After we have said that the abstract transition system from A to D is an abstraction from A to A, we look for the exact relationship between the two.

Such a framework, called Dynamic Knowledge Bases, is represented by a transitional system in which states are defined by a DL-Lite knowledge base and in which a series of actions allow the system to evolve by adding or removing assertions, along with the ability to introduce new instances. The expressive power and argumentation services of description logic are very helpful in describing and managing domain knowledge, but represent a difficult environment for us to deal with in terms of processes. To address this problem, we introduce two optimizations, namely the rewriting of actions and the abstraction of the transition system in the context of a Dynamic Knowledge Base: These optimizations give us a framework in which we can work with partial knowledge and in which the box does not require a solution, which still guarantees that the framework is more relevant to the decision-making aspect."}], "references": [{"title": "Verification of Golog programs over description logic actions", "author": ["Baader", "Zarrie\u00df", "2013] Franz Baader", "Benjamin Zarrie\u00df"], "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),", "citeRegEx": "Baader et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baader et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Business Process Management", "author": ["Kamal Bhattacharya", "Cagdas Gerede", "Richard Hull.
