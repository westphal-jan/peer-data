Approaches to Reordering in Statistical Machine Translation", "text": "A first important distinction must be made between word reordering performed as part of the decoding process (Sections 2.1 to 2.3) and word reordering performed before or after it as a monolingual task decoupled from the bilingual translation task (Section 2.4). Within the former, we further distinguish between string-based (sequential) approaches and tree-based (structured) approaches. String-based SMT (Sections 2.1 and 2.2) treats translation as a sequential task: The target sentence is constructed from left to right while the input units are visited in different sequences and no dependencies other than those of word adjacency are taken into account. Subsequently, the problem decomposition is applied to the target string: an optimal translation is sought for each prefix of the target translation, while the shortest to longest sentence of the input unit is taken into account, while the SMT-based difference between the text units (Section 2.3) declares the existence of a tree structure adjacent to the translation."}, {"heading": "2.1 Phrase-based SMT", "text": "\"It's about being able to put ourselves at the top,\" he says."}, {"heading": "2.2 Other string-based SMT approaches", "text": "N-gram based SMT (Casacuberta and Vidal 2004; Mari\u00f1o et al. 2006) is a string-based alternative to PSMT. Within this framework, smoothed n-gram models are learned about sequences of minimal translation units (so-called tuples), which, like phrase pairs, contain word sequences extracted from verbatim parallel sentences. However, tuples are typically shorter than phrase pairs and can only be achieved by treating the large block (jdd... AlsAds) as a single tupel. Segmentation of spurious phrases is avoided, but non-local reordering becomes a problem. In Figure 2, monotonic phrase segmentation can only be achieved by treating the large block."}, {"heading": "2.3 Tree-based SMT", "text": "In recent years, it has been shown that the problem is a global problem, and not only a global problem, but also a global problem that has developed in recent years.

Thus, Figure 6 treelet pair (3) determines the interchange of jdd and AlEAhl, but says nothing about the order of dEm, which is also a child of jdd. Therefore, when decoding all possible reordering of the non-matching children, it takes into account and evaluates by a separate discrimination model trained to predict the position of a child node (or modifier m) relative to its head h. This model is implemented as a decision tree, whose characteristics (i) of the non-matching children are largely identical elements of the target node, im and im space, where the pair are large node and im."}, {"heading": "2.4 Word Reordering as Pre- (or Post-) Processing", "text": "Given the complexity of word reordering during the decoding process, a productive line of research has focused on the decoupling of word reordering decisions from translation decisions. These approaches aim to arrange the starting sentence in a targeted order before or after the translation. Thus, word reordering techniques are solved as pre- or post-processing (i.e. pre-ordering or post-ordering approaches as opposed to standard SMTs). Many other pre-ordering strategies have been proposed: Deterministic preordering aims to find an optimal reordering for each input judgment, which is then translated monotonically or with a low distortion limit."}, {"heading": "1.56, 0.76, and 2.77 points in BLEU, respectively,", "text": "The rest of this work is organized as follows: Section 2 describes briefly summarized studies on the reordering problem and other related technologies known as post-editing. Section 3 details the proposed method, using Japanese translation as a test case. Section 4 reports on our experiments and discusses the results. Section 5 concludes this paper with our prospects for future work. Section 3 Related work is both a theoretically and practically challenging problem in SMT. In the early stages of SMT studies, reordering is modeled by distance-based constraints in translation models (Brown et al., 1993; Koehn et al., 2003). This reordering model is simple and also works in language pairs that are relatively similar to French-English. Distance-based reordering of words is not useful in some language pairs such as English-Japanese because they are very different word orders and appropriate reordering of words and phrases highly dependent on their synchronisms."}, {"heading": "3. Evaluating Word Reordering in Statistical Machine Translation", "text": "There are innumerable ways to accurately represent the meaning of a source sentence in the target language. In general, SMT systems are judged by the extent to which their results resemble a series of reference translations produced by different human translators. Although they rely on a very rough approximation of language variability, this approach provides SMT researchers with fast automatic metrics that can at least partially guide them toward improvement. In addition, rapid evaluation metrics are used to automatically match SMT characteristics to a development corpus, for example, through minimal error rate training procedures (Och 2003). The design of MT evaluation metrics that correlate with human judgement is an active area of research. We briefly have two widely used general metrics, BLEU and METEOR, and then describe in more detail a number of reclassification specific metrics (Papineni et al 2001)."}, {"heading": "4. Reordering Phenomena in Natural Languages", "text": "In order to select and improve the right SMT models, it is essential to understand the complexity of the reordering of words in natural languages (Birch, Osborne and Koehn 2008; Birch, Blunsom and Osborne 2009). While it is certainly important to measure the extent of the reordering of words, it is also essential to understand what types of reordering occur in a particular language pair. To this end, we present a qualitative analysis of the reordering of words based on linguistic knowledge. More specifically, we draw on a large amount of syntactical information gathered by linguists from more than 1500 languages and systematized in the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) (Dryer and Haspelmath 2011). Following the pioneering work of linguist Matthew S. Dryer, we describe the word ordering profile of a language based on the canonical ordering of its components (word ordering features)."}, {"heading": "4.1 A qualitative analysis", "text": "The amount of word reordering found in a language pair is known to be a good predictor of the performance of YY. Birch, Osborne and Koehn (2008) looked at three variables - the reordering of quantity, morphological complexity, and historical relationships - and found that the first had the highest correlation with the BLEU values of a standard PSMT17 http: / / wals.infoA. Bisazza and M. Federico A Survey of Word Reordering in SMTsystem on a sample of 110 European language pairs. Birch, Blunsom, and Osborne (2009) further analyzed the distribution of different sort widths in Arabic-English and Chinese-English, and the ability of two SMT approaches to model them. They found that the PSMT approach is more suitable for language pairs where most reordering is local (Arabic-English), while the hierarchical approach is stronger when mid-term reordering (Chinese-English)."}, {"heading": "Literal translation:", "text": "Bush, 55, assured reporters before leaving the White House that he was feeling \"great\" and that his health was \"very good.\""}, {"heading": "Human translation:", "text": "Before leaving the White House, the 55-year-old Bush assured reporters that he was feeling \"great\" and that his health was \"very good.\" As Fox (2002) noted, this kind of reorganization is not strictly necessary to produce precise and fluent translations, but its occurrence in parallel corpora influences automatic reordering standards. On the contrary, qualitative analysis can benefit from the extensive work done by linguists and grammars to abstract the basic characteristics of a language. In this section, we mainly base ourselves on Dryer (2007) and on the sections of the WALS devoted to the Rules of the Word (Dryer (2011), chapters 81-97, 143-144)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Word order profiles", "text": "The word order profile of a language is determined by the canonical order of its components (word order characteristics). Generally, the basic or canonical order of a component group can be determined by criteria of frequency (i.e., the most common), distribution (the least restricted use), or pragmatism (the neutral). Although some languages are supposed to have a free (or flexible) order, it is often possible to recognize a dominant and neutral one. Consider English, a subject-verb-object language (SVO) in which other orders are used, but only to achieve specific emphasis or topicalization effects: (1) a. I saw the cat, I said. A. Bisazza and M. Federico A Survey of Word Reordering in SMTHowever, there are cases where no particular order can be defined as dominant.

For example, English and French are SVO languages, while Turkish is SOV. Distribution of main word order types in a large number of world languages is shown in Table 4. This feature is often used solely to denote the word order profile of a language, because it can be a good predictor for several other features.
