At the lowest level of such a framework, we use DSmT for information fusion, which produces not only more realistic beliefs, but also more reliable pignistic probabilities for the underlying theses. The second layer performs the pignistic probability, BetP {.}, calculation. Such BetP {.} is used for the integration of information fusion with the Bayesian network occupying the third layer. Such architecture provides probabilistic conclusions and enables decision-making on the basis of both belief-based probabilities for the underlying theses and Bayesian-based probabilities for the corresponding reasons Figure (1). Indeed, the proposed framework of probability is based on the highest probability structure, which can be answered freely on the observation of the highest probability structure."}, {"heading": "2- Related Work", "text": "Information fusion (IF) is defined as the combination of data from different sources that produce a result superior to that of a single source. Typically, results include an improvement in accuracy, greater confidence through supplementary information, or improved performance in the presence of countermeasures [Blasch et al., 2002]. IF can occur on several levels [Klein, 2004]. Sensor fusion is the level at which relevant data is extracted from the output signal. Characteristic fusion is the combination of data to create a composite feature vector that characterizes the object under test. Decision fusion is the layer that provides a projection of a future state of the object based on the provided feature vector, and the information presented to an operator to facilitate a human decision."}, {"heading": "2.1 Military systems", "text": "The work of [Krenc et al., 2009] presents experiences related to a combination of two opposing approaches to information fusion: the first is typically deterministic ontology fusion and the second is based on the evidence theory of Dezert and Smarandache (DSmT). Therefore, a concept for combining these two approaches was presented and a comparison between hard decision fusion, DSmT fusion and a combination of DSmT and ontological fusion algorithms was established. [Sumari et al., 2008] authors have designed and implemented a hierarchical, multi-agent-based information fusion system for decision-making, which is implemented by basing a maximum number of points on the sum of common probabilities and carried out by a collection of information fusion agents (IFA) that form a multi-agent system.

The layer for calculating faith combinations and information fusion. b. The layer to determine the corresponding pignistic probability.

Nowadays, there is an opportunity to access an increasing amount of information and, in some cases, to use all this information to make an informed and successful decision. The goal of top-level information fusion is to provide effective decision-making tools in situations. In this paper, this problem is addressed by introducing a framework concept to facilitate decisions based on computed beliefs through information fusion and belief theory. The basic elements of the underlying framework are presented as follows: 1) Given: The basic beliefs of the underlying hypotheses. 2) Use: An information fusion agent to obtain hypothetical beliefs, m (.) from the available data using DSmT, taking into account the limitations that include: Calculation of the underlying beliefs {P} from the beliefs {P} (X) (= P)."}, {"heading": "4- The architecture of the proposed framework", "text": "The proposed framework aims to turn the corresponding events (effects) into a cause.
