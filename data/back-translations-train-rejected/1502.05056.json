Generally, it is known that the MWUA dynamic leads to a decreasing regret over time [Jafari et al., 2001; Blum and Mansour, 2007; Kale, 2007; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2007], but generally does not lead to a Nash equilibrium of the game.

Similar results have been shown for concave games [Even-Dar et al., 2009]. Since identical games are both potential games and concave games, and since we have for small games that Hedge and PW are essentially the same, these results apply to our environment. This means that under any RS and SR dynamics the population converges to a stable state, for a sufficiently low degree of selection.

First, they restrict attention to a particular class of fitness landscape where weak selection holds.

The game is an identical interest game, where each player gets the same utility\u2014 thus the joint distribution of alleles corresponds to the mixed strategy of each player, and the expected payoff of the game corresponds to the average fitness level of the population.

Specifically, we consider the two standard population dynamics (where recombination acts before selection (RS), and vice versa (SR)), and show that each of them precisely describes the marginal allele distribution under a variation of the multiplicative updates algorithm that is described for correlated strategies. This correspondence holds for any number of genes/players, any fitness matrix, any recombination rate, and any initial population frequencies. In particular, and in contrast to Chastain et al., we do not assume weak selection or require the population distribution remains a product distribution (i.e., with allele probabilities that are independent), and we allow both the SR model and the RS model. We discuss some of the implications of this correspondence between these biological and algorithmic processes for theoretical convergence properties. Under weak selection, the observation that the cumulative regret of every gene is bounded follows immediately from known convergence results, both in population dynamics and in game theory (see related work). We show that under the SR dynamics, every gene still has a bounded cumulative regret, without assuming weak selection or a product distribution. Our analysis also uncovers what we view as one technical gap and one conceptual gap regarding the fine details in the original argument of Chastain et al. [2014].
