When someone searches for only one form of a name, neither exact nor approximate matching is appropriate for returning the multiple variants of the name. Exact matching requires the user to enter all forms of the name for the search, and approximate matching yields names not among the variations of the one being sought. In this paper, we attempt to solve the problem with a dictionary of all Arabic names mapped to their different (alternative) writing forms. We generated alternatives based on rules we derived from reviewing the first names of 9.9 million citizens and former citizens of Jordan. This dictionary can be used for both standardizing the written form when inserting a new name into a database and for searching for the name and all its alternative written forms. Creating the dictionary automatically based on rules resulted in at least 7% erroneous acceptance errors and 7.9% erroneous rejection errors. We addressed the errors by manually editing the dictionary. The dictionary can be of help to real world-databases, with the qualification that manual editing does not guarantee 100% correctness.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Feb 2015 23:16:00 GMT  (766kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05441v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["ahmad b a hassanat", "ghada awad altarawneh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.05441"}, "pdf": {"name": "1502.05441.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Rule- and dictionary-based solution for variations in written Arabic names in social networks, big data, accounting systems, and large databases", "authors": ["Ahmad B.

Conclusion", "text": "In this work, we are introducing a new dictionary of Jordanian first names and their different spellings to be used by system developers, database administrators and researchers to solve the problem of several alternative written forms of names in Arabic. The problem becomes more complicated when databases are searched for such names. We created the dictionary by applying rules that govern why and how different forms of the same Arabic name are created. Due to different types of errors and different reasons for problems, we had to edit the dictionary manually to eliminate errors. During our review, we identified a number of reasons for errors, such as misspellings and typos introduced by data recorders, as well as inconsistent rendering of compound names. Therefore, we encourage database administrators to train data recorders not only in how to use the system, but also, and more importantly, how to spell the dictionary correctly."}], "references": [{"title": "Algorithms for Romanizing Arabic names", "author": ["M.
