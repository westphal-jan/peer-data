Most of this literature is about methods based on supervised learning, i.e., methods for training an information extraction system from manually annotated examples. While a lot of work has been devoted to devising learning methods that generate more and more accurate information extractors, no work has been devoted to investigating the effect of the quality of training data on the learning process. Low quality in training data often derives from the fact that the person who has annotated the data is different from the one against whose judgment the automatically annotated data must be evaluated. In this paper we test the impact of such data quality issues on the accuracy of information extraction systems as applied to the clinical domain. We do this by comparing the accuracy deriving from training data annotated by the authoritative coder (i.e., the one who has also annotated the test data, and by whose judgment we must abide), with the accuracy deriving from training data annotated by a different coder. The results indicate that, although the disagreement between the two coders (as measured on the training set) is substantial, the difference is (surprisingly enough) not always statistically significant.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Feb 2015 06:04:40 GMT  (911kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05472v1", "12 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 4 Mar 2015 08:08:49 GMT  (933kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05472v2", "Submitted for publication"]], "COMMENTS": "12 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["diego marcheggiani", "fabrizio sebastiani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.05472"}, "pdf": {"name": "1502.05472.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["FABRIZIO SEBASTIANI"], "emails": ["permissions@acm.org."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Article Xiv: 150 2.05 472v 2 [cs.L G] 4M ar2 015AA: 1The addresses of the author: Diego Marcheggiani, Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, 56124 Pisa, Italy; Fabrizio Sebastiani, Qatar Computing Research Institute, Qatar Foundation, PO Box 5825, Doha, Qatar.

Our contribution", "text": "In this paper, we are testing the impact of training data on the accuracy of information systems as applied in practice. We are doing this by testing the accuracy of two state-of-the-art systems on a dataset of radiology reports (originally published in [Esuli et al. 2013]) in which a portion of the data is commented on by two different experts. In other words, we are trying to answer the question: \"What is the consequence of the fact that my training data is not stereotypical? that the coders that produced it are not fully elastic? How much will I lose in terms of the accuracy of the trained system?\""}, {"heading": "2.

Information extraction from clinical documents", "text": "Most work on information extraction from clinical documents is based on methods based on supervised learning, i.e. methods for training an information extraction system from manually annotated examples. Supporting vector machines (SVMs - [Jiang et al. 2011; Li et al. 2008; Sibanda et al. 2006]), hidden Markov models (HMMs - [Li et al. 2010]), and (in particular) random conditional fields (CRFs - [Esuli et al. 2013; Gupta et al. 2014; Jiang et al. 2011; Jonnalagadda et al. 2012; Li et al. 2008; Patrick and Li 2010; Torii et al. 2011; Wang and Patrick 2009]) were the preferred learners in this field due to their good performance and the existence of publicly available implementations. In recent years, research on the analysis of clinical texts has been further boosted by the existence of \"common tasks\" on this topic, such as the Uzundifor Epynology Study Bezal (Bezal)."}, {"heading": "2.2.

We dub | x | the length of the text. Let C = {c1, cm} be a predefined set of terms (a.k.a. tags or markers), or markers that stand between the labels xt2."}, {"heading": "3.2. Dataset", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where there is only one person who is able to establish himself in the region."}, {"heading": "3.3. Learning algorithms", "text": "Since the learning algorithms we have used in this paper have not been able to locate another time-mixed database protocol containing clinical texts that are not publicly available (LC-CRFs - [Lafferty et al. 2001; Sutton and McCallum 2007; Sutton and McCallum 2012]), in Charles Sutton's GRMM implementation7, and hidden Markov support vector machines (HM-SVMs - [Altun et al. 2003]), in Thorsten Joachim's SVMhmm implementation8. Both are supervised learning algorithms explicitly designed for sequence labeling, i.e. for learning to label elements that occur naturally in sequences and such that the labeling of an element depends on the characteristics and / or on the labels of other elements that precede or follow that sequence (which is actually the case for the text in a token)."}, {"heading": "3.4. Evaluation measures", "text": "3.4.1. Classification Accuracy. As a measure of classification accuracy, similar to [Esuli et al = 2013], we use the token and delimiter variant (proposed in [Esuli and Sebastiani 2010]) of the well-known formula 1, according to which an information extraction system is evaluated on an event space consisting of all t units in the text. In other words, each t unit xt (rather than every mention, as in the traditional \"segmentation phenomenon F-Score\" model, counts as true positive, true negative, false positive or false negative for a given concept cr, depending on whether xt belongs to cr or not. This model has the advantage of recognizing a system for partial success (i.e., degree of overlap between a predicted mention and a true mention for the same concept), and penalizing both over-annotation."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1. Experimental protocol", "text": "In [Esuli et al. 2013] the experiments on the UmbertoI (RadRep) dataset play two roles of Coder1. Each dataset was executed with either 1-only and / or 2-only (i.e. the parts of the data that only one encoder commented on) as training data and both (1) and / or both (2) (i.e. the part of the data that both encoders had recorded, in both versions) as test data. In this essay we alternate the roles of the training and test sets, i.e. we use both (1) and (2) as training set (since we need training data with multiple, alternative annotations for the purpose of this work) and only 1-only as a test set. Specifically, we perform two batch experiments, Batch1 and Batch2. In Batch1 Coder1 Coder1 plays the role of the authoritative encoder (C\u03b1) and Coder2 the role of the non-authoritative encoder (C\u03b2)."}, {"heading": "4.2. Results and discussion", "text": "This is not surprising and corresponds to a known pattern. In most cases, the effectiveness is microbiologically conditioned. In both cases, both the learners and the learners are affected by experiments, and together with the resulting intercoder match values. Figure 1 illustrates the results of our experiments by showing F1 as a function of the corruption ratio \u03bb, with LC-CRFs and HM-SVMs as a learning algorithm, each for both values showing the corresponding level of interannotator matches. (As averaged across the two charts), Figure 2 is also shown, rather than precision and recall as a function of the LC-CRFs experiments, while Figure 3 shows the same level of interannotator matches.) Macroaveraged values are lower than microaveraged than microaveraged. A first fact to be observed is that macroaveraged results (FM1) are always lower than the corresponding microaveraged results of the microaveraged results (F1)."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Few researchers have investigated the loss of accuracy that occurs when a supervised learning algorithm is fed with training data of sub-optimal quality. We have done this for the first time in the case of information extraction systems (trained through supervised learning), as applied to the collection of mentions of concepts of interest in medical notes. Specifically, we have tested the extent to which the extraction accuracy suffers when the person who commented on the test data (the \"authoritative coder\") whom we must assume is the person whose judgment we judge independently of their expertise, unlike the person who labeled the training data (the \"non-authoritative coders\"). Our experimental results, obtained on a dataset of 500 mammographic reports recorded according to 9 concepts of interest, are somewhat surprising, since they indicate that the resulting drop in accuracy is not always statistically significant."}], "references": [{"title": "Hidden Markov Support Vector Machines", "author": ["Yasemin Altun", "Ioannis Tsochantaridis", "Thomas Hofmann."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2003).
