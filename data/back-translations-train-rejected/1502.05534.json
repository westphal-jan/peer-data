In todays scenario devices like sensors are used for detection of infections. Accurate classification techniques are required for automatic identification of disease samples. In this context, this study utilizes data mining approaches for classification of liver patients from healthy individuals. Four algorithms (Naive Bayes, Bagging, Random forest and SVM) were implemented for classification using R platform. Further to improve the accuracy of classification a hybrid NeuroSVM model was developed using SVM and feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN). The hybrid model was tested for its performance using statistical parameters like root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The model resulted in a prediction accuracy of 98.83%. The results suggested that development of hybrid model improved the accuracy of prediction.

Pre-processing and Feature selection", "text": "The missing values, together with their instances, were replaced by a zero value, followed by a feature selection to identify relevant attributes for classification. The feature selection was done using both filter and winding methods. First, the attributes with a correlation of more than 70% were removed from the data set by correlation analysis, followed by the feature selection using the library \"Boruta\" in R. The algorithm was implemented on the basis of random forests to estimate the importance of different features in a data set [17]."}, {"heading": "3.3. Randomization and splitting of dataset", "text": "First, the data set was randomized to obtain any permutated sample, then the data set was divided into training sets (70% of the data set) and test sets (30%), the training set comprised 389 instances and the test set comprised the remaining 194 instances."}, {"heading": "3.4. Classification algorithms", "text": "The algorithm is based on the Bayes Conditional Probability Theorem. The algorithm assumes that each attribute contributes to the overall result regardless of other attributes [18].3.4.2. Bagging: They are used for decision trees to reduce the rate of overhaul. Sampling and replacement is used to generate a new training set from the given input training set. The obtained bootstrap sample is equipped with models that use the selection scheme for classification. The algorithm is considered an average scheme for random decision trees. Breiman developed the algorithm."}, {"heading": "3.5. Development of hybrid model", "text": "The hybrid model was developed to further increase the accuracy of prediction of liver disease. SVM classification was better than other algorithms. SVM was implemented in the hybrid model in conjunction with an artificial neural network. A neural feed network was fed the SVM classifier.

It is a wrapper-based feature selector algorithm that calculates the meaning of each attribute by permutation; the attributes deemed important after repeated iteration are selected by the algorithm in order of precedence; the attributes selected by the algorithm are shown in Table 2; the graph derived from Boruta after the feature selection is shown in Fig. 2.Sl.

Development of hybrid model", "text": "The hybrid model for the assessment of liver disease was created with the help of neural networks. SVM prediction results were fed into an artificial neural feed network consisting of 2 input layers, 5 hidden layers and an output layer. Neural networks were inspired by neurons in the brain. The network is represented as a weighted graph with nodes and edges. The input function is represented by xj in such a way that j = 1, 2.... n. The output function is calculated according to the formula: nj uwjxjy 1 equation (1) Here y = output function wj = weights for input j xj = input function u = threshold function \u03b8 = unit-step function The algorithm calculates output class and network for input evaluated on the basis of the allocated weights.
