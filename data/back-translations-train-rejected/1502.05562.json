If a property P is inaccurate, its negation P is considered inaccurate. Fuzzy set theory assumes that P and P are related, namely:) (1) (xPxP). However, this is not always true in real life. Therefore, P and P are sometimes represented independently of each other. On the other hand, fuzzy sets do not allow consideration of the presence of objects whose degree of affiliation P is undefined. Three estimated logic can solve the problem by allowing three logical values: true, false, and undefined. However, this is not always sufficient, and we can find contradictions when confirming a certain value x P and P at the same time. Fourthly evaluated logic can solve the problem because it uses four logical values: true, false, undefined, and contradictory. There is a rejection P for some values of x. In this situation, we can represent the knowledge defined on the basis of a defined penta-logical basis, unlogic-accurately defined."}, {"heading": "2 The Fuzzy Set and Its Extension", "text": "Within the framework of the Zadeh theory [10], both functions define a division of the unit, namely: 1 AA (2,1) Atanasov has extended the fuzzy sets to the intuitionistic fuzzy sets [1].
