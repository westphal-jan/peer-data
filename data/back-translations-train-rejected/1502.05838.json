Different kinds of deontic logic are considered for different fields of application such as argumentation theory, legal logic, and actions in multi-agent systems. [8] This paper applies automated thinking in standard deontic logic (SDL) to a problem in multi-agent systems. To this end, we follow the example from [5], where argumentation is presented with ethical codes. Instead of directly implementing an argumentation system for deontic logic, we rely on the first-order argumentation system Hyper [14], which uses the hypertableau calculation from [3]. This has the advantage that argumentation in deontic logic can easily be embedded in other applications for which Hyper is already an inference system (e.g. the LogAnswer system [6]). SDL corresponds to modal logic with a serial logic with a less logical solution (the fact that SDL can be more dexurized)."}, {"heading": "2 Automated Reasoning for Standard Deontic Logic", "text": "In this logic, the -operator is a short version of [7]. It is interpreted by the DFG grants FU 263 / 15-1 and STO 421 / 5-1 as \"Ratiolog.\" 2 as \"it is compulsory that\" and the other as \"it is permitted that.\" The -operator can be defined by SDL. The seriality of the axioms in SDL states that if one formula must be held in all attainable worlds, there is such a world. Deontic reading of and that is: If the formula P exists, then there is a world in which there is always a world in which there is a world that is ideal in the sense that all standards are formulated."}, {"heading": "Reasoning Tasks", "text": "Hyper allows us to solve the following interesting puzzles: Consistency testing of normative systems: In practice, normative systems can be very large, so it is not easy to tell whether a given normative system is consistent; the hypertheory tester can be used to check the consistency of a normative system N. Assessment of normative systems: In the face of multiple normative systems, we use Hyper to find out for which normative system a desired result is guaranteed."}, {"heading": "3 An Example from Multi-agent Systems", "text": "In multi-agent systems, there is a challenging field of research, namely the formalization of \"robot ethics,\" which aims to define formal rules for the behavior of agents and to prove certain characteristics. Let's take as an example Asimov's laws, which aim to regulate the relationship between robots and humans. In [5], the authors describe a small example of two operating robots that obey ethical codes for their work. These codes are expressed by means of MADL, an extension of standard deontic logic with two operators. In [10] an axiomatization of MADL is given. Furthermore, it is claimed that MADL does not differ significantly from standard deontic logic. Therefore, we use SDL as an example."}, {"heading": "Formalization in SDL", "text": "In our example, there are two robots ag1 and ag2 in a hospital. For the sake of simplicity, each robot can perform a specific act: ag1 can terminate a person's life support and ag2 can delay the delivery of pain medication. In [5], four different ethical codes J, J, O and O are considered: - \"If the ethical code J holds, then the robot ag1 should delay the delivery of pain medication.\" This is formalized as: J \u2192 Act (ag1, term). - \"If the ethical code J holds, then the code J, then the robot ag2 should take care that the delivery of pain medication is not delayed.\" (ag1) This is formalized as: J \u2022 J \u2022 \u2192 Act (ag2, delay) - \"if the ethical code O holds, then the robot ag2 should take care that the delivery of pain medication is not delayed.\""}, {"heading": "Reduction to a Satisfiability Test", "text": "One possible query would be whether the most desirable result (+!!) will occur if the code of ethics is O-shaped. This query can be translated into a satisfaction test. If N-O-shaped (+!!) is not satisfactory, then the code of ethics O-shaped provides the result (+!!) Hyper can be used for this satisfaction test. We get the desired result, namely that (only) the code of ethics O-shaped leads to the most desirable behavior (+!!)."}, {"heading": "Experiment", "text": "We formalized this example and tested it with the hyper-theorem tester described above. As all formalizations are available in ALC, we used the Pellet Description Logic Argumentator [13] to compare performance with Hyper. Pellet took 2,548 seconds and Hyper 2,596 seconds to demonstrate dissatisfaction; further experiments can be found in [7]. For the examples we looked at, the runtimes of Pellet and Hyper are comparable; further studies and comparisons with other modal and / or description logic argumentation tools are required and subject to future work.5"}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we illustrated with an example how to use standard deontic logic to model ethical codes for multi-agent systems. For normative systems described with deontic logic, there is a translation into concepts of descriptive logic. These concepts can be automatically verified by automated theory testers. We used the theory tester Hyper to prove that a certain desired result is guaranteed when a certain ethical code is effective."}], "references": [{"title": "KED: A deontic theorem prover", "author": ["A.
