Random Forests Analysis", "text": "In our results it is clear that we can build a good model for distinguishing debtors from non-debtors, but building a more reliable and accurate model that predicts the level of debt requires deeper and more complex research. Of the two-tier models Random Forests showed the best performance. More precisely, the model achieves an accuracy of 72%, 70% sensitivity (true positive rate) and 74% specificity (true negative rate). Random Forests also provide an opportunity to assess the variable meaning by using the mean decline of the Gini index as a measure. Gini Index measures the impurity of the data and therefore the attribute that causes the greatest decrease in impurity is considered as a significant predictor. Looking at the values of this measure, which are summarized in descriptive statistics of Table 6, we can find that more than the 75% of the attributes that have a measured meaning, which is less than the mean importance of all the attributes, are the mean importance of all the attributes."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we examined the multi-layered nature of consumer debt in a complete and detailed socio-economic dataset containing psychological information. After identifying and verifying the psychological factors in the dataset, we proceeded to evaluate their contribution to the modelling of consumer debt within a complete data-mining framework, with powerful classification models and reliable evaluation techniques. It was found that all psychological factors increase the performance of the models in any case in a statistically significant sense. In particular, impulsivity, a well-researched psychological factor [6], [17] appears to be the strongest predictor in our modelling. Our results also suggest that consumer debt analysis has much to gain by embracing the study of psychological factors and the application of data-mining approaches in its methods and practices. Despite the fact that the transformations we have carried out at the socio-economic level have no impact on the modelling methodology if these factors are not taken into account in their final dimensionality."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We would like to thank John Gathergood, Lecturer in the School of Economics at Nottingham University, for providing the DebtTracl survey."}], "references": [{"title": "Bankruptcy prediction for credit risk using neural networks: A survey and new results", "author": ["Amir F Atiya"], "venue": "Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Data mining for imbalanced datasets: An overview.
