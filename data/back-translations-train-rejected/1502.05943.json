RESULTS USING THIN", "text": "The quinolone drug family is used to test the methodology. A total of 25,8397 initial quinolone prescriptions are in the database. After discussions with clinical experts, we selected four different health outcomes associated with quinolones in the THIN database and applied the refinement methodology to refine each instance. The selected health outcomes are described in Table III and were selected to provide a fair range of events. During implementation, we found that it was currently not mathematically efficient to break down association rules with precursors containing more than three points."}, {"heading": "A. Candidiasis (AB2)", "text": "The GAI \"candidiasis\" was chosen because it is a known side effect of antibiotic drugs. Of all the HOIs examined in this paper, the association level for AB2 was lowest. AB2 was recorded within 1 and 60 days of the first prescription of quinolone for 3388 prescriptions, so there were a total of 3388 instances of quinolone-AB2. Over 6 million association rules were created from the form {Precursor} = > {AB2} with a minimum confidence restriction of 0.01 and a minimum left-sided support restriction of 0.001. For 1293 of the instances of quinolone-AB2, the patient basket containing all medical records prior to the AB2 recording contained one or more AB2 association rules with precursors. 1293 of the quinstances of quinlone-AB2 contained the highest risk, while the quinlone-AB2 instances contained an average of 038, respectively, the highest cause of AB2-331."}, {"heading": "B. Sudden death, cause unknown (R21)", "text": "The HOI \"Sudden Death, cause unknown\" was chosen because it has a temporal bias; death cannot occur before a patient takes a drug, so the use of the AB ratio often leads to a link between a drug and the read code that corresponds to death. By examining this read code, we can see if it is possible to eliminate this form of temporal bias by the refinement method. Read code R21 was recorded for 73 prescriptions during 1 and 60 days after the first prescription of quinolone, corresponding to a total of 73 quinlon R21 cases. There were 11,219 association rules that were recorded in the form {antecedent} = > {R21} with a minimum trust of 0.01 and a minimum left support of 0.001. For 58 of the quinloneR21 cases, the patients that contain all medical records prior to the R21 record have one or more R21 association rules."}, {"heading": "C. Multiple organ failure (C19)", "text": "The HOI \"multiple organ failure\" was chosen because it is a serious result that occurred 9 times a month after the first prescription of quinolone and never the month before. This HOI was rarely recorded; C19 was included in the database in only 262 patients. Application of the association rule Mining with a left minimum support of 0.001 and a minimum confidence of 0.01 changed only one rule of the form {precursor} = > {C19}. The rule was {general screening, septicemia and tropical corticosteroids} = > {C19}. The precursor corresponding to this association rule was not present in the baskets corresponding to one of the 9 cases of C19 after a quinolone. Therefore, none of the cases was refined as in Table VI.The absolute risk value for C19 for two months after the prescription of quinolone is 9 / 258397 = 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 5, which is the same as the establishment risk."}, {"heading": "D. Secondary malignant neoplasm (B572)", "text": "The HOI \"secondary malignant neoplasms\" was chosen because it is highly unlikely to correspond to an acute adverse reaction to a drug. B572 was registered five times during the month following the first prescription of quinolone and never the month before. Therefore, it appears to be associated with quinolones. Over 2 million association rules were established in the form {antecedent} = > {B57} (we only establish rules for the first three elements of the read code, but if a patient is susceptible to B57, they will also be susceptible to B572) with a minimum confidence limit of 0.01 and a minimum left-sided support limit of 0.001. For 5 of the quinlon B572 cases, while the patient basket, which contains all medical records prior to B572 recording, also contained one or more B57 association rules for the history. 5 of the quinlon B572 baskets also contained an average risk of 57-2-2-2-2-2-2."}, {"heading": "IV. DISCUSSION", "text": "This year, there will be no significant reduction in the number of deaths in the first half of the year."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we presented conceptual evidence for a novel efficient ADR signal refinement method that filters cases of a DOI HOI signal and does not require knowledge of possible confusion; the recorded history of a patient experiencing the signal is used to filter out cases where the medical event can be explained by alternative causes (other than the drug); preliminary results suggest that the method is capable of efficiently refining ADR signals, but each signal may require specific adjustments to determine the optimal support and trust values to be implemented; proposals for future work include the development of methods for efficiently matching support and trust parameters, and the implementation of the methodology using distributed computer technology to develop association rules with large amounts of precursors; future work could examine the inclusion of age to remove DOI HOI signals caused by age confusion; the use of different HOI associations; and the coordination of HOI methods that are common."}], "references": [{"title": "Why there is a need for pharmacovigilance", "author": ["W.K.

Electronic healthcare databases present the opportunity to identify new side effects efficiently but currently the methods are limited due to confounding (i.e. when an association between two variables is identified due to them both being associated to a third variable). In this paper we propose a proof of concept method that learns common associations and uses this knowledge to automatically refine side effect signals (i.e. exposure-outcome associations) by removing instances of the exposure-outcome associations that are caused by confounding. This leaves the signal instances that are most likely to correspond to true side effect occurrences. We then calculate a novel measure termed the confounding-adjusted risk value, a more accurate absolute risk value of a patient experiencing the outcome within 60 days of the exposure. Tentative results suggest that the method works. For the four signals (i.e. exposure-outcome associations) investigated we are able to correctly filter the majority of exposure-outcome instances that were unlikely to correspond to true side effects. The method is likely to improve when tuning the association rule mining parameters for specific health outcomes. This paper shows that it may be possible to filter signals at a patient level based on association rules learned from considering patients\u2019 medical histories. However, additional work is required to develop a way to automate the tuning of the method\u2019s parameters.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
