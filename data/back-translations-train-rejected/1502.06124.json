The progress of its solution will be of great benefit for further advances in the fields of information gathering, ontology alignment, relevance calculation, text mining, natural language processing, etc. The paper proposes the concept of the multidimensional global knowledge map, which is elaborated by uncontrolled extraction of dependencies from large document corpus. Furthermore, the problem of the direct interface between human and knowledge is addressed and a concept of the adaptive decoder is proposed for the purpose of interacting with the previously described uniform mapping models.

Introduction", "text": "In society, the area of knowledge representation has grown in importance in recent years [25]. People have always tried to study and classify knowledge of knowledge. We can already find references to the flowering of logic and epistemology [28] in the Middle Ages since Socrates in the fifth century BC. [33] Since the problem was considered important in the past, it is hard to overestimate its importance during the information age. Modern technologies have brought an excessive flood of data to mankind that is difficult to systematize and process. To become a specialist in a given area, it takes years of learning and requires a subsequent information race to keep up with the latest professional trends. It is a common belief among knowledge engineers and data mining specialists that information that is available in open access is sufficient to extract truthful facts about virtually every aspect of our lives and even to predict the future. The only problem that needs to be solved is the systematic access of 35 people to the knowledge processing from a variety of new sources."}, {"heading": "2.

Such a model (let's call it \"Global Knowledge Map\") should reflect the level of similarity of documents and concepts. Therefore, the main purpose of the model is that it requires a mathematical / logical model of knowledge retention with a specific condition: it is optimal for the task of knowledge representation, i.e. interaction with man. To fulfil this condition, the model must reflect the structure of human knowledge in its dimensionality or structure."}, {"heading": "2.3 Automatic GKM generation through unsupervised extraction (hypothesis)", "text": "In order to be useful, GKM mappings should contain a significant number of real Word (WWW) documents and should represent the general human understanding of the world in its structure. Therefore, it is not worth considering any manual methods of creating GKM and complementing it with document mappings. Data mining principles should be used to extract dependencies that represent knowledge from the existing corpus of documents available for computer processing and filter out unnecessary data. However, there have been numerous attempts at unattended extraction of dependencies in texts, it is still a doubtful question whether any technique is capable of providing a sustainable knowledge extraction by analyzing large collection of documents [10, 11, 21, 30]. Let us divide the factors that generally affect the content of the documents into three categories: 1. Personal factors (feelings and motives for generating the text, 2. the writing of the document itself will be used by the author), physical rules, and 3."}, {"heading": "2.4 Implementation (experiment)", "text": "This year, as never before in the history of a country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a city, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country, in a country"}, {"heading": "3.

Both the tasks of receiving requests from users and the transmission of knowledge to them are of equal importance as the tasks of data structuring and storage. In the current work, we discuss the paths towards a new generation of Knowledge Representation Systems and therefore the question of interaction is overlooked to determine whether it is possible to provide an idealistic interface by means of modern technology. \"The interfaces used to support the interaction of a human user with modern knowledge representation systems and information retrieval systems are mainly of the\" indexing \"type, i.e. users need to know exactly what they are looking for, and they also need to specify it linguistically. a common example of such an interface is a search engine. As we have mentioned above, search engine and the corpus of WW documents are the most complete and up-to-date knowledge representation systems available nowadays, and this is considered to be the reason for their popularity, but at the same time it is a very simple problem for their use."}, {"heading": "3.2 High dimensionality and visualisation", "text": "After mentioning that the resulting global mapping space is likely to be n-dimensional, where n is high, it is necessary to solve the problem of visual representation. It is possible for humans to imagine the 3D space, so the optimal ways of nD- > 3D representation need to be evaluated. Dimensionality reduction techniques or a multiple representation approach via interface could be applied. It is important that with the help of the unified knowledge mapping space, the error in calculating the relevance between documents is minimized and furthermore, retrieving relevant documents from other systems becomes a trivial task. For the end user, this means that once the system has found the topic in which he / she is interested, the user will never lead to irrelevant documents."}, {"heading": "3.3 Information request chain", "text": "The most important task that still needs to be solved is the problem of a first request.

Firstly, the user must formulate the cognitive images in short linguistic sentences.
