Regardless of the particularities behind the design of the seed AI used to start an RSI process, all these systems trying to achieve super intelligence will converge to the same software architecture. We will call this intuition - RSI convergence theory. There are a number of ways in which it can happen, depending on the assumptions we make, but in all cases the result is the same, a practically predictable agent similar to AIXI (which is an unpredictable but super intelligent agent [104]. If there is a limit to intelligence, several systems will eventually reach this level, probably by taking different trajectories, and in order to increase their velocity, attempts will be made to minimize the size of their source code, eventually discovering smallest program with such a degree of capability. It may even be the case that sufficiently intelligent RIS will know the basic architecture from Sgorov, and the physics of such a complex."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}], "references": [{"title": "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", "author": ["A.
