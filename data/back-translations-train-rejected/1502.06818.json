INTRODUCTION", "text": "Most data in the modern world can be treated as an information network, so the similarity of the network node is measured and has a wide range of applications: search [1], recommendation systems [2], analysis of research publications [3], biology [4], transportation and logistics [5], etc. Consider a semantic network: set of types T, each type T is a set of units; set of relationships R, each relationship is a predicate of two order, defined on two types of T: R 3 rtp: t \u00d7 p 7 \u2192 {1, 0}, p \u0445 T, both types can be the same in relationship (rtt: t \u00d7 t \u2192 {0, 1}), few relationships can share the same type pair (r (1) tp 6 = r (2) tp: 0, 1} t \u00d7 p).

The main drawback of this approach is that we cannot create multiple relationships or object types, so the only option is to mix them into a blobs relationship \"and\" all objects \"that, in the case where we have multiple relationships with different semantics, for example the OpenCyc ontology node of the concept of\" game \"(see Figure 1), cannot be expressed simply by a single type of relations and objects."}, {"heading": "2.
