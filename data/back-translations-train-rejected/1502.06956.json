Introduction", "text": "Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory is widely used in many disciplines as it allows for dealing with uncertain information. Several familiar branches of its applications include statistical learning [1, 2, 3], classification and clustering [4, 5, 6, 7], decision making [8, 9, 10], epistemological logic [11, 12], risk assessment and assessment [13, 14, 15], and so on [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. In Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory, several major research directions are continually appealing to the attention of researchers, for example, the combination of multiple evidences [21, 22, 23], conflict management [24, 25], Basic Probability Assignment Generation (BPA), and so on [29, 30, 31]. Among these points, the decision-making based BPA model is a crucial question that needs to be resolved and it has attracted a lot of attention."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory", "text": "Dempster Shafer Evidence Theory [40, 41], also called Dempster Shafer Theory or Evidence Theory, is used to deal with uncertain information. As an effective theory of the uncertainty principle, the Dempster Shafer Theory has the advantage of directly expressing various uncertainties, which requires weaker conditions than Bayesian probability theory, so it is often considered an extension of Bayesian theory. To complete the explanation, some basic concepts are introduced as the following. Definition 1. Let us be a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive elements, led by the definition = {E1, E2, \u00b7 \u00b7, \u00b7, Ei, \u00b7 \u00b7, EN} (1) The definition is referred to as a distinction framework."}, {"heading": "3. Proposed probability transformation approach based on Deng", "text": "Entropy This section first introduces a new measure of uncertainty in BPA, deng entropy, then proposes a new approach to converting BPA into probability distribution based on the concept of deng entropy."}, {"heading": "3.1. Deng entropy", "text": "Deng entropy [39] is a generalized Shannon entropy for measuring the uncertainty associated with BPA. Mathematically, Deng entropy can be represented as follows: Ed = \u2212 \u2211 im (Fi) log m (Fi) 2 | Fi | \u2212 1 (7), where Fi is a clause in the mass function m, and | Fi | is the cardinality of Fi. As shown in the definition above, Deng entropy is formally similar to classical Shannon entropy, but the faith for each clause Fi is divided by a term (2 | Fi | \u2212 1) representing the potential number of states in Fi (of course, the empty set is not included). In particular, Deng entropy can definitely degenerate into Shannon entropy if the faith is assigned only to individual elements."}, {"heading": "3.2. Proposed probability transformation approach", "text": "In our view, a primary principle in the transformation process is to minimize the difference between the uncertainties associated with the given BPA and the obtained probability distribution. In order to implement such an optimization transformation, it must be able to calculate the uncertainty of the BPA. Strictly speaking, Deng entropy offers a method of measuring the uncertainty of the BPA as well as the probability distribution. Therefore, a novel probability transformation approach based on deng entropy can be proposed as follows. Suppose that the differentiation frame for m is calculated by solving the following optimization problem: min | Ed (m) \u2212 Ed (P) \u2212 Ed (P) \u00b7 \u00b7 Ed (Ed) \u00b7 s (Ed) \u00b7 s (Ed) \u00b7 s (Ed) ip (Ed) = 1; Bel (Teri) \u2264 P l (Entropi)."}, {"heading": "4. Numerical examples", "text": "Example 1. According to Eqs. (5) and (6), Bel (\u03c91) = Bel (\u03c92) = Bel (\u03c93) = Bel (\u03c94) = 0, P l (\u03c91) = P l (\u03c92) = P l (\u03c93) = 1. By applying the proposed probability transformation approach, a probability transformation is obtained by min | Ed (m) \u2212 Ed (P) \u2212 s.t. p (constru1) + p (\u03c92) + p (\u03c93) + p (\u03c94) = maximum probability transformation."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, the conversion of BPA into probability distribution was investigated, based on the idea that a novel probability transformation approach was proposed to minimize the difference between the uncertainties associated with the given BPA and the probability distribution obtained. Finally, several illustrative examples were given to demonstrate the proposed method."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The work is partially supported by the China Scholarship Council, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 61174022), the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (grant no. 20131102130002), the R & D Program of China (2012BAH07B01), the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) (grant no. 2013AA013801), the open grant project of the State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University (grant no.

In that theory, basic probability assignment (BPA) is the basic element for the expression and inference of uncertainty. Decision-making based on BPA is still an open issue in Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. In this paper, a novel approach of transforming basic probability assignments to probabilities is proposed based on Deng entropy which is a new measure for the uncertainty of BPA. The principle of the proposed method is to minimize the difference of uncertainties involving in the given BPA and obtained probability distribution. Numerical examples are given to show the proposed approach.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
