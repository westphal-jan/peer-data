We can learn by getting class labels as feedback: \"this is a dog,\" \"this is a wolf,\" \"there is a cat,\" etc. We can also learn by getting class labels: \"these are the same,\" \"these are different,\" etc. In this note, we examine the problem of learning with similarity to class labels. Our approach is to use the VC dimension [VC71] to study the basic difficulty of this learning task. In the supervised learning model, we get a series of patterns and associated labels. The goal is then to find a hypothesis function that maps patterns onto labels that predict future data with few errors (small generalization errors). A classical approach to this problem is empirical risk minimization. Here, the procedure is to select a hypothesis from a set of hypotheses functions (hypotheses space) that are as accurate as possible."}, {"heading": "2 The VC-dimension of similarity hypothesis spaces", "text": "A hypothesis room H '0, 1' X is a set of functions from any set of patterns that result in X '71 (= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = {{0, 1} X \u2032 (x): = h (x) for each x-x-x-x-x-x-x.
