Motivations: similarity spaces connected by a comparability mapping", "text": "When confronting complex data, one can encounter situations in which two different spaces S and S, in which already existing native similarities SS and SS, are linked by an image CSS. Figure 1 gives an example of such a situation. This is the case if one looks at comparable corpora, which consists of texts written in at least two different languages. For such data, a bilingual dictionary allows the creation of a native comparability measure (Li & Gaussier, 2010), which leads to the definition of comparability (Marteau & M\u00e9nier, 2013), which links the two sets of comparable documents. More generally, such a case results in situations in which heterogeneous but analogous data is available, in different formats, or characterized by different elements of descriptors, or compact to different semantic models such as heterogeneous ontologies, etc."}, {"heading": "3. Combining similarity and comparability: a three-mode analysis scheme", "text": "3.1 A measure of similarity produced by the comparability of the two linguistic spaces. In this line of work, (Marteau & M\u00e9nier, 2013), an algorithm, Hit-ComSim, was proposed in order to iteratively construct the concept of similarity induced by a comparable bipartite graph. Unfortunately, due to its high algorithmic complexity (in O (N4)), this algorithm is not well scalable. We propose a much simpler approach here, which consists in directly analyzing the comparability of the matrix constructed from the two bilingual finite document collections. Let's consider S and S \"two collections of documents belonging to two different linguistic spaces (L and L\"), in which two homogenous similarity measurements SS and SS are defined. Let's C (.): SS \"SS\" SS \"and SS\" \u2192 R \"the comparability that represents the two finite collections or equivalent."}, {"heading": "4.

Algorithm 1 describes the way each of these 20 tests is generated. Variance parameters Vs and Vc are designed to significantly overlap the categories, making the classification problems difficult enough. To place a more differentiated emphasis on native similarity measures, the variance Vc in connection with the comparability matrix used to provide the induced similarity measure is three times the variance Vs used to produce the native similarity measures. Algorithm 1 Random generation of two native similarity spaces connected by a comparability mapping results. The algorithm provides two random similarity matrix, CSS, SS-Matrix, SS-Comparability Matrix \u00b2, SS-Matrix and SS-Comparability Matrix \u00b2."}, {"heading": "15 491 7 189 15 411 11 314", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "12 355 5 148 15 524 12 343", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "16 485 10 309 6 169 17 488", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "16 516 8 243 8 223 14 420", "text": "In order to evaluate the effectiveness of a 1-NN classification as a mixing parameter \u03b1, we use the measurement of the classification error rate.

Figure 2 indicates the mean and variance of the error rates for the 20 tests obtained with a 10-fold cross-validation with a 1-NN classifier. As shown in this figure, the 1-NN classification, using the induced similarity measurements alone, performs worse, which was expected, since the variance is three times greater in the comparability measurement than in the generation of the native similarity measurements. Thus, the error rate is 46% in S and in S \u00b2 when the induced similarity measurements are used alone and 35% in S and 39% in S \u00b2 when the native similarity measurements are used alone. The effect of mixing of the native and induced similarity measurements is lower than the average of these 25% when the effective data sets are reduced by 0.75, and the average of these measurements is very low."}, {"heading": "5.

Experimenting on textual bilingual data", "text": "We have collected the assessment corpora of 21 Wikipedia categories, English (EN) and French (FR) languages. They originally consisted of a total of 154828 documents with 87793 English documents and 67035 French documents, categorized into 21 categories, taken from existing Wikipedia categories. As such a corpus is thematically very large, the corresponding similarities and comparability matrices are basically very sparse. To avoid the algorithmic complexity behind the calculation of induced similarity matrices (O (N3)), we proceeded as follows, which drastically reduces the scarcity of our matrices: 1. For each class and language, we first evaluate the intralinguistic similarity matrices by basing a cosmic similarity based on a tf \u2212 idf weighting; 2. We truncate these intralinguistic similarity matrices by a threshold (typically 0.5) and arrange the documents by their number of the remaining corpus (they share a similarity)."}, {"heading": "6.1 Bilingual dictionary", "text": "To estimate the quantitative comparability between a pair of Anglo-French documents, we used the ELRA bilingual dictionary under the reference ELRA-M0033, which contains 243,580 pairs of French and English lexical entries, which decompose into 110,541 English lexical entries and 109,196 French lexical entries. Influence of the dictionary coverage rate has been partially examined in (Li & Gaussier, 2010) and (Ke, Marteau, & M\u00e9nier, 2014).

Accuracy (AC) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) are used to evaluate cluster performance (Wei Xu & Gong, 2003). As an internal evaluation scheme for estimating the quality of the cluster obtained in each linguistic area, we also use the Davies Bouldin Index (DB) (Davies & Bouldin, 1979), which roughly measures the quotient of the intra- and inter-cluster average similarity measurement. Accuracy (AC) is defined as the percentage of documents that are correctly labeled, assuming a one-to-one match between the true categories and assigned clusters."}, {"heading": "7. Experiments", "text": "On the basis of the categorized comparison corpus from Wikipedia, we evaluate the usefulness of mixing native-language similarity measures with comparability in a 1-NN classification task and a k-medoid cluster task (Kaufman & Rousseeuw, 1987) (Kaufman & Rousseeuw, 1990)."}, {"heading": "7.1 1-NN classification task", "text": "First, we examine the effect of mixing similarity and comparability on the problem of the 1-NN classification with simultaneous variation of the parameter \u03b2 [0, 1]. Figures 3 and 4 show that mixing similarity and comparability has a significant impact on the two variants CV A1 and CV A2, since it allows a reduction of the error rate of classification by 3% for English-language documents and by 1.5% for French-language documents."}, {"heading": "7.2 k-medoids clustering task", "text": "Figures 5 and 6 show that both AC and NMI measures can be improved up to 15% in terms of clustering French language documents and up to 3% in terms of clustering English-language documents for both CV A1 and CV A2 measures. However, the CLG brings comparatively less improvements for both languages. Figure 7 shows the DB measure as a function of the parameter \u03b1 for all three benchmarks. It shows that this rate is decreasing for some good \u03b1 values, especially for the French language, while the CLG measure generally increases this value. Thus, a good blending of comparability and similarity measures has a positive impact when using CV A1 and CV A2, whereas the CV A2 measure tends to have a negative impact on a CLG measure and on the application of the CLG measure."}, {"heading": "8. Analysis and conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a new approach to co-clustering and co-categorizing bilingual data when comparability mapping exists; this approach, which could be characterized as a kind of three-mode clustering or categorization, is based on the concept of similarity induced by comparability in bilingual graphics; the three-mode data analysis scheme is implemented as a mixed model that is used to merge indigenous and induced similarity measurements within each of the two linguistic spaces; the evaluation of this mixed model on purely synthetic random data is quite informative and demonstrates the ability to reduce noise of the method.On real bilingual textual data, the approach includes a quantitative comparability measurement based on the use of a bilingual dictionary. To this end, two variants of comparability measurement proposed by (Li & Gaussier, 2010) are proposed to adapt this measure to clustering and categorization tasks."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was partly funded by the French National Research Agency (ANRMETRICC)."}], "references": [{"title": "A co-classification approach to learning from multilingual corpora", "author": ["Amini", "M.-R", "C.
