Brute StemmingThere are, however, many crude parentage techniques used in the context of ATC. They can be divided into two types: (i) parentage from a dictionary in which dictionary letters must be removed from the dictionary; (ii) parentage from dictionary letters in which dictionary letters must be used; (ii) parentage without dictionary in which stem letters are extracted without specifying the root or pattern. Khoja and Garside are derived from dictionary letters [16] in which the longest suffix and prefix are removed.

First, Arabic patterns, prefixes and suffixes are modeled by simple transducers, then a transducer is constructed using these simple patterns, applying rational patterns such as concatenation, union and composition, then we will show how to use rational cores as frames to construct ATC.Stemming by TransducersArabic language differs from other languages syntactically, morphologically and semantically. One of the most important characteristic features is that most words are built from roots by taking certain fixed patterns into account and adding prefixes and suffixes. For example, the Arabic word \u00e9 PY\u00d6\u00cf @ (school) is constructed (learn) from the three letters rootor stem PX and uses the pattern \u00c9\u00aa \u00ae, the word thenprefix @ and suffix \u00e8 (which is added to denote femalegender)."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Results and Discussion", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced a new framework for Arabic word origin and text classification based on the use of parentage converters and rational cores to measure the distance between documents. First, our converter uses converters to model Arabic patterns. Second, rational cores are used to measure the distances between documents. Experiments and analysis of this framework in the context of Arabic text classification show that parentage improves the quality of classifiers in terms of accuracy, memory and F1, but slightly reduces precision. 3 gram classifiers achieved the best results. Like Al-Serhan's, our approaches to parentage are not based on dictionaries and provide better results."}], "references": [{"title": "Stemming techniques for Arabic words: A comparative study", "author": ["M.
