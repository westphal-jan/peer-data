Problem Formulation", "text": "In this work, we approach the task of identifying musical plagiarism in a pair-by-pair discriminatory classification framework, in which we want to predict whether the pair is sufficiently similar to be considered plagiarized. Each musical track (x) is first represented by a series of characteristic vectors designated by F (x) = {f1, f2,..., fn}. Each song here represents a class of characteristics, e.g. Mel frequency cepstral characteristics, pitch contour characteristics. We then define a set of n distance functions (one for each characteristic class extracted for a song), sp."}, {"heading": "3. Feature Representations from compositional models", "text": "Our feature space design is primarily motivated by the fact that most current approaches do not explicitly address the problem of polyphony in recordings, but simply use a monophonic approach, while others view polyphony as a more general multi-dimensional mathematical problem. While an ideal solution to this problem would be to separate the many notes or voices in the recording into different tracks, this would require information for each track that is likely to be unavailable. We are introducing a new feature set based on the compositional representation of the size spectrum. Specifically, we are using a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) -based embedding for the music tracks [6], which we expect will take polyphony much better into account than the feature sets traditionally used for music rendering. These NMF-based features are used in conjunction with traditional feature representations. In the following, we first describe the NMF-based feature extraction section, and then briefly describe the NMF-based feature extraction section for traditionally used feature audio."}, {"heading": "3.1. NMF features", "text": "In fact, it is that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able to change the world, and that we are able to change the world without destroying it."}, {"heading": "3.2. Traditional Representations for Audio", "text": "In addition to the characteristics extracted from the NMF, we extract characteristics that use traditional methods of audio content analysis that effectively describe temporal and spectral sound structures. We use the F score to identify the more discriminating characteristics of the data set used [10]. We expect that the addition of these characteristics to the NMF-based characteristics will lead to increased efficiency in the detection of similar music documents in polyphonic environments. Generally, the perception of structural boundaries in music is mainly influenced by variations in tone color, tonality and rhythm. Other characteristics extracted from the audio are the Mel frequency cepstral coefficient, the relative Shannon entropy, a tonality characteristic that indicates the cross-correlation value for each different tonality candidate, another characteristic that is extracted from the audio, the Ceptral scalification, and the use of the Ceptral, the additional characteristics that are extracted from the Ceptral, the use of the Ceptrace."}, {"heading": "3.3. Distance Features for Pair Characterization", "text": "In the previous subsections, we described the sets of characteristics extracted for each track. We use these characteristics to calculate distances that we use to characterize trace pairs as plagiarized or not. Given the feature presentations for the two tracks, we use the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to calculate distances between the corresponding trace sequences. Dynamic Time Distortion is a dynamic programming algorithm that efficiently calculates the optimal alignment of nonlinear extended or contracted sequences. Based on an inspection of the dataset, we observed that the music in a pair of plagiarized tracks is usually different in rhythm, while maintaining other characteristics that make it sound similar. We incorporate this intuition into our distance calculation by using a modified version of the DTW algorithm for rhythm-based characteristics (with local weights)."}, {"heading": "4. Experimental Results", "text": "We used the MIRToolBox in MATLAB [11] to extract the traditional audio-based characteristics described in Section 3.2, followed by extraction of the NMF characteristics and DTW-based distance calculation to characterize tracks in pairs, as in Section 3. These distance characteristics and true class names for the training data were then used to train a random forest classifier [12] with 150 trees."}, {"heading": "4.1. Dataset", "text": "We created a database of 2966 song pairs, consisting of 966 plagiarized (positive data sets) and 2000 unplagiarized (negative data sets) song pairs. The positive instances were obtained from music covers and plagiarism lawsuits [13, 14], including the Music Copyright Infringement Resource of the UCLA School of Law. The data set consists of music from a wide range of genres and languages. All recordings were re-sampled to a uniform 16 kHz sampling rate with a frame length of 40Table 1: Total classification accuracy comparison for the various systems on the entire test file Baseline NMF-only Enhanced"}, {"heading": "45.1% 72.6% 78.4%", "text": "Figure 1: (L): Precision-Recall ROC curves for the different systems on the plagiarized instances in test data; (R) Corresponding Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the different systemsms. Training and test data were randomly separated to obtain a 9: 1 pull test split."}, {"heading": "4.2. Results", "text": "We compare the performance of 3 systems based on the test data. We use the traditional sets of features described in Section 3.2 as a starting point and compare them to performance only using the NMF features and an extended set of features using the basic features along with NMF features. First, a comparison of the general classification accuracy is shown on the test set in Table 1. We find that the NMFonly system significantly outperforms the system using the basic features, while the extended system significantly outperforms both. Figure 1 compares the performance of the systems using ROC charts for precision and recall for the plagiarized instances in the test data. Since precision and recall are both indicators of accuracy, the higher the Area Under the Curve (AUC), the better the performance of the systems using ROC charts for precision and recall for the plagiarized instances in the test data."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "We formulated the task of plagiarism detection within a supervised classification framework that uses distance characteristics across pairs of music tracks to learn the model, and our approach resulted in a significant improvement in performance over baseline metrics. It should be noted that our method does not do without agencies that track potential copyright infringement. Ideally, it should be used as a filtering mechanism to identify extremely similar music tracks. In this work, we used sample foundations derived from the data for NMF - alternative methods of learning the basics (such as training the baseline set from the data, using examples of expected notes for initialization) and effects of changing the baseline set size are guidelines that we expect to explore in future workflows. NMF-based representation of features should also be useful in other tasks dealing with polyphonic music."}, {"heading": "6. References", "text": "[1] A. Ghias, J. Logan, D. Chamberlin, and B.C.
