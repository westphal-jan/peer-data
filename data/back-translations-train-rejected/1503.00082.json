We propose to use a group representative to handle detection with a different number of group members, and to use an asynchronous Hidden Markov Model (AHMM) to model the relationship between people. In addition, we propose an algorithm for detection of group activities that can handle both symmetrical and asymmetrical group activities, and show that this approach enables detection of hierarchical interactions between people. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. I. Introduction to detection of human group behavior or human interactions has aroused increasing research interest [1-6]. Some examples of group events of interest include people who are fighting, being tracked, people who launch terrorist attacks in groups, etc. The ability to automatically detect group activities of interests is important for many security applications. In this post, we will address the following group detection questions."}, {"heading": "A. Group Event Detection with a Varying Number of Group Members", "text": "Most previous research on group event detection [1-2] uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or its variation to model human interactions. Some researchers attempt to detect human interactions using a semantic set independent of content [3-4]. However, most of this work is designed to detect group activities with a fixed number of group members where the input marker is vector length. They cannot deal with the case where the number of group members varies, which often occurs in our daily lives (e.g. people leaving a group or joining a group activity), in which case the input marker vector length may vary with different number of group members. Although some work [5-6] tried to deal with detecting group activities with a different number of members, most of them have assumptions under certain scenarios that restrict their application."}, {"heading": "B. Group Event Detection with a Hierarchical Activity Structure", "text": "In many scenarios, interacting people form subgroups. However, these subgroups are not independent of each other and they can continue to interact to form a hierarchical structure. For example, in Fig. 1, three fighting people form a subgroup of the fight (the dotted circle). At the same time, another person approaches the three fighting people and these four people form a larger group of approach (the fixed circle in Fig. 1). This is an example of a hierarchical activity structure in which the group approaches at a higher level than the group of combat. Some algorithms [1-2] could be expanded to solve the problem of hierarchical recognition of events when the number of group members is specified. Our work deals with the problem of recognizing group events with a different number of group members under a hierarchical activity structure."}, {"heading": "C. Clustering with an Asymmetric Distance Metric", "text": "Most previous cluster algorithms [6,10] perform clustering on the basis of a symmetric distance measurement (i.e. the distance between two persons is symmetrical regardless of the relationship of the persons).In the detection of group events, some activities such as \"following\" are asymmetrical (e.g. \"person i to person j\" is not the same as \"person j to person i\").Defining a suitable asymmetrical distance measurement and performing clusters under the asymmetrical distance measurement is an important topic. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: activity structure, we beat a2) ing number of persons, we beat nach3) opose aThe rest of the work is organized as follows."}, {"heading": "II.

Symmetric and Asymmetric Activities", "text": "To solve the problem of hierarchical activity structure, we classify activities into symmetrical activities and asymmetrical activities. Suppose we have two units i and j, the activity \u03b8 between i and j is defined as symmetrical activity, if \"i has the activity \u03b8 with j\" is the same as \"j has the activity \u03b8 with i.\" For example, the activity WalkTogether is a symmetrical activity because \"i goes together with j\" is the same as \"j goes together with i.\" From the above definition, we see that units belonging to the same symmetrical activity play similar roles for the activity and are interchangeable. We can further define the symmetrical group as a group of units where two units in the group perform the same symmetrical activity. A symmetrical group can have symmetrical activity, a symmetrical number of group members or units that are symmetrical."}, {"heading": "IV.

We also assume that each asymmetric group contains two symmetrical subgroups, one group contains 3 persons and the other group 1 person. It should be noted that the number of group members in this experiment is determined that SRC clustering is not required for the SAAS + SRC + MV method and the GRAD method and is therefore skipped. Based on our proposed SAAS, we have better performance. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our SAAS method. It should be noted that it is possible to develop better features than those listed in Table 3 to improve the performance of the HMM method."}, {"heading": "C.
