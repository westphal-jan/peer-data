Individuals are aware of the size of the population and the distribution of other robots. At any time, each robot is able to perform only one of the feeding spots for green or fodder purposes. Depending on the area of the spots, the number of robots performing cleaning and sampling activities inside them varies. Obviously, it is not necessary to fill the entire capacity of the spots with robots. Also, a robot is able to perform cleaning and sampling activities alone, but it takes a lot of time and is less desirable. In abstract terms, the scenario can be defined in such a way that more colored spots are found with minimal waste of energy. One of the causes for this waste are unnecessary robot rotations in the environment. There are also some other reasons for the robots remaining active with different energy wastage, such as the distribution of their robots, and finally preventing the robots from remaining proportional to their area."}, {"heading": "3 Methods", "text": "In all the proposed methods, the robots are first placed at random locations. In each method, the energy level of each robot is divided into three parts: the first part is used to search for food; the second part is used to perform cleaning and sampling operations; and the third part is used to return to the charging station, either to the nest or to another specified location. All methods are organized on the basis of the transmission of messages and all messages have the same structure; each message can have several lines that each of them represents unique spot information; the total capacity of each spot consists of 10 characteristics that are as follows: One line is occupied or not, this is represented by 1 or 0 similarly; X, Y and Z coordinates the current position of the robot in the desired environment, which is calculated by GPS. The total capacity of the existing spots consists of the following characteristics: One line is occupied or not occupied, this is represented by 1 or 0 similarly; the current position of the robot in the desired environment, which is calculated by GPS."}, {"heading": "3.1 Static communication based method", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have established in the past."}, {"heading": "3.2 Dynamic communication based method", "text": "This method (Figure 1) is similar to the first method in that it supports dynamic task allocation in such a way that the robot will probably change its target color after a time step. Consider, for example, that after 100 iterations with 1 black and 3 green, a robot has 4 points in its private list. Then, the robot will likely set its target color to black and also to green with the probability. Therefore, we expect this method to be better than the previous one, because with this method, the search time for each robot to find the appropriate location can be shortened. If the robots in the environment are not evenly distributed at the beginning, it is possible that some points will not be detected after small time steps (100 time steps)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Decentralized Chapar Method", "text": "In this method, we have some radio towers called Chapar stations that are used for radio communication and also we assume that two groups of robots; workers (as defined in the previously explained methods) and Chapars, which transmit messages between workers and Chapar stations. \"Chapar Khaneh\" or \"Chapar-Khaneh\" is a term used in Persian, meaning the \"House of the Courier\" as a \"courier,\" in reference to the postal service during the Achaemenid era [14]. Here we used Chapar station instead of Chapar-khaneh. High-speed robots with simple structure are considered as Chapars. Chapars flood their updated private message, which is changed by some workers to the range of their radio frequency coverage. Once a Chapar realizes a new line in his private message (which shows that a new spot has been discovered), it quickly goes to the next Chapar station and sends his private message to them and also updates the message based on the Chapar content of the stations being sent."}, {"heading": "3.4 Centralized Chapar Method", "text": "This method (Figure 2) is similar to the decentralized method, where there is only one chapar station covering the entire environment. In this method, chapars have a single task to transmit messages from robots to the chapar station, and they do so as soon as they realize a new line in their private messages. If the chapar station receives a message that is not similar to their private message, it updates the private message and sends it to all robots. To prevent the chapar station from failing at a single point, in addition to updating the messages through chapars, they should quickly transmit messages to the environment. Despite the centralized method, each chapar station only goes to the chapar station when it encounters a new location in its private message. It should be remembered that the robots used in the third and fourth method have the same behavior as the robots used for one of the first or second methods (optional) and as explained before, their behavior is the same as that of one of them."}, {"heading": "4 Simulations", "text": "We have used E-Puck robots in simulations that are augmented by color detection infrared sensors, positioning module, compass and radio wave transmitter and receiver. As the purpose of this article is to include a wide range of robots and the use of simpler hardware, we considered them in fact without camera. In this way, the methods can show their power in the use of blind robots. All the experiments were carried out in a 3m x 3m square environment surrounded by walls using webs as robot simulation software. In two general experiments, the performance of the four proposed methods is evaluated individually before and after energy consumption and in both 10 robots are called workers with IDs from 1 to 10. Initially, the foraging mode of the robots with IDs from 1 to 5 is set to green and the robots with IDs from 6 to 10 are set to black."}, {"heading": "4.1 First experiment: performance evaluation of proposed methods before the threshold energy", "text": "Since the third and fourth methods will be the first, it is necessary to compare the performance of the first and second methods before moving on to the second. Thus, we have only compared the performance of the first and second methods before moving on to the third. In each of the four areas, the first and second methods are discussed."}, {"heading": "4.2 Second experiment: performance evaluation of proposed methods after the threshold energy", "text": "In this area, all proposed methods are tested 10 times with random initial distribution of robots. In the third and fourth method, in addition to 10 workers, another 3 Chapar robots are used, which are faster than the workers. About Chapar station, it should be mentioned that the third method is equipped with 3 Chapar stations, whose communication radius is successively covered, and the fourth method is equipped with one of them, which is omniscient. Figure 4 (left) shows the results of the second abstract experiment. The absorption percentage is the percentage of success of the detection of points by robots after the threshold by applying the decision mechanism. As expected, the fourth method has the highest absorption percentage, which is 100%. This is due to the use of the global messaging system. The third method is second with 87.09% and after it the first and the second method with approximate absorption 76%."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "Most studies of swarm robots define their own test scenarios, which are then used to build a concrete swarm robot system capable of solving the problem, leading to an enormous amount of differently designed global missions and, as a result, to many different solutions that are difficult to compare [3]. Accordingly, the application of current methods in this area and the associated comparison with other methods is so difficult and in most cases impossible except to change the scenario, which in turn leads to a change in both the problem and the solutions. As stated earlier, Dasgupta's method is practicable for unknown environments with this difference that its global mission is different from the one proposed here. However, our proposed methods have a much more beneficial meaning than Dasgupta's. The proposed methods have Dasgupta Dasgupta for practical environments with this difference that their global task is different from the one proposed here."}, {"heading": "5.1 Scalability and Robustness in term of single point of failure", "text": "In this section, we will analyze the scalability and robustness of the proposed methods in terms of their efficiency. If adding or removing robots reduces the performance of a method, we will call it incalculable. Accordingly, both the first and the second methods are scalable, because both are distributed, autonomous and based on local communication. Thus, adding or removing robots will maintain their effectiveness. The decentralized Chapar method also has scalability characteristics, due to the use of the limited range of Chapar station, the worker-robots and the Chapar robots, which are distributed and behave locally. However, the centralized Chapar method, due to the use of omniscient Chapar stations in terms of their expected effectiveness, has no scalability characteristic.In terms of robustness, the first and second methods are completely robust against individual points of failure, because they behave in a distributed and autonomous manner."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "This paper presents a new practical scenario in swarm robotics, which deals with the distribution of tasks in unknown environments. We consider that there is a limited energy source for each robot. It is pointed out that energy management in the form of a 3-step structure is indispensable and that four self-organized threshold-based methods are proposed for solving the scenario.In addition, the performance of these methods is analyzed in two general experiments. From the results of the simulations, we can conclude that the second method is more efficient compared to the first before the threshold and therefore the performance of the third and fourth method is increased by applying it as an algorithm of their work robot.However, since the methods use similar communication mechanisms, they show almost the same performance after the threshold. Consequently, the fourth method shows the highest performance from the point of view of performance, followed by the third method, which in turn has a higher ranking than the other two. The second method is also in this criterion scalability and robustness better than the first."}, {"heading": "1. Bonabeau, E., Dorigo, M., Theraulaz, G. (1999).
