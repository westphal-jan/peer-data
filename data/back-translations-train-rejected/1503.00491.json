An obvious SATC strategy is to rank $\\mathcal{D}$ so that the documents that the classifier has labelled with the lowest confidence are top-ranked. In this work we show that this strategy is suboptimal. We develop new utility-theoretic ranking methods based on the notion of \\emph{validation gain}, defined as the improvement in classification effectiveness that would derive by validating a given automatically labelled document. We also propose a new effectiveness measure for SATC-oriented ranking methods, based on the expected reduction in classification error brought about by partially validating a list generated by a given ranking method. We report the results of experiments showing that, with respect to the baseline method above, and according to the proposed measure, our utility-theoretic ranking methods can achieve substantially higher expected reductions in classification error.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 2 Mar 2015 12:09:23 GMT  (200kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00491v1", "Forthcoming on ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data"]], "COMMENTS": "Forthcoming on ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["giacomo berardi", "rea esuli", "fabrizio sebastiani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.00491"}, "pdf": {"name": "1503.00491.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["name.lastname@isti.cnr.it", "fsebastiani@qf.org.qa", "permissions@acm.org."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The order in which the authors are listed is purely alphabetical; each author has made an equal contribution to this work.
