Maximal Partitioning of Graphs With Supply/Demand", "text": "The MPGSD is defined for an undirected graph G = (V, E) with a set of nodes V and a set of edges E. The set of nodes V is divided into two disjointed subsets Vs and Vd. Each node u-Vs is called a supply vertex and will have a corresponding positive integer value sup (u). Elements of the second subset v-Vd are called demand inverts and will have a corresponding positive integer value sup (v). The goal is to find a division \u0432 = {S1, S2,.., Sn} of the chart G that meets the following constraints. All subdiagrams must contain interconnected subdiagrams that contain only one unique supply node. As a result, we have | Vs | = n. Each of the Si must have a supply greater than or equal to total demand."}, {"heading": "3. Outline of Greedy Algorithm", "text": "In this section we give a brief overview of the greedy algorithm, for which the details relating to the EQS (28), which are used as the basis for the ACO method for the MPGSD (28), are. As already mentioned, the solution to the problem of interest is a set of n subgraphs, in which n = Vs (1), the number of delivery nodes (1), which we select in the first stage of the algorithm and use to extend a selected subgraph Si, which has only one delivery node S = {si}. In each of the following steps (iterations) of the algorithm, a vertex v (1), Vd is selected and used to extend a selected subgraph Si and Si. The selection of the two subgraphs Si and Si is performed in a way that satisfies the generated subgraphs."}, {"heading": "4. Application of Ant Colony Optimization", "text": "In this section, we present an ACO approach to solving the MPGSD, based on the greedy algorithm from [28] outlined in the previous section. The general idea of the ACO algorithms is to perform an \"intelligent\" randomization of an appropriate greedy algorithm for the problem of interest. In practice, there are several variants of the ACO from which the Ant Colony System [30] is most commonly used. In it, \"intelligence\" comes from experiences gained through previously generated solutions stored in a pheromone matrix. In practice, a column of n artificial ants generates solutions with a probabilistic algorithm based on a heuristic function and pheromone matrix. As in the case of the greedy algorithm, an ant generates a solution by extending a partial one by steps. The difference is that one of the n artificial ants generates solutions with a probabilistic algorithm, based on a hay generator."}, {"heading": "4.1. Algorithm Specification", "text": "In all the following equations, we will assume that we have a randomly selected subgraph rule with index s. (9) The heuristic function is defined first, based on the same heuristic function as in [28] defined in the following equation. (9) The logic behind this is that it becomes more difficult to meet high requirements as the algorithm progresses, as the available supply set is added to the subgraph as new vertices. (9) It is better to resolve high requirements early. By using the transition rule for individual ants, we can define the transition rule for individual ants. This selection is made using a combination of deterrent and probable steps."}, {"heading": "4.2. Implementation", "text": "In this section we will give details of the implementation of the proposed ACO algorithm. The first necessary step is the definition of a suitable quality function V alfor the solutions generated. This is done by using the following equations.T = \u2211 v Vs sup (v) (15) V al (B) = 1T \u2212 D (B) + 1 (16) Eq. 16 states that the quality of the solution is inversely proportional to the difference of T, the total initially available supply in G and the satisfied demand D (B) of partitioning. To avoid division by zero one is added to this value. By this measure, the initial value of all pheromone elements tvs is set to the value V al (G) where the solution is acquired using the previously outlined greedy algorithm. Specifically, it corresponds to the method presented in [28], where the maximum demand and the subgraph selection is heuristic."}, {"heading": "5. Results", "text": "This section compares the results of our experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed ACO methods. We give a comparison of the proposed ACO algorithms with which we are able to break the boundaries between the individual areas and the different approaches we are able to blur the boundaries between the individual areas. Calculation methods have been developed by the editors and the editors themselves, and the calculation methods have been elaborated by the editors in a way that the editors and editors themselves have taken into their own hands."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "The basic ACO algorithm was combined with a local search to improve the performance of the method. Our computational experiments showed that the proposed approach found the optimal solution in more than 50% of the test problem cases, with an average relative error of less than 0.5%. Tests were carried out on trees and general diagrams, and showed that the method is better suited for trees.In the future, we plan to adapt the method to a less restricted and stochastic version of the problem. This type of research can prove very beneficial for problems encountered in the field of electrical distribution systems, especially for optimizing the autonomy of networked microgrids and other related problems."}, {"heading": "100 X 1000 4.67(0.89) 2.29(0.22) 0.60(0.07) 7.04 2.71 0.74 0 0 0", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "100

We propose an ant colony optimization algorithm for the problem. With the goal of further improving the algorithm we combine it with a previously developed correction procedure. In our computational experiments we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on both trees and general graphs. The tests show that the method manages to find optimal solutions in more than 50% of the problem instances, and has an average relative error of less than 0.5% when compared to known optimal solutions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
