In (Beckers and Vennekens), we developed a general definition that includes several of them. However, the idea behind our general definition is that one should first modify theory T into a theory T * that takes into account the influence of actual history b, and then assess causality by applying the probabilistic extension of counterfactual dependence. The available operations for constructing T * are to make laws deterministically in accordance with the decisions made in b and to remove laws. A specific definition is achieved by specifying which laws fall under the first category - referred to as intrinsic laws and referred to as int - and those that fall under the second - referred to irrelevant laws and referred to as errone.1 We then construct T."}, {"heading": "3 The HH Extension to Actual Causation", "text": "In fact, it is that most of us are able to follow the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

(On the other hand, definitions of actual causality look at counterfactual stories that result from an intervention, namely do (\u00ac C), which violates the laws. Following HH, Def. 7 tries to circumvent the use of this intervention by simply requiring \u00ac C to hold. However, this solution is not always available, and if it is not, it counterintuitively delivers counterintuitive results. We illustrate what goes wrong by using the following theory: (A: 0.1) \u2190.C \u2190 C.E \u00ac A. Consider the story in which A first occurs, followed by C and E. Intuitively, C is a strong cause of E, even if one considers the typicality of C. The law with A in one's head is intrinsic, and thus T normal (b)."}, {"heading": "6 The Importance of Probabilities", "text": "Since the HH approach lacks the quantification of normality that probabilities offer, it discards all witnesses who are less normal than the real world. A direct consequence is that a typical event - P > 0.5 - is never a cause, which is quite radical. By using probabilities, this qualitative criterion is no longer necessary: less normal witnesses simply affect our judgment less. Furthermore, HH order causes only by looking at the best witnesses. We present an example that illustrates the benefit of both abandoning their criterion and aggregating the normality of witnesses to ordered causes without sacrificing the influence of normality."}, {"heading": "6.1 Why it is better to use (T \u2217)NN in the first factor", "text": "(3 3 3 3).

Therefore, the first head changes to T hrow (1,6): 0.6, which makes it a typical result. Therefore, the first law in T PN (b) becomes deterministic, resulting in the PTNormal (b) (\u00ac T hrow (1,6) = 0, which in turn leads to the counterintuitive judgment that the first roll in no way led to you winning the car. We therefore propose to use T NN in the second factor of inequality instead of T Normal (b), using the gradual measurement offered by probabilities. Applying this idea to the example, we get the result that T hrow (1,6) has a causal strength of 0.4, which is smaller than before, because the cause is now less atypical."}, {"heading": "6.4 The final definition", "text": "This brings us to our final extension of a definition of actual causality.
