For simplicity, a Markov model assumption is set up so that the predicted configuration of the opposing team only depends on its current lineup. The field is divided into a grid and per player a robot state is created with information about its position and speed. To get a more general impression of what the opposing team is doing, the state also takes into account the average position (centric) of the team. All possible state transitions are stored in a hash table, which requires minimal disk space. The table is equipped with transition probabilities, which are learned by reading vision packages and counting the state transitions independently of the respective robot player.

Introduction", "text": "In this category, each team consists of six cylindrical robots and a golf ball tracked by a vision system. The vision system consists of two overhead cameras that distribute information to both teams through coaching and tactical planning."}, {"heading": "2. Related work", "text": "Carnegie Mellon University's CMDragons were ranked as the second best team in the 2014 RoboCup in Brazil. Some of their best work focused on modeling opposing teams, and this system gave them a big advantage in the 2011 tournament, which reflected a stronger defense. Nevertheless, it must be said that this approach is outdated since it was introduced and tested three years ago. At that point, most participating teams exhibited prefabricated tactics with little or no adaptive play. CMDragons trained their system with games from previous tournaments, and their opponents did not change significantly before the next game."}, {"heading": "3.
