INTRODUCTION", "text": "In this paper, we address the problem of event visualization based on structured data, in the form of time-referenced and geo-referenced relative tuples, and unstructured data, in the form of free text. Information extraction systems based on the detection of named entities (NER) and the extraction of relationships have enabled detection of events described in free text and in the extraction of structured tuples describing the location, time and other attributes of an event. One limitation is the absence of veracity for high event activities. In some cases, this is due to a lack of well-defined criteria for activity and relevance, while it is based on limitations in existing annotations and trends, but remains an open problem. One limitation is the absence of basic probabilities for high event activity."}, {"heading": "2. EVENT VISUALIZATION TASKS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Spatiotemporal Event Extraction", "text": "The aim of event extraction is to identify phenomena related to specific actions, events, relationships or institutions. For example, a positive test for a contagious animal disease on a farm is an event that can be linked to an epidemic and is posthumously identified as indicating an outbreak. Confiscation of equipment from a methamphetamine production plant or waste products from a landfill is an example of an event in the field of drugs presented at EuroHCIR2012.

To this end, we developed two alternative access levels with a unified representation and geographic information system (GIS) data model, the first layer based on Google's Keyhole Markup Language (KML) and a file-based application programming interface (API), while the second layer is based on a PHP interface to a MySQL database that implements the KML schema. Our front-end application can be configured so that both schema can be used."}, {"heading": "2.3 Timeline Visualization", "text": "Figure 1 shows the data integration between map and timeline visualization subsystems. The seizure event in April 2010 is represented on the map by a pop-up notice, on the timeline of the monthly scale (top right) by a circular dot, and on the timeline of the annual scale (bottom right) by a circular dot."}, {"heading": "2.4 Thematic Mapping", "text": "The goal of the thematic mapping is to present phenomena and trends in a geospatial context. To this end, we have added a mapping overlay to the TimeMap framework that enables map transformations such as the overlay of data and layers of transparency using the Google Maps API, including Choropleth maps with dynamically predictable color palettes. Figure 2 is a Choropleth map that depicts seizures by state from meth laboratories in 2004. [3] This map, published by The Associated Press and published on the ABC News website in 2005, does not take into account population or population distribution within states. More importantly for information gathering applications, it does not provide a drill-down interface, cf. HealthMap [4] or similar event visualization services. One of the reasons for the development of the geospatial visualization components of TimeMap is that it provides access to well-established technical information and small-scale maps."}, {"heading": "2.5 Spatial Time Series Prediction", "text": "A final rationale for the TimeMap visualization framework stems from domain-specific data mining objectives in epidemiology and criminology. Government agencies dedicated to agriculture, public health, and law enforcement often face the need for predictive analysis tools to help in decision-making in both public policy and intervention, as well as public relations. In public health, tools like HealthMap [4] have begun to do for individual citizens what more general crime mapping systems are designed to do for search users: provide relevance filters based on criteria of incident frequency, corroborative reporting, and relevance."}, {"heading": "3. TOPIC MODELING", "text": "As mentioned in Section 2.1, identifying named entities in combination with date and place can provide a way to extract a stream of events and updates from news, including microblogs and other social media. However, in order to classify new events and detect the emergence or revival of new event-related topics, a mechanism is needed to monitor update flows. This requires a more flexible theme model than the fixed or extensible sets of named entities used for structured information extraction. In addition, the frequency and semantic heterogeneity of event reporting from multiple media, even on the web alone, requires an enrichment of parameters beyond those used in classical generative models of information extraction."}, {"heading": "3.1 Static Topic Models", "text": "Figure 3 illustrates the type of Bayesian generative theme model widely used to cluster static document collections. Here, s is a theme distribution for a document, while Z is the theme sampled by s for word W. \"d\" is a Markov matrix that indicates the word distribution per topic, and j is the dirichlet parameter before creating this matrix."}, {"heading": "3.2 Dynamic Topic Models", "text": "As our preliminary experiments with historical data on both outbreaks of animal diseases and bouts of meth laboratories have shown, flashes of news do not permit the stationarity assumed in Figure 3. In particular, the latent variables of our theme model change over time as a result of concept shifts and the emergence of new themes that we can imagine as a process linked to observable events between birth and death. Lead and Lafferty (2006) proposed a dynamic theme model with a fixed number K, in which word distribution and popularity of each topic are linked over time. [5] Meanwhile, older theme modeling algorithms such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) [6], which allow K to suffer variably from problems such as the proximity of different senses of a polysemeric word, while the variants Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) [7] exhibit linear parameter growth in the number of documents."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Discrete Time, Infinite Topic", "text": "Ahmed and Xing (2010) proposed a partial solution to this problem by introducing an infnites dynamic topic model (iDTM) that allows an unlimited number of topics and an evolving representation of topics according to Markovian dynamics. [8] They analyzed the birth and evolution of topics in the neural computation community based on the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference procedures, and their model developed topics across individual epochs (units of time). All conference procedures fall into the same epoch. This model does not suit less \"inflated\" topic applications such as laboratory seizures or disease outbreaks that are asynchronous whether reported in the news or in local law enforcement records. In modeling topics such as event visualization, such a discrete time model can be too fragile. An extension to continuous time gives it the flexibility needed to take into account variability and temporal changes in granularity."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Continuous Time, Finite Topic", "text": "In the meantime, Wang et al. (2008) proposed a continuously time-dynamic topic model that simulates the evolution of topics over time. [9] Although this model uses a novel, sparsely varying Kalman filter algorithm for quick inference, the number of topics from which it scans is limited, severely limiting its application in story creation and article aggregation in the news feed. If the number of topics covered by the news feed is smaller than the number of topics K specified in the model, similar stories appear under other headings. On the other hand, when the number of topics covered exceeds the preset number of topics, topics and headlines are mixed."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 Proposed: Continuous Time, Infinite Topic", "text": "To meet the needs of unbloated news updates in areas such as our event visualization domains, we propose a hybridization of the infinite theme model and the continuous time model, which combines a hierarchical Dirichlet process (DP) for dynamic abstraction and refinement of themes with Brownian motion to capture stochastic theme writing. [10] We can use a varying inference algorithm such as the variable Kalman filter to factorize variable distribution via latent variables: where d is word distribution over themes, and vice versa, word distribution over themes is for time 1: T, topic z1: T, and word index 1: N, where N is the size of the document lexicon."}, {"heading": "4.1 Prior Work: Veterinary Epidemiology", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4. APPLICATION TEST BED", "text": "Volkova & Hsu (2010) describes previous work on computerized information and knowledge management (CICM) and information extraction. [11] This research, motivated by the need to visualize the digestion of news articles on animal disease outbreaks as shown in Figure 4, led to the earliest prototype of our event visualization system implemented using Google Maps and MIT SIMILE, which used syntactic detectors for semantic equivalence claims (Volkova et al., 2010). [12]"}, {"heading": "4.2 Kansas Meth Lab Seizures", "text": "A newer version of the event visualization system is present in the meth laboratory application described in Sections 1 and 2. This system is the test bed for both the visualization techniques described in Section 2 and the modeling techniques on the subject, which aim to increase the precision of the federated system by improving relevance filtering and ranking."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION", "text": "In our thematic model, these are event types covering 50 different types of meth amphetamine laboratory seizures. Given the text of a laboratory seizure report or news story of the event with the date and location as the earlier date, we can use the thematic model shown in Figure 3 to assess the likelihood of the event in light of the previous event. Events with a probability value above a threshold are considered highly probable given the location and time of the event. In light of a collection of police laboratory seizure reports with date and location, we performed the thematic model on it and evaluated the composition of each report in the collection. Table 1 shows the percentage of \"abandoned landfill sites\" per seizure report for four Kansas counties over a six-year period. If we set a probability threshold of 0.02, the event for the year 2000 will be marked on the map for Cowley and Renties."}, {"heading": "6. CONTINUING AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "As part of our further work, we validate the initial data of the LDA by using it to filter and classify search results from the seizure database shown in Figure 5 and Table 1. Relevance feedback from multiple subject matter experts is used to evaluate both LDA and DP-based subject models. [11]"}, {"heading": "7.
