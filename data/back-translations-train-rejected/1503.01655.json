Our diagrams contain a directed edge from one article to another if the text of the first article contains a hyperlink to the second article. In addition, we also include hyperlinks in info boxes. The graph contains two types of nodes (articles and categories) and three types of directed edges: hyperlinks from article to article (H), infobox links from article to article (I), links from article to category and links from category to category (C). We have constructed several graphics that use different combinations of nodes and edges. In addition to the directed versions (D), we also have an undirected version of articles (U), and a reduced graphic that contains only links that are reciproactive."}, {"heading": "3.1 Building the dictionary", "text": "To link running text to the articles in the graph, we use a dictionary, i.e. a static association between mentions with all sorts of articles that the mention can refer to. We have created our dictionary from the same Wikipedia dump, with article titles, redirects, clarification pages and anchor text. Mention strings are lowercase and any text between brackets is removed. If an anchor points to a clarification page, the text is associated with all sorts of articles that the clarification page refers to. Any association between a mention and an article is evaluated with the previous probability, estimated as the number of times the mention occurs in an anchor divided by the scale edges and could otherwise be avoided."}, {"heading": "4 Random Walks", "text": "The PageRank Random Walk Algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998) is a method of ranking vertices in a chart according to their relative structural significance. PageRank can be considered the result of a random walk process in which the final rank of the node i represents the probability of a random path across the graph ending on node i, at a sufficiently large time.Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a variant of the PageRank (Haveliwala, 2002), in which the user's query defines the importance of each node, distorting the resulting PageRank value to favor nodes near the query nodes. Query distortion is also called a teleport vector. PPR has been successfully used on the WordNet chart for relativity (Hughes and Ramage, 2007; Agirre et al., 2010) and Wre (Agiret, 2014) Soroa."}, {"heading": "4.1 Random walks on Wikipedia", "text": "In fact, it is that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able to change the world, and that we are able to change the world, \"he said."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental methodology", "text": "We summarize the data sets used in Table 4. RG, MC, and 353 are the most commonly used reference records, with TSA and KORE being newer records in which some high-level systems were evaluated. Word reference records have been lemmatized and reduced in size, except for KORE, which is a reference record in which input includes articles. [8] The following standard practice rankcorrelation (spearman) was used for the evaluation. [8] We had to manually adjust the articles in KORE because the exact title depends on the Wikipedia version. We overlooked 3 for our 2013 version, which might slightly worsen our results. In terms of NED, the Entity Linking competition is held annually. Due to its popularity, it is useful to determine the state of the art."}, {"heading": "5.1 Development and test", "text": "Unfortunately, there is no standard breakdown in the literature, 9Corresponds to the non-NIL accuracy of TAC-KBP (also referred to as KB accuracy) and Micro P @ 1.0 in (Hoffart et al., 2011) 10See (Cornolti et al., 2013) for a framework to evaluate both detection and ambiguity. 11http: / / en.wikipedia.org / w / api.phpand the choice is difficult: the development data should be representative enough to draw conclusions about various alternatives and parameters, but at the same time the most relevant data sets in the literature should be left for review in order to have enough points for comparison. Furthermore, some of the most recent algorithms determining the state of the art are only tested on the newly created data sets."}, {"heading": "6 Studying the graph and parameters", "text": "In this section, we will examine the performance of the various graphics and parameters on the two development datasets, RG and TAC09200. The next section reports on the results of the tests for the best parameters to be found in the various areas of the system. It is only a matter of time before the individual parameters and variants in each area are optimized. We first checked all possible combinations of different graphics with which we set the remaining parameters. We then answered the following questions: Which links help most?

We follow a clear development / testing / analysis method based on a wide range of both relations and NED datasets.
