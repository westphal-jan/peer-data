In particular, recent approaches for discovering similar motifs of different lengths have been proposed. In this work, we show that such variable-length similarity-based motifs cannot be directly compared, and hence ranked, by their normalized dissimilarities. Specifically, we find that length-normalized motif dissimilarities still have intrinsic dependencies on the motif length, and that lowest dissimilarities are particularly affected by this dependency. Moreover, we find that such dependencies are generally non-linear and change with the considered data set and dissimilarity measure. Based on these findings, we propose a solution to rank those motifs and measure their significance. This solution relies on a compact but accurate model of the dissimilarity space, using a beta distribution with three parameters that depend on the motif length in a non-linear way. We believe the incomparability of variable-length dissimilarities could go beyond the field of time series, and that similar modeling strategies as the one used here could be of help in a more broad context.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Mar 2015 09:10:34 GMT  (318kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01883v1", "20 pages, 10 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["joan serr\\`a", "isabel serra", "\\'alvaro corral", "josep lluis arcos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.01883"}, "pdf": {"name": "1503.01883.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Ranking and significance of variable-length similarity-based time series motifs", "authors": ["Joan Serr\u00e0", "Isabel Serra", "\u00c1lvaro Corral", "Josep Lluis Arcos"], "emails": ["jserra@iiia.csic.es", "iserra@crm.cat", "acorral@crm.cat", "arcos@iiia.csic.es"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Recognition of very similar patterns in a time series commonly referred to as motives has received continuous and increasing attention from various scientific communities.

Quantitative evaluation", "text": "In order to quantify the incomparability of d with respect to the smaller fluctuations in distribution differences, we need two basic measures of the difference between distributions. First, we look at the global discrepancy between empirical CDFs compared to each other. We quantify them by the total number of probability distributions (Levin et al., 2009), where there is an arbitrary difference between the two empirical CDFs compared to each other. Nevertheless, since we use CDFs and take the average, there is a quick and intuitive idea of the average difference between distributions. The resolution for all the experiments we have reported here corresponds to k = 100 equally graded values between the minimum and maximum values of each sample. Since we are interested in the best motives, we must pay particular attention to the smaller fluctuations in distribution differences."}, {"heading": "3. Modeling motif dissimilarities", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. Main idea", "text": "In order to overcome the disadvantages described in the previous section, we now propose a method for modelling the dissimilarity space. Our goal is to build a compact model of the empirical dissimilarity distributions for each W. We want to transform the dissimilarity space into a unified probability space in which motives of different lengths can be compared in a meaningful way. In paragraph 2, we have seen that in the face of two longitudinally normalized dissimilarity di and dj derived from wi and wj, the relationship di < dj does not necessarily mean that dj should be classified by di. Our observation is that by looking at an estimated CDF for each w, we can mix motifs of different lengths and compare them meaningfully."}, {"heading": "3.2. Preliminary analysis", "text": "An illustration of the empirical probability distribution function (PDFs) for deviations from fixed values is shown in Fig. 7. Note that a Gaussian model might initially appear to be a reasonable model, but this is not the case. Gaussian model is a good model for the central part of an empirical distribution, but it has the caveat that kurtosis is always zero. Therefore, it does not model the observed tails correctly. In contrast, the motive discovery task based on similarity requires accurate estimates of the tails of such distributions. In fact, we are only interested in the smallest existing inequalities. Therefore, our modeling task requires a good model for the tails. In particular, it requires a model with a good fit in the left, lowest distribution limit. Extreme Value Theory (EVT) focuses on the exact modeling of the tail (Beirlant)."}, {"heading": "3.3. Model fit", "text": "The beta distribution typically depends on two form parameters, each corresponding to the tail index of each page (\u03b2 \u03b2 = 3). The extreme value for near-zero dissimilarity is zero, but in the case of the maximum we have seen that it depends on the original data sets and therefore we use the three parameters Beta DistributionP (d) = 1mB (\u03b1, \u03b2) (dm) -1 (1 \u2212 dm) \u03b2 \u2212 1, (1), where there are the so-called form parameters, m is a scale parameter, and B (\u03b1, \u03b2) is the beta function. Eq. 1 is defined for 0 \u2264 d \u2264 m. For values outside this range P (d) = 0.We start by adjusting a beta distribution for each w. We do this by applying the maximum probability."}, {"heading": "3.4. Model usage", "text": "As already mentioned, our final goal is to \"normalize\" the deviation space with respect to variations in w. To do this, we only need to calculate \u03b1w, \u03b2w and mw according to Eqs. 3-7 and consider the CDF of the proposed model Pw (D \u2264 d) = B (d mw; \u03b1w, \u03b2w) B (\u03b1w, \u03b2w), where B (x; \u03b1, \u03b2) is the incomplete beta function, a generalization of the beta function. The incomplete beta function can be efficiently calculated using functions commonly found in spreadsheet or programming systems (Press et al., 2007). Since Pw (D \u2264 d) is defined only for 0 \u2264 d \u2264 mw, we suggest the new deviation measured \u2032 = 0 if d < 0Pw (D \u2264 d) is equal for the accuracy of this position, if 0 \u2264 d is equal for the accuracy (D \u2264 d) or the accuracy of other motifs of different lengths under the same conditions."}, {"heading": "3.5. Model validation", "text": "In order to measure the quality of the model fit Pw, we refer to the measures introduced in paragraph 2.2: the global discrepancy between empirical CDF and pKS, the p-value of the KS test at the lowest quartile of the samples. The only difference is that the pKS value here is not the result of a test with two samples, but the result of a quality test for the plausibility of our proposed model in view of the available samples (we adapt the generative procedure for bootstrap described by Clauset et al. (2009) to the current model. If we calculate all the measured variables and data sets considered and calculate pKS, we see that the inserted models generally provide a good correlation with the data (Fig. 9). In general, the pKS value is never above 0.02 and rarely above 0.01. The pKS value is often above 0.05, indicating that we can reject the zero hypotheses of the swan fit = 0.0002, which is relative to the 0000z = the 0.000z used for Jones."}, {"heading": "4.

Motif sampling", "text": "In view of the formal definition of similarity-based time series motifs (Mueen et al., 2009), we only need to scan the motif space to obtain possible motif candidates.

That is, at a motif length w we randomly generate the beginning of the segments that form the motif, i, j [1, N \u2212 w], where N is the time series length, so that, if not stated otherwise, we look at wmin = 5 and wmax = 500, i.e. w [5, 500]."}, {"heading": "4.4.

Conclusion", "text": "The main contribution of the current work is to show that time series dissidences of different lengths are not directly comparable and therefore cannot be evaluated. Through both motivational examples and formal quantitative analysis, we have shown (1) that they have the least differences in terms of motif, (2) that these dependencies change with the data and measure the dissidence, and (3) that they have the least differences in terms of interest in similarity to the motif. (3) Another contribution of the current work is a solution to address the evolved problems and measure the dissidence, and (3) that they relate to the least differences in terms of motif."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank all those who contributed the data sets used in this study, which were financed by the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Spanish government: 2009-SGR-1434 (JS, JLA), 2014-SGR-1307 (AC, IS), FIS2012-31324 (AC), MTM2012-31118 (IS) and TIN2012-38450-C03-03 (JS, JLA)."}], "references": [{"title": "The UCI machine learning repository", "author": ["K.

In particular, recent approaches for discovering similar motifs of different lengths have been proposed. In this work, we show that such variable-length similarity-based motifs cannot be directly compared, and hence ranked, by their normalized dissimilarities. Specifically, we find that length-normalized motif dissimilarities still have intrinsic dependencies on the motif length, and that lowest dissimilarities are particularly affected by this dependency. Moreover, we find that such dependencies are generally non-linear and change with the considered data set and dissimilarity measure. Based on these findings, we propose a solution to rank those motifs and measure their significance. This solution relies on a compact but accurate model of the dissimilarity space, using a beta distribution with three parameters that depend on the motif length in a non-linear way. We believe the incomparability of variable-length dissimilarities could go beyond the field of time series, and that similar modeling strategies as the one used here could be of help in a more broad context.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
