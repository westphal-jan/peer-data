Theoretically, one can achieve a regret about O (\u221a n logLT). One of the most important open questions within this framework concerns closing the above gap. In this paper, we give a complete answer to the above question based on two main results: We show by closer analysis that the semi-definitive programming algorithm for local online learning implies with less regret a polynomic age algorithm for the planted click problem, which is widely assumed to be hard. Second, we show a similar hardness result among a related assumption about planted, dense subgraphs that we make.

It then earns a real, estimated payout, which is a function of the predicted labels. The goal is to achieve a complete payout in T-rounds comparable to the best expert, i.e., the best fixed label of items at each stage. The difference from the best possible payout is known as the regret of the algorithms. The weighted majority of algorithms (Littlestone and Warmuth) achieve the optimal regret of O (T logN) for the above problem (T is the number of rounds, N is the total number of experts), but is computationally efficient only if the number of experts is small."}, {"heading": "1.1 Techniques", "text": "We obtain the above-mentioned upper limit of regret by showing that \"Re-the-regularized-leader\" achieves the repentance we claim with the same regulator as (Christiano, 2014a), but with a completely different analysis. There, the idea is to express the entropy of a multivariate Gaussian regret with respect to the log determinant of its covariance matrix, and that two multivariate Gaussian distributions, which differ by a small amount in their covariance matrices, cannot be too far, even in the total variation distance. The main reason for this approach in (Christiano, 2014a) is that the Hesse of the log-determinant regulator is not diagonal, so it is difficult to argue about its inversion. We use the special structure of the regulator to obtain explicit expressions for the inversion, which allows us to use further standard tools from the conactive follow-leader for the \"exact geometry analysis.\""}, {"heading": "1.2 The planted dense subgraph and planted clique problems", "text": "We will review the planted clique conjecture and describe the dense subgraph conjecture on which we will base our lower boundaries."}, {"heading": "1.2.1 Planted clique", "text": "In the planted clique problem, one gets a graph from one of two possible random ensembles: a terdo \ufffd sRe \ufffd nyi random graph G (n, 1 / 2) or an erdo \ufffd s re \ufffd nyi random graph G (n, 1 / 2) together with a clique of size k placed between randomly selected vertices in the graph. (The usual notation for this random ensemble is G (n, 1 / 2, k).) The task is to distinguish whether one puts a graph from the G (n, 1 / 2) ensemble or the G (n, 1 / 2, k) ensemble. Previous work sequences (Feldman et al., 2013), (Meka et al., 2015) show that broad classes of natural polynomic time algorithms cannot efficiently distinguish between these two cases if the size of the planted clique n is (man et al, 2013), and that these cases are polymical (al, 2015)."}, {"heading": "1.2.2 Planted dense subgraph", "text": "The main reason for this scenario is a natural generalization of the planted clique, in which one again wants to distinguish between a random and a planted instance.

The reduction will ensure that if we can achieve a sufficiently low repentance in polynomial time, we will obtain a benefit of at least bp \u2212 r in the planted case, so that bp \u2212 r, with probability 45.

In this framework, the algorithm is shown a pair of items at each step, chosen from a set of n items. The learner then predicts a label for each item, from a label set of size L and receives a real valued payoff. This is a natural framework which captures many interesting scenarios such as online gambling and online max cut. (Christiano, 2014a) designed an efficient online learning algorithm for this problem achieving a regret of O( \u221a nLT ), where T is the number of rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of O( \u221a n logLT ). One of the main open questions left in this framework concerns closing the above gap. In this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main results. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-definite programming based algorithm of (Christiano, 2014a) in fact achieves a regret of O( \u221a nLT ). Second, we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely, we show that a polynomial time algorithm for online local learning with lower regret would imply a polynomial time algorithm for the planted clique problem which is widely believed to be hard. We prove a similar hardness result under a related conjecture concerning planted dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike planted clique, the planted dense subgraph problem does not have any known quasi-polynomial time algorithms. Computational lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we hope that the ideas developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other online learning scenarios as well.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
