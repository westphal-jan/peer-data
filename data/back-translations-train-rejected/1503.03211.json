The procedure for forecasting SFR are rigid and most often times require data scaling or conversion into binary form such as is the case of the logistic model which may lead to lose of information and effect size attenuation. Also, the high number of factors, incomplete and unbalanced dataset, and black boxing issues as in Artificial Neural Networks and Fuzzy logic systems exposes the need for more efficient tools. Currently the application of Genetic Programming (GP) holds great promises and has produced tremendous positive results in different sectors. In this regard, this study developed GPSFARPS, a software application to provide a robust solution to the prediction of SFR using an evolutionary algorithm known as multi-gene genetic programming. The approach is validated by feeding a testing data set to the evolved GP models. Result obtained from GPSFARPS simulations show its unique ability to evolve a suitable failure rate expression with a fast convergence at 30 generations from a maximum specified generation of 500. The multi-gene system was also able to minimize the evolved model expression and accurately predict student failure rate using a subset of the original expression", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Mar 2015 08:17:11 GMT  (434kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03211v1", "14 pages, 9 figures, Journal paper. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1403.0623by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 9 figures, Journal paper. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1403.0623by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["j o orove", "n e osegi", "b o eke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.03211"}, "pdf": {"name": "1503.03211.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Multi-Gene Genetic Programming Application for Predicting Students Failure at School", "authors": ["J.O.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "It refers to the proportion (or proportion) of students who have not graduated from a chosen course of study. However, it is an important aspect of educational planning that contributes to assessing the performance of their existing curriculum. However, it is necessary to examine these parameters. There is an aggressive call to reduce student failure rates, especially in mathematics and computer science. Social graphs and data collection in mining system techniques are largely affected by student failure rates. Logistics and multiple regression techniques have also been used to reduce student failure rates."}, {"heading": "3.

Typically, GP solutions develop individual programs encoded in a structure called a gene or gene tree. At the beginning of a GP algorithm, the genes or expression trees are randomly initialized within a workable solution space, and then subjected to reproduction, crossover and mutation. Reproduction is a technique that replicates new genes from the original parent genes that resemble sexual reproduction in the programming tournament. The programming tournament can be compared as an environment of competing programs in which the best of them are selected as the ultimate winners. [13] The two most important genetic operations during reproduction are: (i) crossover: This involves the exchange of genetic material between the solutions or genes (ii) mutation: these are random changes (additions and deletions) within a gene itself."}, {"heading": "3.2 Genetic Programming Process", "text": "The basic mathematical formulas that guide genetic programming and the corresponding pseudo-codes are not new and are given in [12]. Generally, a GP system attempts to minimize the mean square error of the adapted data by developing several solutions at different time intervals. A typical architecture of a GP programming sequence is shown in Figure 1. A genetic programming process begins by providing genetic programming with basic building blocks of the solution and some methods for analyzing how well a proposed solution solves the problem. It also follows the provision of genetic programming with the fitness metrics that genetic programming (GP) applies to the generation of solutions. Figure 1 presents the process analysis of genetic programming is4 and clearly shows that the first set of solutions that are generated will not be the final solution. Instead, the solutions that develop over a certain number of times remain until an optimal solution is found. In the illustration, it is clear that the solution begins with an individual GP and that an individual GP is trying to improve the suctional solution."}, {"heading": "3.3 GP Model Solutions and Methodology", "text": "The first step in the conception of a genetic programming is the conception of the problem presentation.

We applied the concept of cross-over and mutation to develop a random population of individual solution programs and obtained a best-adapted model for the specified GP parameters. Graphic reports are generated using MATLAB \u00a9 graphics technology. [15] Using the interactive software GPSFARPS, GP parameters can be specified and meaningful characteristics observed at runtime. A parsimonious model can be achieved if the core GP parameters, in particular the number of generations, population size, tournament size, tree depth, number of gene trees and number of genes are limited. From Figure 8, we have shown that specifying any number of generations does not significantly improve system performance beyond possible achievable limits (log fitness versus generation plot). We should also point out here that minimal logic, such as the local I, can be achieved with this type of network, may be similar to the local I."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "An object-oriented evolutionary software application has been developed for the development of model expressions that can predict pupil failure rates at school, the system has been fed with incomplete raw score data, and the simulated response has been satisfactory with a fast convergence rate - about 30 generations at a set maximum generation of 500 and a minimum model expression consisting of only 4 predictor variables out of a total of six predictor variables. It can safely be used to facilitate predictions of complex data by using the software interface, which will be open source and made available on the web to facilitate further development."}, {"heading": "7. SIGNIFICANCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK", "text": "This paper introduces a software application for predicting the failure rate of students at school. It is capable of regenerating expressions from failure rate models based on the raw values of a time series dependent student as input parameters, and these model expressions can in turn be used by school administrators to determine the failure rate of students at school. It can be made more useful by integrating an inflating mechanism. Further research is required to test the effect of two state logical data on the developed GP software system, thereby improving the functional database and making the program platform independent. A step in this direction is also the development of an appropriate software framework that promotes end user programming of the functional dataset. An interactive-agile functional dataset to facilitate end user programming of GPSFARPS in a future design is therefore proposed."}], "references": [{"title": "The Failure Rate of Hospitality Management Students in Win Courses at Tshwane University of Technology: Exploring Probable Causes", "author": ["J Annelize"], "venue": "Faculty of Management Sciences Tshwane", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Predicting Student Exam\u2019s Scores by Analyzing Social Network Data", "author": ["M Fire", "G.

predict student failure rate (SFR) at school accurately still remains a core problem area faced by many in the educational sector. The procedure for forecasting SFR are rigid and most often times require data scaling or conversion into binary form such as is the case of the logistic model which may lead to lose of information and effect size attenuation. Also, the high number of factors, incomplete and unbalanced dataset, and black boxing issues as in Artificial Neural Networks and Fuzzy logic systems exposes the need for more efficient tools. Currently the application of Genetic Programming (GP) holds great promises and has produced tremendous positive results in different sectors. In this regard, this study developed GPSFARPS, a software application to provide a robust solution to the prediction of SFR using an evolutionary algorithm known as multi-gene genetic programming. The approach is validated by feeding a testing data set to the evolved GP models. Result obtained from GPSFARPS simulations show its unique ability to evolve a suitable failure rate expression with a fast convergence at 30 generations from a maximum specified generation of 500. The multigene system was also able to minimize the evolved model expression and accurately predict student failure rate using a subset of the original expression.", "creator": "Nitro Pro 8  (8. 0. 10. 7)"}}}
