A recent paradigm, called shapelets, represents patterns that are highly predictive for the target variable. Shapelets are discovered by measuring the prediction accuracy of a set of potential (shapelet) candidates. The candidates typically consist of all the segments of a dataset, therefore, the discovery of shapelets is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel method that avoids measuring the prediction accuracy of similar candidates in Euclidean distance space, through an online clustering pruning technique. In addition, our algorithm incorporates a supervised shapelet selection that filters out only those candidates that improve classification accuracy. Empirical evidence on 45 datasets from the UCR collection demonstrate that our method is 3-4 orders of magnitudes faster than the fastest existing shapelet-discovery method, while providing better prediction accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Mar 2015 09:38:49 GMT  (1110kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03238v1", "Under review in the journal \"Knowledge and Information Systems\" (KAIS)"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review in the journal \"Knowledge and Information Systems\" (KAIS)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["josif grabocka", "martin wistuba", "lars schmidt-thieme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.03238"}, "pdf": {"name": "1503.03238.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Scalable Discovery of Time-Series Shapelets", "authors": ["Josif Grabocka", "Martin Wistuba", "Lars Schmidt-Thieme"], "emails": ["josif@ismll.uni-hildesheim.de", "wistuba@ismll.uni-hildesheim.de", "schidt-thieme@ismll.uni-hildesheim.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "II.

Distances from formulas to series can be used as classification characteristics, also known as shapelet-transformed characteristics [2], [6]. The distance of a shapelet of a candidate to the next segment of a series can be perceived as a degree of belonging to that particular shapelet.

Quantification of Similarity Using a Distance Threshold", "text": "Since series of the same class follow a similar structure, similar patterns are repeated over time series of the same class. Similarities can also be observed between time series of different classes, since classes are often discriminated against by differences in small sub-sequences, rather than by the global structure. Consequently, we overturn the hypothesis that existing state-of-the-art techniques, which comprehensively search all candidates, inefficiently take into account many very similar patterns. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of distances among arbitrary pairs of candidate segments from different time series in the UCR collection of data sets [16]. As shown in Figure (a), the distribution of distances is highly sketched, indicating that most candidates are very similar to each other. However, threshold separation at similarity distance is required in order to use segments as similar or not."}, {"heading": "C. Main Method: Scalable Discovery of Time-series Shapelets", "text": "The scalable discovery of the Shapelets time series follows the two primary principles of this work: i) pruning similar candidates, and ii) on-the-fly supervised selection of shapelets. The rationality of these principles is based on the knowledge that the majority of candidates from each specific candidate series resemble candidates, whether candidates in other rows of the same dataset. Therefore, it is mathematically not optimal to measure the quality of the many very similar candidates. Instead, we aim to consider only a small core of non-redundant candidates.

A Modular Decomposition of the Performance", "text": "We have seen that our proposed method, SD, significantly exceeds the state of the art in terms of runtime = does not produce better predictive accuracy. However, there are a few questions that can be addressed to our method, such as: 1) What fraction of the SD runtime shortening is attributed to the novel candidate and what fraction of the PAA compression? 2) To what extent does circumcision imply a deterioration in predictive accuracy? To address these analytical questions, we will dissect our method in a modular manner. Our method, SD, performs both a PAA approximation and a circumcision according to the parameters r, p provided in Table II. To isolate the effects of compression and circumcision, we create four variants of our method, namely the permutations \"With / Without PAA compression\" and \"Without PAA compression.\""}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "Shapelets represent discriminatory segments of a time series dataset, and the distances from time series to shapelets are proving to be successful characteristics for classification. Currently, the discovery of shapelets takes place by testing candidates from the segments (sub-sequences) of the time series. As the number of candidate segments is large, the time series community has made efforts to speed up the discovery time of shapelets. In this paper, a new method has been proposed that truncates candidates based on a distance threshold to other similar candidates previously considered. In parallel, a novel supervised selection filters those shapelets that increase classification accuracy. We have empirically demonstrated that our method is 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than the fastest existing shapelet detection methods while providing better predictive accuracy."}], "references": [{"title": "Time series shapelets: a new primitive for data mining", "author": ["L.

range of application domains involving time-series data. A recent paradigm, called shapelets, represents patterns that are highly predictive for the target variable. Shapelets are discovered by measuring the prediction accuracy of a set of potential (shapelet) candidates. The candidates typically consist of all the segments of a dataset, therefore, the discovery of shapelets is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel method that avoids measuring the prediction accuracy of similar candidates in Euclidean distance space, through an online clustering pruning technique. In addition, our algorithm incorporates a supervised shapelet selection that filters out only those candidates that improve classification accuracy. Empirical evidence on 45 datasets from the UCR collection demonstrate that our method is 3-4 orders of magnitudes faster than the fastest existing shapelet-discovery method, while providing better prediction accuracy.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
