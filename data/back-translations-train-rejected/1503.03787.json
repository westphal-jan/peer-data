The name Orchestrated machines is partly inspired by the Penrose - Hameroff Orchestrated Objective Reduction (OrchOR) model of quantum consciousness [5].The taste of our algorithms in question is reminiscent of the dynamics of Neumann's U and R processes [15] and the dynamics of the intuitive Cell Automation Example [5] in the sense that a transition rule is selected non-deterministically from applicable rules (R), then this selected rule is executed in all Turing machines (U), and so on."}, {"heading": "2.1 Orchestrated machines", "text": "The complete pseudo-code for orchestrated machines is in Alg. 1. As input, the algorithm receives a series of Turing machines. The initial state of the orchestrated machine is that the heads of the Turing machines contained read zero and the machines are in their initial state, which can be applicable to the actual value of the machines. If a machine G does not have such a rule, then it pauses and is removed from the orchestrated machine in line 10.

Among purebred machine types, we have defined two unpredictable overall functions EQ and IQ to catalyze the search for more interesting types of machinery.In this paper, the time complexity of orchestrated machines has not been investigated, but it is clear that the NP OM1P, where OM1P denotes the class of decision problems that can be solved by an orchestrated machine (with OrchMach1 algorithm) in polynomial time.This inclusion follows from theorem 3. We have many other exciting and unanswered questions for future research. In this paper, for example, the orchestrated machines were built from turing machines. Is it possible that an orchestrated machine can be constructed from orchestrated machines (if we believe that machine cyclopediments are good for each other)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "Some of the calculations presented in this paper were performed on the NIIF High Performance Computing Supercomputer at the University of Debrecen."}], "references": [{"title": "Recombinations of Busy Beaver Machines", "author": ["N.
