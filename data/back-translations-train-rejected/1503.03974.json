In the STN semester paper [18], Dechter et al. is first proposed to consider the temporary problem of satisfaction (TCSP). A binary constraint in a TCSP is represented by a series of intervals, not by a single interval as in an STN. In particular, a binary constraint on authors \"satisfaction (TCSP), [a2, b2], [al, bl]} between times representing the xi and xj disjunctions is presented."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In the literature, there are various frameworks and approaches aimed at extending the STN model, which allows the representation of disjunctive time constraints [18, 44], but at the expense of an exponential time consistency test. The only extension with a polynomial time consistency test that we know of is that of Kumar [40], which was proposed in Section 8. In this paper, a novel extension called Hyper Temporal Network (HyTN) is proposed in which it is possible to test a new type of disjunctive constraint, hyperconstraint, and the consistency of a network in pseudo-polynomial time. Hyperconsistency is a suitable set of STN distance constraints and it is isfied when at least one distance constraint is met. There could be two types of hyperticity constraints: multiheader and multiple consistency hyperconsistencies."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "Simple Temporal Networks (STNs) provide a powerful and general tool for representing conjunctions of maximum delay constraints over ordered pairs of temporal variables.
