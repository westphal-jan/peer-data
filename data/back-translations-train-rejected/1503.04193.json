We concentrate on extensions of variants of Linear Logic with one minimal non-normal modality. In earlier work, where we investigated agency in multi-agent systems, we have shown that the results scale up to logics with multiple non-minimal modalities. Here, we start with the language of propositional intuitionistic Linear Logic without the additive disjunction, to which we add a modality. We provide an interpretation of this language on a class of Kripke resource models extended with a neighbourhood function: modal Kripke resource models. We propose a Hilbert-style axiomatization and a Gentzen-style sequent calculus. We show that the proof theories are sound and complete with respect to the class of modal Kripke resource models. We show that the sequent calculus allows cut elimination and that proof-search is in PSPACE. We then show how to extend the results when non-commutative connectives are added to the language. Finally, we put the logical framework to use by instantiating it as logics of agency. In particular, we propose a logic to reason about the resource-sensitive use of artefacts and illustrate it with a variety of examples.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Mar 2015 19:54:15 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04193v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 4 Sep 2015 15:16:44 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04193v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["daniele porello", "nicolas troquard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.04193"}, "pdf": {"name": "1503.04193.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Non-normal modalities in variants of Linear Logic", "authors": ["Daniele Porello", "Nicolas Troquard"], "emails": ["daniele.porello@loa.istc.cnr.it", "troquard@loa.istc.cnr.it"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 150 3.04 193v 1 [cs.L O] 13 Mar 2"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "It is not only a question of time, but also of the way in which it is about the question of what the future of the world is like, and what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the world is like, what the future of the future of the world is like, what the future of the future of the world is like, what the future of the future of the world is like, what the future of the future of the future of the world is like, what the future of the future of the world is like, what the future of the future of the future of the future of the world is like, what the future of the future of the future of the future of the world, what is like, what the future of the future of the future of the world is like, what the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the world, what is like, the future of the future of the future of the world is like, what the future of the future of the future of the future of the world, what is like, the future of the future of the future of the future of the world, the future of the future of the future of the future of the world, what is like, the future of the future of the future of the future of the world, the future of the future of the future of the future of the world, the future of the future of the future of the future of the world, the future of the future of the future of the"}, {"heading": "5 Adding non-commutativity", "text": "Systems that integrate a commutative linear logic (primarily a commutative context) and its composition (primarily a commutative context) (primarily a commutative context) (primarily a \"context\" (primarily a \"context\") and primary a \"commutative context\" (primarily a \"context\") (primarily a \"commutative context\") (primarily a \"commutative context\") (primarily a \"commutative context\"), and primary a \"commutative context\" (primarily a \"commutative context\") (primarily a \"commutative context\")."}, {"heading": "6 Resource-sensitive \u201cbringing-it-about\u201d", "text": "We present the (non-normal) modal logic of mediating action possibilities (Elgesem, 1997; Governatori and Rotolo, 2005) and propose two versions of it in the linear logic-driven RSBIAT (for resource-sensitive \"inducing\") and SRSBIAT (for resource-sensitive \"inducing action sequences\").

So we have defined and examined a minimal non-normal modlogic. Non-normal minimal modality is defined in the usual way that A stops at a point of evaluation. Extension of A is in the neighborhood of the point of evaluation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Porello was supported by the VisCoSo project financed by the Autonomous Province of Trento (\"Team 2011\" funding programme) and Troquard was supported by a Marie Curie scholarship (\"LASTS\" project) under the PCOFUND-GA2008-226070 funding programme."}], "references": [{"title": "Non-commutative logic i: The multiplicative fragment", "author": ["V.M.

We concentrate on extensions of variants of Linear Logic with one minimal non-normal modality. In earlier work, where we investigated agency in multi-agent systems, we have shown that the results scale up to logics with multiple non-minimal modalities. Here, we start with the language of propositional intuitionistic Linear Logic without the additive disjunction, to which we add a modality. We provide an interpretation of this language on a class of Kripke resource models extended with a neighbourhood function: modal Kripke resource models. We propose a Hilbert-style axiomatization and a Gentzen-style sequent calculus. We show that the proof theories are sound and complete with respect to the class of modal Kripke resource models. We show that the sequent calculus allows cut elimination and that proof-search is in PSPACE. We then show how to extend the results when non-commutative connectives are added to the language. Finally, we put the logical framework to use by instantiating it as logics of agency. In particular, we propose a logic to reason about the resource-sensitive use of artefacts and illustrate it with a variety of examples.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
