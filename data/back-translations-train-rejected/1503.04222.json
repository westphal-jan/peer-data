Taking into account the linearity and associated uncertainty in real data, the problem of AV optimization is formulated as FMILP by treating the time variable as continuous; the mathematical formulation allows staggered AV departure times to ensure that the time constraints are met and different task fulfillment times are incorporated into the optimization model, where feasibility is ensured provided that the number of UAVs deployed exceeds the number of targets and the UAV endurance is sufficiently high; the formulation is flexible enough to allow various alternative performance functions; the strict formulation allows a true optimal solution to demanding assignment and scheduling problems; experimental results are presented for real-world problems of the Indian Air Force, which the efficiency of the FILP solution can serve as an effective solution to today's problem categories."}], "references": [{"title": "Theory of Scheduling", "author": ["R.W.
