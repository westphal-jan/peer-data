Virality, in our view, is a phenomenon with many facets, i.e. under this generic term several different effects of persuasive communication are comprised. By exploiting a high-coverage and bilingual corpus of documents containing metrics of their spread on social networks as well as a massive affective annotation provided by readers, we present a thorough analysis of the interplay between evoked emotions and viral facets. We highlight and discuss our findings in light of a cross-lingual approach: while we discover differences in evoked emotions and corresponding viral effects, we provide preliminary evidence of a generalized explanatory model rooted in the deep structure of emotions: the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) circumplex. We find that viral facets appear to be consistently affected by particular VAD configurations, and these configurations indicate a clear connection with distinct phenomena underlying persuasive communication.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 16:43:58 GMT  (108kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04723v1", "preprint version of WWW 2015 'Web Science Track' paper"]], "COMMENTS": "preprint version of WWW 2015 'Web Science Track' paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["marco guerini", "jacopo staiano"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.04723"}, "pdf": {"name": "1503.04723.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Deep Feelings: A Massive Cross-Lingual Study on the Relation between Emotions and Virality", "authors": ["Marco Guerini", "Jacopo Staiano"], "emails": ["marco.guerini@trentorise.eu", "jacopo.staiano@lip6.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "We highlight and discuss our findings in the light of a linguistic approach: while we discover differences in evoked emotions and corresponding viral effects, we provide preliminary evidence for a generalized explanatory model rooted in the deep structure of emotions: the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) Cirplex.

With the advent of new media, this definition has been updated (see, for example, [15]). Indeed, readers of online content can decide whether and how to share such content by either sending it to their audience or addressing only a small portion of it (Narrow Casting). [4] For example, the act of submitting a news article by email is treated as a form of Narrow Casting, in which case the subjects address a selected section of their audience / contact. Following the above definition, we consider article comments as a form of Narrow Casting, since the readers who upload a comment to the article page contribute to a discussion that takes place at most between the readers of this article."}, {"heading": "4.

Nevertheless, it seems of paramount importance to consider the role of dominance (not in [4]) in order to understand the emanation of phenomena."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this article, we have provided a comprehensive study of the relationships between the viral nature of news articles and the emotions they elicit. Using an extensive and bilingual corpus of 65k documents, the metrics of their distribution in social networks, and a massive affective note from readers (more than 1.5 million votes), we presented a thorough analysis of the interplay between evoked emotions and viral facets. We highlighted and discussed our findings in the light of a cross-lingual approach. Our results show differences in the evoked emotions and the corresponding viral effects within the bilingual data we have collated; among other things, we note the remarkably different influence of the SADNESS affective dimension between English and Italian language datasets, as opposed to the hypothesis that viral phenomena alone can be used to explain viral phenomena."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The work of M.

investigation on the relations between virality of news articles and the emotions they are found to evoke. Virality, in our view, is a phenomenon with many facets, i.e. under this generic term several different effects of persuasive communication are comprised. By exploiting a high-coverage and bilingual corpus of documents containing metrics of their spread on social networks as well as a massive affective annotation provided by readers, we present a thorough analysis of the interplay between evoked emotions and viral facets. We highlight and discuss our findings in light of a cross-lingual approach: while we discover differences in evoked emotions and corresponding viral effects, we provide preliminary evidence of a generalized explanatory model rooted in the deep structure of emotions: the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) circumplex. We find that viral facets appear to be consistently affected by particular VAD configurations, and these configurations indicate a clear connection with distinct phenomena underlying persuasive communication.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
