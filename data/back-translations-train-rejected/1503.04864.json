In the following sections, we outline these components."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Input Parser:", "text": "GeomRDF takes as input ESRI shapefile [8], Geospatial DBMS or GML [20]. This component extracts from each file / database all features and their descriptions (e.g. schema, types, CRS (Coordinate Reference System). We mean \"feature,\" the \"simple feature\" defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) [25] and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard ISO 19125 to have both spatial and non-spatial attributes. Spatial attributes are evaluated geometrically, and simple attributes are based on 2D geometry with linear interpolation between entries (e.g. multipolygons, polygons,.etc.).ESRI shapefile: This format is part of the GIS technology offered by ESRI. Geodata format defined by ESRI. Geographic data metrics."}, {"heading": "3.2 Feature Parser:", "text": "This component iterates on the characteristics that are extracted in the first step and classifies their properties according to their type, either thematic or geometrical. For one characteristic, the parser tests all the properties and stores for each property information such as their name, their value and their type. To show how the characteristics are processed, we take as an example the \"Paris\" section, which is defined in the administrative units produced by IGN France. Fig 2 shows the two classes designed to store properties. To illustrate how the \"Paris\" section was defined, the data of the French administrative units of IGN France are stored and stored in ESRI shapefile format."}, {"heading": "3.3 RDF Builder:", "text": "In fact, the number of printed copies has decreased many times over the previous year. & nbsp; & nbsp; The number of printed copies has doubled in recent years. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The number of printed copies has multiplied in recent years."}, {"heading": "3.4 External Libraries", "text": "The actual version of GeomRDF (a platform-independent version implemented in Java) only depends on two essential libraries: GeoTools [15] and OpenRDF Sesame [14].

It includes many features such as support for a wide range of formats (including ESRI shapefile, XML (GML, KML), and geospatial databases), and a coordinate transformation service that provides descriptions and operations of coordinate systems such as map projections and data transformations. Data structures used in GeoTools are based on the standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). OpenRDF Sesame is an open source Java framework for processing RDF data. Its features include SesDF parsers, storage solutions (triplestore queries), and query queries supported by the XARG main library."}, {"heading": "4 Transforming the French Administrative Units Dataset from GIS Format to RDF Model", "text": "This section represents a test of the conversion and publication of the French administrative units (in accordance with practice). < < http http http: / / www.geomRDF / http http http http http http: / / www.geomRDF tool and the Datalift platform < http http http: / / www.geomRDF tool and the Datalift platform. < http http http http: / / www.geomRDF tool and the Datalift platform. < http: / / www.geomRDF tool / http: / / www.geomRDF tool and the Datalift platform).Conversion of the geospatial data we use in this step to convert and publish the GeomRDF module for converting the ESRI shapefiles to RDF.

We detailed how the geometric information is structured according to an ontology that reuses and expands the existing geographical vocabularies, and showed an example of this structuring in the case of multi-polygon geometry. The GeomRDF tool was implemented as a module in the Datalift platform. We illustrated an application of this tool by detailing the process of publishing the French administrative dataset provided by IGN France. So far, GeomRDF only accepts geospatial formats as input data. However, it would be useful to accept text file formats such as CSV that contain direct location information, and to convert these textual coordinates in instances of the Geom class: then such a linking of information via any way could be used to visualize information."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was partially supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Datalift project under grant number ANR-10-CORD-009."}], "references": [{"title": "Triplify: Light-weight linked data publication from relational databases", "author": ["S.
