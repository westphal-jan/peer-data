Clustering algorithm is performed for all mass functions of s1, regardless of the clustering that is performed on those of s2. Remember that all mass functions of both sources are defined on the same differentiating frame and therefore should be considered as values of a single attribute when classifying their corresponding objects. For the same example of physicians, patients are objects that must be classified according to an attribute disease. Values of this attribute are mass functions that are defined on the differentiating frame and enumerate all possible diseases. Distance (14) can be simplified as follows, because we have only one attribute: D (oi, Clk) = 1 nknk, q = 1 d (mi, mq) (21) In this essay, we place the number of clusters on the number of hypotheses in the differentiating frame that gives the number of possible disease hypotheses in a differentiating point."}, {"heading": "4.2.

General case", "text": "The method described above estimates the independence of one source from another. Measure of independence is not symmetrical, because if a source s1 is independent of one source s2, then s2 is not necessarily independent of s1, and even if it is, the degree of independence is not necessarily the same. In other words, two sources are independent only if they are independent of each other. Therefore, the general independence referred to as I (s1, s2) is given by: I (s1, s2) = min (Id (s2), Id (s2), Independence (29) We note that I (s1, s2) is not negative, standardized, symmetrical, and identical."}, {"heading": "5.

Rules [10] tolerate redundant information and can therefore be used to combine mass functions that depend on sources. In this paper, we propose a new mixed combination rule that uses conjunctive and cautious rules in detail in equations (8) and (13). In the case of totally dependent sources (where independence is 0), the cautious and proposed mixed combination rules are similar; while in the case of completely independent sources (independence is), the conjunctive and proposed combination rules are similar."}, {"heading": "6.

Independent sources", "text": "In general, some information is needed to generate mass functions: the number of hypotheses in the differentiating frame, the number of mass functions, and the number of mass functions. We find that the number of center points and masses are chosen randomly. In the case of independent sources, masses can be anywhere, and the centers of gravity of both sources can be chosen independently. Mass functions of s1 and s2 are created according to algorithm 2. We find that center points, their number, and the number of center points are randomly selected."}, {"heading": "6.1.2. Dependent sources", "text": "The case of dependent sources is somewhat difficult to simulate, as several scenarios can occur. In this section we will try to illustrate the most common situations. Mass functions created for dependent sources should be consistent and not include an internal conflict [27]. Consistent mass functions contain at least one focus element common to all focus groups. Figure 4 illustrates a consistent mass function in which all focus elements {A, B, C, D} overlap. To simulate the case in which one source depends on another, consistent mass functions of the first are created, defined on a size differentiating frame. In the case of dependent sources, they are almost consistent and at least one dependent on the other. To simulate the case in which one source depends on the other, consistent mass functions of the first are generated, then the consistent mass functions of the third algorithm, and then those of the second source are generated by knowing decisions of the first source."}, {"heading": "6.2. Results of tests", "text": "We find that in extreme cases where mass functions are safe, or even when the center of gravity does not overlap, maximum values of independence are achieved. In the case of complete dependence, mass functions have the same center of gravity, but clusters contain mass functions with consistent center of gravity. Clustering is done by center of gravity and clusters are perfectly interconnected."}, {"heading": "6.2.1. Independent sources", "text": "In this paragraph, mass functions are independent. Focus elements and BBMs are randomly selected, resulting in algorithm 2. For tests, we choose the mean of 100 tests for two dependent sources yields a degree of independence \u03b3 = 0.68, so sources are independent. Suppose that m1 and m2 specified in Table 1 are provided by two algorithms 4 that generate dependent mass functions required: | |, n: number of mass functions, d decision of another source \u03b3 = 0.68, so sources are independent. Suppose that the set S of all focus groups including d. 3: Random choose | F |, the number of focal elements on [1, | S |], n: number of mass functions, d: for i = 1 to n 2: Find set S of all focus groups, including d. 3: Random choose | F |, the number of focal elements on [1, | S |]."}, {"heading": "6.2.2. Dependent sources", "text": "In the case of dependent sources, mass functions resulting from algorithms 3 and 4 are created.

Table 2 illustrates the mean value of 100 degrees of independence of two dependent sources, each delivering 100 randomly generated mass functions. These sources depend on a degree of 1 \u2212 \u03b3 = 0.66. In Table 3, m1 and m2 are combined according to the mixing rule, if \u03b3 = 0.34. To illustrate the case of three dependent sources, three groups of 100 dependent mass functions are created according to algorithms 3 and 4, if | = 5. The mean value of 100 degrees of independence is represented in Table 5.Finally."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "The proposed statistical approach is based on a cluster algorithm applied to mass functions provided by multiple sources. A pair of source independence is derived from the weighting of associated clusters after matching their clusters. Source independence can guide either the choice of the combination rule if it is either 1 or 0; if it is one degree above] 0.1 [, we propose a new combination rule that weights the conjunctive and cautious combinations with the degree of source independence."}], "references": [{"title": "Fuzzy sets", "author": ["L.A.
