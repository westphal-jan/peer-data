We used 650 megabytes of unique chart notes from COPD patients from 2012 to mid-2014 (we did not use notes from the trial period, although this is a personal decision as word2vec does not have access to the response variable). We decided to use some data processing to keep things understandable (although this is not necessarily recommended): 1. Remove numbers. 2. Remove contiguous spaces. 3. Remove all punctuations except dots, semicolons, query marks and exclamation points. 4. Create sentence vectors by dividing each text block by dots, semicolons, query marks and exclamation points. b) Form vocabulary on word2vec to generate the list of all words that correspond to the threshold value."}, {"heading": "Building Bag-of-Words", "text": "The terms attempt to be specific to COPD, but also to describe the situation, environment, personality and state of mind of a patient.aclidinium albuterol rages arformoterol asthma bronchodilators budesonid children copd corticosteroids cough dirty dizziness education exacerbation factory family farmers finance fluticason formoterol friend god arformoterol friend god heroin homeless indacaterol inflammatory insurance ipratropium irritated levalbuterol manual married medicare methylxanthines mobility mold narcotics non compliant partime phosphodiesterase prednisolone runny salmeterol scratchy sick smoker support surgery theophylline throat tiotropium tired tremor moments unemployed welfare2."}, {"heading": "Modeling and Results", "text": "This is quite remarkable since LACE gets 0.65 by extracting the most critical structured elements from the diagram. If we select a set of words by hand, we can gather almost the same amount of information without the help of typical EMR data. Method 2: Clustering 1) The 160,000 500-dimensional vectors are grouped into 50 clusters based on their vector representation.2) Since the similarity in word2vec representations is typically measured by the cosinal similarity between vectors rather than by Euclidean distance, the spherical k-mean algorithm is used for clusterisation.2) Each note is evaluated based on the percentage of its words contained in each cluster, resulting in 50 new characteristics (since there are 50 cosinal similarities between the individual clusters).These columns do not add exactly 100% as not all words reach the 100-point threshold in the corpus, but on the average word, the sum of 96% of the words between the three words and the inconsistencies."}, {"heading": "Modeling and Results", "text": "We used AdaBoost in R (including code) and obtained an AUC score of 0.61 from the percentage and 0.6 from the affinity approach."}, {"heading": "Note on the CMS Definition Used for COPD Patients", "text": "Comments and patients were selected according to the following CMS definition: an admission with a main outlet diagnosis indicating an acute exacerbation of COPD (ICD-9 of 491.21, 491.22, 491.8, 491.9, 492.8, 493.20, 493.21, 493.22, 496) or a main diagnosis of respiratory failure (518.81, 518.82, 518.84, 799.1) and a secondary diagnosis of COPD (491.21, 491.22, 493.21, 493.22)."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The speed and ease with which word2vec delivers quantitative measures of unstructured text is impressive, and its potential is hardly explored in this essay (sentences, for example, have been treated like bags of words without order, rather than trying to model the effect of words on each other).The challenge is to find creative ways to apply this mathematical representation of language to better answer relevant questions."}, {"heading": "Appendix", "text": "\"It is not like, as if,\" he says, \"it is like, as if.\" \"It is not like, as if.\" \"It is like, as if.\" \"It is like, as if.\" \"It is like, as if.\" \"\" It is like, as if. \"\" \"\" It is like, as if. \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \".\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\". \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\""}], "references": [{"title": "Unstructured Data in Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems: Challenges and Solutions Healthcare", "author": ["C.V.

In this study, we ran 650 megabytes of unstructured, medical chart notes from the Providence Health & Services electronic medical record through word2vec. We used two different approaches in creating predictive variables and tested them on the risk of readmission for patients with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease). As a comparative benchmark, we ran the same test using the LACE risk model (2) (a single score based on length of stay, acuity, comorbid conditions, and emergency department visits). Using only free text and mathematical might, we found word2vec comparable to LACE in predicting the risk of readmission of COPD patients.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
