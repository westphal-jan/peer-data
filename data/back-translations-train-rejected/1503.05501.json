Suppose we get a system S like an argumentation system < S, R > and we want to add an aspect to it. There is a general way to add a new feature to a system. It involves 1) identifying the basic units that build the system, and 2) introducing the new feature into each of these basic units. In the case where the system is argumentation and the feature is probabilistic, we have the following: the basic units are a. the type of arguments involved; b) the affiliation relationship in the sentence S of the arguments; and d) the choice of extensions.
