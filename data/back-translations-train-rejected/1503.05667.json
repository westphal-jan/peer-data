Unlike other DL-based similarity measures, \u03c3BS is designed to meet all the necessary characteristics defined in Section 3.2, with particular emphasis on structural dependence and strict monotonicity. At the same time, \u03c3BS calculation is performed via LB and not ALCH +. This significantly improves computing speed, since \u03c3BS essentially becomes a function via \u03c9B pairs (such bitcodes can be calculated and stored offline in the knowledge base). As \u03c3BS calculation is performed on pairs of bits that hold the same position in perspecB, we can therefore fragment bitcodes into constant sizes and exhibit similarities via concept pairs on parallel computer platforms. This gives the BS massive scalability. Efficient optimization can be accomplished through the invisible caching of similarity results, which are frequently visible to the code."}, {"heading": "5.2 Encoding Atomic Concepts", "text": "Before we show that LB is in complete agreement with ALCH +, we first provide the basic axioms that help us encode atomic concepts in ALCH +. To do this, we must define the proposed algebraic interpretation function IB (also called bit interpretation). Definition 8: Bit interpretation (IB) is a function as follows: IB: C 7 \u2192 LB; C-TALCH + Hereby we define (Ai) IB, where Ai is an arbitrary atomic concept in ALCH +, using the following two axioms: Basic axiom of atomic concepts, b-Ai-B, b-Ai-Base; \u03c9 Ai-B-IB-Code IB.

However, these operations do not have a direct mapping to the algebraic lattice represented in Figure 1. Instead, they are mapped to a medium and discrete compound bit (b2) that can be represented in relation to bit operations via certain bit pairs."}, {"heading": "6 BitSim Similarity Measure", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Outline", "text": "In this section, we provide a generic definition for bitcoins.

The first two properties are trivial. The following theories show that the rest of the properties apply: Theorem 6. Closing and invariance of equivalence applies to circular economy. Follows from Theorem 1 and Theorem 4. Theorem 7. Structural dependence applies to circular economy.

Since LB can be assigned to a Boolean space, it is possible to perform bit operations at high speed, even on a distributed and parallel platform. At the same time, various caching techniques can be efficiently applied. In the future, we will investigate these research perspectives and other possibilities, such as probabilistic thinking about LB, A-box logic and reasoning about higher meaningful DL."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed BitSim (\u03c3BS) - an algebraic similarity measure for concept definitions in ALCH +. We show that \u03c3BS fulfils all the necessary algebraic properties recommended for a formal measure of similarity.
