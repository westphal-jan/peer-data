This has been investigated within the framework of the RatioLog project, as shown in this article. Techniques of machine learning with similarity measures and case-based thinking, defeatist thinking with (a revision) of the specification criterion, and normative thinking with deontic logic help in the selection of good candidates for answers. If, however, background knowledge encodes mainly linguistic knowledge - without general healthy world knowledge - then the effect on finding good candidates for answers is low. Therefore, future work will focus on using even more background knowledge (e.g. from ontology databases) so that rational thinking can be used more effectively when applied to this concrete knowledge.
