Linguistic intelligence for the scope of this article is the competence attained in a number of languages, i.e., not the potential to quickly learn a new language, but an achievement that has already taken place. The basic idea is that languages that are related to each other give less to linguistic intelligence than those that are not related to each other. We will actively use the ideas and methods of finance. A language sample is to some extent similar to a portfolio of valuations. To a given portfolio of assets, it is more valuable to add an asset that is not correlated to or even negatively correlated to the assets of a given portfolio (e.g. [Markowitz 52]). Likewise, it is more valuable for a particular portfolio of languages (further, portfolio of languages). It is more valuable (in the sense of the intuition of this article that a certain part of intelligence is not related to a particular point)."}, {"heading": "2 Properties of linguistic intelligence", "text": "On the basis of these principles, we will later deduce the formal rules. We consider all languages to be equal. It is not a trivial assumption, since there are languages that have evolved over thousands of years to achieve literary and oral traditions that serve as a medium for scientific expression, etc. There are other languages that cannot compete with the former for this reason. It is tempting to say that they are less valuable. Nevertheless, we still consider them to be equal, because the \"undeveloped\" languages may be more difficult to learn precisely because they do not have a written tradition. People speak the languages to varying degrees. Suppose that the level of knowledge of the adult native speaker is 1. Someone who has never met her has a level 0 in that language. It would be logical to demand that increasing knowledge of a language in the portfolio is more difficult precisely because it would increase the person's Q."}, {"heading": "3 Formal approach", "text": "In this chapter we will discuss appropriate qualities of a linguistic intelligence, formalize these qualities as axioms, and propose a formula to satisfy them."}, {"heading": "3.1 First principles", "text": "We write our reflections on how the QL measurement should behave in the following list of axioms. It was inspired by the idea of coherent risk metrics [Artzner et al. 99] from financial mathematics. Consider a language l is an element of the linguistic area L and weighted language w (in other words, a language with competence level) is an element of the space W: = L \u00b7 [0, 1] which is a language and a number between 0 and 1 (1 is a fluent linguistic area, 0 means that all knowledge is missing). Portfolio of N languages is an element of the space WN. If necessary, we could also look at the portfolio of N languages to be an element of space LN (i.e. languages with fluent competence).Definition: Measuring linguistic intelligence (l.i.i.v) is a function s.t."}, {"heading": "3.2 LQ", "text": "The children of ToB are language families such as Indo-European or SinoTibet. This is the layer of nodes of the language that contain the complete language. (ToB) So the languages are the complete tree of all (N) languages. The languages are the leaves of the tree and the portfolios are the induced subgraphs of the complete languages that contain the sources (ToB), the leaves and the paths between them. Thus, a portfolio of 1 language would be a path from the source through all families, sub-families, etc. The union of 2 portfolios would be the union of the corresponding subgraphs. To illustrate it, let us consider a portfolio of Chinese and Serbian portfolios consisting of all families, sub-families, etc. The union of 2 portfolios would be the union of the corresponding subgraphs."}, {"heading": "3.3 Matrix approach", "text": "In this chapter we will discuss an alternative approach, namely that based on correlation matrices. Matrix entries represent a correlation or language distance (1 minus distance to make them look like a correlation) expressed as a number between 0 and 1. There is a lot of work on measuring such a distance, to name but a few [Petroni and Serva 2010], [Koehn 2005], [Chiswick and Miller 2005], [Gingsburgh and Weber 2011]. They use different approaches: difficulties in acquiring a language, difficulties in machine translation between languages, number of words in general, etc. Most of them cover rather a small part of all possible correlations / distances. In N languages, there must be N (N-1) / 2 distances."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "We presented a solid methodology for measuring a language portfolio. How could it be used other than to measure someone's linguistic intelligence? There is a broad field of research on the intersection of economics and linguistics. A comprehensive overview could be found in [Grin 2003].LQ, for example as a function for communication costs. An institute that evaluates several options as a working language (s) could aim to minimize the total QL of its members, as this would also mean minimizing communication costs. For example, the optimal language (or bundle of languages) for the European Union could be chosen in such a way that the aggregate QL of the European population would be minimal. Implementation of the QL algorithm could be found at lingvometer.com."}, {"heading": "5 References", "text": "[Artzner et al 1999] Artzner, P., Delbaen, F., Eber, J. M., & Heath, D. (1999).

It contains patterns that put the first principles to the test. Someone speaks fluent Serbian, Slovenian, Croatian and Chinese. Furthermore, he knows a certain level of English that qualifies for 50% level. We also do the arithmetic and show each step of the calculation. Let's look at the following language portfolio. To initialize the algorithm, we rank each level and set the LQ to 1 for each language, except for English, where we set the LQ to 0.5 (fig. 1). The deepest layer (that of Serbian, Slovenian and Croatian) is in rank 5. Let's now calculate the LQ for the western branch of South Slavic languages (fig. 2)."}], "references": [{"title": "Language distance and tree reconstruction", "author": ["Petroni", "F.
