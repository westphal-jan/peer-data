We assume we have a base classifier for a cost-sensitive classification problem, but it is trained with respect to a cost setting different to the desired one. Moreover, we also have some training data samples streaming to the algorithm one by one. The prob- lem is to adapt the given base classifier to the desired cost setting using the steaming training samples online. To solve this problem, we propose to learn a new classifier by adding an adaptation function to the base classifier, and update the adaptation function parameter according to the streaming data samples. Given a input data sample and the cost of misclassifying it, we up- date the adaptation function parameter by minimizing cost weighted hinge loss and respecting previous learned parameter simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is compared to both online and off-line cost-sensitive algorithms on two cost-sensitive classification problems, and the experiments show that it not only outperforms them one classification performances, but also requires significantly less running time.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Mar 2015 17:47:00 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06745v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["junlin zhang", "jose garcia"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.06745"}, "pdf": {"name": "1503.06745.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Online classifier adaptation for cost-sensitive learning", "authors": ["Junlin Zhang", "Jos\u00e9 Gar\u0107\u0131a"], "emails": ["junlinzhang1@yahoo.com", "josegarciajaumei@outlook.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 150 3.06 745v 1 [cs.L G] 23 MKeywords Cost-sensitive learning \u00b7 Adaptation to classifiers \u00b7 Online learning \u00b7 Recognition of facts \u00b7 Vehicle identificationJ.

This data set is a large data set containing 9832 face images and 9832 non-face images. Each face image is treated as a positive sample, while each non-face image is treated as a negative sample. In addition, each image is presented as a 50,000-dimensional visual feature vector. The problem with face recognition is to classify a particular candidate image as a face or non-face."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Car detection data set", "text": "The second data set we used is an auto detection data set [1]. This data set contains 500 auto images and 500 non-auto images. The problem of auto detection is the classification of a particular candidate image into a car or non-car. In this problem, auto images are defined as positive images, and the non-auto images are defined as negative images. In this case, we set the cost of misclassifying an auto image to 8, and that of a non-auto image to 1,3,2 experiment setup.In order to perform the experiment, we used 10-fold cross-validation. A whole data set was randomly divided into 10 folds, and then each set is used as a test set, while the remaining 9 sets were combined as a training set. In addition, since the proposed method is based on the adaptation of a classifier f0 (x), trained with different cost settings, we further divide the training set to two sub-sets containing 0, the first part-fold and we used it."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Comparison to online cost sensitivity classification method", "text": "The box plots of classification accuracy and misclassification of the proposed cost-sensitive online classification algorithm (OCSCA) and the CSOC algorithm over 10-fold cross-validation are shown in Fig. 1. This figure shows that the proposed method outperforms the CSOC algorithm in both average accuracy and misclassification costs. In particular, in the case of misclassification costs, the proposed algorithm achieves completely lower average misclassification costs than the CSOC. This is because the proposed method uses an existing predictor that has been learned from more data points by adapting it to a given cost setting."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Comparison to off-line cost sensitivity classification method", "text": "We also compare the proposed OCSCA with four most popular cost-sensitive offline learning algorithms proposed by Zhou et al. [58], COD by Sun et al. [32], ABC by Masnadi-Shirazi and Vas-concelos [25] and SW by Ting [34]. Breakdown of classification accuracy and misclassification costs is given in Fig. 2. A major reason for this phenomenon lies in the fact that the proposed OCSCA algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithms in terms of both classification accuracy and misclassification costs. A major reason for this phenomenon is the fact that the proposed OCSCA algorithm starts by learning from a base classifier f0 (x) and then adapts it well to the given cost setting, while the other algorithms ignore f0 (x) and learn the classification directly from the slightly better base f0 (x)."}, {"heading": "3.3.3 Running time", "text": "An important advantage of the proposed OCSCA algorithm is its low time complexity compared to offline algorithms. Therefore, we also compared the runtime of these methods and the results are in Fig. 3. It is obvious that the runtime of the two online learning algorithms OCSCA and CSOC is much shorter than that of the offline learning algorithms. Both OCSCA and CSOC take less than 200 seconds, while all offline learning algorithms take more than 800 seconds. This is not surprising since OCSCA and CSOC update the classifier in each iteration with only one data sample, while offline learning algorithms must take into account all training samples."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions and future works", "text": "In this thesis, we propose the problem of adapting an existing basic classifier to a cost-sensitive classification problem. The basic classifier is trained on the basis of different cost settings. In addition, we have proposed a novel online learning algorithm for adapting the classifier. The algorithm takes a data sample at once to update the adaptation parameter.The advantages of this method lie in two folds: 1. It can use the basic classifier to increase classification performance, and 2. Its runtime is low due to its online learning nature. In this thesis, we used the SVM as a formulation of learning. In the future, we will study other classification methods, such as Adaboost. We will design an iterative algorithm to learn the classifier online by adapting an existing classifier trained with a different cost setting, and the adaptation function is a combination of some weak data classifiers. [99 99 data iteration we will select one weak classifier by selecting 449, by selecting an existing classifier 457 4503In order 449, 4503In some weak data classifiers, the adaptation function is a combination of some weak data classifiers. 499 99 99 data classifiers we will select a weak data function by selecting an existing classifier 450449, 457 4503In some weak data classifier, 4503In some other data classifiers we will select a weak data classifier."}], "references": [{"title": "Learning to detect objects in images via a sparse, partbased representation", "author": ["S.

We assume we have a base classifier for a cost-sensitive classification problem, but it is trained with respect to a cost setting different to the desired one. Moreover, we also have some training data samples streaming to the algorithm one by one. The problem is to adapt the given base classifier to the desired cost setting using the steaming training samples online. To solve this problem, we propose to learn a new classifier by adding an adaptation function to the base classifier, and update the adaptation function parameter according to the streaming data samples. Given a input data sample and the cost of misclassifying it, we update the adaptation function parameter by minimizing cost weighted hinge loss and respecting previous learned parameter simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is compared to both online and off-line cost-sensitive algorithms on two cost-sensitive classification problems, and the experiments show that it not only outperforms them one classification performances, but also requires significantly less running time.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
