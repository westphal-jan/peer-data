It has gained its importance in e-government applications, mobile-based applications, embedded systems, and even business process development. User's decisions on software acquisitions are often ad hoc or based on preference due to difficulty in quantitatively measuring software quality in use. But, why is quality-in-use measurement difficult? Although there are many software quality models, to the authors' knowledge no works survey the challenges related to software quality-in-use measurement. This article has two main contributions: 1) it identifies and explains major issues and challenges in measuring software quality in use in the context of the ISO SQuaRE series and related software quality models and highlights open research areas; and 2) it sheds light on a research direction that can be used to predict software quality in use. In short, the quality-in-use measurement issues are related to the complexity of the current standard models and the limitations and incompleteness of the customized software quality models. A sentiment analysis of software reviews is proposed to deal with these issues.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Mar 2015 07:35:16 GMT  (470kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06934v1", "4 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "4 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.CL", "authors": ["issa atoum", "chih how bong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.06934"}, "pdf": {"name": "1503.06934.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["@article{Qinu,"], "sections": [{"heading": "Recommended citation", "text": "Atoum, I., & Bong, C.

There is a limited number of literature references to software QinU.

There is insufficient research into other possible search directions to address the first problem."}, {"heading": "Research Contributions", "text": "This article provides the following contributions: \u2022 Identifies and explains various problems in measuring QinU software using standard and custom quality models. This article is the first to examine several quality models and explain various challenges in measuring QinU. Most of the challenges associated with ISO standard models are considered complications and incompleteness of the documents. On the other hand, custom quality models are subject to incomplete models designed for their own specific needs. \u2022 Represents a research direction to design SoftwareQinU from software reviews. Given the problems associated with measurement, mood analysis, an emerging branch of natural language processing, can be used to analyze textual user judgments about software (Mei et al. 2007; Taboada et al. 2011)."}, {"heading": "SOFTWARE QUALITY-", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "IN-USE MODELS", "text": "There has been much work on software quality models, but to the knowledge of the authors no research has been done to summarize the main problems of quality measurement in the application.

It attempts to bridge the gap between users and developers by applying quality factors that influence the views of the user and developer. The main perspective of product operation of the McCall model can be attributed to the QinU, but is not complete. Boehm's Quality Model (Boehm et al. 1978) Boehm's model - similar to the McCall Quality Model - attempts to define a qualitative hierarchical quality software model. The hierarchical quality model is structured around features at the high to medium level that contribute to the overall level of quality. The high-level characteristics of the model address utility, maintainability and portability. The usage behavior can be attributed to the QinU of the ISO standard, with QO characteristics not directly incorporated into the product quality, but only the drone component."}, {"heading": "Usability-Based Models", "text": "There is much work aimed at measuring one aspect of quality in the application, called usability. The International Organization for Standardization defines usability as the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which certain users achieve specific goals in certain environments (ISO 1998). There is no agreement on this definition; it could essentially refer to user interfaces, usability or usability (Ba\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 and Porub\u00e4n 2014; Carvajal et al. 2013; Holzinger 2005; ISO 1998; Shackeland Richardson 1991).

FURPS + stands for functionality, ease of use, reliability, performance and availability. In addition, the FURPS + includes design limitations, implementation requirements, interface requirements and physical requirements. The QinU of the ISO standards implies ease of use and features. SAP Q-Index SAP developed and implemented three ISO 9000 certified quality management systems, namely SAP Global Development, SAP Active Global Support and SAP IT.

Kl\u00e4s et al. (2014) suggested using comprehensive quality model landscapes (CQMLs) as a scheme for comparing quality models. Bakota et al. (2011) identified that a good quality model should be interpretable, explainable, consistent, scalable, expandable and comparable. However, these approaches are subjective. In this article, the standard quality model ISO 25010 is used as a starting point to compare with other models as it is accepted as an acceptable approach worldwide. Figure 4 shows the QinU characteristics of ISO 25010 compared to the work examined.

Another problem with task measurement is the variability of tasks from one software function to another and from one software to another. A task to open a file for writing, for example, is different from the task to remove special characters from a text file. Worse, defining the tasks themselves is a big challenge. Hedonic tasks (the \"be goals\") that imply user satisfaction cannot be specified; therefore, they cannot be measured directly."}, {"heading": "Challenges Related to", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Standard Quality Frameworks", "text": "In fact, it is as if most of them will be able to abide by the rules that they have imposed on themselves.

The challenges identified relate to terminology differences, system engineering skills and a lack of user processes. He suggested implementing user requirements, understanding the result as a service rather than a product, and managing functional safety as part of quality in use. Bevan (2001; 1999) identified several obstacles to measuring quality in use: 1) incomplete requirements as user requirements are not taken into account early; 2) additional costs arising from adding user activities and software and hardware requirements during the software lifecycle; and 3) obstacles arising from the unclear definition of who should use the system and under what circumstances."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Quality in the application represents software quality from the point of view of the user. This article presents the most important questions when measuring software quality in the application. Quality in the application can be measured with the standard SQuaRE series, while many features of software quality are scattered in many custom software quality models. Measuring quality in the application is challenging due to the complexity of current standard models and the incompleteness of other related custom models. The standpoint of software users is difficult to implement in advance within the software lifecycle, especially for hedonic tasks. To overcome these challenges, a sentimental analysis is proposed."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This study was partially supported by the Universiti Malaysia Sarawak Zamala Graduate Scholarship and a grant from ERGS / ICT07 (01) / 1018 / 2013 (15)."}, {"heading": "International Conference on Software Process and Product", "text": "Measurement (IWSM-MENSURA), 165-170.
