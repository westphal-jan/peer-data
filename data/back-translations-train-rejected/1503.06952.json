The single-label learning community frequently uses as a reference the one which always predicts the majority class. Although a classifier might perform worse than this simple baseline classifier, this behaviour requires a special explanation. Aiming to motivate the community to compare experimental results with the ones provided by a multi-label baseline classifier, calling the attention about the need of special explanations related to classifiers which perform worse than the baseline, in this work we propose the use of General_B, a multi-label baseline classifier. General_B was evaluated in contrast to results published in the literature which were carefully selected using a systematic review process. It was found that a considerable number of published results on 10 frequently used datasets are worse than or equal to the ones obtained by General_B, and for one dataset it reaches up to 43% of the dataset published results. Moreover, although a simple baseline classifier was not considered in these publications, it was observed that even for very poor results no special explanations were provided in most of them. We hope that the findings of this work would encourage the multi-label community to consider the idea of using a simple baseline classifier, such that further explanations are provided when a classifiers performs worse than a baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Mar 2015 08:57:25 GMT  (586kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06952v1", "19 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jean metz", "newton spola\\^or", "everton a cherman", "maria c monard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.06952"}, "pdf": {"name": "1503.06952.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Everton A.

Each example egg is associated with a attribute vector xi = (xi1, xi2,., xiM), that of M characteristics Xj, j = 1.. M, and a subset of labels Yi L, where L = {y1, y2,. yq} is the set of q labels. Table 1 shows this representation. In this scenario, the multilabel-like classification task consists of generating a classifier H, which has given an invisible instance E = (x, y2,), able to accurately predict its subset of labels Y, i.e. H (E) \u2192 Y learning methods prevailing approaches to multi-label learning methods are: algorithm adaptation and problem transformation (Tsoumakas et al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al al).

To our knowledge, however, the multi-label community still does not have a consolidated idea of a simple multi-label base classifier GeneralB. To raise awareness of the consideration of a simple multi-label base classifier, we have conducted a systematic review of the multi-label learning literature to collect experimental results that contrast with the proposed simple multi-label base classifier GeneralB. It has been found that a significant number of published results (12.8%) are worse or equal to those obtained by GeneralB. In fact, for all 10 most commonly used data sets presented in the work, results are worse than or equal to those obtained by GeneralB. In the extreme case, 43% of the published results should not be classified as the result of a multiple algorithm B, or worse than the one proposed by GeneralB."}], "references": [{"title": "Introduction to Machine Learning, 3rd Edition.
