Problem definition", "text": "Many studies have been conducted to understand the occupancy statistics. For example, the statistical and spectral occupancy analysis of the measurements in [2] was presented to study the traffic density in all frequency bands. In [3], the auto-regressive model was used to predict the availability of radio resources using occupancy measurements to achieve uninterrupted data transmission by secondary users. In [4], occupancy statistics were used to select the best channels for control and data transmission purposes, so that less time is needed to switch the transmission from one channel to another in case the PU appears. Furthermore, in [5], [6] bandwidth efficiency was maximized by controlling the transmission performance of cognitive radio using spectrum occupancy measurements. In [7], various time series models were used to categorize specific occupancy patterns in the spectral measurements."}, {"heading": "B. Contributions", "text": "The papers are listed as follows: 1. We propose the use of ML algorithms in the Spectrum Occupancy Study, using both monitored and unmonitored algorithms; the machine learning techniques are advantageous because they are able to implicitly learn the environment and are much more adaptable compared to traditional occupancy models of the spectrum; they can describe more optimized decision regions on trait space than other approaches; in [9] and [10], ML was used for cooperative spectrum scanning; however, we use ML for spectrum occupancy modeling, which can be used in all CR operations, including spectrum management, spectrum decision and spectrum scanning; in [11] the authors discussed call-based modeling to analyze the spectrum usage of the dataset collected by the wireless network operator; and they have shown that the Random Walk modeling process can be used to aggregate the cell."}, {"heading": "II.

Measurement setup and data", "text": "We measured the data from 880 MHz to 2500 MHz using radiometers on eight main radio frequency bands for about four months (February 6-June 18, 2013) at the University of Warwick. The eight bands are: 880-915 MHz, 925-960 MHz, 1900-1920 MHz, 1920-1980 MHz, 1710-1785 MHz, 1805-1880 MHz, 2110-2170 MHz and 2400-2500 MHz. The number of frequency bins in each band varies. For example, the band 925-960 MHz contains 192 frequency bins, each taking a bandwidth of 0.18 MHz, while the band 1710-1785 MHz contains 448 frequency bins, each taking a bandwidth of 0.167 MHz.

PROPOSED ALGORITHMS", "text": "In the proposed approach, five machine learning algorithms are used to predict future PU status based on occupancy data, which is a function of time, frequency and threshold, including four supervised learning algorithms: NBC, DT, SVM and LR, while one is an unattended algorithm, HMM. The motivation to use five different algorithms is to find the best machine learning algorithm because they have different properties."}, {"heading": "A. Naive Bayesian Classifier", "text": "A Naive Bayes Classifier is a generative model based on the Bayes Theorem. It is also referred to as an \"independent feature model\" because it does not take into account dependence on characteristics. For example, the feature vector for the ith time slot in our model contains all samples that are independent of each other, since each feature represents a specific frequency range. The status vector of the ith time slot is given as Si = Si (1), Si (1), Si (2), Si (k), where Si (1) is independent of Si (2). However, the response variable in our approach, i.e. the PU status (P i), is a dependent variable that is influenced by each frequency range. As our characteristics are independent, we will use NBC for the classification. The probability that Si (1) belongs to class P i is classified as Si class, while Si (Si-class) is classified as Si-class."}, {"heading": "B. Decision Trees", "text": "The decision tree builds classification or regression models in the form of a tree structure. The decision trees used in this approach are classification trees whose leaf represents the class names. Unlike NBC, it can handle interactions and dependencies on characteristics. In DT, the decision is made on each internal node used as the basis for dividing the data into two subsets, while leaf nodes represent the class names (in the case of classification trees) or the real numbers (in the case of regression trees). The data comes in the form of 25 March 2015 DRAFT9 (Si, P i) = (Si (1), Si (2), Si (3).., Si (k), P i). (6), where P i is the dependent variable representing the class name of the ith time window.

Support Vector Machines", "text": "SVM is a discriminatory classifier with high accuracy. Unlike DT, it prevents overfitting and can be used for online learning [18]. There are two types of classifiers in SVM: linear SVM for separable data and nonlinear SVM for non-separable data. Here, the linear classifier is used. The training characteristic and the reaction vectors can be represented as D = (P i, Si), where P i {0, 1}. The two classes are separated by the definition of a random division line H as d.Si + b = \u03c1, where d and b respectively represent the weight vector and the preload, while \u03c1 represents the constant for the division of two hyperplanes. The maximum margin hyperplanes separating the points with P i = 1 from those P i = 0 are indicated as: P i = + 1 when d.Si + b > \u03c1 (Occupied Class P i = 0, when Class Sint = 8ct) is separated by two biological planes (Evaulti Technique \u2212 Idle)."}, {"heading": "D.

If a firefly, say l1, finds another lighter firefly l2 at another location that has more intensity than its own in our approach, it tends to move towards the firefly l2.

Linear Regression", "text": "The flexibility of linear regression to take into account the mixture of different characteristics in different dimensions, e.g. space, frequency, time and threshold as a linear combination, is the main motivation to use it for modelling in this approach. The linear regression model for our approach is given by the following yardsticks: P i = e0 + e1S i (1) + e2S i (2) +... + ekS i (k) = e0 + k \u2211 j = 1ejS i (j). (10) where the class name P i is used as a linear combination of the parameters e1, e2, ek and characteristics (Si (1), Si (2),.., Si (k)) in the ith time window. The gradual linear regression is used in this approach.

Hidden Markov Models", "text": "It is an unattended algorithm for modeling time series data. The motivation to use the unattended algorithm is that it does not require a training phase. In HMM, the sequence of states can be restored by analyzing the sequence of observations. The set of states and observations is represented by U = (u1, u2,... uN), G = (g1, g2,... gM), where u1 and u2 represent the states when P i = 0 and P i = 1, respectively. The observations g1 and g2 represent the value of OC i, which corresponds to each P i.

Statistics of Data", "text": "The CDF plot is shown in Fig.2, which gives the summarized view of all power ranges for the eight bands. It can be observed from Fig.2 that the eight bands can be divided into two main groups. Group A contains those bands that have large power ranges from -110 dBm to -30 dBm, including 1805-1800 MHz, 1710-1785 MHz and 2110-2170 MHz. Group B has five bands: 925-960 MHz, 2400-2500 MHz, 1900-1980 MHz and 1900-1920 MHz, which have power ranges between -110 dBm and -100 dBm. Thus, the Group A bands have larger standard deviations than the Group B bands. Next, we will discuss the effects of two main parameters (frequency and threshold) on MH1)."}, {"heading": "B. Classification Criteria", "text": "This subsection examines the choice of Uoc, Loc, coni and B in section II-C as shown in Fig. 5.

The parameters Uoc and Loc are selected by Ms, which represent the allocation selection that divides the data into occupied and unused classes. It varies from 0.1 to 0.9 with a step size of 0.1. It is observed in Fig. 5 that the value of CA depends on the day and the threshold value.
