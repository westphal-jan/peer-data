We will return to this case study in Sections 5 and 6 to illustrate RoCoMO's modeling capabilities. To illustrate, we have selected a situation from the field of rescue and evacuation, but this in no way limits the applicability and universality of RoCoMO. A fire event takes place in a room on the fourth floor of a building on a university campus. Firefighters and reactionaries use a contextual system to coordinate rescue efforts. A reactionary, using the system, gets updated readings from two temperature sensors in the combustion room. With this contextual information, the system determines the time that reactionaries have before the building is evacuated."}, {"heading": "3 RELATED WORK IN CONTEXT AND SITUATION MODELING", "text": "In this context, it is also worth mentioning the fact that most of them are people who are able to get involved in another country, in a country where they are able, in which they are able to get established; in other countries, it is so that they are able to get established; in other countries, it is so that they are able to get established; in other countries, it is so that they are able to get established and get established; in other countries, it is so that they are able to get established and get established."}, {"heading": "4 STRUCTURE, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ROCOMO", "text": "& & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & & # 10; & # 10; & & & & # 10; & # 10; & & & & # 10; & & & # 10; & # 10; & # 10; & & & # 10; & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & # 10; & & & & # 10; & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & # 10; & # 10; & & & & & & & & # 10; & & & & & & & & & &"}, {"heading": "5 ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF RO-", "text": "COMO Bettini et al.

However, the majority of contextual information is dynamic, such as location, and its persistence is highly variable. Each element of RoCoM ontology, starting with top-level classes such as \"entity,\" \"activity,\" and \"event,\" divides its contextual information into two hierarchies - static and dynamic. This allows a simple distinction between contextual information that is persistent over a long period of time (static) and those that frequently need to be updated due to its freshness (dynamic)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Representation of temporal characteristics of primitives", "text": "For each primitive such as an enterprise, activity or event, we have defined a time class in which properties such as start time - the time at which the event / activity began or the enterprise arose, end time - the time at which the event / activity ended or the enterprise ceased to exist (which corresponds to the current time, if the individual still exists), duration or lifespan of an individual (difference in start time and end time) and repetition - frequency of repetition of an event / activity.

RoCoMO is implemented in OWL2 DL, which is expressive and allows for a more versatile representation of knowledge. In OWL, context can be represented as annotated semantics through data properties and relationships between different elements via object properties. It also allows automatic context thinking. In addition, OWL represents information hierarchically, allowing for an efficient delivery of context and multiple levels of abstraction or granular representation."}, {"heading": "5.5 Encoding bias/ Comparability", "text": "Contextual information sources represent a variety of sensors and devices that often use different measurement and encoding systems7 that result in a heterogeneous set of values that describe the same units. Therefore, context model and ontology must not depend on a particular symbol-level encoding, such as the representation of the date in a particular format. They should provide tools for comparing and converting values with different scales and encodings. To achieve this, we comment on all measurable contextual information with an annotation property called \"scale\" defined in a RoCoMO scheme (this scheme enables the matrification of any OWL statement that is part of RoCoMO)."}, {"heading": "5.6 Quality of Context (QoC)", "text": "< < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\"; \";\""}, {"heading": "5.7 Provenance and Traceability", "text": "In order to provide adequate control and interpretation of the contextual information, the model and the ontology should provide the means to determine the source of the data and the transformations. < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < <, \"< < < < < <,\" < < < < < <, \"< < < < <,\" < < < <, \"<\" < \"<\" < < < \"<"}, {"heading": "5.8 Heterogeneity and Mobility", "text": "Pervasive computing environments are characterized by distribution, heterogeneity, unpredictability, and unreliable communication connections, so the model and ontology should support these requirements and allow aggregation and merging of data when needed.

These permissions can take the form of an \"activity\" that the group is allowed to execute. Each entity can belong to several access groups, while each access group can have multiple entities and privileges. This form of access control, which is achieved by assigning users to groups and not to individual users, reduces the number of involved associations that need to be managed. Therefore, it is easier to set security policies within this framework."}, {"heading": "6 MODELING THE FIRE INCIDENT CASE STUDY USING ROCOMO", "text": "In this section, we review the Fire Incident Case Study from Section 2 and illustrate how RoCoMO can be used to model it. Figure 3 shows a graphical representation of the situation modeled in RoCoMO. At the time t0, the Fire Incident Event triggers the following situation and sets the evacuation target. This goal can be divided into smaller sub-targets that can be accomplished by one or more activities. Entity Responder1 performs the activity of updated temperature measurements, at the time t1, to obtain the context information information of the room Room123 - the updated temperature measurements of the temperature sensors TempSensor1 and Tempor2.The goal of this activity is to determine the remaining time for the evacuation. Since the information is timed, the system can periodically release it due to its freshness and this triggers any ambiguity of the system."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we have described a generic, flexible and extensible ontology called Rover Context Model Ontology (RoCoMO) and demonstrated its benefits for context and situation modeling in ubiquitous computer environments using a practical case study. We have identified several shortcomings in contemporary context models and ontologies and explained how RoCoMO remedies them. We have also identified the benefits of their capabilities by evaluating them against various criteria that ontologies should have for context and situation modeling. Our next step is to develop a GUI that allows users to browse and explore the RoCoM ontologies, as well as expand and modify them. An API for working with ontology will also be available. Our goal is to encourage users to develop applications and systems using this ontology so that they can be used both in isolation and integrated with Rover II.10."}], "references": [{"title": "Towards a better understanding of context and context-awareness", "author": ["G.
