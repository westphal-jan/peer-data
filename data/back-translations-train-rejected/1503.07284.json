If a certain combination of tags corresponds to a tag combination associated with a rule, then the rule is \"fired\" and the domains and their corresponding confidentialities are returned. If a certain combination of tags occurs, then it can be said that the query belongs to a certain domain with a certain degree of security. If the trust for a certain domain is high for a certain combination of tags, then there is a higher probability that this query belongs to that domain or can be accurately associated with it. We know that the output from the tagging phase is Q = {w1 [t1], w2 [t2]......, wj [tj]} format.

System Description", "text": "The built-in functionality system consists of three domains, Yellow Pages, Movie and Road Map Domains. There are a total of seven tags: T = {Address, Category, Proper Name, Movie Title, Movie Actor (Proper Name), Movie Actor (Category), Direction Word}. The address tag is assigned to a general address element, such as street, street or street name, or city area. The category tag is assigned to keywords, such as restaurant, theater, club, bank, hospital. A proper name is the name of a person, company, etc. The tags described above can be generally associated with yellow pages. The directional word tag is assigned to words such as from, to, way to, etc. The proper name of the movie title is partially or entirely associated with movie names, category of movie actors refers to keywords such as actor, music director, etc. The proper name of the movie actor refers to names of movie personalities."}, {"heading": "A. System Generated or Semi Supervised Rule Base", "text": "The strategy for developing a rule base is a semi-automatic process. The developed method is based on the premise that when a certain tag occurs, there is a higher probability that the tag combination belongs to a certain domain. Here, a weight is set for each tag and domain pair, namely (ti, dj) \u2192 wij. If the tag ti occurs in the query, then the weight wij is assigned to the domain j. Formally, for each day ti in sentence T and domain dj in sentence D a weight wij is assigned, namely (ti, dj) \u2192 wij. The trust of a domain dk, the trust (dk) for a tag combination (t1, t2,....., tn) is given as trust (dk) = n1i ikw. If there is a certain number of domains in the group D of domains within which the system operates, trust in a domain is normalized."}, {"heading": "B.

A quick glance through the results presented in Tables 2 to 5 might give the impression that the rule generated by the system works better than the handmade rule. Note, however, that the variation measured at Euclidean distance is the least (0) in the handmade rules. Assuming a reasonable threshold \u03c4 = 0.6, it can be seen that for C0 cases the cumulative number of cases for the handmade rule is = 106. However, for the same threshold, the rule set generated by the system is 110. We can conclude that the handmade rule actually performs much better (as expected). VI. CONCLUSIVE AND FUTURE WORK In this essay, we have described the functioning of a rule-based short query content identification system. The rule base is a critical component of the technical QIZ (We have two handcrafted tags)."}], "references": [{"title": "Varying approaches to topical web query classification", "author": ["S.M.
