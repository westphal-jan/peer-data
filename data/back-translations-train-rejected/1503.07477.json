OVERVIEW OF CLASSIFICATION", "text": "Classification is one of the data mining techniques that classifies unstructured data into structured classes and groups and helps the user discover knowledge and plan for the future [3]. Classification ensures intelligent decision-making. There are two phases of classification, first the learning phase, in which huge training data sets are provided and analyzed, then rules and patterns. Then the execution of the second phase, which is the evaluation or verification of data sets and archives of the accuracy of a classification pattern, begins. In this section, supervised classification methods such as Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine are briefly described."}, {"heading": "2.1 SUPERVISED METHODS", "text": "Problems involving classification are considered to be instances of a branch of machine learning called \"supervised learning.\" [5] In this case, the machine is given a \"training set\" of correctly classified data instances in the first stage, and then the algorithm developed from this \"learning\" is used for the next stage of prediction; the opposite is \"unsupervised learning,\" in which the data is classified into categories based on some similarity of input parameters in the data. Monitored data mining techniques are appropriate when we have a certain target value so that we can predict about our data [8]. The targets can have two or more possible outcomes or even be a continuous numerical value. To use these methods, we ideally have a subset of training data (observations and measurements) for which this target value is already known. Training data includes both the input and the desired results."}, {"heading": "1. Decision Tree (DT)", "text": "The decision is ideal to process the large amount of data. DT is a basic means to increase the efficiency and accuracy of this data."}, {"heading": "2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only be a matter of time before it is ready, until it is ready."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this report, we saw the different classification techniques in the field of big data. Both classification techniques are better suited than the other classification techniques. We also have a table showing the advantages and disadvantages of the different classification techniques. [1] Each classification technology has a different accuracy and predictors. [2] The classification efficiency of the SVM algorithm was better than the DT algorithm."}], "references": [{"title": "Data Mining with Big Data", "author": ["Xindong Wu", "Xingquan Zhu", "Gong-Qing Wu", "Wei Ding"], "venue": "Transactions On Knowledge And Data Engineering, Vol. 26, No. 1. 1041-4347/14 January 2014, IEEE.", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2014}, {"title": "A DT-SVM Strategy for Stock Futures Prediction with Big Data,\u201d16th", "author": ["Dingxian Wang", "Xiao Liu", "Mengdi Wang"], "venue": "International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2013}, {"title": "A Study on Classification Techniques in Data Mining", "author": ["G.
