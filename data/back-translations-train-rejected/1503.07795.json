But very few, and maybe no work has been done in multi-labeled analysis of the demographics of patients who are likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. To identify such groups, we applied ensembles of several multilabel learning algorithms. The best performing multi label ensembles include BR/Hoeffding Tree, CC/Hoeffding Tree, BCC/Hoeffding Tree, BR/JRIP, CC/JRIP, BCC/ JRIP respectively. In the empirical part of this study, we used on the UCI Diabetics dataset of over 100,000 records, collected from 130 US hospitals. The dataset consisted of attributes that included personal demographics, diagnoses code, lab results, etc. Experiments conducted on datasets of 1000, 10000, 20000 samples, show that BR/JRip model achieves a high overall accuracy of 0.533 (1000 samples), 0.702 (10000 samples), 0.569 (20000 samples), improving over the baseline model ZeroR with accuracy of 0.526, 0.586, .562 respectively. Loss functions such as Rank Loss, One Error, Hamming Loss, and Zero One Loss are also low for BCC/JRIP model for all samples of dataset, making it the best candidate for better performance given the label dependencies.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}}
