Finally, within this framework, a solution was added to the archive, a linear interpolation and a PSA-based strategy, both using the aggregated solutions of the entire run, to derive a series of reference points with equal spacing. On this basis, a solution was finally added to the archive system. We then used known MOPs for benchmarking [8]: an instance of the Sphere problem with X R2 and an associated convex pareto front, the DENT problem with X R2 and an associated convex convex-TX and R3 connected front."}, {"heading": "3.2 Results", "text": "At first glance, the behaviour of the algorithms within the classical EMOA is examined by comparing the MEDAs with the classical EMOA approaches in terms of the indicator Dominated Hypervolume (HV, [4]), which requires significant improvements in terms of the indicator Dominated Hypervolume (HV, [4]) and \"p\" (Figures 1 and 2), which are based on the primary reference fronts described in Section 3.1. However, it becomes apparent that the MEDAs lead to very stable results over the repeated runs reflected by both indicators, while no MEDA is superior to the others. Furthermore, the respective performance for all test strategies is comparable to the best performing algorithms outside the classical EMOA set. While for all test problems, but WFG1 PSEMOA and SCD-NSGA2 can be considered best in terms of p, SMS-EMOA exceeds the other classical EMOA strategies in terms of HV optimization."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions and Outlook", "text": "In this work, we first compared the quality of the solutions of four evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms (NSGA2, PSEMOA, SCD-NSGA2, SMS-EMOA) and four multi-objective distribution algorithms (MARTEDA, MO-CMA-ES, MONEDA, Naive MIDEA) using a number of well-known multi-objective test problems. Based on two indicators considered - HV and \u2206 p - it was shown that the performance of MEDAs at least competes with that of classical EMOAs. MEDAs themselves also developed quite similarly. Based on these competitive and therefore promising results, we analyzed whether the performance of the latter with respect to \u2206 p could even be improved by a subsequent application of forward or backward actualization strategies that lead to a more even distribution of solutions along the approximated Pareto front. Experiments confirmed this hypothesis and the apparent influence of the use of these two updating directions."}], "references": [{"title": "Towards a New Evolutionary Computation: Advances on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms", "author": ["J.A.
