CDL has formulas to express that the agent believes that he believes that the agent has some relationship to the \"AGM theory\" of faith revision, which is due to Alchourro, Ga \ufffd rdenfors and Makinson [1]. Therefore, we can also think of B\u044b that the agent will believe after he has revised his state of faith by successfully incorporating the information that is true. As with the AGM theory, CDL assumes that conditionalization (i.e. revision) is always successful: the agent should assume that the incoming information is completely trustworthy and therefore update their state of faith by consistently incorporating this incoming information."}, {"heading": "2 Plausibility models", "text": "A plausibility model is a structure M = (W, \u2264, V), consisting of a non-empty sentence W of \"worlds,\" a preorder (i.e., a reflexive and transitive binary relationship) \u2264 to W, and a propositional assessment V: W \u2192 x (P), which each world w applies to the set V (w) of the propositional letters.

Essentially, a formula that is part of the faith state after a revision by it could be substantiated by a specific reason whose syntactic structure traces the emergence of \"incremental\" basic principles, suggesting that we consider JCDL as a theory of revisable justified faith. It would be interesting to see if there is any explicit version of the general assembly revision principles that agrees with JCDL in the way that the standard general assembly revision agrees with CDL."}, {"heading": "A Technical results", "text": "This is a well-known result of order theory, but we still check it for completeness.
