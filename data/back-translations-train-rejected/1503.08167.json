These systems consist of various components that enable speech generation; one of the components of a TTS system is text normalization, which transforms non-standard text elements into their extended form and prepares them for further processing in the system (g2p conversion, prosody generation, etc.) In most cases, text normalization involves numbers, dates, time, abbreviations, acronyms, various symbols, currencies, units of measurement, etc. The first problem with text normalization is the recognition of non-standard words (NSW). Sometimes standard words and NSWs share the same font form - North Pole, Half, and Pole - / Political /. The second problem is to write the recognized NSWs in their fully extended form. For example, the first problem with text normalization is the recognition of non-standard words (NSW)."}, {"heading": "2 Text Normalization", "text": "Normalization is the first step in the word preprocessing of TTS [7]. The normalization module is responsible for the identification of a single NSW token and its transformation into extended form. Normally, NSWs are not listed in the dictionary and there is no clear rule for their expansion or pronunciation [12]. Also, they are more ambiguous than conventional words in meaning or pronunciation. The first problem is to identify all NSWs in Croatian and separate them from standard words. The second problem is the transformation of recognized NSW into extended form, fitting the TTS system. These two problems are the most obvious, but there are some other problems to consider. For example: When does punctuation mark the end of a sentence, and when is an abbreviation? For example, in the sentence \"Ivo je na natjecanju bio 3. i odlikovan je broncom.\" would we recognize the number / 3. / as \"the third\" But like this two sentences, the computer cannot recognize one and two?"}, {"heading": "3 Taxonomy of Normalization for Croatian Language", "text": "In most TTS systems, the normalization of the text is achieved by using handwritten rules defined for specific fields of application [1,12], together with rules [16], n-gram models [7,12], decision trees and weighted finite state converters [12] or reference dictionaries (lists) of the most common NSWs with their extended form [12], these were used. Listing all NSWs is tedious and therefore never ensures the complete success of normalization, i.e. it does not guarantee that some novel NSW characters from the input text will also be listed in the reference dictionary. Therefore, we suggest that the taxonomy, which classifies all positive NSWs, provides the complete framework for text standardization for the Croatian language. First, the module classifies NSWs as letters, digits or combinations as shown in the main classification tree table 1. It is important that the textual rules are written strictly according to the proposed taxographic categories."}, {"heading": "4 Implementation", "text": "The normative algorithms are implemented in Perl. Perl is suitable for word processing [11], because there are many automatic functions to solve problems of lexical analysis and functions for word processing. The proposed solution is based on the identification of NSW with regular expressions contained in the correct class of the tree. Numerical values are very suitable for normalization, because it is easy, as many as there are, hundreds, thousands they contain the number of digits. By dividing the digits we get the numerical value for each digit. Then, each digit is replaced by a word."}, {"heading": "5 Results and Integration", "text": "The results of the proposed Croatian text collection are in relation to the acquired correctness as a percentage of recognized tokens (the number of words covered in the original text), the number of tokens covered (the number of words covered in the original text), the number of terms covered (the number of terms covered), the number of terms covered (the number of terms covered), the number of terms covered (the number of terms covered), the number of terms covered (the number of terms covered), the number of terms covered (the number of terms covered), the number of terms covered (the number of terms covered), the number of terms covered (the number of terms covered), the number of terms covered (the number of terms covered), the number of terms covered (the number of terms covered), the number of terms (the number of terms covered), the number of terms covered (the number of terms covered), the number of terms (the number of terms covered), the number of terms (the number of terms covered), the number of (the number of terms covered), the number of words (the number of terms covered), the number of words (the number of terms covered), the number of words (the number of terms covered), the number of words (the number of terms covered), the number of words (the number of terms covered), the number of words (the number of terms covered), the number of words (the number of words (the terms covered), the number of words (the number of terms covered), the number of words (the number of terms covered), the number of words (the number of words (the), the number of words, the number of words (the number of terms covered), the number of words (the tokens), the number of words (the tokens), the number of words (the tokens), the number of words (the tokens), the number of words (the number of words (the number of terms covered), the number of words (the tokens), the number of words (the tokens), the tokens (the number of words (the number of terms covered), the tokens (the tokens), the number of the tokens (the tokens), the number of the tokens (the number"}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "This paper describes the normalization of non-standardized words in Croatian texts for the purpose of speech synthesis. Normalization of the text is highly complex if we take into account the determination of the correct gender, number and case of normalized words. Also, the problem is that input texts are not written completely according to the orthographic principles of the standard Croatian language and the text normalization module must have a certain degree of tolerance in the execution of its methods, which make the systems even more complex. Synthesized text is better and more complete if as many samples as possible are extended in the text pre-processing process. To this end, we proposed the taxonomy of croatical NSWs, which unifies the normalization procedures of Croatian texts. Algorithms for detecting samples for normalization (ordinary and cardinal numbers, data of numerical and combined forms, time, abbreviations, acronyms and symbols) and algorithms for normalization of forms, date and abbreviation forms (were constructed as date and normalities)."}], "references": [{"title": "From Text to Speech: the MITalk System", "author": ["J.
