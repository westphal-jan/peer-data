It illustrates a neighbourhood of six single-family houses, in which each house consists of the following components: (1) a PV system, (3) an interface to the neighbouring buildings, (5) a grid connection.

In this way, individual load profiles were generated for the 6 households over a period of 30 days with a resolution of one hour, yielding an average load consumption of 16 kWh per household and day at a mean value of 30 days. PV data acquisition generated the same PV profile for each household over a period of 30 days with a resolution of one hour. If the same PV profile is used for each building, this corresponds to the case that each roof has the same orientation and slope as well as the same number and type of PV modules. Such a situation is realistic in newly built housing estates with a resolution of one hour."}, {"heading": "2.3 System Modelling", "text": "Figure 1 gave an overview of the topology of the energy system and its components, which was realized within the framework of a Visual Studio C + + simulation. In order to keep the system modelling simple and to allow easier analysis of the results, efficiency losses of individual components (PV modules, PV and battery inverters, batteries, wiring, etc.) were neglected in the current study. Thus, analyses could be carried out independently of the performance of the currently available technologies, which are actually changing and rapidly improving, making it possible to investigate the theoretical limits and potentials of the chosen energy management strategies independently of a particular technology currently on the market. In the given test scenarios for energy storage (see Section 2.4), analyses with battery storage capacities of 16 kWh per household were carried out, which corresponded to the average amount of daily PV production and load consumption."}, {"heading": "2.4 Specified Test Scenarios", "text": "In order to test the optimisers developed (see Section 2.5.2), five different test scenarios were defined, from which scenarios 3 to 5 were divided into two further sub-scenarios each. The main objective of each of the five scenarios was to optimise the local consumption of locally generated PV energy, thereby reducing the energy exchange with the grid as much as possible (see Section 2.5.1 for further details). In order to achieve this goal, different measures can be selected for each scenario (see Table II). In scenarios 1 and 3, for example, each building aims to individually optimise its local PV energy consumption, while in the other cases an energy exchange with neighbours is supported. In scenarios 1 and 2, no buffering of PV energy in a battery storage system is supported, while the other scenarios allow such a temporary energy storage system. Scenarios 3 to 4 only allow individual storage use, while scenario 5 allows the exchange of energy using neighbouring storage systems. Furthermore, scenarios 3b do not support the storage network (whereby the electricity storage network is not supported by the other)."}, {"heading": "2.5 Optimizer", "text": "In fact, the majority of them are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight."}, {"heading": "III.

The optimization goal was to maximize local consumption of locally generated PV energy. The results of the modified simulated incandescent optimizer were evaluated by comparing them with the globally optimal solution, which was determined by a computationally expensive search approach for the entire space, which searches through all possible action combinations and achieves the solution using a computationally inexpensive gradient descent algorithm. While the results of the gradient descent algorithm showed the need to develop a method that is not so easily caught in local minimums, the modified simulated incandescent approach found the global optimum in six of eight tested scenarios. For the remaining two scenarios, a local optimum was optimized to calculate the global optimum 03% less than the global optimization function (very close to the local optimization function for 1.3%)."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The work described in this article was co-financed by the European Commission under the INTERREG programme to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Italy and Carinthia (Austria) and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under the Fit4Set programme (Vision Step I project)."}], "references": [{"title": "Cognitive Architectures as Building Energy Management System for Future Renewable Energy Scenarios \u2013 A Work in Progress Report", "author": ["R.
