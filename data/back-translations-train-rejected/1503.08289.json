Two of the most recent proposals for axiomatization came from Brunelli and Fedrizzi [7] 1 and from Koczkodaj and Szwarc [24]. In addition to presenting separate axiomatic systems, the two proposals differ in their conclusions, with Koczkodaj and Szwarc being more drastic. To cut a long story short, the first two axioms are simple regularity conditions, while the third seems to be rather restrictive. These three axioms have the form of appropriate properties and serve the implicit definition of inconsistency indices. In agreement with this, the authors claimed that their axiomatic system \"allows us to define inconsistencies when they then provide a function.\""}, {"heading": "3.1 The triad and the matrix", "text": "The interpretation of the third axiom of Koczkodaj and Szwarelli is problematic because of its ambiguous definition and the soundness of the stated motivation. According to them [24]: \"It is a reasonable expectation that the degradation of a triad used in the definition of consistency cannot make the whole matrix more consistent.\" The following example calls their expectation into question. Consider the matrix 1 2 2 4 4 4 4 4 1 / 4 1 1 1 1 / 3 1 / 4 1 / 2 1. The entry a15 appears in the triads (a12, a25, a15), a35, a15) and (a15, a15).

Many other axiomatic systems work in a similar manner, such as the axiomatic definition of distance in metric spaces or the norm in linear spaces. It should follow that if a function that I perform their three axioms, then this same function should be respected as an inconsistency index (at least by the authors who proposed the axioms in linear spaces). Considering the ambiguous formulation (especially regarding the third axiom), by considering a 3 \u00d7 3 pairwise comparison matrixA3 \u00d7 3 = 1 aiczom aik1 / aiczom 1 ajom 1 / aik 1, the axiomatic system of Koczkodadadaj and the 1 is waromatic."}, {"heading": "3.3 One rotten apple does not necessarily spoil the barrel", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive by not following the rules they have imposed on themselves.

Ideally, as also proposed by Horn and Johnson [18], a norm should capture the \"size\" of a vector. N1 and N2 capture two views of the \"size\" of x, namely N1 represents the component-based contributions, whereas N2 only takes into account the largest. Consequently, they can give very different answers to the question regarding the \"consistency\" of the vector x. Nevertheless, they are both norms, since they respect the axiomatic conditions for norms. Considering the vector x = (3, 0, 0, 0)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The author is grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments."}], "references": [{"title": "The geometric consistency index: Approximated thresholds", "author": ["J.
