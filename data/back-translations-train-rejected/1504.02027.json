Primary Neutrosophical information is defined by three parameters: degree of truth, degree of falsehood, and degree of neutrality. Blurred representation is described by a single parameter, the degree of truth, while the degree of falsehood has an error value calculated by a negation formula: 1 (1,1) and the degree of neutrality has a default value of 0. Blurred intuitionist representation is described by two explicit parameters, the degree of truth and the degree of falsehood, while the degree of falsehood has a default value of 0. Atanassov considered the incomplete variant of neutrality taking into account 1.
