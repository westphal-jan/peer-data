Kasiviswanathan et al. [KLN + 11] initiated the Differential Private Learning Study [DMNS06] with the aim of enabling such analysis while providing a strong formal guarantee of the privacy afforded to individuals. Broadly speaking, a differentiated private learner is obliged to issue a classification of the examples referred to that is precise but does not significantly alter the presence or absence of an individual example. The early positive results of private learning found that each concept class is privately learnable, with a number of examples logarithmic to the size of the concept class [KLN + 11]. Since then, a number of papers have improved our understanding of example complexity - the minimum number of examples - required by such learners in order to simultaneously achieve a high level of privacy, privacy and some privacy.

A learner L is given n samples of the form (xi, c (xi))) where the xi's are drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution, and are labeled after an unknown concept c. The goal of the learner is to create a hypothesis h: X \u2192 {0} from a hypothesis class H that approximates c well on the unknown distribution. This is the probability that h does not agree with c on a fresh example from the unknown distribution - say, less than 0.05. The hypothesis class H may differ from C, but in the case where H'C we call a regular learner. Furthermore, we say that a learner is efficient when it runs polynomial in time."}, {"heading": "1.2 Our Techniques", "text": "We give an informal overview of the construction and analysis of the EncThresh concept class.

We show how to use order-revealing encryption to separate computationally efficient PAC learning from efficient (\u03b5, \u03b4)-differentially private PAC learning. That is, we construct a concept class that is efficiently PAC learnable, but for which every efficient learner fails to be differentially private. This answers a question of Kasiviswanathan et al. (FOCS \u201908, SIAM J. Comput. \u201911). To prove our result, we give a generic transformation from an order-revealing encryption scheme into one with strongly correct comparison, which enables the consistent comparison of ciphertexts that are not obtained as the valid encryption of any message. We believe this construction may be of independent interest.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
