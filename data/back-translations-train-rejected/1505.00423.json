INTRODUCTION", "text": "Time is probably the most common type of data occurring in practically all areas of modern life where measurements have time stamps (e.g. physiological and medical, financial, meteorological, acoustic and videographic).In many cases, the underlying patterns of these data sets are not known and visual inspection is often not feasible given the complexity and size of the data. Therefore, the search for the most repetitive methods to do all or part of this work is essential."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Research into the discovery of time series motifs suffered from a terminological ambiguity. Initially, motifs were defined as the most common patterns in a time series [25]. However, in another publication, the term \"motif\" was redefined as the closest pair among the series segments [23, 21]. In this essay, we refer to \"the most common patterns\" [25] when it comes to motifs, whereas the closest pair of series segments is referred to as the \"pair motif,\" as suggested by [19]."}, {"heading": "2.1 Pair-motif discovery", "text": "The brute force search, which calculates the distance of each seg-ar Xiv: 150 5.00 423v 1 [cs.A I] 3 May 201 5ment pair, is arithmetically expensive, so efforts are being made to scale up the brute force. A fast but precise method of detecting pairs of motifs was introduced by [23]. Enumerations of all motifs with variable length have also been researched [20, 19]. In a streaming scenario, an algorithm cannot rely on accessing the entire past series, so we must find the top k motif search using an online method such as in [12]. Furthermore, the statistical significance of the motifs found is also a topic of interest [4, 5].Note: The search for motif pairs corresponds to the problem of finding the nearest pair of dots in a geometric space and a historical geometry [8]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Motif Discovery", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves how they have behaved."}, {"heading": "3. PRELIMINARIES", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Notations", "text": "3.1.1 Time Series and Motifs A time series is a long sequence of real values. Such a series is abstracted as a list of J-many Z-normalized sliding window segments of length L and is then called S-RJ \u00b7 L. On the other hand, a repetitive pattern, also known as a motif, is simply a sequence of L-points. The definition can be generalized to a series of K-motifs and continuously defined as M-RK \u00b7 L.3.1.2 Motif Frequency The frequency of occurrence of a motif is defined as the non-trivial (see Section 3.2.2) number of similarities between a motif and all normalized segments of the time series. The current approach to counting the frequency of coincidence of the k-th motif is the frequency of the k-th motif, denotedMk,: a motif iterated over all j-segments {1, &."}, {"heading": "3.2 Problem Definition", "text": "3.2.1 Optimal motifs According to the established literature definition, the only optimality criterion of a motif is its frequency at a certain distance threshold. Therefore, the only legitimate measure for comparing the qualities of motifs is the frequency (alias support or number of matches).The optimal motifs M * for a time series are defined in Eq.3 as the candidate motifs M reaching the maximum frequency value F (M) from Eq.1. Nevertheless, there is an important limitation in the search for motifs: The K motifs should differ from each other [25], otherwise the motifs run the risk of being close variations of the single, most repetitive motif. Such a restriction is included in Eq.3 under such (see) clause, which distinguishes each pair of motifs (Mk,:, Mp,:)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Searching The Motifs", "text": "The modern methods described in Section 2, which focus on the search for motifs, are primarily concerned with trying out candidate motifs from the series segments. Although they propose important innovations in their scope (scalability, length analysis, etc.), these techniques are still qualitatively at the upper limit due to the brute force motif search. Algorithm 1 describes a speed-naive, but qualitatively search-optimized implementation of a brute force motif search. We can predict the frequency of all series segments in O (J2L) runtime complexity and then search for the top K motifs based on the calculated frequencies in O (K2JL) time. Since K is typically a small number compared to the segments J > > K, the total brute force search therefore exhibits a complexity of O (J2L + K2JL) and O (J2JL), which is quadratically indicated by the number of motifs we suggest in the sequence (in this case the higher number of the sequence)."}, {"heading": "4.

In this essay, we will optimize the objective functionality by gradient-ascending motif updates in a series of iterations. Since both areas of the F series and V points of the equation lie between 0 and 1, no terms will go beyond the overall learning and we will not have found that both are adapted to our experiment.In this section, the two terms are preliminary and we have not adapted to our experiment.In this section, we have found that both, the smooth motif frequency and the smooth motif frequency and the smooth motif diversity of the motif diversity merge into a meaningful lens function."}, {"heading": "4.5 Learning Algorithm", "text": "Our method is detailed in Algorithm 2 and in this section we will explain the steps of the algorithm in detail.

However, the learning rate and the number of iterations I are less critical hyperparameters, which control the number of steps required until convergence. Convergence is safely attainable for low learning rates and a large number of iterations. The algorithm starts with a set of motifs initialized from random segments and updates them towards partial gradients using a learning speed of steps that are maximized. The learning rate is dynamically updated per point of each motif with an adaptive technique called degree."}, {"heading": "4.6 Convergence of The Learning Algorithm", "text": "The learning algorithm converges by updating the motives so that the approximate frequency is maximized.

OPTIMALITY OF OUR METHOD", "text": "The objective function of Equation 12 is not concave, since the frequency function is a sum of Gaussians and not concave.

Here, we create all possible motifs of length 500 using two values (for the sake of a 3D diagram), one for all the first 250 points in the X axis and another value for the last 250 points in the Y axis. As can be clearly seen, frequency is not a concave function in relation to motifs and has multiple local maximizations.In the case of non-concave functions (or non-convex for minimizing problems), an effective Koch-Buch solution is to combine the gradient departure with a random restart strategy [16]. To avoid the gradient descending optimization getting stuck in local maxima, it is restarted with random initial motifs for the local maxima."}, {"heading": "5.1 Runtime Algorithmic Complexity", "text": "The runtime complexity of algorithm 2 is determined by the calculation steps and the update steps.

Similarly complex is the calculation of the courses of diversity violation in relation to the motif with O (RIK2L).

CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper proposed a new perspective in the learning of time series motifs. In contrast to the current state of the art, where motif candidates from serial segments are sought, our method learns them in a principled optimization. The motif frequency is approximated as a differentiable function, and a method of gradient ascent is proposed to find the motif values that maximize the objective function. To avoid local optima, a random restart strategy is combined with learning the gradient ascent of the motifs. Learned optimal motifs have more segment matches than the motifs found in the search, for the same distance threshold. The optimal motifs represent latent patterns that are not necessarily present as sub-sequences in explicit form, so can identify motifs that are located at the center of the densest hyperspheres, including segment points. Detailed experimental results show that learning optimal motifs always produces more qualitative motifs than they seek."}, {"heading": "9.

The discovery of motifs is crucial for practitioners in order to understand and interpret the phenomena occurring in sequential data. Currently, motifs are searched among series sub-sequences, aiming at selecting the most frequently occurring ones. Search-based methods, which try out series sub-sequence as motif candidates, are currently believed to be the best methods in finding the most frequent patterns. However, this paper proposes an entirely new perspective in finding motifs. We demonstrate that searching is nonoptimal since the domain of motifs is restricted, and instead we propose a principled optimization approach able to find optimal motifs. We treat the occurrence frequency as a function and time-series motifs as its parameters, therefore we learn the optimal motifs that maximize the frequency function. In contrast to searching, our method is able to discover the most repetitive patterns (hence optimal), even in cases where they do not explicitly occur as sub-sequences. Experiments on several real-life time-series datasets show that the motifs found by our method are highly more frequent than the ones found through searching, for exactly the same distance threshold.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
