RELATED WORK", "text": "The term \"Semantic Web\" was coined more than 10 years ago by Tim Berners-Lee to discover the potential of SWD components across the Web. [7] Since then, this term has been used and quickly filled with content. During this time, semantic web technologies have been actively developed, so it was not surprising that the task of ontology search on the Web has already been investigated and even implemented. There are several implemented ontology web search engines and let's analyze them to look at them individually. SWOGLE was the first search engine for the Semantic Web, and the main contribution of SWOGLE was Li Ding [8]. SWOGLE is positioned as a crawler-based indexing and retrieval system for the Semantic Web documents, including the RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL [9]. SWOGLE consists of four key components SWD (Semantic Web Document) discovery, metadata analysis, data interface, and interface."}, {"heading": "III.

CONCLUSION", "text": "The project aims to develop a web search engine for the search and indexing of OWL ontologies on the web [3]. In the course of the project description, the achievements of the search engine technology were considered, the typical structure of a web search engine was described, ontology web search strategies were identified, related work in the field of ontology search was overlooked, and also the structure of the ontology web search engine was presented. This structure was described in detail in order to have the possibility of realizing the project as soon as possible. It seems that OWL ontologies cannot completely replace regular websites. At least, it can be argued that this will not happen in the near future. In fact, this is a really difficult task, taking into account the distributed nature of the web. Such a situation contradicts the purpose that this knowledge can be generated regularly in order to use the side of the SWES system (a rule designed so that all websites can be converted in the near future)."}], "references": [{"title": "P", "author": ["J.
