It offers a more flexible formalism than the equivalent CSTP model of Tsamardinos, Vidal and Pollack, from which it was derived mainly as a sound formalization. Three notions of consistency arise for CSTNs and CSTPs: weak, strong, and dynamic. Dynamic consistency is the most interesting notion, but it is also the most challenging and it was conjectured to be hard to assess. Tsamardinos, Vidal and Pollack gave a doubly-exponential time algorithm for deciding whether a CSTN is dynamically-consistent and to produce, in the positive case, a dynamic execution strategy of exponential size. In the present work we offer a proof that deciding whether a CSTN is dynamically-consistent is coNP-hard and provide the first singly-exponential time algorithm for this problem, also producing a dynamic execution strategy whenever the input CSTN is dynamically-consistent. The algorithm is based on a novel connection with Mean Payoff Games, a family of two-player combinatorial games on graphs well known for having applications in model-checking and formal verification. The presentation of such connection is mediated by the Hyper Temporal Network model, a tractable generalization of Simple Temporal Networks whose consistency checking is equivalent to determining Mean Payoff Games. In order to analyze the algorithm we introduce a refined notion of dynamic-consistency, named \\epsilon-dynamic-consistency, and present a sharp lower bounding analysis on the critical value of the reaction time \\hat{\\varepsilon} where the CSTN transits from being, to not being, dynamically-consistent. The proof technique introduced in this analysis of \\hat{\\varepsilon} is applicable more in general when dealing with linear difference constraints which include strict inequalities.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 May 2015 22:14:28 GMT  (56kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00828v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 8 May 2015 09:48:07 GMT  (56kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00828v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 08:16:45 GMT  (56kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00828v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 17 Jul 2015 15:42:23 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00828v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["carlo comin", "romeo rizzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.00828"}, "pdf": {"name": "1505.00828.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Dynamic Consistency of Conditional Simple Temporal Networks via Mean Payoff Games: a Singly-Exponential Time DC-Checking", "authors": ["Carlo Comin", "Romeo Rizzi"], "emails": ["carlo.comin@unitn.it", "romeo.rizzi@univr.it"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to another world, in which they are able to move to another world, in which they are able to move to another world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they are able to"}, {"heading": "II.

RELATED WORKS", "text": "Remember that the article by Tsamardinos, et al. [16] was already discussed in the introduction, and the work of Cimatti, et al. [5] provided the first solid and complete algorithm for verifying the dynamic controllability of CSTNs with uncertainty (CSTNU) and can therefore be used as a special case to verify the dynamic consistency of CSTNs. The algorithm is reduced to the problem of solving time slot machines (TGA). Nevertheless, [5] no worst-case has been defined that is tied to the temporal complexity of the process. We note that solving TGAs is a problem of much higher complexity than solving MPGs, compare the following known facts: The solution of 1-player TGAs is PSPACEcomplete and the solution of 2-player TGAs is EXP-complete; on the contrary, the problem of determining MPGAs in MPP GP P P is MPP."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "The algorithm actually manages a few more general variants of the problem, where labels are not required to be conjunctions and hyperarc constraints in which input CSTNs can be empirically captured, apart from the classical binary constraints. In summary, at the core of the algorithm, a reduction to MPGs is mediated by the HyTN model. CSTN is dynamically consistent if and only if the corresponding MPG is obtained everywhere, and a dynamic execution strategy can be conveniently read from an all-conquering position strategy. At most, the size of this MPG is polynomic in the number of possible scenarios; as such, the term on the exponent is linear, at worst linear in the number of observation events, and the same applies to the runtime of the resulting algorithm."}], "references": [{"title": "The tropical shadowvertex algorithm solves mean payoff games in polynomial time on average", "author": ["X.

constraint-based graph-formalism for conditional temporal planning. It offers a more flexible formalism than the equivalent CSTP model of Tsamardinos, Vidal and Pollack, from which it was derived mainly as a sound formalization. Three notions of consistency arise for CSTNs and CSTPs: weak, strong, and dynamic. Dynamic consistency is the most interesting notion, but it is also the most challenging and it was conjectured to be hard to assess. Tsamardinos, Vidal and Pollack gave a doubly-exponential time algorithm for deciding whether a CSTN is dynamicallyconsistent and to produce, in the positive case, a dynamic execution strategy of exponential size. In the present work we offer a proof that deciding whether a CSTN is dynamicallyconsistent is coNP-hard and provide the first singly-exponential time algorithm for this problem, also producing a dynamic execution strategy whenever the input CSTN is dynamically-consistent. The algorithm is based on a novel connection with Mean Payoff Games, a family of two-player infinite games played on finite graphs, well known for having applications in model-checking and formal verification. The presentation of such connection is mediated by the Hyper Temporal Network model, a tractable generalization of Simple Temporal Networks whose consistency checking is equivalent to determining Mean Payoff Games. In order to analyze the algorithm we introduce a refined notion of dynamic-consistency, named -dynamic-consistency, and present a sharp lower bounding analysis on the critical value of the reaction time \u03b5\u0302 where the CSTN transits from being, to not being, dynamically-consistent. The proof technique introduced in this analysis of \u03b5\u0302 is applicable more generally when dealing with linear difference constraints which include strict inequalities.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
