Link Context and Time", "text": "The context must be defined in accordance with the space-time domain. This observation is consistent with Ryan's view of the importance of time in the characterization of the context. [20] In fact, any situation, event, or interaction should be performed within a mandatory time interval. Granularity of this interval is critical because it represents the temporal extension of the information describing the context. [7] This fact also has implications for the quantity of information: one can move from a small number of units of information to a database depending on whether one focuses on a short-term event or on a sequence of events (activity). We also reinforce our approach with Jensen's Affirmation [7]. It distinguishes two aspects of time that are very specific in the description of temporal data: LocationTimeAdaptationPredictionPredictionConsideredNot 1994 1997 1998 1999 1999 1999 1999 1999 2000 2005 2008 2008 Non-explicitly Chilit Adams, Page Wouvey, Brown, Brown Ward, Brown."}, {"heading": "B. Link Context and Space", "text": "In the literature, the spatial context is at best reduced to a variable location (user location), as M. Georgia et al. \"We can identify the places that are located in the relative user environment.\" [15] Rather, we can find the concept of \"context use,\" which defines and encompasses all the information that characterizes the user, the environment and the platform. [19] Li [14] defined the spatial context (or geographical context) in three dimensions: (1) the static spatial context, (2) the dynamic spatial context and (3) the internal spatial context. He defined it as follows: \u2022 The static spatial context: is geo-spatial information that can have an impact on the user's environment. For example, information about the road network, buildings, shops, interior structures (rooms, offices, homes...). \u2022 Dynamic spatial contexts: collect geo-spatial information that is collected, for example, by different types of sensors."}, {"heading": "C.

Proposed Context Definition", "text": "Our definition promotes the following axes: (1) the representation of time as the most important feature of the context, (2) the redefinition of the spatial dimension in the ecological integrity of the system and services in a context of use, (3) and the inclusion of the finality of the context in the definition of contextual information. This means that the elements of the context for which the context is used should be taken into account. We then note that the predictive definition is mandatory. Knowledge of the adaptation scenario based on the current context does not require the identification of the spatial or temporal information, neither the finality of the context, nor the attributes are decisive for the prediction. The context in a pervasive system is located around a spatial context and is defined by the three axes mentioned above: (1) time (2) space, and (3) purpose (4) purpose. \""}, {"heading": "E.
