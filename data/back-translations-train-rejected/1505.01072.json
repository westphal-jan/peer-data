MEASURED QUANTITIES", "text": "We consider measured quantities as a 5-tuple of form: (sign, number, errors, scientific notation, units), where underlined elements are mandatory and other optional. As an example, a team of researchers in Italy recently obtained the first direct measurement of the curvature of gravity as (1.3999 \u00b1 0.003) x 10 \u2212 5s \u2212 2m \u2212 1 [10]. The corresponding 5-tuple representation of these numbers is: (< empty >, 1.3999, 0.003 \u2212 5, s \u2212 2m \u2212 1).5 tuples like these are populated with a set of extraction rules that operate on individual sets. These rules fall into four broad categories: 1) pre-processing, 3) quantities and 4) post-processing. Simplified forms of some of the rules for units and quantities are referred to in Table 1.3 We refer to the implementation of such rules as Measured Quantity Extractor or MQE."}, {"heading": "3. MEASURED PROPERTIES", "text": "To better illustrate the problem, we show several sample snippets that contain measurement variables. In each example, the measured amount is shown in blue, the measured property is highlighted in red, and the symbols connecting them are underlined: \u2022 a pixel pitch as high as about 352 microns \u2022 a 352 micron pixel pitch \u2022 the pixel pitch used was 352 microns. \u2022 an average gravitational curvature is as follows: \u2022 10 \u2212 5s \u2212 2% with a size of 30% that stirs up sulfuric acid \u2022 a size of 0.1 m2 \u2022 the frequency of the longitudinal sampling was about 300 Hz. \u2022 a nominal current density of 1.3 A / cm2 to 0.03 A / cm2 \u2022 a plate thickness of less than 8.90 ksi (61.4 MPa) \u2022 wavelengths of at least 2.4 microns \u2022 large fields of about 10 kV / cmFrom the examples shown, it is easy to see that we have an extremely high degree of stability."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION", "text": "Because our research is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), we evaluate our approach based on a block of text consisting of 40,807 unclassified research reports published in the 2008-2010 timeframe and hosted by the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). This rich collection describes a wide range of research funded by the DoD that spans many areas from engineering and physics to biomedical research and social science. From this collection, we generate samples with the following procedure. To evaluate the ability of the MQE to extract measured quantities, we sampled uniform random sets from the population with a numerical value. By examining sets of numbers (but not necessarily a measurement unit), we are able to identify false negatives in addition to false positives."}, {"heading": "5. AN APPLICATION: MQSEARCH", "text": "Here we present MQSearch: a realisation of a search engine with full support for measured information. MQSearch is implemented with Apache Solr6 and AJAX Solr7, which both support full-text search, multi-faceted navigation and numerical range queries. In the process of indexing and including the DTIC document in our search engine, we apply our extractors to encountered text and store both measured quantities and measured properties in the search engine index. In addition, the search engine performs keyphrase extraction on documents using the KERA algorithm described in [8]. Using Solr filter queries, extracted keyphrases can be used to generate a tag cloud for each subset of the document. Figure 1 shows the multi-faceted navigation field of MQSearch, which allows users to filter documents based on detected measurement units, set ranges and measured properties. Figure 1 selects the measurement unit mU / L."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a proven effective approach to extracting measured information from unstructured text data; we have demonstrated how to extract metrics and the properties to be measured; and we have shown how such extractions can be used in a search engine for documents that are rich in measured information; to our knowledge, no other search engine supports such functionality; and our extraction method6http: / / lucene.apache.org / solr / 7https: / / github.com / evolvingweb / ajax-solr 8This cancer research was funded by the U.S. Army's MRMC through a congressionist research program and has the potential to greatly improve the search, navigation, and exploratory analysis of large or even huge collections of scientific and technical articles; for future work, we plan to combine our proposed approaches with other well-studied exploratory search techniques."}, {"heading": "7.
