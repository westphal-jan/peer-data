Traditionally, these FTA-based analyses are done using paper-and-pencil proof methods or computer simulations, which cannot ascertain absolute correctness due to their inherent limitations. As a complementary approach, we propose to use the higher-order-logic theorem prover HOL4 to conduct the FTA-based analysis of safety-critical systems where accuracy of failure analysis is a dire need. In particular, the paper presents a higher-order-logic formalization of generic Fault Tree gates, i.e., AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR and NOT and the formal verification of their failure probability expressions. Moreover, we have formally verified the generic probabilistic inclusion-exclusion principle, which is one of the foremost requirements for conducting the FTA-based failure analysis of any given system. For illustration purposes, we conduct the FTA-based failure analysis of a solar array that is used as the main source of power for the Dong Fang Hong-3 (DFH-3) satellite.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 May 2015 05:14:08 GMT  (712kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02648v1", "16"]], "COMMENTS": "16", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["waqar ahmed", "osman hasan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.02648"}, "pdf": {"name": "1505.02648.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Osman Hasan"], "emails": ["waqar.ahmad@seecs.nust.edu.pk", "osman.hasan@seecs.nust.edu.pk"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: higher order logic, probabilistic analysis, theorem proving, solar rays of the satellite"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it is at an all-time high in the history of the European Union."}, {"heading": "2 Probability Theory in HOL", "text": "In this section, we offer a brief overview of the HOL4 formalization of probability theory [19] on which we are building in this thesis. Based on the measured theoretical foundations, a probability space is defined as a triple list (\u0432 Li, Pr), which is a set designated as sample space, \u03a3 represents an \u03c3 algebra of subsets of probability calculation, in which the subsets are usually designated as measurable sets, and Pr is a measurable quantity with domain number \u03a3 and is 1 for the entire sample space. In the HOL4 probability theory, Formalization [19], in which a probability space and subsets return the corresponding probability spaces and subsets, or the corresponding quantity and number of sizes, respectively. Based on this definition, all basic probability axioms are verified. Now, a random variable is a measurable function between a probability space and a measurable space, which is essentially a pair (S, where A and subsets are not a collection of S)."}, {"heading": "3 Formalization of Fault Tree Gates", "text": "In this section we describe a general formalization of commonly used FT gates in Table 1.

In FTA, all the basic error events that can cause the occurrence of the system failure event are first identified, and these error events are then combined to model the general error behavior of the given system by using the error genres. [25] These combinations of the basic error events, known as cut sets, are then reduced to minimal cut sets (MCS), using some set theory rules such as idempotent, associative and commutative [25]. At this point, the PIE principle is used to evaluate the overall error probability of the given system based on the MCS events.

[5] The solar array is normally driven by the use of a torsional burst [5]. Whereas, the closed cable loop (CCL), and the stepping or servo motors are used during the synchronization and orientation phases [5]. An FT can therefore be constructed by taking into account the faults in these mechanical components, which are the fundamental causes of satellite system failure."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "The accuracy of error analysis is an urgent need for safety and mission critical applications where faulty error analysis can lead to catastrophic situations, including loss of life or severe financial setbacks. In this paper, we have presented a precise FTA approach based on higher order theoretical evidence to tackle the analysis of such critical systems. In particular, the paper presents a formalization of the commonly used FT gates and the PIE principle, which are the most important foundations for formal considerations about FTA within solid theorem evidence. As a case study, the paper also presents the formal error analysis of a satellite solar array. Building on the results presented in this paper, other FT gates, such as priority and tuning gates, can be formally modeled, and thus the scope of FTA-based formal reliability analysis [32] can be further improved. Some interesting applications in the real world that may benefit from our transports systems [3] and other avionics systems [3] can facilitate."}], "references": [{"title": "Fault Tree Handbook", "author": ["N.H.

availability and safety of many complex engineering systems. Traditionally, these FTAbased analyses are done using paper-and-pencil proof methods or computer simulations, which cannot ascertain absolute correctness due to their inherent limitations. As a complementary approach, we propose to use the higher-order-logic theorem prover HOL4 to conduct the FTAbased analysis of safety-critical systems where accuracy of failure analysis is a dire need. In particular, the paper presents a higher-order-logic formalization of generic Fault Tree gates, i.e., AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR and NOT and the formal verification of their failure probability expressions. Moreover, we have formally verified the generic probabilistic inclusion-exclusion principle, which is one of the foremost requirements for conducting the FTA-based failure analysis of any given system. For illustration purposes, we conduct the FTA-based failure analysis of a solar array that is used as the main source of power for the Dong Fang Hong-3 (DFH-3) satellite.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
