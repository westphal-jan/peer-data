ARABIC LANGUAGE", "text": "Arabic is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. According to the Egyptian Demographic Center, it is the native language of about 300 million people (22 countries). By 2013, there are approximately 135.6 million Arabic Internet users. [2] The alignment of the script is right-to-left and the Arabic alphabet consists of 28 letters. The Arabic alphabet can be expanded to ninety elements by writing additional forms, markers and vowels. Most Arabic words are morphologically derived from a list of roots that are trilingual, quadrilingual or quadrilingual. [3] Most of these roots are trilingual. Arabic words are divided into three main parts of the speech, namely nouns, including adjectives and adverbs, verbs and particles. In formal writing, Arabic sentences are often distracted by commas and periods. [Arabic language has two main forms: standard Arabic and dialectal Arabic.] Classical Arabic includes classical Arabic (CA) and Mectal, while Arabic is currently spoken in different forms during daily life among the six Arabic languages."}, {"heading": "3.
