CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGIES", "text": "In this section, the concepts related to language understanding that are used in this essay are presented."}, {"heading": "2.1. Dialogue Act", "text": "The terminology of speech acts was treated by Searle (1969) on the basis of the Austin work (1962) as follows (Webb, 2010): assertively, they oblige the speaker to be truthful about a proposal (e.g., assertion, assertion, reporting, announcement) Guidelines that attempt to achieve some effect through the listener's action (e.g., commands, pleading, requesting, begging) Commissions oblige the speaker to act in the future (e.g., promise, offering, swearing, doing something) Expressive are the expression of a psychological state (e.g., thanking, apologizing, congratulating) Explanations are speech acts whose successful execution brings about the consistency between the content of the statement and reality (e.g., resignation, condemning, dismissal, and baptism) Dialogue acts are roughly the equivalent of Searle's speech act (1969). Dialogue acts differ in different dialog systems (dialogue systems closely related to the 1999 work), which treat the term \"dialogues\" as the most important dialogues."}, {"heading": "2.2. Turn vs Utterance", "text": "In the natural human conversation, we refer to the speaker's speaking time and refer to the ability to know when we start and when we finish the turn in the conversion. The turn limit contains one or more sentences, in addition, \"turning\" is generally fixed to the expression of a single sentence. In the spoken dialogue system, the term enunciation refers to the one speech act. (Dream and Heeman, 1997) defines the unit of expression by one or more of the following factors: 1. Speech by a single speaker, speaking without interruption by the speech of the other, as a single turn. 2. Has syntactic and / or semantic completion. 3. Defines a single speech act. 4. Is an intonational phrase. 5. Separated by a pause. Consequently, this paper refers to an enunciation as a small unit of speech corresponding to a single turn (Webb, 2010; Dream and Heeman, 1997)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Dialectal Arabic", "text": "There are three categories of Arabic: Classical Arabic \"The Ancient Written Form,\" Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) \"The Famous Written Form Today\" and Dialectal Arabic \"Arab Mother Languages of Arabic Speakers\" (Diab and Habash, 2007).In addition, the written form of the Arabic language - MSA - is completely different from dialectical Arabic. However, MSA is primarily used in written form, but the regional dialects are predominant in spoken communication or in daily use. Unlike MSA, the dialects have no written grammar rules and have different characteristics, such as morphology, syntax and phonetics. Dialectal Arabic can mainly be divided into six dialect groups: Maghrebi, Egyptian, Levantine, Gulf, Iraq and others. These regional dialects of Arabic are quite different from each other. Egyptian dialect, commonly known as Egyptian slang, is the most widely understood Arabic (Zaidan and Burqan)."}, {"heading": "3.

However, the high cost of licensing corpora is a difficult issue for many young researchers. Therefore, searching for freely available corpora is clearly a desirable goal, unfortunately, the freely available corpora are usually not easy to find, and most of the words provided by language data providers are paid for or reserved exclusively for subscribers. As the best of our knowledge is considered difficult to segment the dialogue in Arabic, these are identified as segmentation due to the specific nature of the Arabic language and the lake of Arabic dialogues (Zaghouani, 2014). However, there are many annotated dialogues that include corpora for non-Arabic languages, which are used by this most-advertised corpora listed in the classification tasks (Webb, 2010) for non-Arabic languages such as: MAPTASK1: 160,000 consisting of 815,000 English words BMO2."}, {"heading": "3.3 Arabic Dialogue Segmentation", "text": "In fact, most people are able to recognize themselves and understand what they are doing.
