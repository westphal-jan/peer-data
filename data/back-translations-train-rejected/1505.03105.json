With the proliferation of reviews, ratings, recommendations and other forms of online expression, online opinion has turned into a kind of virtual currency for businesses looking to market their products, identify new opportunities and manage their reputations, therefore many are now looking to the field of sentiment analysis. In this paper, we present a feature-based sentence level approach for Arabic sentiment analysis. Our approach is using Arabic idioms/saying phrases lexicon as a key importance for improving the detection of the sentiment polarity in Arabic sentences as well as a number of novels and rich set of linguistically motivated features contextual Intensifiers, contextual Shifter and negation handling), syntactic features for conflicting phrases which enhance the sentiment classification accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic expandable wide coverage polarity lexicon of Arabic sentiment words. The lexicon is built with gold-standard sentiment words as a seed which is manually collected and annotated and it expands and detects the sentiment orientation automatically of new sentiment words using synset aggregation technique and free online Arabic lexicons and thesauruses. Our data focus on modern standard Arabic (MSA) and Egyptian dialectal Arabic tweets and microblogs (hotel reservation, product reviews, etc.). The experimental results using our resources and techniques with SVM classifier indicate high performance levels, with accuracies of over 95%.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 May 2015 18:10:53 GMT  (227kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03105v1", "International Journal on Natural Language Computing (IJNLC) Vol. 4, No.2,April 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal on Natural Language Computing (IJNLC) Vol. 4, No.2,April 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hossam s ibrahim", "sherif m abdou", "mervat gheith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.03105"}, "pdf": {"name": "1505.03105.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR MODERN STANDARD ARABIC AND COLLOQUIAL", "authors": ["Hossam S.

RELATED WORK", "text": "Much of the work focuses on adjectives and adverbs, as they are considered the most obvious indicator of sensations [5,8], and some others focus on verbs and nouns. Also, most of the work-use tweets contain indirect information gathered from a large corpus to extract them from the text to build their sensory lexicon [2,5], it uses superordinate machine learning to classify movie reviews or phrases, achieving accuracies between 78.7% and 82.9%. Alexander and Patrick [10] use a corpus of 300,000 text postings from a tweet, collected and automatically divided into three sets of text."}, {"heading": "3. ARABIC LANGUAGE AND CHALLENGES", "text": "Arabic is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. According to the Egyptian Demographic Center1, it is the native language of about 300 million people (22 countries). By 2013, there are approximately 135 million Arabic Internet users. Scripture is aligned from right to left and the Arabic alphabet consists of 28 letters. Arabic alphabet can be expanded to ninety elements by writing additional forms, markers and vowels. Most Arabic words are morphologically derived from a list of roots that are tri, quad or pentoblique. Most of these roots are triliteral. Arabic words are divided into three main parts of the speech, namely nouns, including adjectives and adverbs, verbs and particles. In formal writing, Arabic sentences are often separated by commas and periods. Arabic language has two main forms: standard Arabic and dialectal Arabic."}, {"heading": "4. DATA SET AND ANNOTATION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1. Corpus", "text": "We have built our own corpus containing 2,000 Arabic sentiment statements, including 1,000 MSA tweets, tweets in Arabic dialect and 1,000 microblogs (hotel reservation comments, product reviews, television programs & movie comments).The corpus includes data in both modern standard Arabic and Egyptian dialect Arabic. Since June 2012, we collect data via Twitter API2 and various microblogs and forum websites such as http: / / www.booking.com /, http: / / forums.fatakat.com, http: / ejabat.google.com etc. We collect approximately 10,000 Arabic tweets and 10,000 Arabic comments and reviews. The selected data are carried out under certain conditions: sentiment, hold one opinion, MSA, Egyptian dialect, non-sarcastic, no insult, subjective. The data is manually selected and commented as positive and negative sentiment using three evaluators (native speakers) aged between 35 and 45 years of age, which is determined by the metric agreement in the current valuation criteria."}, {"heading": "4.2. Sentiment Lexicon", "text": "Our approach is essentially based on lexicon, by determining the polarity value of terms by matching lexical known polarity terms in the polarity lexicon. In this work we have built two lexicon; Arabic sentiment words lexicon and Arabic sentiment idioms / phrases lexicon. Most works use adjectives only for sentiment analysis, and some of them use nouns, adverbs or a combination of them. We have chosen to use sentiment adjectives and adjectives of adjectives because we have noticed that some opinions do not contain adjectives but express negative or positive feelings, such as: \"There are no adjectives in this example, although they express the negative mood, the words\" Arabic \"and\" Arabic. \""}, {"heading": "4.3. Idioms phrase Lexicon", "text": "As we work on Arabic and Egyptian slang, and most Internet users who write in these languages express their opinions and feelings in a sarcastic manner (33 old wisdom, old idioms, and idioms that exceed 20% of the total), sarcastic phrases are marginalized because they are difficult to deal with, for example, \"What a great car! It stopped working within two days.\" Sarcasms are not as common in consumer reviews of products and services, but are very common in political discussions that make political opinions difficult to deal with [28]. But there are plenty of idioms that represent ancient wisdom and popular idioms that people used to express their opinions directly as in Table 1.Table1. Examples of old idioms or idioms Example1. \""}, {"heading": "5. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS", "text": "The system consists of two parts: Part 1 includes the pre-processing and extension of the lexicon, Part 2 the extraction and classification of the characteristics. The pre-processing includes the data cleansing (removal of foreign characters, symbols, numbers, etc.), the removal of stop words and the normalization (standardized Arabic letters and the removal of all characters such as [..., \"...,\"..., \"\"..., \"...],...\", \",...\", \"\",... \")."}, {"heading": "5.1. Automatic expansion and orientation detection", "text": "It consists of 5244 commented sentiment words (2003 Positives (PO), 2829 Negatives (NG), 412 Neutrals (NU). In this research, we propose a simple yet effective method to use the synonym extracted from free online dictionaries and lexicographs to predict the sentiment orientations of sentiment words. Generally, we share the same orientation as their synonyms and opposing orientations. [8] We followed Hu and Liu to predict the orientation of sentiment words. We built a method shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "5.1. Features Selection and Extraction", "text": "The selection of optimal feature sets is considered to be the most difficult aspect for any machine learning approach in the NLP area. We used various features to our sentiment analysis system, such as standard features, sentence level features, linguistic features, etc. We have developed an algorithm for selecting and extracting features from text and construct a one-line statement (SVM format) for each topic, which can be a tweet, review or comment consisting of one or more statements."}, {"heading": "5.1.1. Standard Features", "text": "For sentiment classification, we use two main binary characteristics for sentiment words, has _ PO _ senti and has _ NG _ senti, which determine whether the word has a positive or negative sentiment polarity by using our basic lexicon, and two main binary characteristics for idiom phrases, has _ PO _ ph and has _ NG _ ph, which define whether the topic contains any idioms / sayings, and whether it is positive or negative when using our idiom / speech lexicon. Other default characteristics that simply count the number of positive (W _ PO), negative (W _ NG), neutral (W _ NU) sentiment words in the topic."}, {"heading": "5.1.2. Sentence-Level Features", "text": "No long sentence can greatly affect classification accuracy. Pang and Lee [2] noted this problem in their work in classifying products when the reviewer starts with many negative sentences, but at the end of the entire review with a short sentence of \"but I liked it!\" [37] to overcome this problem, we use two features: (A) the frequency of the term can solve that part of the problem by increasing the polarity of the polar word. (B) The position of a symbol within a text unit (e.g. in the middle toward the end of a document) can have potentially important effects on how strongly this symbol influences the general mood. (B) The adjective term that appears at the beginning of the sentence increases the polarity intensity as the one that is in the late position [2]."}, {"heading": "5.1.3. Linguistic Features", "text": "We have studied a wide variety of linguistic and lexical characteristics that can deal precisely with complex linguistic structures in the Arabic language, such as negation, intensification, etc. In this work we have used the following characteristics: \"Contextual shift (negation) Dealing with negation can be an important concern in the analysis of opinion and sentiment.\" \"The two sentences that are considered very similar by the most commonly used similarity measures are the only distinct characteristics of negation that force the second sentence into the opposite polarity.\" Thus, there is a list of negative terminology in the Arabic language (MAS) and Egyptian dialects such as \"B,\" \"O,\" \"\" which can change the sensibility of the terms from positive to negative and vice versa if they have occurred before the word polarity. \"There is a list of negative terminology in the Arabic language (MAS) and Egyptian dialects such as\". \""}, {"heading": "5.1.4. Syntactic features for conflicting phrases", "text": "Syntactic features include phrase patterns that use the POS tag n-gram pattern to detect inflection phrases [13]. Following the authors [38,39], they found that phrase patterns such as \"n + aj\" (noun followed by positive adjective) typically represent positive mood orientation, while \"n + dj\" (noun followed by negative adjective) often express negative feelings. In this work, we used POS tag and bi-gram to extract contradictory phrase patterns consisting of two sentiment words facing each other in polarity; noun followed by adjective or adjective followed by noun, one of which is positive polarity and the other is negative polarity."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND EVALUATION", "text": "In this study, we use a support Vector Machine (SVM) light [40] for classification, as SVMs are known for the ability to handle large feature spaces. We experiment with different cores and parameters settings and find that linear tweets provide the best performance for our work. We perform two sets of experiments, which we divide into 80% for training and 10% for development and 10% for testing. The classifier and features are optimized during development and all the results we report are in the test group. We also report accuracy as well as precision, recall and F measurement for each experiment. F measurement is calculated by the following equation (2000 Topics) consists of four types of data as follows (997 tweets 49%, 300 hotel reservations comments 16%, 357 product reviews 17%, 357 TV programs comments 18%)."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this thesis, we presented a mood analysis system for MSA and Egyptian dialect that uses a corpus of different data types (tweets, product reviews, TV program commentary and hotel reservations).We used a series of novels and rich feature sets to handle valence shifters (negations, amplifiers), question and request terms and improve classification performance.We show that the use of idioms and idioms with a high reach lexicon has the greatest impact on classification accuracy. In addition, the automatic extension of the polarity lexicon has a major impact on the classification of feelings. The results obtained show that our SA system is very promising. In the future, we plan to expand our lexicon for Egyptian dialect polarities and the Egyptian idiom / speech lexicon, as to the best of our knowledge, no resources are available and we will provide this lexicon to the general public."}], "references": [{"title": "Sentence-level Arabic sentiment analysis", "author": ["A.

social networks has fueled interest in sentiment analysis. With the proliferation of reviews, ratings, recommendations and other forms of online expression, online opinion has turned into a kind of virtual currency for businesses looking to market their products, identify new opportunities and manage their reputations, therefore many are now looking to the field of sentiment analysis. In this paper, we present a feature-based sentence level approach for Arabic sentiment analysis. Our approach is using Arabic idioms/saying phrases lexicon as a key importance for improving the detection of the sentiment polarity in Arabic sentences as well as a number of novels and rich set of linguistically motivated features (contextual Intensifiers, contextual Shifter and negation handling), syntactic features for conflicting phrases which enhance the sentiment classification accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic expandable wide coverage polarity lexicon of Arabic sentiment words. The lexicon is built with gold-standard sentiment words as a seed which is manually collected and annotated and it expands and detects the sentiment orientation automatically of new sentiment words using synset aggregation technique and free online Arabic lexicons and thesauruses. Our data focus on modern standard Arabic (MSA) and Egyptian dialectal Arabic tweets and microblogs (hotel reservation, product reviews, etc.). The experimental results using our resources and techniques with SVM classifier indicate high performance levels, with accuracies of over 95%.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
