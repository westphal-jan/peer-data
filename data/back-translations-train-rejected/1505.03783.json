Instead, we introduce here a measure of how word ranks change in time and call this distribution \\emph{rank diversity}. We calculate this diversity for books published in six European languages since 1800, and find that it follows a universal lognormal distribution. Based on the mean and standard deviation associated with the lognormal distribution, we define three different word regimes of languages: \"heads\" consist of words which almost do not change their rank in time, \"bodies\" are words of general use, while \"tails\" are comprised by context-specific words and vary their rank considerably in time. The heads and bodies reflect the size of language cores identified by linguists for basic communication. We propose a Gaussian random walk model which reproduces the rank variation of words in time and thus the diversity. Rank diversity of words can be understood as the result of random variations in rank, where the size of the variation depends on the rank itself. We find that the core size is similar for all languages studied.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 14 May 2015 16:21:02 GMT  (5034kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03783v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["germinal cocho", "jorge flores", "carlos gershenson", "carlos pineda", "sergio s\\'anchez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.03783"}, "pdf": {"name": "1505.03783.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Rank diversity of languages: Generic behavior in computational linguistics", "authors": ["Germinal Cocho", "Jorge Flores", "Carlos Gershenson", "Carlos Pineda", "Sergio S\u00e1nchez"], "emails": ["cgg@unam.mx"], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into a different world, in which they are able to live than in another world, in which they are able to live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live."}, {"heading": "Rank diversity of words", "text": "What follows are six European languages from the Indo-European family. They are English and German; Spanish, French and Italian; and Russian. They belong to different linguistic branches: German, Romance and Slavic, respectively, 0.5. Native speakers of these languages account for about 17% of the world's population. We start by taking into account the 20, say, most commonly used words in the six languages, that is, the lowest ranked words. Let's use, for the sake of uniformity, the first sense or first meaning given by Google Translate, as soon as these words are translated into English, the coincidences in all six languages are remarkable (see Table S1 in File S1). This could have been foreseen as most of the least ranked words are articles, prepositions or conjunctions, i.e., what is called functional words. Another matter, as we will see, would arise if we only used nouns, adjectives that are known as contents."}, {"heading": "A random walk model for rank diversity", "text": "We consider the relative magnitude of frequency changes, or flights, as they are sometimes called in statistical physics, defined as (kt + 1 \u2212 kt) / kt, where kt is the rank at discrete time of a given element. We present in fig. 5 the distribution of these frequency changes for English, our largest data set, and in fig. 17 in file S1 for all languages. Note that on average the relative jumps seem to be largely independent of the value of the rank. We propose, based on this fact, a simple model to understand the evolution of the rank variety of words, and in fig. 17 in file S1 to call a scale invariant random Gaussian deviation for all languages, since a word with rank kt, rank kt + 1 is converted to rank following method: Define an auxiliary variable st + 1 at the time t + 1 after the relation of st = kt + G (0, ktp + G), where G (0) is a width, where G (0) is a random (G) of width, where the width is a centered (0)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Within statistical linguistics, the frequency-rank distribution of multiple languages of European origin can be adequately compared with 34 different explanatory patterns that have been analyzed for many years. However, no simple model can reproduce the detailed characteristics of this distribution (see SI). In particular, it was suggested that there are two different systems for ranking, but these regimes have not been satisfactorily validated in empirical data. Due to these difficulties, we were led to introduce a statistical measurement that we have called ranking diversity to describe the statistical properties of natural languages. A simulated random language was created that reproduces the observed characteristics fairly well. Our random model mimics the evolution of languages to produce a simulated ranking diversity that closely matches historical data. We consider statistical similarities between languages and the simplicity of the model to reproduce them, sufficient evidence to assert that the ranking diversity of words is universal. This does not imply that all languages have the same ranking diversity, but that all languages have the same diversity."}, {"heading": "S1 Models for rank-frequency distributions", "text": "The frequency distributions of words for different languages are very similar to each other, as shown in Fig. 8a.

This normalization ensures that both < dt > = 0 and < d2t > = 1. The time correlation is given by C\u03c4 = < dtdt + \u03c4 >. (S24) In principle, this value also depends on t, but usually this dependence is very weak, as in this case, and can be ignored. In Figure 18 we show the average of CKT, of 50 randomly selected rankings, for different languages, as well as for the simulated language. We note that the correlation is very low, except for localizations = 0, where it is 25.1, for the normalization chosen here = 24.1, and for the 24.1 value of the normalization chosen here = 27.1."}], "references": [{"title": "Selective Studies and the Principle of Relative Frequency in Language", "author": ["GK Zipf"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1932}, {"title": "An informational theory of the statistical structure of language", "author": ["B Mandelbrot"], "venue": "Communication Theory, the Second London Symposium, London: Betterworth,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1953}, {"title": "The Evolution of Human Languages", "author": ["JA Hawkins", "M Gell-Mann"], "venue": "Proceedings of the Workshop on the Evolution of Human Languages, Held August,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 1992}, {"title": "Zipf\u2019s law and random texts", "author": ["R Ferrer i Cancho", "RV Sol\u00e9"], "venue": "Advances in Complex Systems", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Zipf\u2019s law unzipped", "author": ["SK Baek", "S Bernhardsson", "P Minnhagen"], "venue": "New Journal of Physics", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Emergence of Zipf\u2019s law in the evolution of communication", "author": ["B Corominas-Murtra", "J Fortuny", "RV Sol\u00e9"], "venue": "Phys Rev E", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Evolution of the most common English words and phrases over the centuries", "author": ["M Perc"], "venue": "Journal of The Royal Society Interface", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf\u2019s law", "author": ["ME Newman"], "venue": "Contemporary Physics", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Power-law distributions in empirical data", "author": ["A Clauset", "CR Shalizi", "ME Newman"], "venue": "SIAM Review", "citeRegEx": "9", "shortCiteRegEx": "9", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Das gesetz der bev\u00f6lkerungskonzentration", "author": ["F Auerbach"], "venue": "Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen", "citeRegEx": "11", "shortCiteRegEx": "11", "year": 1913}, {"title": "A \u201claw\u201d of occurrences for words of low frequency", "author": ["AD Booth"], "venue": "Information and Control", "citeRegEx": "12", "shortCiteRegEx": "12", "year": 1967}, {"title": "Beyond the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot law in quantitative linguistics", "author": ["MA Montemurro"], "venue": "Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications", "citeRegEx": "13", "shortCiteRegEx": "13", "year": 2001}, {"title": "A (2013) A scaling law beyond Zipf\u2019s law and its relation to Heaps", "author": ["F Font-Clos", "G Boleda", "Corral"], "venue": "law.
