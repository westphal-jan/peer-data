We consider both the $\\alpha$-perturbation resilience notion of Bilu and Linial [BL12], which states that the optimal solution does not change under any $\\alpha$-factor perturbation to the input distances, and the $(\\alpha,\\epsilon)$-approximation stability notion of Balcan et al. [BBG09], which states that any $\\alpha$-approximation to the cost of the optimal solution should be $\\epsilon$-close in the solution space (i.e., the partitioning) to the optimal solution. We show that by merely assuming 3-perturbation resilience or $(2,0)$-approximation stability, the exact solution for the asymmetric $k$-center problem can be found in polynomial time. To our knowledge, this is the first problem that is hard to approximate to any constant factor in the worst case, yet can be optimally solved in polynomial time under perturbation resilience for a constant value of $\\alpha$. In the case of 2-approximation stability, we prove our result is tight by showing $k$-center under $(2-\\epsilon)$-approximation stability is hard unless $NP=RP$. For the case of symmetric $k$-center, we give an efficient algorithm to cluster 2-perturbation resilient instances.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 14 May 2015 23:59:14 GMT  (1092kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03924v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 15 Nov 2015 15:42:23 GMT  (517kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03924v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 7 Mar 2016 22:49:26 GMT  (324kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03924v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["maria-florina balcan", "nika haghtalab", "colin white"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.03924"}, "pdf": {"name": "1505.03924.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Maria-Florina Balcan", "Nika Haghtalab", "Colin White"], "emails": ["ninamf@cs.cmu.edu.", "nhaghtal@cs.cmu.edu.", "crwhite@cs.cmu.edu."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "We consider both the concept of the prophylaxis resistance of Bilu and Linial [11], which states that the optimal solution does not change under any prophylaxis factor disturbances at the input distances, and the concept of (\u03b1,) approximation stability by Balcan et al.

"abstractText": "The k-center problem is a canonical and long-studied facility location and clustering problem with many applications in both its symmetric and asymmetric forms. Both versions of the problem have tight approximation factors on worst case instances: a 2-approximation for symmetric k-center and a log\u2217(k)approximation for the asymmetric version. Therefore to improve on these ratios, one must go beyond the worst case. In this work, we take this approach and provide strong positive results both for the asymmetric and symmetric k-center problems under two very natural input stability (promise) conditions. We consider both the \u03b1-perturbation resilience notion of Bilu and Linial [11], which states that the optimal solution does not change under any \u03b1-factor perturbation to the input distances, and the (\u03b1, )approximation stability notion of Balcan et al. [6], which states that any \u03b1-approximation to the cost of the optimal solution should be -close in the solution space (i.e., the partitioning) to the optimal solution. We show that by merely assuming 3-perturbation resilience or (2, 0)-approximation stability, the exact solution for the asymmetric k-center problem can be found in polynomial time. To our knowledge, this is the first problem that is hard to approximate to any constant factor in the worst case, yet can be optimally solved in polynomial time under perturbation resilience for a constant value of \u03b1. In the case of 2approximation stability, we prove our result is tight by showing k-center under (2 \u2212 )-approximation stability is hard unless NP = RP . For the case of symmetric k-center, we give an efficient algorithm to cluster 2-perturbation resilient instances. Our results illustrate a surprising relation between symmetric and asymmetric k-center instances under these stability conditions. Unlike approximation ratio, for which symmetric k-center is easily solved to a factor of 2 but asymmetric k-center cannot be approximated to any constant factor, both symmetric and asymmetric k-center can be solved optimally under resilience to small constant-factor perturbations. \u2217Authors\u2019 addresses: {ninamf,nhaghtal,crwhite}@cs.cmu.edu. ar X iv :1 50 5. 03 92 4v 1 [ cs .D S] 1 4 M ay 2 01 5", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
