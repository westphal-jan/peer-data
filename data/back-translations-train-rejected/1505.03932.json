Outlier Detection", "text": "All histological data are of good quality, without missing values or outliers. To detect outliers, we used a Z-score model, which required the calculation of the following quantities: \u043a = With this method, we identified some observations that were outside the traditional [-4, + 4] interval and were therefore designated as potential outliers [6], but after careful verification, we decided to consider these values valid even though they were outside the range."}, {"heading": "B. Normality Assumption", "text": "Before proceeding with the modelling phase, we checked whether the variables met the assumption of normality or not, and this was indeed the case for all variables, as shown in Figure 1. To further guarantee the quality of the data, we calculated the crooked and kurtosis (i.e. peak values) measurements for each variable and confirmed that they were within the interval [- 2 / + 2] that was considered acceptable for such statistics. As reflected in their skew levels, the variables had acceptable symmetries; however, with regard to kurtosis, we had two variables that exceeded this range: area and dimension due to their long tails; a minor problem that was solved with the normalization of the data."}, {"heading": "C. Data Normalization", "text": "Due to the large variations in the range of variables, we decided to normalize the data by a minimum-max transformation: \u043a = This transformation brought all variables within the interval [0,1], guaranteeing that none of the variables will have a greater impact due to their larger values [6]."}, {"heading": "D.
