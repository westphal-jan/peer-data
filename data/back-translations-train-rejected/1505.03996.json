INTRODUCTION Within the Multi-Agent System (MAS) area, norms are understood as a means of coordinating and regulating the activity of autonomous agents who interact in a particular social context. [19] However, the existence of autonomous agents capable of violating norms implies the development of standards control mechanisms that implement norms in agent societies. [21] Most of these proposals focus on providing efficient and scalable methods to monitor norms in dynamic agent societies, but they assume that all actions by agents are observable. However, this assumption is too strong because it is not necessarily true that all actions to be monitored can always be monitored. One reason for this is that the monitoring of actions normally incurs high costs."}, {"heading": "II.

NM INFORMATION MODEL", "text": "We assume that actions are deterministic, and that the current state develops from the performance of actions in only 11 years. NM's goal is to analyze a partial sequence of actions performed by agents and observers to detect violations of norms. Enforcement of norms is beyond the scope of this work, and we assume that as soon as the NM detects a violation of norms (vs. compliance), it applies the appropriate sanction (vs. reward). When the NM observes a sub-sequence of actions, it observes a sub-sequence of actions performed by agents, it has partial information about the state of the world. NM represents each sub-state of the world denounced by a partial deviation."}, {"heading": "IV. NM ALGORITHMS", "text": "Algorithm 1 contains the NM pseudo-code. At each step, the NM observes the actions of the agents and uses this information to update the current and previous partial states (lines 4-9). If all actions in the previous state were not observed, the NM performs the reconstruction function to reconstruct unnoticed actions (lines 11-14). Then, the CheckNorm function is executed to determine which standards in the previous state (line 15) according to definition 9 and 10. Note that the NM code can be executed while actions are performed without delay. With regard to the time cost of the algorithm executed by NMs, it is determined by the cost of the reconstruction function, the implementation of which (complete and approximate) is discussed below.

Finally, consistent solutions are used to expand the series of observed actions and knowledge of the initial and final actions (lines 7-14), the time cost of this algorithm being given by the cost of the search function discussed below. Algorithm 3 contains the pseudo code of the recursive search function, which calculates all sequences of consistent actions performed by the agents that were not observed. It starts with verifying that there is at least one target agent (line 2). If so, it identifies all actions that may have been performed by a target agent (lines 3-4), an action may have been performed consistently according to the static properties, the domain knowledge, and the initial and final states executed."}, {"heading": "V.

CONCLUSION", "text": "Our experiments show that both reconstruction processes detect more violations of standards than conventional monitoring approaches. An approximate reconstruction performs slightly worse than a complete reconstruction, while its calculation costs are much cheaper and therefore practicable. The reconstruction algorithms proposed in this paper can be applied to several areas that require monitoring; from normative MAS [31] to intrusion detection systems [16] to control systems [26] and intelligent monitoring systems [17]. As a future work, we plan to investigate area-based approximations that could further accelerate the reconstruction of measures."}], "references": [{"title": "Reasoning about normative update", "author": ["N.
