These cultures are increasingly deteriorating and emptying their meaning, their gentle contents and values in many African peoples. Also, the contents proposed by the media, educational systems and the Internet are turned to the West side; this does not help the African youth to know their culture. However, culture increasingly seems to guide human activities. Some paths seem identified: a permanent (re) education and of course the Internet. On the Web, all the topics constituted in this capacity are covered, the most global source of information. To revive the memory of our citizens and a transparent view of the opportunities (unknown infrastructures, etc.) and challenges (investments unevenly distributed, etc.)."}, {"heading": "2 Related works", "text": "To the best of our knowledge, only socio-cultural ontology [4] [5] covers the socio-cultural sphere developed in the Senegalese context, and the modelling approach is based on the first generation of HAT by Vygotsky. Organized around the concept of \"mediation,\" the model is based on the idea that human actions are mediated by cultural, symbolic or physical artifacts that enable man to act in his environment. We agree that the principle of the authors of ontology should be more oriented towards knowledge shared by communities, rather than relationships between individuals. However, the translation of the view that the community sees as an atomic entity conceals a range of information that we consider relevant in our context. It is the case of the internal dynamics (collaboration, interaction, actors and roles, etc.) of communities and the contextual nature (regulations, tools used, etc.) to organize any activity."}, {"heading": "3 OntoSOC Modeling", "text": "Most existing approaches follow an iterative and incremental cycle. In our case, we used a HAT-based methodology in conjunction with the top-down approach. We1 http: / / xmlns.com / foaf / spec / 2 http: / / lov.okfn.org / dataset / lov / 3 https: / / schema.org / 4 http: / / dbpedia.org / agree with Berger that \"reality is a social construction.\" The universe is evolving. These changes are driven by groups of individuals through their various activities. To analyze and understand these changes and how they transform reality, many models of human activity have been proposed, among which we have the Vygotsky Model [7] and the Engestrom Model [8]."}, {"heading": "3.1 Engestr\u00f6m Human Activity Model", "text": "The Engestr\u00f6m theory of human activity is known as the third generation model, which clearly distinguishes between individual and collective activity, and is based on the historical and cultural view of the activity. According to its author, it helps to have a holistic view of the local dynamics of change, while taking into account culture and historicity. [8] The model has six poles (subject, object, tool, rules, community and division of labor), as shown in Figure 1. \"Subject: represents the individual selected by the viewer to analyze it;\" Object: transformation of the environment through activity (task to be accomplished, objective goal); \"Tools: materials or symbolic tools that mediate the activity;\" Community: subjects (or subgroups) that share the same objects and thereby differ from other communities; \"Division of labor: it considers both the horizontal distribution of actions between subjects, community members as well as the vertical statutes, hierarchies, or rules and regulations;\" they relate to the rules and responsibilities. \""}, {"heading": "3.2 Fundamental concepts and Relationships identification process", "text": "Engestr\u00f6m theory is characterized by individual and collective vision of the concept of activity and each HAT has meaning only in a social matrix (context).

There are many approaches to developing the class hierarchy: from top to bottom, bottom to bottom, up to hybrid approach. The use of HAT, which enabled us to have basic concepts, is the beginning of the hierarchy from the top to the bottom."}, {"heading": "3.4 OntoSOC alignment", "text": "OntoSOC is a cross-domain vocabulary.

Its popularization took place with three use-case data according to the \"collaborative personality\" approach. The cultural community called Naakonda was involved in organizing a cultural event in the locality of Mokolo, the community of CDE-SAARE 9. In software engineering, this approach is called \"targeted design.\" Personas are fictional personalizations that represent realistic individuals. In our case, we used \"collaborative personas.\" The advanced form of individual persona is suitable for collaborative, eptic participation and interaction in groups that are populated within 11 communities."}, {"heading": "4.2 SPARQL queries", "text": "The use of some attributes such as owl: disjointWith, owl: equivalentClass, owl: hasValue, respectively, helped us to return the concepts (if any), concepts that are equivalent, and finally the exact values of real estate (which owns one). We focused on various activities that were organized in a particular place, and the tools used for the cultural event. The following query returns to each given community, to organized activities, resources used, and the roles played by the actors."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and perspectives", "text": "To get there, we simulated the Engestr\u00f6m Human Activity Theory to identify concepts and relationships between them. Ontology developed is considered an improved version of ontology developed by [5], but in the Cameroonian context. To solve the interoperability problem, we have mapped OntoSOC concepts and those that are related to each other. We have equipped our ontology with three use cases and applied some SPARQL tests. Certainly, the three cases are by far representative, but their data helped us to eliminate or explain some contradictions. It should be noted that the elimination of redundant triplets took place empirically. We have no guarantee of achieving the minimum coverage. Nevertheless, the reduction rate is considerable, about 60%. Moreover, the notion of sociocultural knowledge is not easy to master: it may be a specific problem, generally limited to a type of inaccurate, or to a structure of H."}], "references": [{"title": "l'imp\u00e9rialisme culture occidental et devenir de la culture africaine: d\u00e9fis et perspectives", "author": ["B.Z.
