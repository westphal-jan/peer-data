By that we mean that we see intelligence expansion as the determinant of the 'greater good' and 'well being' of both of individuals and collectives at all scales.

A psychologically oriented definition of sensitization is: sensitization is a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which lie between people, places, and events) in order to anticipate and effectively relate to their trajectories [Klein et al., 2006a, p. 3]. In addition to the human sciences, the theory of sensitization to human-computer interaction, decision-making support systems, and artificial intelligence [Klein et al., 2006b, p. 5]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Individual-environment milieu", "text": "We claim that the most important factor contributing to the understanding of a sociotechnological system is the interactions between the intelligent actors (see Section 3.2). In our framework, an individual actor is a kind of sensory machine that has a sense for all sensory information generated by its sensors. Structuring the environment in its classical understanding (i.e. incorporating all available data and building an approximate model) is only one option. Other options for creating a sense of the environment may be."}, {"heading": "2.3 Worldviews", "text": "Any worldview is essentially subjective (in the sense that one cannot know what it is like to have a particular worldview without actually adopting it) or intersubjective, depending on the choices of the actors and communities that share it. If we apply the concept to the sociotechnological system, a world view is a more or less integrated system of cognitive and behavioral patterns that governs the interactions of the actor. In other words, a world view is an integral system of sense-making that characterizes an intelligent actor. In our discussion of future scenarios for the sociotechnological system, the intelligence expansion of an actor at each level is equivalent to the development of the world view that characterizes that actor. Hui and Halpin refer in their article \"Collective Individuation: The Future of the Social Network\" to the concept of a world view by using the German word Weltbild [Yuk Hui and Harry]."}, {"heading": "3 A framework for scalable cognition", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 The generic cognitive agent", "text": "In fact, most of them are unable to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "3.2 Scalable cognition", "text": "The way the company operates is inspired by Bernard Baar's global labor theory [Baars, 1993, Baars, 2005] and by the application of the theory in his work on the ontology of cognition [Franklin, 2006, Franklin, 2008]. However, our definition aims to highlight various aspects of the cognitive process in order to prepare the ground for a scalable framework for cognition, and in this context it also refers to the concept of adaptive activity [Holland, 1996]."}, {"heading": "3.3 Coalitions", "text": "This year, there has been a major U-turn, with a reactionary U-turn."}, {"heading": "3.4 Coalitions as super agents", "text": "A recurring coalition is indeed a cognitive agent as well. No precise mechanisms of internal connection and coordination are defined at this level. As long as the behavior of the coalition can be effectively described in terms of selection of relevance and selection for effective action, this behavior corresponds to the definition of a cognitive process. Moreover, its internal contexts are coupled and finally form a common context that belongs to the super agents."}, {"heading": "3.5 Coalitions as a source of novelty", "text": "A cognitive actor can always be described from two complementary points of view: the first point of view focuses on the structure and function of the cognitive actor in relation to input / output relations; from this point of view, the actor is an independent dynamic system with more or less specific behavioural tendencies; each input event, combined with the current state of the actor, results in him following a path towards another state; aspects of the course and the new state also determine possible output events; the second point of view focuses on the connections and coalitions in which a cognitive actor participates; and from this point of view, the actor is described in terms of his capacity to influence and be influenced by actors in a heterogeneous population."}, {"heading": "4 Extended framework of cognitive development", "text": "After putting together the conceptual ground, we can now proceed to describe the future of the web in terms of cognitive development \u2192 We associate our concept of a generic cognitive agent with that of Burns and Engdahl [Burns and Engdahl, 1998a]. They consider what they call \"agential capabilities\" which, in addition to what is implied by our framework, also emphasizes the social construction of identity (as embodied by its inner state) of each agent, which is the representation of the self always partially constructed from its social image. Any such socially constructed agent e.g. technological artifacts, social institutions and networks, bacteria, anthill, human beings, etc. is therefore considered a cognitive agent. Cognitive agents are differentiated by the level of their cognitive development."}, {"heading": "4.1 Society of Mind versus Mind of Society", "text": "Explaining the concept of the \"society of the mind,\" Minsky notes that \"words such as life and thought are useful to describe phenomena arising from certain combinations of relationships.\" [Minsky, 1988] Discussing collective consciousness (i.e., \"the spirit of society\") Burns asserts that \"collectives such as families, communities, administrative organizations, or states are social actors and can be considered as agents of ability.\" [Burns and Engdahl, 1998a] It is obvious that these are different perspectives on the same phenomenon. When we look at an actor, we perceive a boundary between individual and collective, between actor and environment, where the actor himself is already a collective. When we analyze a cognitive actor as an individual and see a collective phenomenon that makes him what he is, we perceive the perspective of the \"society of the mind\" in relation to the boundary between individuals and collectives."}, {"heading": "4.2 The formation of boundaries", "text": "It is important to remember that the boundary itself arises in the course of cognitive development. Central to our approach is that the process of individuation precedes the individual, as Kegan notes: \"Evolutionary activity involves the mere creation of the object (a process of differentiation) and our relationship with it (a process of integration).\" [Kegan, 1982, p. 77] The \"collectivity\" of intelligence and individuation can be observed on two levels: 1. The individuation of each actor is driven by the environment, which is a collective of actors; the process of forming boundaries between oneself and others does not depend exclusively on individual parts. Rather, it is formed in the process of coevolution and reflective progressive determination when individual affects and its environment are influenced. 2. The actions of a [pre] individualized actor are driven by competition and interaction between internalized objects (\"society of the mind\")."}, {"heading": "4.3 Object relations theory", "text": "The extended cognitive development process can be described as an ongoing equilibrium of the subject-object relationship [Kegan, 1982, Pruyn, 2010] across the boundaries of an agent. [Kegan, 1982, Pruyn, 2010] The subject-object relationship is the key mechanism that describes how agents use their sensory input. It is a recursive cycle of the following subprocesses ([Kegan, 1982, Pruyn, 2010, Kegan, 1995]): \u2022 Being the subject of sensory experience, e.g. when a small child is sad, does not refer to sadness as \"a transient mental state,\" but IS sadness. \u2022 Separation of sensory input / experience from an object, i.e. creating a boundary with the environment. Note that theory does not claim that the subject distinguishes a priori between \"inner\" and \"external\" experiences; this differentiation is achieved during the cognitive development process with the aim of forming a sense for the totality of experiences."}, {"heading": "4.4 The \u201dcollectivity\u201d of intelligence", "text": "The mechanism of cognitive development refers to both what we call individual and collective intelligence, which we understand as different scales of the same phenomena; the collective character of the process can be seen both from the perspective of the \"mind of society\" and the \"society of mind\" (see Figure 1 on page 15) as well as from the collective individuation [Yuk Hui and Harry Halpin, 2013]. Recursive levels of perceived boundaries between individual agencies and their collectives result in overlapping hierarchies of actors emerging from the interaction of simple agents; this general structure is conceptualized by our framework for scalable cognition (see Section 3.2). We position scales of cognition not only by their physical manifestations, e.g. neurons \u2192 brains or mental manifestations, e.g. thoughts \u2192 memes \u2192 cultures, but also because cognitive abilities of actors at each boundary are developed to evolve through interactions between scales."}, {"heading": "5 The cognitive development of the Web", "text": "We argue that the evolution of our web can be conceived as a process of cognitive development. Furthermore, we propose that what we call distributed governance in a world of views [Veitas and Weinbaum, 2013] is the next phase of the cognitive development of human society, whose current phase of cognitive development can roughly be compared to that of an infant, which means that an intelligence that deals with reflexes, impulses and perceptions but has no needs and desires derived from them as Yet.It is quite clear that the cognitive development of mankind through the World Wide Web does not follow the stages of cognitive development derived from various collective patterns of sensation formation arising from human biological evolution and cultural history."}, {"heading": "5.1 Distributed governance", "text": "Informed by the above discussion, we argue that there is no single structure or model of the future sociotechnological system that can cope with the increasing complexity and unpredictability of the world [Taleb, 2012]. Therefore, we see greater importance in the development of a global sociotechnological system towards a hypothesis that is not dissimilar to the human cognitive system, but with much more porous limits. Hypotheses that test the engine in the social sphere imply the ability to respond effectively to the needs of the global system for the new structures, institutions and initiatives to address the challenges ahead (e.g. climate change). Due to limited resources, massive hypotheses require an effective mechanism of integration and disintegration of social structures and institutions in a manner analogous to open source projects. Implementation of these principles requires a change in the fundamental concepts of governance dynamics, namely its rigid hierarchical nature."}], "references": [{"title": "Connectionism and the mind: Parallel processing, dynamics, and evolution in networks.
