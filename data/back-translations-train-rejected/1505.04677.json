This property is introduced in the following definition. Let's be a set of FAIs. We say that the FAIs in a group of FAIs in a group have saturated consequences if there are saturated consequences for each A-group B. Obviously, it depends on whether a given A-group has a saturated sequence. Applicable Proposition 1 follows that FAIs in a group have saturated sequences. iff for each A-group B have saturated consequences.
