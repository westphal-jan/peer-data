To support such a spatial argument based on these relationships, certain important characteristics and a transferability table were presented. In another study, how vague spatial information can be modeled when vague regions are presented as blurred propositions was demonstrated. At the end of this study, standard RCC models by Shockaert et al. (2008) were introduced [17].

In other words, for u and v in U, C (u, v) is a degree between [0,1] that u and v are connected to each other. Compared to RCC, C is a blurred reflective and symmetrical relationship. To generalize, a blurred connection is established, a norm that is a figure [0,1] 2- [0,1] have symmetrical, associative and increasing properties. Limit condition T (a, 1) = a for all a in [0,1] is also specified, which can be shown that such a figure behaves directly as a link operator. In the following, \u0141ukasiewicz tnorm is used: TW (a, b) = max (0, a + b \u2212 1) = a for all compounds (1) Other popular t-norms are the minimum TM and the product Tmin, which is defined by TW (a), (b) and Tb (b)."}, {"heading": "C.

Implementation of disease methods and lead datasets The fuzzy RCC lead distribution and urban areas functions implemented in the previous section have been executed and evaluated, as in 0the overlap of the Isfahan cities with the lead. By comparing this rate and the amount of diseases for each city, we can conclude that the results are closely related to this association, but not directly related to the number of diseases achieved in the city."}, {"heading": "C.

Support radius is the fuzzy limited area for each region and is filled with a random number between zero and three.The horizontal axis represents areas and the vertical axis is connectivity and distance.Figure 5 shows the results of applying five steps of fuzzy connectivity to the urban areas of Isfahan dataset. In this implementation, different minimums for the connectivity of these regions that have met the minimas.In the first phase, the blue region with gid = 124 meets the minimum connectivity requirement. In the next phase, the yellow and blue regions will meet the minimum connectivity."}, {"heading": "E. Evaluation and interpretation of results", "text": "By observing and comparing the results of the fuzzy connectivity and distance function and by taking into account the fuzzy ranges of the regions, the accuracy of the proposed function is clear. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm also has a reasonable runtime. In its implementation, taking into account the smaller number of divisions, we have proposed a method for implementation in PostGIS to solve real spatial analysis tasks. Fuzzy-RCC allows us to calculate blurred spatial relations between blurred features. It has been shown that Fuzzy-RCC has great potential for many goals. Afterwards, we evaluated this method and used it in comparison with distance functions on a dataset."}], "references": [{"title": "A spatial logic based on regions and connection", "author": ["D.A.
