So, although researchers know that these concerns are not necessary at present, there is no generalized explanation as to why these concerns would not be necessary and which consideration should be put in this presentation of the concerns that people have."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Although researchers in the field of machine learning or artificial intelligence know that we are nowhere near the technology that could enable us to build a machine with real intelligence, almost all discussions about the various attributes of intelligence remain at a philosophical level, such as the ability to learn, the ability to think logically, self-confidence, or even emotions. Formal mathematical definitions of these attributes are very undefined, and we do not even have binary criteria to verify whether a system really has any of these attributes, let alone formal methods that can be used to analyze the level of each of these attributes. By generalizing our intuitive understanding of learning ability, this essay provides a concise necessary prerequisite to be a learning model. And this essay also presents other research guidelines that would allow us to analyze whether a model will be a learning model or a non-learning model during the development process. The discussion begins with intuitive introductions, the discussion of standpoint based on the following understanding of the conceptual process."}, {"heading": "1.1 Intuitive introduction: Information", "text": "We are constantly surrounded by different information and we process it. And certainty plays a decisive role in the representation of information, because an information must be carried by at least one particular representation. \u2022 \"I am 188cm\": In this example, a certain number together with a unit (cm) represents information about height, the pronoun of the first person represents an identity related to height information. \u2022 \"Left? Right!\": In this example, the uncertainty of the context implies ambiguity. Even if we measure the uncertainty of a system (entropy), we get a certain number or a range with a certain limit; or if we cannot get a certain limit, we still have the certain representation of the system we are measuring; or even if we do not know which system we are measuring, we still have a certain definition of entropy; and if we have no certainty about anything, then there is no information at all. In other words, the amount of certainties, which also corresponds to the amount of information."}, {"heading": "1.2 Intuitive introduction: Learning", "text": "We as human beings cannot perceive an enormous amount of physical realities in a natural way, such as the existence of almost all submicroscopic particles, the existence of a majority region of electromagnetic waves, the motion of the Earth, the fact that the Earth is a sphere, in fact, this list could continue to grow and encompasses almost all the knowledge we have learned since the birth of modern science, and we are all very familiar with the process of learning new knowledge based on known knowledge, and on new learned knowledge to learn even newer knowledge. First, this essay will give a general definition of the relative relationship between known knowledge and the new knowledge learned. Introduction of this definition begins with an example: a man has been convicted of murder, judge or jury has no information about the reality of innocent or guilty people. A reasonable sentence must be the consequence of applying appropriate methods on all the evidence, the proof of which is local information, and the reality of innocent or guilty people is global information."}, {"heading": "2 Information", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Information Generator and Representation", "text": "Suppose there is a mapping relationship between a set of X and a set of Y, so that any subset of X can be considered generated by a generator, and the corresponding elements of the subset of Y are representations of that generator. Connecting two subsets of X or two corresponding subsets of Y need not be zero."}, {"heading": "2.2 Domain and Range of a Mapping Relation", "text": "If an assignment relationship F is defined between domain D and area O., then in relation to F each subset of its domain could correspond to an unknown generator, and the corresponding elements in this area are the representation of this unknown generator. 3Then, in relation to F (could be a function), we can define local information and global information as follows: \u2022 Local information: Every input x-D is a local information in relation to F. \u2022 Global information: Every element of the subset Y-O and the corresponding subset X = {x | y-Y, y = F (x)}} is global information.So the global information y-Y, Yn-O is an unknown generator Gn. It is obvious that an unknown information generator Gn could have a lot of global representations: all elements of Yn, and due to the attribute One of the information, we can say that all elements of Yn should follow some constraint. And if the corresponding elements of the domain Xn subset do not follow the large form of Yn, then all elements of Yn are (the array of 25,000)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Information (generator) Type", "text": "It is obvious that different mapping relations pair different subsets between domain and area. Therefore, we can say that a mapping relation together with its domain defines the type of unknown generator Gn, or in other words, the type of information."}, {"heading": "2.4 Common constraint:Linear separable hypersurface", "text": "As introduced in Section 2.2, global information must follow a certain constraint c, so that the certainty of the information can be guaranteed. There are a large number of possible constraints, and we refer to the set of all possible constraints as C. Now, we would like to know which constraint is preferable? and why? The following discussion gives the answer to these two questions. Assumption One: Within certain types of information, there is a mapping relationship that can define the differences between information generators. Based on assumption one and feature one of the information, we know that a mapping relationship called FC maps different subsets that are generated by unknown generators to global information that are distinguishable by applying cR constraints. By choosing the simplest constraint cR, each y-O property represents a confusable information generator, so that the expression of FC: D \u2192 O (D-RN, O-RN) (1) 5."}, {"heading": "3 Learning", "text": "In fact, the majority of them are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move,"}, {"heading": "3.1 Necessary condition of Learning", "text": "Therefore, combining the discussion of information and its representation with the above discussion is the intuitive understanding of the ability to learn: learning means the ability to define new information generators. From this point of view, B and D are learning models, A and C are not learning. And, generalizing the description above, we have a formal necessary condition for mapping the relationship Fmodel as a result: Condition S: Land Use Plan XS, YS = Fmodel (XS), YN = Fmodel (XN), (YN 4 YN = YN) & (YN 4 YS = YS 6 = YS) for each subset XS of domain D, the corrsponding subset of domain YS, there is a set XN which is a subset of complementary systems XS, so we have a subset of XS-Fmodel."}, {"heading": "3.2 AI Effect", "text": "One method of measuring the validity of our hypothesis is as follows: Suppose the validity of the validity of the validity of our hypothesis is U: D \u2192 O, and our guess is whether H. For simple problems like the regression problem, our hypothesis works well, but it only learns simple mapping relationships. But when complex optimization problems occur to obtain a desired mapping relationship, strategies A and B are usually applied together, and if researchers do not examine the property of the information used carefully, it is possible that information can be imported from outside that structure. Usually, the choice of introducing information outside the structure helps to reduce the difficulties in constructing a desired model."}, {"heading": "4 Problems and Feature Works", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "John Connor asked T-800, \"Can you learn things you weren't programmed with? So you could be... you know, more human? And not be such a rogue all the time?\" Even if this is just a movie scenario, we all want to know the answer to this question. And for researchers, the most interesting part is how to answer this question. In this essay, machine learning theories focus on solving various optimization problems so that we can model hypotheses of our observation. While the discussion of learning should focus on the behavior of the model, starting from a point that examines the relationships between observable appearance (local information), reality (global information), its representation, and the generalization of our intuitive understanding of learning, we have a necessary condition S that can be used to get the answer to John's question."}], "references": [{"title": "Subjectivity and lifeworld in transcendental phenomenology", "author": ["Sebastian Luft"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2011}, {"title": "The nature of statistical learning theory", "author": ["Vladimir Vapnik"], "venue": "springer,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2000}], "referenceMentions": [{"referenceID": 1, "context": "(C) : When applying probabilistic model, our hypothesis is based on the belief that there are unknown statistical laws which represent different concepts [2] .", "startOffset": 154, "endOffset": 157}], "year": 2015, "abstractText": "Nowadays, represented by Deep Learning techniques, the field of machine learning is experiencing unprecedented prosperity and its influence is demonstrated in academia, industry and civil society. \u201cIntelligent\u201d has become a label which could not be neglected for most applications; celebrities and scientists also warned that the development of full artificial intelligence may spell the end of the human race.
