To do this, we will add a time tag to the sensor information and base our treatment of time on the second option discussed in the last section, i.e. we will assume that a specific time sensor that provides a reading of the actual time of the form, now (t) that t is an integer.Let (t) p. \u2212 jm are the sensors that provide relevant information for Cj in addition to this. Then, Cj will add bridge rules of formadd (P, T, jr) \u2190 P @ jr, now (T) @ twhere the operation means adding new, time-tagged information to the context. We assume that the reading of a single sensor is consistent at a given time.

Suppose there are m potential emergencies E1,..., Em we want to handle the context. The role of Cd is to be verified based on the absence made, whether one or more of the emergencies egg is suspected or confirmed. Based on information about potential emergencies Cd can signal that emergency egg is suspected (Ei) or confirmed (Ei). \u2022 Cd has information about standard or actual window sizes for different observations (def.win, x), win (p, x), and \u2022 about the number of observations are relevant for specific emergencies."}, {"heading": "6 Control of computation", "text": "In this section, we will show how it is possible - at least to a certain extent - to control the effort involved in calculating certain contexts. We will introduce a specific control context C0 that decides whether a context it controls should be idle for a certain time. idle context merely buffers sensor data it receives, but does not use the data for other calculations. Let's do this using the discussion on Sect. 5. Suppose there are different contexts for detecting potential emergency. the rMCS that we will discuss is based on an architecture in which each detector context Ci, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k is connected to the control context by bridge rules. C0 receives information about suspected emergencies and decides whether it is safe to let a context be idle, for some time.We will now address the question of what it means for a detector context to be idle.
