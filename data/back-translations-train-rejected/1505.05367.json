In contrast to recent proposals, contexts in an aMCS communicate with each other in an asynchronous way which fits the needs of many application domains and is beneficial for scalability. The federal semantics of aMCSs renders our framework an integration approach rather than a knowledge representation formalism itself.

It enables complex updates and revisions of knowledge bases, and is implemented through a management function that provides updates for each balance. Consequently, although we build on mMCSs, they differ significantly in some aspects from the formalism we introduce in this paper for reasons inherent in the asynchronous approach (see Section 5). Consequently, we use only basic terms from the original work and refer the interested reader to the paper by Brewka et al. [3] for full details on mMCSs. Like mMCSs, aMCSs build on an abstract notion of a logic suite that can be seen as an abstraction of various formalities for knowledge representation. A logic suite is a triple LS = < KB, KB, KB, KB, ACC, where is a set of knowledge bases > C."}, {"heading": "3 Asynchronous Multi-Context Systems", "text": "In fact, it is so that it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about and in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and which it is about a way and a way and a way it is about which it is about a way in which it is about which it is about a way in which it is about which it is about a way in which it is about a"}, {"heading": "4 Scenario: Computer-Aided Emergency Team Management", "text": "In fact, most people who stand up for people's rights have the same rights as the majority of people who stand up for people's rights on the other side of the political spectrum.

It uses TCP / IP ports for incoming input streams and also reports the resulting response sets on such a port.
