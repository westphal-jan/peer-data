METHODOLOGY", "text": "The localization process consists of two distinct phases: data acquisition and analysis. Prior to collecting our data set, some pre-processing was required to determine which WiFi Base Station IDs are to be stored. In an initial scan of the various signals received throughout the building, we discovered a few portable hotspots that are likely to come from people in the building connecting their devices to the coupling. As these signals would not remain constant, they were not recorded as attributes for the algorithms to train on. Only the WiFi signals that were part of the building infrastructure were stored."}, {"heading": "A. Android Application", "text": "We chose to use the Android platform for our research because of the wide variety of devices and sensors available on the market, the ease of use, and the widespread use of the platform. We developed an application that allows a data collector to select which building he is in so that multiple records can be collected in buildings on our campus. Each building has the WiFi access points programmed into the application, and all access points not included in the list of the selected building are ignored, allowing us to filter out access points that only appear at certain times, such as personal hotspots. The data collector can also select a room or building size, and a grid of the right size is drawn so that the data collector can more easily indicate its position in the room. Figure 1 shows the application in data collection mode."}, {"heading": "B. Data Collection", "text": "The data is associated with a custom location and written to a text file on the device that can later be pulled from the device for analysis. A single data point in our case consists of 172 attributes that correspond to the values of each individual sensor on the device. We have taken into account a value from the light sensor, GPS / network location data, signal strength from 21 access points, and x, and z values for the device accelerometer, rotation sensor, and orientation sensor. The number of WiFi signals used for the localization system varies. While we have recorded GPS / network location data at each point, the accuracy in our system is extremely low."}, {"heading": "C. Analysis", "text": "After data acquisition, we move on to a phase of pre-processing and offline analysis, in which various machine learning algorithms are trained and their errors measured. A certain pre-processing of the data may be necessary or helpful depending on the algorithm. In our case, we removed the x attribute when training algorithms to classify the y position and removed the y attribute when training for the x classification, because these will not be known in an online live environment. Implementation of the algorithms used was carried out by the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA), developed at Waikato University [13]. WEKA allows an easy selection of different algorithms and parameter options that allowed us to test different parameters for each algorithm. The final phase is an online analysis in which the algorithms are tested under real conditions, including with the user on the move, receiving new, unclassified data in order to process it live."}, {"heading": "OFFLINE ANALYSIS", "text": "The prediction was issued along with a timestamp and written to a text file on the device. A timestamp was also recorded when the researcher reached each vertex of the path and changed direction. Vertex timestamps were used to calculate the actual position of the researcher at each point in the prediction by interpolating the position between the vertex timestamps, which was then compared with the prediction of the algorithm to determine the error of the algorithm."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "In fact, we are able to go in search of a solution that is capable of finding a solution that meets the needs of the people."}, {"heading": "COMPARED WITH THE FULL DATASET IS INDICATED BY GREEN WITH WORSE PERFORMANCE IN RED.", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "PERFORMANCE COMPARED WITH THE FULL DATASET IS INDICATED BY GREEN WITH WORSE PERFORMANCE IN RED.", "text": "The RBF regression model increased by almost a fifth of a meter to 1,561 meters and 1,511 meters for both X and Y predictions, respectively, increasing the absolute error to 2,173 meters, about 0.3 meters higher than the entire dataset. These results suggest that this density of readings may not be high enough for applications that require a very high level of accuracy. However, if only a general position is required, a small dataset can enable faster and easier deployment and be more useful for a broad application. A further decrease in accuracy is expected when a lower-density dataset is used."}, {"heading": "B. Online", "text": "During the online phase, we stored the models for the two best performing algorithms to test them and examined the K * and RBF regression algorithms. In total, we collected 27 sets of test results for K * and 20 for the RBF model. The majority of these results were collected several months after our initial data collection, indicating some stability of the original data and algorithms. In a live environment, the difference between these two algorithms is very important."}, {"heading": "ORIENTATIONS", "text": "Since the data was collected with the device facing south, we went some routes that kept the device constantly facing south. We also went routes that enabled the device to change its orientation as we walked, imitating a user from the real world. These tests were carried out at any pace. The results table can be seen in Table IV. A single walkable route with K * at a slow pace with the device holding a changing orientation is shown in Figure 5. The starting point is the x-coordinate 4.5, y-coordinate 1.5 in the lower left corner of the chart and the endpoint x-coordinate 32.5, y-coordinate 28.5 in the middle in red. The black line indicates that the path went with square points as vertices. The circle points in the diagram show predicted positions. The color is used to indicate the time that was gently interpolated from blue to red."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we have studied a large number of machine learning algorithms for indoor localization based on the sensors available in smartphones. We have found algorithms that achieve an average accuracy of up to 0.76 meters in a real-world environment without the need for dedicated hardware or infrastructure changes, exceeding algorithms taken into account in previous studies [11]. Our online experiments in motion show that our proposed hybrid approach achieves an accuracy equivalent to the best instance-based methods with the speed of non-instance-based methods. In the future, we will investigate the use of multiple devices to collect and evaluate models. As different devices can receive different signal strengths from each access point in different locations and receive a different number of signals depending on whether the device has a single- or dual-band radio card, a model constructed from a dataset from one device cannot accurately predict the position of another device."}], "references": [{"title": "Bluetooth and wap push based location-aware mobile advertising system", "author": ["L.
