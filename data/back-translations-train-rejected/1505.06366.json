While \"narrow\" artificial intelligence which focuses on solving specific problems such as speech recognition, text comprehension, visual pattern recognition, robotic motion, etc. has shown quite a few impressive breakthroughs lately, understanding general intelligence remains elusive. In the paper we offer a novel theoretical approach to understanding general intelligence. We start with a brief introduction of the current conceptual approach. Our critique exposes a number of serious limitations that are traced back to the ontological roots of the concept of intelligence. We then propose a paradigm shift from intelligence perceived as a competence of individual agents defined in relation to an a priori given problem domain or a goal, to intelligence perceived as a formative process of self-organization by which intelligent agents are individuated. We call this process open-ended intelligence. Open-ended intelligence is developed as an abstraction of the process of cognitive development so its application can be extended to general agents and systems. We introduce and discuss three facets of the idea: the philosophical concept of individuation, sense-making and the individuation of general cognitive agents. We further show how open-ended intelligence can be framed in terms of a distributed, self-organizing network of interacting elements and how such process is scalable. The framework highlights an important relation between coordination and intelligence and a new understanding of values.

However, many different contextual definitions exist in different disciplines such as psychology, philosophy of mind, engineering, computer science, cognitive science, etc. It is far from easy, if at all possible, to find a common definition that overcomes epistemological barriers between disciplines. Legg and Hutter (2007) have compiled the most comprehensive collection of definitions of intelligence to date. A shorter overview of various representative examples of such definitions can be found in (Legg, 2008). Based on this broad review and their attempt to find a formal theoretical approach to general intelligence, Hutter and Legg have distilled the following definition: Intelligence measures the ability of an agent to achieve goals in a wide range of environments. (ibid., p. 6) This definition attempts to capture the broadest possible concepts of general intelligence, \"so all of the possible objectives of a pragmatic version of a work environment are somewhat lost in the context of 2012."}, {"heading": "2.2 Criticism of the definition", "text": "In fact, it is so that most of them are able to assert themselves, that they are able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves.

In other words, we are trying to minimize the number of assumptions that limit the concept. Thus, we arrive at the concept of open intelligence. As we will show in a moment, it is an unconventional concept that can never be clearly spoken of, but that is not doomed to be silenced. The fluid and generative nature of open intelligence precedes and complements the established concept of intelligence that we criticize. Without such a complementary approach, a truly universal artificial intelligence inevitably seems to remain beyond the reach of understanding."}, {"heading": "3.1 The ontological \u201cchicken and egg\u201d problem", "text": "That is the question, whether it is a political strategy that follows the principles of democracy, or a strategy that follows the principles of democracy, a strategy that follows the principles of democracy, a strategy that follows the principles of democracy, a strategy that follows the principles of democracy, and a strategy that follows the fundamental principles of democracy, and a strategy that follows the fundamental principles of democracy."}, {"heading": "3.2 Individuals and individuation", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that individuals are not only persons, but also persons who are able to possess a certain quality while at the same time not possessing it.

As it was, it also means that artificial abilities are destroyed. Certain interactions can amplify the internal unexplained intensities within an individual, up to the effects of his disintegration.
