Information and communication technology and far reaching mobile penetration has opened this new research trend Number of key players in Search industry including Microsoft and Google are attracted by the expected increase in volume of use of such applications. The wide range of applications and their public acceptance has motivated researchers to work in this research domain. Several applications such as SMS based information access using database management services, SMS based information retrieval through internet (search engine), SMS based information extraction, question answering, image retrieval etc. have been emerged. With the aim to understand the functionality involved in these systems, an extensive review of a few of these SMSbISs has been planned and executed by us. These systems are classified into four categories based on the objectives and domains of the applications. As a result of this study a well structured functional model is presented here. The model is evaluated in different dimensions, which is presented in this paper. In addition to this a chronological progress with respect to research and development in this upcoming field is compiled in this paper. Such an extensive review presented in this paper would definitely help the researchers and developers to understand the technical aspects of this field. The functional framework presented here would be useful to the system designers to design and develop an SMS based Information System of any specific domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 May 2015 10:08:19 GMT  (584kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06537v1", "17 pages 3 Figures 5 Tables"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages 3 Figures 5 Tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["manish r joshi", "varsha m pathak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.06537"}, "pdf": {"name": "1505.06537.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A survey of SMS based Information Systems", "authors": ["Manish R.

Functional model", "text": "In order to investigate the functionality of these systems, various functional components of the selected SMS-based information systems were examined in detail. A functional model is framed from this study. Five functional levels are associated with the general functionality involved in these systems, namely: Query Construction Interface, Query Processing, Core Service Logic, Security & Privacy and Response Generation. These functional levels are referred to here as \"Functional Categories.\" These functional categories meet the corresponding functional level with the sub-functions. These sub-functions are referred to as \"Functional Features\" in this functional model. This functional model is presented in the figure. It is further explored by evaluating each system for these functional features. In this evaluation, the practical implementation of corresponding subfunction systems is understood. These functional options are recognised as \"Function Points.\""}, {"heading": "A. SMS edit", "text": "It is noted that most of the mobile software provides a usable text editor; the most important requirement of the query interface is the small space of the screens of the mobile phones / PDA units; this formally limits the number of characters to be used (close to 160 characters).A suitable query interface with this limitation is the important feature of the systems. Pratima Mitra et al of System S13 has discussed this fact well. Referring to Abdul-Kareem [12], System S9 raises various concerns about the query interface. System S9 supports special query formation interface. System S5 uses query templates from measuring devices to enter. Some predefined services, such as the railway information system, can be supported with menus to construct the query. Users must select by the amount of terms in the menu to compose the query. Modern mobile phones support browsers [34] this information is preferred by web browsers."}, {"heading": "C. Language Support", "text": "A better applicability of SMS-based information systems (SMSbIS) can be achieved by overcoming language barriers. \"Language support\" is therefore an unavoidable feature. Users can achieve flexibility in query construction when natural language support is available. NLQ processing has become an emerging field of research. NLP approaches are underway in this regard [15, 16]. In System S8, for example, ontology-based natural query language is being trialled. NLQ-based systems such as (S8, S12) have focused on format-free NLQs that use a single language (English). Apart from the semantic solutions, SMS formation has added the problem of new abbreviations (for: 4, letter: l8r, etc.). With advances in IR, multilingual support has become an important challenge. A number of translators must be used to convert information into another language."}, {"heading": "D. Query Formats", "text": "A text-based query in SMS form must contain attributes of the information to be retrieved. There are two important methods that are extracted from the systems under review. Fixed form, scheduled query - systems such as S1, S13 apply SMS query in predefined, predetermined form. Many of the telemarketing SMS provide a format that asks people to type the query. This predefined form of query is sent as an SMS to the number of a particular service provider. SMS queries originating from the service use this type of format. Such queries are planned and simple, but have limited functionality. Free form, unplanned query - users come in free form. Users can conveniently write queries when there are no limitations on predefined defined formats. A free natural language query is therefore one of the most demand parameters and a focused goal of most research in this area (S8, S9)."}, {"heading": "B. Query Refinement", "text": "Parsing involves separating terms and checking their relevance with the expected query form. Normalization involves removing noise or distortion from the received query (S2, S7). New NLP approaches are underway to resolve noise in SMS NLQ. Alexander Ran [4] proposed a method for parsing using semantic tagging. Parsing the query \"What are the names of my contacts at IBM in Ulm?\" yields < tokens, classes. Attribute > pairs as < Ulm, Location >, < IBM, Organisation.name >, etc. It forms a subgraph to show the abstract meaning of the query. Two models as \"HMM-based distance model\" and \"rule-based query correction model\" are removed by Byun, Juan Lee i-Xiao i-15 systems for troubleshooting."}, {"heading": "C. Relevance Check", "text": "The feature of query refinement is supplemented by a relevance check. It supports alternating query formation. Mainly, the free form of unplanned NLQs requires relevance check by means of internal or external ranking. Major queries can be built by applying ranking. Queries with internal computing mechanism are assigned ranking / credit points. In case of a distorted query by the user, the alternative query is constructed by applying the previous two questions, e.g. query refinement and alternative query construction. The relevance of alternative queries is checked by feedback or internal ranking mechanism. The feedback ensures that the satisfaction of the user is satisfied by the alternating query. Alexander Ran proposes the semantic tagging mechanism in his research for NLQ systems (S8) to match internal queries with available information. Similar research has been recorded in the publication [29] of the Sfind 23 system as an extraction algorithm related to SMS."}, {"heading": "D. Query Conversion", "text": "Most related projects mention that SMS text is received in the form of a Protocol Data Unit (PDU), and must be converted to plain text form (S11, S19, S33) or alternatively to HTML query form. This conversion depends on the compatibility of application server software and its backend support. 4.2 Analysis of Query Processing.The Table - II shows all of the above features and the associated methodology observed in different systems. \"Nine Function Points X Forty three Systems\" matrix is evaluated to extract the following facts. No Category A or Category B systems seem to care about query refinement and other counterparts."}, {"heading": "A. Domain Dependency", "text": "The core logic of the service is mainly characterized by the domain of the application. For example, a system can be developed for a particular business. Mobile phones could be used by the customers of the business and information access ports by their employees as service access terminals. Wireless connectivity can be used to overcome domain dependence by connecting services of independent but interconnected services. Crime information from police files can be linked to the RTO database to track the owner of a lost car / vehicle [16]. In practice, the core service logic is based either on one domain or on several domains. Systems S1 to S3 are limited to specific areas of application. The S14 system related to the agricultural domain is an example. Here, it is a single domain system. Vendor systems such as S4 allow the connectivity of multiple databases and mediate multi-domain IR applications. Domain independent solutions are part of experimental systems such as S7, which are provided independently of such domains."}, {"heading": "B. Knowledge Base Construction", "text": "Another option is the Dynamic Knowledge Base. Web-based data / information is powered by a search engine interface or WAP. System S8 operates on an ontology-based RDF repository; effective semantic information access via NLQ is supported by such ontology-based knowledge construction; the use of WEB for SMS-based information access has been tested in System S23; the \"SMSfind\" algorithm of System S23 is designed to access search engines to extract relevant documents from the Web; it extracts relevant snippets from these documents by applying surface pattern matching mechanisms [20]; Enterprise Resource Planner (ERP) software such as SAP is another example of dynamic KBS. This alternative is illustrated in Systems S2 and S3. Some systems (S12, S14 and SDF) can be combined with both PRDF systems and external as well as with dynamic BBS systems."}, {"heading": "C. SMS Log", "text": "Maintaining a log of all incoming and outgoing messages is mandatory for all SMS-based information systems. Some systems use non-service SMS services. The service receives a special wireless connectivity that is independently identified by a unique service number with a lower number of digits than the normal mobile number. Normally, the mobile number of each subscriber is about 10 digits, with the special services receiving a 5 / 6 digit number such as \"55566.\" The SMS sent to this service application is initially stored in the SMS Center (SMSC), which is directly accessible to the system service. Special systems such as mobile surveys / polls, market feedback, interactive quiz competitions use this type of services. The system dependent on the service provider is connected to a standard mobile connection to its PC. In this case, the system can organize such SMS log data in its local database. Most research models use dependent services and therefore need to maintain local SMS log files."}, {"heading": "D. Connection Mechanism", "text": "In order to connect the SMS-based information system to mobile phones, it requires wireless connectivity. GSM / GPRS network, Internet connection and WAP are available technologies for establishing PC-mobile connectivity. SMS gateways / SMS interfaces can be built separately to execute matters related to mobile services, leaving the application server free to handle the backend and the service APIs. It is noted that systems such as S27 have covered all these options in their related work. Working with System S17 also involves connecting via SMSC and SMS interface to the recipient's mobile unit. Alternatively, the use of the Internet server is presented as another option for connectivity. The literature on S39, S41 systems specifies the use of these components, namely SMSC, SMS gateway and GSM modem, to implement this client and server paradigm."}, {"heading": "E. Programming Support", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they do not want."}, {"heading": "A. User Registration and Authentication", "text": "Systems related to academic organizations refer to \"university exam systems\" (S21, S20 and S30), and paid services such as \"Telepay\" require security with support for registration and authentication. Financial systems such as S33, S35 also include this security. At the time of registration, users can customize their information channel, and service providers can maintain their user profile for filtering and customizing information before making it available to users. This personalization would improve the privacy practices of the service."}, {"heading": "B. Previleged Access", "text": "When users are asked to register and authenticate, it is possible to restrict access to information according to the privileges assigned to them at the time of registration on the basis of the user profile. Privacy measures can be effectively used to improve the personalised privacy measures that lead to a reliable information channel. System S10 defines this as its application. Systems S6, S16 indicate the need for privacy measures in M-Governance applications based on specific examples. Systems S16 and S32 have proposed a coordinated architecture, in which case different levels of privileged information access could be managed at different levels. Systems S19, S20, S21 apply two levels of privacy rights such as teacher-student. Banking (S22), business processes (S2) require multi-level privacy rights to push and pull information."}, {"heading": "C. Location Tracking", "text": "The security measures of SMS-based systems even require a demand for location tracking. Tracking of suspects is the concern of the police. System S10 is one of these types of applications in M-governance. System S24 an election observation system that also takes into account the security of the transmitter. There are two important options for location tracking. One is Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and the other is Cell Destination Investigation (CDI). System S24 an election observation system that tracks the security of the transmitter."}, {"heading": "D. Response Representation", "text": "One of the options is the SMS form and another option is the e-mail form. Modern systems S25, S26 send MMS messages as a system response. Most vendor systems allow the conversion of SMS to e-mail and e-mail to SMS (S4). If a request has more than one answer (S8, S14), a multiple message may be required. In such a case, the order of the messages and the order is the important concern. If the response of a request requires more than 160 characters, it must be divided into several SMS replies. Sequencing such replies to make them meaningful is not an easy task. Results can also be generated as a formatted output. For example, live information on the status of the central voting of current parliamentary elections can be transmitted on the television screen (S3) in tabular form."}, {"heading": "E. Location Based Answering", "text": "A location-based query can be answered by positioning mechanisms such as GPS. The number of problems of the modern age is related to location tracking. A number of options are available to provide technical support for location determination. These location techniques for mobile phones can be listed as CID, GPS and GIS. Few systems associated with applications in tourism (S26, S28) and vehicle tracking (S31) need to provide information related to location tracking. M-governance problems in systems S5, S6, S10 also illustrate good applications of location tracking."}, {"heading": "F. Relevance Feedback Mechanism", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A reliable IR service is necessary to meet user\u2019s satisfaction level. Applying RFM relevant information delivery can be", "text": "Very few systems are designed to require the user's feedback after the response to the user's manual settings has been made. Requesting the user to rank the results sent by the system is the explicit RFM method. For example, Google SMS \"Did you mean coffee?\" if someone misspells \"cofe\" in the corresponding query, causing the user to correctly type and resend the word / query set to get more relevant results (S14). Implicit and blind relevance feedback mechanisms are the other options mentioned in S23."}, {"heading": "G. Unavailable Information", "text": "In the case of unavailability of relevant information in the Knowledge Base, most systems respond to messages with a meaning similar to \"Unavailable Data... Please contact < Person / URL >\" or \"Please visit... for further inquiries.\" For example, a System S33 confirms the user with \"Invalid input or No record found\" message. Sunil Kumar Kopparadu et al. [8] solves this problem in S12 by finding the answer to the unanswered question \"Next Close Answer.\" For example, the query is \"Chemical Engineering Thane.\" It cannot be answered because no engineering college in Thane Chemical Branch offers it. The system as above would create another internal alternative query to find close to answers. In such a case, the user may receive one of the answers - $1. Zero for the query, but you can try... $2. Computer Engineering - < XYZ Engineering College, Thane W > 3. Chemical Engineering College < ABC; Course Engineering >"}, {"heading": "H. Response address", "text": "The relevant information is sent in response to the target mobile unit, and the response may be intended for individual destinations or multiple destinations. For example, a student's question about his / her result (S22) can be answered on his / her mobile phone, but a student's furious complaint must generate warning messages to affected members of the committee. Current mobile systems support single addresses, bulk SMS and even transmitted SMS services. In some applications, the responses can be sent as triggers, as information support or as queries to other applications that provide a dependent service. For example, SMS can be processed as query data by different queries by the application server to send survey updates to the service of a NEWS channel."}, {"heading": "I. Categorical evaluation.", "text": "If we evaluate the systems in the category vs. chronological order, as shown in Chart I, the following points could be localized: 1. Maximum number of systems will be developed in 2009 that have contributed to the development of all categories except the category Professional. Literature of 2008 shows many developments in all four categories. 2. As of 2007, no traces of research in m-Governance are found. Comparatively greater efforts are being made by the developers of category C and D. 3. In 2011, no work was recorded in category A and category B. 4. Not much work was found for professional systems and M-Governance systems after 2008 and 2009 respectively. 5. Not many forecasts were found in this research area in 2002. 6. Only one system was found for 2013. It may be because the actual work is not yet available."}, {"heading": "J.

Information and communication technology and far reaching mobile penetration has opened this new research trend Number of key players in Search industry including Microsoft and Google are attracted by the expected increase in volume of use of such applications. The wide range of applications and their public acceptance has motivated researchers to work in this research domain. Several applications such as SMS based information access using database management services, SMS based information retrieval through internet (search engine), SMS based information extraction, question answering, image retrieval etc. have been emerged. With the aim to understand the functionality involved in these systems, an extensive review of a few of these SMSbISs has been planned and executed by us. These systems are classified into four categories based on the objectives and domains of the applications. As a result of this study a well structured functional model is presented here. The model is evaluated in different dimensions, which is presented in this paper. In addition to this a chronological progress with respect to research and development in this upcoming field is compiled in this paper. Such an extensive review presented in this paper would definitely help the researchers and developers to understand the technical aspects of this field. The functional framework presented here would be useful to the system designers to design and develop an SMS based Information System of any specific domain.
