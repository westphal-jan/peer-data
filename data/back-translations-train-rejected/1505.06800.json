Suppose the channel response function is channel output, the image response is given as follows: (1) where a first order simple function is described as the sum of pixels in a fixed rectangular area. High quality characteristics can be achieved by combining several first order functions across a variety of strategies. In addition, combining different channels is referred to as aggregate channel characteristics. In this paper, we extract low-grade pedestrian characteristics to improve training speed by reducing the number of layers of a deep learning network, and then extract the high-grade characteristics through our deep network. Specific steps are as follows: Step one: In this paper, we use color UI and graphic characteristics as the input unit G (we anchor the high grade characteristics in GB)."}, {"heading": "2.2 CNN structure", "text": "The two-dimensional image data can be used directly as input channels. In addition, the extraction of features is embedded in the structure of CNN.CNN, which mainly represents bias, displacement, and scale invariance. [13] The following layers acquire higher properties by combining these primary properties. The neurons can detect the same properties in different locations of the input image by extracting primary visual features from the input image, such as edge, endpoint, corner, and so on. Then, the changes in the input translation appear in the output in the same direction and distance, but they do not cause other forms of change."}, {"heading": "3 Boosting-like", "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "4.1 Comparison of boosting-like stability", "text": "The abscissa represents training repetitions, and the ordinate refers to the average error rate tested by each trained model on the basis of the Caltech test dataset. This log-average error rate is evaluated on the basis of the uniform criteria proposed in [15]. Furthermore, the experiments are conducted with Caltech databases. Comparative results show: First, the curve is relatively stable when the Boosting-l-ike method is used in the feedback propagation, and the volatility is lower. Although it is low without the Boosting-like stability, the volatility is high. Second, the Boosting-like algorithm achieves a 0.48% performance increase in pedestrian detection. Therefore, this method not only improves network stability, but also slightly improves the accuracy of the system while not decreasing the convergence speed."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results of the Caltech dataset", "text": "The evaluation method proposed in [15] is used to verify the detection performance of our pedestrian detection framework, which maintains the curve between the average error rate and the false positive rate of each image. In the experiment, we evaluated the detection performance in the reasonable subset, which is a commonly used pedestrian detection method. It consists of pedestrians larger than 49 pixels and whose locked portions are less than 35%. We compared the common approaches related to our method: VJ [16], HOG, ConvNet [17], ACF [18], JointDeep [8], HOGCSS. These methods use different characteristics, deformation models and different classifiers. Our experimental method is estimated by BDL.Fig.6. Comparison of the average error rate per image vs. false positive per image (FPPI) between our BDL approach and related methods on Caltech dataset.Figure 6 shows that the average error rate per Caltech detection method on Caltech's error average error rate of 51% and the error average of PI on Caltech's error rate of 51."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we propose a simple but effective framework for pedestrian detection. We use a similar idea to train the network structure, which not only improves system stability, but also reduces the average error rate of pedestrian detection. By interacting, it achieves performance gains of 15.85% and 3.81%, respectively, compared to the corresponding methods in the largest Caltech dataset. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the validity and stability of our model. Through the experiments, we can draw the following conclusions: The boosting method we propose can improve detection stability and performance; the deep model is more time consuming during the training process, while the traditional, handcrafted feature extraction has low adaptability. If we use hand-carved features at a low level as input channels, fewer layers of deep structure can effectively improve classification performance, while it can improve training speed. We are sure that when measures to detect pedestrian are enhanced [by 20, or by 19]"}], "references": [{"title": "Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection[C", "author": ["N Dalal", "B Triggs"], "venue": "//IEEE Conference on Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition.
