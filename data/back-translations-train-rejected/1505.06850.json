What background material should be recommended to the student for review? In the current work, we would \"flip the script\" and look at what we think is a more fundamental problem for AI: computer programs that can learn from feedback themselves, because if it were easy to build large automatic tutors, they would be part of everyday life. As potential users (think from both sides of the desk), we look forward to a future if that is the case. Besides automated tutors, computed creativity is a challenge within artificial intelligence, where feedback plays a crucial role (for example, Pe-rez y Pe-rez, Aguilar, & Negrete, 2010; Pease, Guhe, & Smaill, 2010)."}, {"heading": "2 The Writers Workshop", "text": "Richard Gabriel (2002) describes the practice of Writers Workshops, which have been used within the Pattern Languages of Programming (PLoP) community for over a decade; the basic style of collaboration originated much earlier with groups of literary writers who engage in peer group critique; some literary workshops are open to genres and are happy to accommodate beginners such as the Minneapolis Writers Workshop2; others focus on professionals working within a particular genre, such as the Milford Writers Workshop.3The practices Gabriel describes are fairly typical: \u2022 Authors come up with works that are willing to present and read a short sample. \u2022 This work is generally Work in Progress (and workshop shopping is intended to help improve it). Importantly, it may be early-stage work, rather than just presenting a created artifact, activities in the workshop can be aspects of the creative process itself.

Feedback has long been a central concept in cybernetics, particularly in Pickering, 2002, and in related disciplines such as neuroscience (Ashby, 1952; Seth, 2015). The basic types of feedback are positive and negative: positive feedback increases disruption, while negative feedback reduces disruption. Sources of negative feedback are therefore useful for systems control applications (and their analogies). Feedback and control (including feedback on control) are considered relevant to thinking about learning and communication (Bateson, 1972)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Feedback in computational creativity", "text": "Creativity is often seen as a cyclical process (e.g. Dickie's (1984) Circle of Art, Pease and Colton's (2011) Iterative Development-ExpressionAppreciation Model).There are opportunities for embedded feedback at every step, and the creative process itself is \"comparable\" to a feedback loop. Despite these strong hints of the central importance of feedback in the creative process, our sense is that feedback has not taken a central place in research on computerized creativity. In particular, current systems in computerized creativity almost usually do not consume or evaluate the work of other systems. 6Gerva's and Leo'n (2014) represent a creative cycle of narrative development involving a composer and an interpreter in such a way that the composer has interpreted the composer's interpretative functionality. Individual creativity is not the poor relationship between social creativity, but his reflection. But even when computer models explicitly involve multiple systems, as in 2001, they are indeed different actors in culture."}, {"heading": "3.2 Feedback in computational serendipity", "text": "The term \"computational serendipity\" is relatively new, but its foundations are already established in previous research. Grace and Maher (2014) investigate computer surprises by trying to \"apply computational creativity methods [...] to the generation of scientific hypotheses.\" This is an example of efforts that focus on computer-based inventions. One area of AI in which it can be argued that snake lines play an important role is pattern matching. Current computer programs are able to identify known patterns and \"close matches\" in data sets from specific areas, such as music (Meredith, Lemstro, & Wiggins, 2002). Identifying known patterns is a special case of the more general concept of Pattern Mining (Bergeron & Conklin, 2007). Specifically, the ability to extract new higher-order patterns that describe exceptions is an example of \"learning from feedback\" - and increasingly using Lucas \"evolutionary learning models to facilitate these."}, {"heading": "3.3 Communications and feedback", "text": "Gordon Pask's Conversation Theory, discussed in (Pask, 1984; Boyd, 2004), goes far beyond the simple process language of the workshop, although there are structural parallels. We see that a basic task-like learning conversation has many similarities to the Writers Workshop model of communicative feedback (Boyd, 2004, p. 190): 1. conversation participants perform some actions and observations; 2. naming and recording what is being done; 3. asking questions and explaining why it works so; 4. conducting overarching methodological discussions; and, 5. trying to find out why unexpected results occur. Deviations in the underlying system, protocol, and event schedule should be taken into account depending on the needs and interests of the participants, and several variants can be tried. On a pragmatic basis, if the workshop proves quite useful to the participants, it could be revised monthly, weekly, or continuously."}, {"heading": "4 Case study: Flowcharts and Feedback", "text": "This section describes the work that is currently under way to implement the Writers Workshop model, not just within a system, but as a new paradigm for collaboration between different projects. To reach other participants, we need a neutral environment that is not difficult to develop, because: The FloWr system mentioned in Section 2.1 provides one7For a comparison case in computer Go, see http: / / cgos.computergo.org /.such possibilities of the basic primary objects in the FloWr system are flowcharts, which are composed of interconnected process nodes (Charnley, Colton, & Llano, 2014; Colton & Charnley, 2014). Process nodes specify input and output types and internal processing in Java, or other languages that interact with the JVM, or by calling external web services. One of the most common applications to date is the generation of computer poetry, and we will focus on basic issues related to this system."}, {"heading": "5 Concluding discussion and future directions", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "Joseph Cornelli's work on this paper was supported by the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) programme of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Commission under FET Open Grant No 611553 (COINVENT)."}], "references": [{"title": "Design for a brain", "author": ["W.R.
