From this perspective, we show first how TEC can easily be addressed as a preimage problem. Unfortunately this preimage problem is ill-posed, may suffer from over-fitting especially for long time series and getting a sub-optimal solution involves heavy computational costs. We then derive two new algorithms based on a probabilistic interpretation of kernel alignment matrices that expresses in terms of probabilistic distributions over sets of alignment paths. The first algorithm is an iterative agglomerative heuristics inspired from the state of the art DTW barycenter averaging (DBA) algorithm proposed specifically for the Dynamic Time Warping measure. The second proposed algorithm achieves a classical averaging of the aligned samples but also implements an averaging of the time of occurrences of the aligned samples. It exploits a straightforward progressive agglomerative heuristics. An experimentation that compares for 45 time series datasets classification error rates obtained by first near neighbors classifiers exploiting a single medoid or centroid estimate to represent each categories show that: i) centroids based approaches significantly outperform medoids based approaches, ii) on the considered experience, the two proposed algorithms outperform the state of the art DBA algorithm, and iii) the second proposed algorithm that implements an averaging jointly in the sample space and along the time axes emerges as the most significantly robust time elastic averaging heuristic with an interesting noise reduction capability.

Multiple alignments have been extensively studied in bioinformatics [6], and it has been shown that the arithmetical complexity of determining the optimal alignment of a set of sequences below the sum of all pairs (SP) is a NP-complete problem [7] [8]. The temporal and spatial complexity of this problem is O (Lk), where k is the number of sequences within the set and L is the length of sequences in dynamic programming to find an optimal solution [9]. The latter result applies to estimating the time elastic centricity of a set of k time series in relation to the DTW measure. Since the search for an optimal solution quickly becomes impossible with increasing k, most of the following three categories of one of them have been divided into the most relevant categories."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 Progressive heuristics", "text": "Progressive heuristic methods estimate the temporal elasticity of a series of k time series by combining pairs of centric centering (Def. 2.3). Such an approach constructs a binary tree whose leaves correspond to the time series of the dataset and whose nodes correspond to the calculation of a local pair-wise centride, so that when the tree is complete, the root is associated centered with the estimated dataset [10]. The proposed strategies differ in the way the tree is constructed. A popular approach is to provide a random sequence for the leaves and then construct the binary tree using this sequence to the root [10]. Another approach involves constructing a dendrogram (a hierarchical ascendant grouping) from the dataset and then using this dendrogram to calculate pair-wise centering, starting with the narrowest of the progressive rows, as shown on the left side of the time series as 1."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Iterative heuristics", "text": "The first step consists in the calculation of the inertia, i.e. the sum of the DTW distances between the temporary centrid and each time series in the dataset.

Thus, a new time series u (i) is constructed, which contains all samples of the time series uj (i), with the time being stretched or compressed according to the best orientation path. The third step consists in creating a new temporary centric candidate c (i) from the set u (i), containing all samples of the time series uj (i), with the time being stretched or compressed according to the best orientation path.

Simple pairwise progressive aggregation is a less complex approach, but it suffers from its dependence on the initial conditions. Iterative aggregation is said to be more efficient, but entails higher computing costs. It could be combined with ensemble methods or soft optimizations such as genetic algorithms.

DBA is also currently considered state of the art to consistently capture a number of sequences with DTW. To this end, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the methods that use a first nearestroid / medoid-based task (1-NC) classification task on a series of time series derived from widely different application fields. The task consists of representing each category contained in a training dataset by evaluating their error-doid-centred and then-centered data."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we address the supposedly difficult problem of averaging a series of time series in the context of time-elastic distance measurement such as dynamic time warping. The new perspective offered by the kernization of elastic distance allows us to first consider averaging time series as a premage problem, which, unfortunately, is a non-convex problem that may suffer from a combinatorial number of local optimizations when it comes to long multidimensional time series. Furthermore, this type of premage problem can only be solved by gradient-free optimization procedures, which are mathematically very expensive (since a comprehensive functional evaluation is required). However, this new kernization approach allows a reinterpretation of the paired kernel alignment matrices as distributions of probabilities over alignment paths. Based on this reinterpretation, we propose two different algorithms, iKDBA and pDTW-progressive PWA, which represent the most significant WA-based time series."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The authors thank the French Ministry of Research, the Brittany Region, the General Council of Morbihan and the European Regional Development Fund, which partially financed this research, and the promoters of the UCR and UCI data repositories for providing the time series data used in this study."}], "references": [{"title": "Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel", "author": ["M.

From this perspective, we show that TEC can be readily addressed as a preimage problem. However, this non-convex problem is ill-posed, and obtaining a sub-optimal solution may involve heavy computational costs, especially for long time series. We then derive two new algorithms based on a probabilistic interpretation of kernel alignment matrices that expresses the result in terms of probabilistic distributions over sets of alignment paths. The first algorithm is an agglomerative iterative heuristic procedure inspired from a state-of-the-art DTW barycentre averaging algorithm. The second proposed algorithm uses a progressive agglomerative heuristic method to perform classical averaging of the aligned samples but also averages the times of occurrence of the aligned samples. By comparing classification accuracies for 45 time series datasets obtained by first nearest centroid/medoid classifiers we show that: i) centroid-based approaches significantly outperform medoid-based approaches, ii) for the considered datasets, the second algorithm which combines averaging in the sample space and along the time axes, emerges as the most significantly robust heuristic model for time-elastic averaging with a promising noise reduction capability.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
