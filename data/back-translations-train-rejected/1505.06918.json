Millions of sports fans participate in their fantasy leagues each week. Users \"main tasks are to draft, retread players before each season, and determine the weekly lineup for their team. Users have many tools at their disposal for the latter: statistics, predictions, expert rankings, and even peer recommendations. However, there are problems with all of these. Most users do not want to spend time reading statistics. Fantasy football's prediction has been little studied and is fairly inaccurate. Experts judge mainly on the basis of personal preferences rather than impartial metrics. Finally, there are few like-minded people who vote in line-up decisions, so the results are not representative of general opinion. As many people pay money to play, prediction tools should be improved, as they provide unbiased and easy-to-use tools for making fantasy football decisions, so the results are not representative of general opinion."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Most sports prediction research focuses on predicting the winner of a match rather than fantasy football scores or specific game statistics that are important for fantasy football. Min et al. [5] used Bayesian conclusions and rules-based considerations to predict the outcome of an American football game. Their work is based on the idea that sports are both highly likely and simultaneously based on rules based on team strategies. Sierra, Fosco and Fierro [1] used classification methods to predict the outcome of an American football game based on a limited number of game statistics without most scoring categories. In their experiments, linear support vector machines had by far the most accurate predictions and ranked ahead of all expert predictions they compared to. Similarly, Harville [8] used a linear model for the same task. An approach by the Neural Network to predict the winner of college football games was suggested by Pardee to improve from 76% to 7% accuracy."}, {"heading": "3 Proposed Solution", "text": "Much of my work consists in creating a suitable dataset from the real game data; the raw game data must be filtered and manipulated in such a way that only relevant data cases are used later on. Predictions are made using two different methods: vector regression support (SVR) and neural networks. Linear models such as SVR have been very successful in predicting the winner of a match [1,8]. Neural networks are able to adapt to the data and are therefore particularly useful when the structure of the data is not known. In this particular case, I have no prior knowledge of whether linear models work well or not, so the neural networks will at least provide another prediction to compare the results of the SVR with those. As the two approaches do not have much in common, I will describe them separately."}, {"heading": "3.1 Support Vector Regression", "text": "Support for vector regression (SVR) is a linear regression model. Compared to other models, SVR is insensitive, i.e. when the model is adapted to the data, the error is not determined on a continuous function. Instead, the deviation from the desired target value yi is not counted within the target value yi. Specifically, SVR uses a regression function fSV R with attribute vectors xi and its designations yi as follows: fSV R (x) = (D \u2211 d = 1 wdxd) + b = xw + bwo w and b are selected, so that w \u0445, b \u0445 = argmin w, bCN \u2211 i = 1 V (yi \u2212 (xiw + b) + \u044522V is a function that returns 0 if the absolute value of its argument is less than and otherwise the difference of the absolute value of its argument is calculated and the loss of linear outside the -insensitive corridor increases from several options that can be selected unsparingly."}, {"heading": "3.2 Neural Networks", "text": "Neural networks have the advantage that they adapt to the problem by learning the properties of the dataset. After initial input of the characteristics, there are potentially several hidden layers and finally the output layer. In each layer, there are so-called neurons or hidden units that perform calculations. From layer to layer, there are connections so that the outputs of the neurons of the previous layer are the inputs of the neurons of the next layer. In order to work for regression, the neural network is configured to have a linear output layer. The hidden layer units should not be linear. Frequent decisions for the activation function are hyperbolic tangents (tanh) or sigmoids. In my experiment, I used only neural networks with a hidden layer. The activation function in the hidden layer for the kest unit ishk = 11 + exp ((\u2212 D-wk = bk) which must be hidden on the radio layer while the dk) are hidden on the K."}, {"heading": "3.3 Pipeline", "text": "The neural network can do this implicitly or not, depending on whether or not it improves its predictions. Before using SVR, I scaled the features down to the interval [0, 1] to improve performance specifically for linear and polynomial kernel SVR. After normalization comes feature selection. There are three options: no feature selection, manual feature selection, and recursive feature selection with cross validation (RFECV). All have certain advantages and problems. Non-use of feature selection can lead to inaccurate predictions due to correlated features. Manual feature selection requires domain knowledge. Finally, RFECV takes a lot of time depending on the number of features, but the results should be reasonably good as the elimination is cross-validated. After feature selection, the hyperparameters for SVR must be determined. An appropriate number of configurations will be tested depending on the number of features, with the rest being best matched to the number of features."}, {"heading": "4 Data Set", "text": "The data set consists of NFL game data from 2009 to 2014. I accessed it using the API from github.com / BurntSushi / nflgame, which uses data from NFL.com. Before using it to make predictions, I performed several operations. First, I filtered the data so that only quarterbacks (QBs) with at least 5 passes are selected. This restriction is so necessary that non-QB players or backup QBs are not taken into account. Then, for each game that I feature, the current age of the QB, his experience in years as a pro, the stats of the previous game, the average stats of the last 10 games, as well as the statistics of the opposing defense in their last game and their average in the last 10 games. The stats for a QB include 12 features that show the performance in passing and rushing as well as turnover. The values are all treated as continuous real values."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments and Results", "text": "In this area, it is very important that most of them are able to establish themselves in the region, \"he said in an interview with\" Welt am Sonntag \":\" It is not the first time that they are able to establish themselves in the region, but that they are able to establish themselves in the region. \""}, {"heading": "6 Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "Considering that I have only predicted the results for one position, quarterback, there are still several positions in a team, potentially increasing the overall error. Comparing with other prediction sources is difficult, as most websites only use experts. Those who actually plan with a model, e.g. ESPN, do not openly write about their accuracy. Reda and Stringer [10] analyzed the accuracy of ESPN, but they used several positions at once, so I could not properly compare them. It is encouraging, though, that their MAE histograms show the same Bell Curve shape and have roughly the same deviation. Apart from that, there are some interesting observations from this experiment. The feature selection with RFECV selected only 4 features. I assume that many of NetMA's features are correlated and therefore do not add much added value to the predictions."}], "references": [{"title": "A Statistical Data Mining Approach to Determining the Factors that Distinguish Championship Caliber Teams in the National Football League", "author": ["E.
