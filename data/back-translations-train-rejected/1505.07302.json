RELATED WORK", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 European Parliament", "text": "The most prominent forms of MEP behaviour studied in the existing literature include expressing political positions through speeches and written submissions and voting in plenary. Parliament's formal structure provides strategic advantages for certain MEPs by giving them privileged access to information, which has led MEPs in committees to address issues that are relevant to them in order to influence outcomes in these areas."}, {"heading": "2.2 Topic Models", "text": "In the field of data analysis, advanced subject modeling algorithms that go beyond word frequency distributions have recently been applied to large collections of text. Extensive topic modeling research has focused on the use of probabilistic methods such as variants of latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) [23]. Subsequently, authors developed analog probabilistic approaches to track the evolution of topics over time in a sequentially organized corpus of documents, such as the Dynamic Topic Model (DTM) of Lead and Lafferty [2]. Alternative algorithms, such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) [12], have also been effective in discovering the underlying topics in text corporations [15, 25]. Saha & Sindhwani [20] proposed an online learning framework for the use of NMF to extract topics from streaming social media content by dividing the streams into short timeframes."}, {"heading": "2.3 Topic Models Applied to Political Texts", "text": "Some methods of modeling topics have been adopted in the political science literature to analyze political attention. In environments where politicians have limited time resources to express their views, such as plenary sessions in parliaments, politicians must decide which topics to address. Thus, the analysis of such speeches can provide insight into the political priorities of the politician in question. Individual membership topic models, which assume that each speech relates to a topic, have been successfully applied to plenary speeches given in the 105th to 108th U.S. Senate in order to track the political attention of senators in this context over time [18]. This study found that the collected speeches resulted in a rich and meaningful policy agenda, in which the topics evolved significantly over time in response to internal and external stimuli."}, {"heading": "3. METHODS", "text": "In this section, we describe a two-tiered strategy for applying theme modeling in a non-negative matrix factorization framework to a time-stamped corpus of political speeches. First, in Section 3.1, we describe the application of NMF theme modeling to a single set of speeches from a specified period of time. Second, in Section 3.2, we propose a new approach to combine the results of theme modeling from consecutive periods to identify a set of dynamic themes that encompass part or the entire duration of the corpus."}, {"heading": "3.1 Topic Modeling Speeches", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "3.2 Dynamic Topic Modeling", "text": "When applying clustering to temporal data, we have often suggested dividing the data into fixed-duration time frames. < In the case of streaming data, such as content coming from social media platforms, this is an artificial transformation of continuous topics into sliding windows. However, in the case of political speeches transcribed from different plenary sessions, the data will naturally be divided into segments, while some aspects of the agenda will remain common between successive sessions, in other cases the focus of the topic debates will shift considerably between sessions. Consequently, online learning approaches that use sliding windows and assume that a smooth evolution in topics over time, as proposed in [20], may be unworkable. Subsequently, we divide the topic of the packed corpus of parliamentary speeches into disordered time frames."}, {"heading": "4. DATA", "text": "In August 2014, we accessed all the plenary speeches available on Europarl, the official website of the European Parliament3, corresponding to the parliamentary activities of MEPs during the 5th-7th parliamentary term of the EP. This resulted in 269,696 unique speeches in 24 lan3http: / / europarl.euguages. While we considered the use of either multilingual subject modeling or automated translation of documents, problems with the accuracy and reliability of both strategies led us to focus on English-language speeches in plenary - either by native speakers or translators - which made up the majority of speeches on Europarl. A corpus of 210,247 English-language speeches was identified in total, representing 77.95% of the original collection, ranging from 100% for the United Kingdom, over 87% for Germany, to 66.2% for Romania."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Experimental Setup", "text": "After pre-processing the data, we applied NMF with parameter selection, as described in Section 3.1. Considering the relatively specialized vocabulary used in the EP debates, we used the full set of English-language speeches to build the word2vec space for selecting parameters. We used the same word2vec settings and the number of top terms per topic (t = 10) as described in [15]. In each time window, we generated models with k topics [10, 25] window topics, selecting the value k, which maximized the mean TC-W2V coherence, resulting in an average number of topics per window of 15.5. The figure of the number of topics per window in Fig. 2 shows that there are significant variations in the number of topics determined for each window that do not correlate with the number of speeches per quarter."}, {"heading": "5.2 Dynamic Topic Validation", "text": "The 57 topics we identified in our experiments are diverse, both in terms of their thematic content and their temporal signatures. Table 2 lists the 20 most dynamic topics in the data ordered in terms of their TC-W2V theme coherence results. We report on the temporal frequency of the topics, along with a manually assigned short label for discussion purposes. The first reflects the frequency of dynamic topics ranging from 11 that appeared in < 10 time frames, to a broad \"plenary topic\" that appeared in 57 out of 60 windows. In general, we observed two different categories of dynamic topics for discussion topics. The first reflects the EU's day-to-day policy regarding legislation and debate on the EU's core competencies (e.g. \"energy,\" agriculture \"), while the other reflects unexpected exogenous shocks and MEPs responses to these events (e.g. Euro issues full window 4full details)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Case Studies", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "5.4 Explaining MEP Speech Counts", "text": "This year, it is at an all-time high in the history of the European Union."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a new two-tiered matrix factorization method to identify issues in grand political decorations over time that relate to events; in terms of providing substantial insights into the European Parliament's political processes, we have the opportunity to unveil the political agenda in Parliament; and in terms of the way in which they have evolved over time, we have three different case studies that can be drawn between day-to-day business and policy areas."}, {"heading": "7.
