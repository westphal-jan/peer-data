However, more and more attention is being given to cases in which cost should not always be the sole or major consideration. In this paper, we study a fair task allocation problem where an optimal allocation not only has low cost but more importantly, it is max-lexmin fair to all participants. To tackle this max-lexmin fair minimum cost allocation problem, we analyze and solve it in two parts. We first aim to determine the maximum number of jobs that can be feasibly done and the fairest distribution thereof. Since there may be many allocations that are considered equally fair, we then find the allocation with the minimum costs. We propose two novel polynomial-time algorithms that make use of the network flow structure of the problem to obtain the optimal solution. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the trade-off between cost minimization and fairness.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 May 2015 19:03:07 GMT  (45kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07434v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 May 2016 15:48:39 GMT  (58kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07434v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 7 Dec 2016 15:07:41 GMT  (60kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07434v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["qing chuan ye", "yingqian zhang", "rommert dekker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.07434"}, "pdf": {"name": "1505.07434.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Qing Chuan Ye", "Yingqian Zhang", "Rommert Dekker"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 150 5.07 434v 3 [cs.A I] 7 Dec 201 6Task allocation problems traditionally focus on cost optimisation. However, more and more attention is being paid to cases where cost should not always be the only or most important consideration. In this paper, we examine a fair problem of task allocation in transport, where optimal allocation not only has low costs, but more importantly, it distributes tasks as evenly as possible among heterogeneous participants who have different capacities and costs to perform tasks. To address this fair problem of minimal cost allocation, we analyze and solve it in two parts using two novel polynomial time algorithms. We show that despite the new fairness criterion, the proposed algorithms can solve the fair problem of minimal cost allocation optimally in polynomial time. In addition, we are conducting extensive experiments to investigate the trade-off between cost minimisation and fairness."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, we will be able to look for a solution that will enable us to move to another world, to move to another world, to move to another world."}, {"heading": "2 Literature review", "text": "The idea of factoring fairness in decision-making has been explored in several areas, and one of the earlier and still important areas where fairness has been considered is that of bandwidth allocation in telecommunications networks (Jaffe 1981, Zukerman et al. 2005). In this area, continuous flows with predefined origin identification pairs are used, which leads to algorithms that increase the flow over all paths simultaneously until the connections are saturated, or bandwidth is shared between competitors. Bertsekas et al. (1987) There is a simple algorithm for calculating maxmin fair tasks in networks, the so-called progressive filling of algorithms that are treated as one of the standard fairness concepts within telecommunications or network channels. (Ogryczak et al al al al al al al al.) In their problem definition, they assume that each session has a fixed path in the network."}, {"heading": "3 Problem definition", "text": "We assume that the number of available jobs (or jobs) that will be allocated in advance by the central planners is known in advance. (In our motivational example, the terminals know one day in advance which container ships will arrive and how many jobs they will have to handle.) Terminals are therefore able to construct a schedule for their vehicles and cranes one day in advance, and this plan reveals the necessary interterminal transport movements. We assume that the jobs can be executed independently of each other, which consists of T periods. The number of jobs mentioned by J consists of a total of J jobs, comes with an earliest available time and a latest completion time for each job. We assume that jobs can be executed independently of each other, regardless of the execution of other jobs. We define for each job a possible starting time as a figure: J-T 7 \u2192 If it is clear that we provide the jobs and the jobs."}, {"heading": "4 Polynomial-time optimal algorithm for MFMCA", "text": "In this section, we present a two-step network flow-based polynomial time algorithm to solve the proposed MFMCA problem. In the first stage, we propose an iterative maximum flow algorithm called IMaxFlow, in order to enforce the fairest job distribution across companies while ensuring that the maximum number of jobs can be assigned. IMaxFlow output, i.e. the optimal maximum-min-fairness vector \u03c6f, is then used as input for the FairMinCost algorithm to construct a new flow network. With each standard maximum flow algorithm on this constructed flow network, we prove that we have the optimal solution for MFMCA. In the next section, we present the proposed two-step algorithm, starting with the iterative maximum flow algorithm (IMaxFlow)."}, {"heading": "4.1 IMaxFlow algorithm for solving MMFA", "text": "In fact, it is such that it is a matter of a way in which people are able to put themselves into the world, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live."}, {"heading": "4.2 FairMinCost algorithm", "text": "Once we know the fairness vector of IMaxFlow, which minimizes the problem of job flow and associated costs (compensation), because there are many possible maximum flow solutions with different costs, we want to find the problem with the minimum cost. Unfortunately, we cannot apply a standard maximum flow algorithm to our flow network, as it can violate the maximum cost while looking for the exact number of jobs that all companies would receive. MFMCA is easily solvable if the jobs are distributed in the fairest allocation. However, we do not know which company would be allocated, what number of jobs is so small. If we know the exact number of jobs that all companies would receive, MFMCA is easily solvable. This is obvious because we can determine the capacities of the companies from the nodes of the respective companies."}, {"heading": "5 Computational results", "text": "In this section we examine the performance of the algorithms through numerical experiments. We are interested in the following two performance measurements: 1. The effect of fairness on costs, the so-called price of fairness (POF) (Bertsimas et al.2011a). POF is defined as the relative increase in total costs (TC) within the framework of the fair solution compared to the solution of minimum costs (MC); i.e. POF = TC (MFMCA) \u2212 TC (MC) TC (MC).2. The effect of fairness on the workstation distribution. The workstation distribution represents the number of jobs allocated to each company. Therefore, we generate test cases with different parameters and calculate both the minimum cost solution (MC) using the standard algorithm for cancelling the medium cost cycle and the fair minimum cost solution using the two-step algorithm: first IMaxFlow and then FairMinCost. In addition to the costs, we take a look at the allocations in both cases and see how the Java Algorithm Lisa is supported."}, {"heading": "5.1 Test instances", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "5.2 Results: price of fairness", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to leave the country without being a country in which it is a country in which it is a country in which it is a country in which it is a country in which it is not a country, but a country in which it is not a country, but a country in which it is a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a country, a"}, {"heading": "5.3 Results: job distribution", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to do so without being able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "5.4 Results: varying number of jobs", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "5.5 Results: varying number of companies", "text": "To examine the effect of the number of companies on the price of fairness, we need to increase the number of companies from 25 to 100, while the number of jobs increases to 250."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and discussion", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves and are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "A Proof of Theorem 2", "text": "Proof.

In G \u2032, there are \u03c6K \u2212 \u03c61 < J dummy layers. In each dummy layer, the number of dummy jobs is limited by K. The number of vertices in each dummy layer is then limited to a maximum of 3K.

In their problem setting, they assume that each session has an associated fixed path in the network. The algorithm starts with no flow, and then flow gets gradually increased over all paths simultaneously until a link in a path is saturated. The algorithm then continues from step to step, equally incrementing the flow in all paths that are not using saturated links, until all paths contain at least one saturated link.

In road network design fairness is also an issue, because without fairness network users might not get any benefit from the network design project, and therefore it may be difficult to rally public support and it may be easy to evoke opposition to the implementation of such a project (Meng and Yang 2002). In this application fairness is enforced through the addition of a constraint on the difference of the travel cost ratio between before and after the project. There has also been some work in vehicle routing problems, where fairness is considered in the extra-time distribution of a transportation service (Perugia et al. 2011). In order to incorporate fairness, they make use of a capping function, which enforces an upper bound on the extra-time.

However, more and more attention is being given to cases in which cost should not always be the sole or major consideration. In this paper we study a fair task allocation problem in transportation where an optimal allocation not only has low cost but more importantly, it distributes tasks as even as possible among heterogeneous participants who have different capacities and costs to execute tasks. To tackle this fair minimum cost allocation problem we analyze and solve it in two parts using two novel polynomial-time algorithms. We show that despite the new fairness criterion, the proposed algorithms can solve the fair minimum cost allocation problem optimally in polynomial time. In addition, we conduct an extensive set of experiments to investigate the trade-off between cost minimization and fairness. Our experimental results demonstrate the benefit of factoring fairness into task allocation. Among the majority of test instances, fairness comes with a very small price in terms of cost.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
