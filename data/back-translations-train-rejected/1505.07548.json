These models focus on isolated systems with only one defender, despite being part of a more complex system with multiple players. Furthermore, many real systems such as transportation networks and the power grid exhibit interdependencies between targets and, consequently, between decision makers jointly charged with protecting them. To understand such multidefender strategic interactions present in security, we investigate game theoretic models of security games with multiple defenders. Unlike most prior analysis, we focus on the situations in which each defender must protect multiple targets, so that even a single defender's best response decision is, in general, highly non-trivial. We start with an analytical investigation of multidefender security games with independent targets, offering an equilibrium and price-of-anarchy analysis of three models with increasing generality. In all models, we find that defenders have the incentive to over-protect targets, at times significantly. Additionally, in the simpler models, we find that the price of anarchy is unbounded, linearly increasing both in the number of defenders and the number of targets per defender. Considering interdependencies among targets, we develop a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation to compute a defender's best response, and make use of this formulation in approximating Nash equilibria of the game. We apply this approach towards computational strategic analysis of several models of networks representing interdependencies, including real-world power networks. Our analysis shows how network structure and the probability of failure spread determine the propensity of defenders to over- or under-invest in security.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 May 2015 04:54:53 GMT  (1727kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07548v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["jian lou", "andrew m smith", "yevgeniy vorobeychik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.07548"}, "pdf": {"name": "1505.07548.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Multidefender Security Games", "authors": ["Jian Lou", "Andrew M.

Specifically, let's assume that there are n defenders, each of whom protects k \u2265 1 targets. Then, the defender's strategy i will be a vector < qi1, qi2,... qik >. The attacker's strategy profile can then be described as a matrix of probabilities, p11 p12... p1k p21 p22..... p2k......... pn1 pn2.... pnk, in which i = 1, k = 1 pij = 1 pij = 1 and pij \u2265 0 for each i and j. The expected usefulness of a defender i in this model is isui = k, j = 1 piju a ij + (1 \u2212 pij) uuij, where uiv \u2212 ij is the usefulness of the target for i, if it is not qqj = iv \u2212 iv \u2212 iv \u2212 iv \u2212 iv."}, {"heading": "3.3 The General Model", "text": "In general, we assume that if the attacker attacks a target protected by defender i, and the defender chooses to protect the target, then the benefit of the target is for defender i c, and if the attacker attacks the target but is not protected, then the benefit of the target is for defender i. One can reasonably assume that U c \u2265 Uu. If the target of defender i is not attacked, then we assume that the benefit of the target for defender i is the same as in the multi-target model. Therefore, in the general model, uaij = qijU c + (1 \u2212 qij) is Uu \u2212 qijc = (U c \u2212 Uu \u2212 c) qij + Uuuiij = qijc."}, {"heading": "3.4 The Interdependent Model", "text": "The previous three models had three important limitations: first, that the target values are homogeneous; second, that the targets are independent; and third, that the defenders protect the same number of targets. Suppose that a defender can choose i from a limited number of security configurations for each target j \u00b2 Ti, where Ti is the set of targets under the direct influence of i. Let's say T is the set of all targets, i.e., T \u00b2 iTi, with a limited set of security configurations for each target j \u00b2 Ti, where Ti is the target configuration for the defender i. If the attacker attacks a target j \u00b2 T while the configuration o is present, the expected value for a defender i is denoted by Uoi, while the value of the attacker is V \u00b2 j. In this model, we assume that the usefulness of each player depends only on the target under attack and its security configuration. (Kiekintveld et al al al al al al al al al al al, 2009; Letchobek & 2012) We assume that the probability of the attack only depends on the previous three models."}, {"heading": "3.5 The Weakness of Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium", "text": "By far the most important solution in Stackelberg's security games is a Strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE). An SSE is characterized by the assumption that the attacker breaks ties in his favor. If there is a single defender, this is well-defined and perfectly reasonable if the defender can pursue a mixed strategy: A slight adjustment in defense policy forces the attacker to strictly prefer the desired option without disadvantaging the defender. To see specifically what goes wrong, consider the example in Figure 1. In this example, however, there are two defenders, one of whom defends the target on the left, while the other defends the target on the right, because we need to specify which defender is preferred. To see specifically what goes wrong, consider the example in Figure 1. In this example, there are two defenders, one of whom defends the target on the left, while the other defends the target on the right."}, {"heading": "3.6 Solution Concepts", "text": "Since the classic (two-player) SSE solution concept is used in Stackelberg security games that do not refer to a single defender, we need to consider an alternative. One option is to calculate an arbitrary subgame perfect balance. However, a natural balance rule is that the attacker chooses a random answer to all common defense policy questions. We call the appropriate solution concept (that is, we want to establish a balance rule). A natural balance rule is that the attacker chooses a target."}, {"heading": "4. Equilibrium Analysis of Independent Multi-Defender Security Games", "text": "In this section we will consider scenarios in which the values of targets among defenders are independent and homogeneous. Our equilibrium and price-of-anarchy analysis will show that a Nash equilibrium among defenders in the two-tier game model (equivalent to ASE) does not always exist, even if defenders apply randomized strategies (i.e. probability distributions over target protection levels). In cases where there is no Nash equilibrium, we will use the approximate Nash equilibrium (ASE) and the associated () price of anarchy."}, {"heading": "4.1 The Baseline Model", "text": "Our first result sets necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a Nash balance among defenders in the baseline model = > q = q = q = q = q = q = q = 1. In the baseline model, the Nash balance only exists if all targets have the same coverage probability. Otherwise, a defender who is likely to be attacked has the incentive to reduce his qj. To find the Nash balances, we only need to consider strategy profiles where all targets have the same coverage probability. If all defenders have the same coverage probability, each defender has the incentive to reduce their qj. To find the Nash balances, we only need to consider strategies where all targets have the same coverage probability."}, {"heading": "4.2 The Multi-Target Model", "text": "Armed with observations from the model with a single target for each defender, we now extended the model to a case not as now < < c) in the literature in a theoretical light: each defender protects a set of k targets. This leads to a number of possible decisions for each defender, so even calculating an optimal answer is not necessarily easy. It is noteworthy that we are able to characterize equilibrium and approximate balances in this setting. Evidence for this subsection is in Appendix.Our first result is almost a mirror-image of the corresponding result in the baseline model: when a Nash equilibrium exists, all defenders protect all of their targets with probability 1.Theorem 4. In the multi-target model, Nash equilibrium exists if and only if and if. In this equilibrium, all targets will most likely 1.Next, we will consider scenarios in which there is no equilibrium."}, {"heading": "4.3 The General Model", "text": "Both the basic and multi-target models are identical."}, {"heading": "5. Analysis of Interdependent Multi-defender Security Games", "text": "A crucial step in calculating (or approaching) a Nash balance in a game is to consider the problem of calculating the best answer for any player (in our case defender, since the attacker's best answer is simple). Next, we develop a novel mixed-integer programming formulation for calculating the best answer to ASE, and then propose a highly effective heuristic method of approaching ASE in multi-defender games."}, {"heading": "5.1 Computing Defender Best Response: A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Formulation", "text": "While ASE seems a very natural alternative to SSE even in two-player security games, we are not aware of any proposals for its calculation."}, {"heading": "5.2 Approximating ASE", "text": "Previously, Vorobeychik and Wellman (2008) presented a convergent equilibrium approximation algorithm based on simulated annealing (SA) that would be applicable in our environment; they also demonstrated in the simulation that SA is actually surpassed by a simple heuristics based on iterated best response (IBR) dynamics; here, we interpret IBR as a local search heuristically, with the property that if the starting point is a Nash equilibrium, IBR will never deviate from it (i.e., Nash equilibrium is a fixed point); clearly, then the choice of a starting point can be significant for IBR's performance, which makes it natural to consider coupling it with random restarts; our most important contribution in this section is the proof that IBR with random restarts is a highly effective equilibrium approximation approach that outperforms our environment (and outperforms several alternatives)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Analysis of Multi-Defender Games on Synthetic Networks", "text": "For our first set of experiments, we will use RIBR on 3 artificially created networks, with 40 samples for each parameter variation. First, we will illustrate and compare the results of our interdependent multi-defender game on artificial networks. We will use 3 commonly analyzed network structures: a network, erdo-re-nyi networks, and preferred connectivity networks. In all generated networks, there are 64 nodes or targets. For the latter two, we will use the Metis graphics partitioning software to divide the nodes (targets) among defenders. These software partition nodes to minimize connectivity between targets belonging to different defenders, a property that we expect them to hold together in real networks, due to efficiency considerations. We will start by considering average strategies as well as social welfare for the three different synthetic networks (network, erdo-re-probability, re-function probability, and cascade number)."}, {"heading": "5.4 Results on power grid networks", "text": "The network described above is probably the most \"artificial,\" in which both erdo-re-nyi and preferred investment models have been developed to resemble real networks (especially the latter, which aim to replicate the scale-free characteristics of the observed networks). What is surprising, however, is that the approximate equilibrium results applied to three snippets of the actual power networks are most similar to the phenomena seen in Figure 8. In particular, over-investment in security seems to dominate, even with relatively high interdependencies, but only when decentralization is significant, while most levels of decentralization are near optimal (these are in Figure 8)."}, {"heading": "5.5 Security and Network Centrality", "text": "Finally, we consider the relationship between the centrality of the network and the strategic choice of a node. The results shown in Figure 10 show the centrality of the proximity of each node and the corresponding security in 10 cases for each network. If the interdependence of the networks is low, the security investments seem to correlate quite strongly with the proximity in synthetic networks: in other words, more central nodes invest more in security. A similar relationship can be seen in the nodes. However, this correlation largely disappears with greater interdependence, probably because the difference between a node and two nodes is distant from an attacked node (i.e. being a low-connected neighbor of a highly-connected node), in such a case, is considerably less.In the case of power networks, the correlation between centrality and strategy remains even at higher cascade probabilities. This relationship can be considered by comparing the strategy profile in the second column of Figure 9 and the proximity of p = 0.7 for the electricity network."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have expanded the current state of Stackelberg security games to include multiple defenders in non-cooperative scenarios with independent and interdependent objectives. In the independent case, we have provided complete characterizations of Nash and approximate balances, socially optimal solutions, and the price of anarchy (PoA) for three models of different generalities. Our analysis showed that defenders generally protect the targets, but different modeling assumptions lead to qualitatively different results: a simpler model leads to an unlimited PoA, whereas a more general model PoA converges to a constant as the number of defenders increases. In the interdependent case, we have developed a novel calculation framework to overcome the difficulties of a precise formal analysis of such a complex model. Our simulations describe a wide range of strategic constraints, varying cascade probability, network structure, and system decentralization. In contrast to the independent models, our results are dependent on the strength of our networks, and the behavior of our security investments."}], "references": [{"title": "Network security and contagion", "author": ["D.

These models primarily focus on isolated systems where only one defender is present, despite being part of a more complex system with multiple players. Furthermore, many real systems such as transportation networks and the power grid exhibit interdependencies between targets and, consequently, between decision makers jointly charged with protecting them. In order to understand such multi-defender strategic interactions present in security, we investigate game theoretic models of security games with multiple defenders. Unlike most prior analysis, we specifically focus on the situations in which each defender must protect multiple targets, so that even a single defender\u2019s best response decision is, in general, highly non-trivial. We start with an analytical investigation of multi-defender security games with independent targets, offering an equilibrium and price-of-anarchy analysis of three models with increasing generality. In all models, we find that the defenders have the incentive to over-protect the targets, at times significantly. Additionally, in the simpler models, we find that the price of anarchy is unbounded, linearly increasing both in the number of defenders and the number of targets per defender. Considering interdependencies among targets, we develop a novel mixedinteger linear programming formulation to compute a defender\u2019s best response, and make use of this formulation in approximating Nash equilibria of the game. We apply this approach towards computational strategic analysis of several models of networks representing interdependencies, including real-world power networks. Our analysis shows how network structure and the probability of failure spread determine the propensity of defenders to overor under-invest in security.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
