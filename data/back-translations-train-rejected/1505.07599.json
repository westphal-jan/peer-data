In recent years, word segmentation and POS tagging have undergone a major development, and the popular method is to treat these two tasks as sequence marking problems [7, 5] that can be treated with monitored learning algorithms such as Maximum Entropy (ME) [1], Perceptron [2], Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [3]. After years of intensive research, Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging are achieving quite high precision, but their performance for the practical requirements for analyzing Chinese texts, especially informal texts, is not as satisfactory. The main reason for this is that most commented corpora Xiv: 150 5.07 599v 3 [cs.C Lau's message texts are not able to work well with texts outside the text domains.

Each character is referred to as one of {B, M, E, S} to indicate segmentation. {B, M, E} represents the beginning, middle, end of multi-character segmentation, and S represents one-character segmentation. In common word segmentation and POS tagging, the state-of-the-art method is also based on cross-labeling sequence learning that avoids the problem of error propagation and can achieve higher performance in both subtasks [4]. Each label is the cross-product of sequence labeling and a tagging label, e.g. {B-NN, I-NN, E-NN, S-NN,...}. Characteristics are generated by position-based templates at character level. (Sequence labeling is the task of assigning labels y = 1, y1)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Chinese word segmentation", "text": "In terms of word segmentation, the best performances are 95.12, 95.52 and 96.65 for closed, semi-open and open tracks.

Currently, a simple system is available at http: / / nlp.fudan.edu.cn / nlpcc2015. The system also gives the leaderboards the latest results among the various tasks and tracks.
