[1] Formal, logic-based approaches, on the other hand, do not allow new knowledge to be easily learned, since they depend on people codifying it. [2] Neither semantic networks nor formal logical approaches treat the meaning of concepts and phrases well. [3] More importantly, the aforementioned representations do not contain quantitative, computer-interpretable information about the concept and relationship of internal structures. [4] We assume that it is practically impossible to work with the meanings of concepts and phrases, and therefore severely restricts the capabilities of software."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "The meaning of the word and the way in which it is used are significant."}, {"heading": "3 Approach overview", "text": "The approach is based on blurred logic, as it is a very good tool for working with different levels of truthfulness and concepts with unclear boundaries, phenomena that often occur in knowledge from natural language, and common sense in particular [10]. All knowledge is encoded in blurred properties (with values from zero to one), each of which encodes an independent piece of information. Contexts and context hierarchies are used to structure knowledge and model its context sensitivity. Context is defined as a coordinate system: If N is the number of independent properties in a given context, it means that the context contains N axes, and knowledge in that context is described as a blurred region in a N-dimensional unity. We model phrases, words, and other fragments of natural language as a region that we call meaning operators."}, {"heading": "4 Basic concepts", "text": "This chapter is an informal introduction to the concepts and ideas that we will later use to define what we mean by \"meaning\" and how they can be used in the process of interpreting phrases."}, {"heading": "4.1 Properties, context and regions", "text": "In this case, it is as if it is a matter of a pure \"yes,\" a \"yes,\" a \"yes,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"yes,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"yes,\" a \"yes,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"yes,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"no,\" a \"\" no, \"a\" \"yes,\" a \"\" yes, \"\" a \"yes,\" a \"\" \"yes,\" a \"\" \"a\", \"a\" a \"a\", \"a\" a \"a\", \"a\" a \"a\" a \",\" a \"a\" a \",\" a \"a\" a \"a\", \"a\" a \"a\" a \",\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \",\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \",\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\", \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \"a\" a \""}, {"heading": "4.2 Operators", "text": "Regional transformations or operators will play a key role in our model. This section is an example of two simple operators that illustrate how we can use operators to create new concepts. We can define the operator that does not match the word \"not\" as: () = 1 \u2212 where x is the value of the property (fig. 4-5). This is similar to Zadeh's \"addition\" [7: 10]. Using the operator \"not\" we can define a new concept as \"slow\" (fig. 4-6) (fig. 4-6). If we trace it back to our reference context, we get: (,) (fig. 4-7). We can define \"very\" something like this: () = 2 (fig. 4-9).

According to the interpretation, the state will change, and with it its projection on that context. Let's call this new projection region R1. Well, if the source state were S2, the resulting state would also be different according to the interpretation, say R2.

When a new phrase comes into play, we can do the following: First, as far as possible, the syntactic structure of the phrase is obtained from the grammatical forms of the words. In practice, this means determining the sequence of use of operators and block operators to each other. In the case that this structure is ambiguous, we must remember the possible options so that we can compare them later on based on their intelligibility (6,3), and select the best option. Afterwards, we must exert sequential use of operators on each other. More specifically, the operators that modify the internal context of another operator do so (which results in a block operator), while the operators that work only with the external context of the narrative (e.g. phrase context) form a line, in the order of application. The result is phrase operator: composition of multiple block operators that are later applied to the narrative context by the operators."}, {"heading": "6.2 Polysemy and homonyms", "text": "In the case of homonyms (when words are used in very different contexts), the correct meaning can be recognized almost immediately by comparing the axes of the internal context of the word with the axes of the current context. In the case of similar meanings, the internal contexts of the words will be quite similar. Then, we must take all possible meaning operators for the word and \"test\" them as part of the phrase operator, selecting the one that best satisfies the comprehension criteria. It would be best if we normally store such similar meanings as a \"fuzzier\" operator instead of storing separate meanings as separate operators, otherwise there is a risk that too many variants of the phrase meaning will arise (if the phrase contains several such words with polysemy involved)."}, {"heading": "6.3 Assessing comprehension", "text": "In this section, we will describe some techniques and ideas used to determine whether a statement or phrase makes sense, and choose which of the possible interpretations makes the most of it. We can start by trying to define several heuristics to identify them in the context of our concept."}, {"heading": "7 Composing descriptions", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7.1 Abstract concepts", "text": "In 4.1 and 5.4, we have examined how derived concepts (concepts defined by other concepts) are expanded, leading to simpler concepts (defined by basic system parameters). Now, let's look at how the system can derive new concepts that allow the operation of abstracting.Consider two operations we can perform on a region (or an operator).The first is \"blurred,\" which reduces the accuracy of the boundary definition for the region (or operator).The other is dimensionality reduction: the projection of that region onto a specific subspace (or the restriction of an operator to that subspace). In both cases, we reduce the amount of information used to define the region (or operator)."}, {"heading": "7.2 Describing with words", "text": "In this case, most of them will be able to move to another world, where they will be able to move to another world, where they will be able to move to another world, where they will be able to move to where they are."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions", "text": "We have described our approach to working with semantic information, which allows us to define the meaning of words and phrases and formulate criteria for the intelligibility of texts. This possibility potentially enables our system to learn new words using texts intended for people (dictionaries, encyclopaedias, etc.) as long as a certain minimum vocabulary is available. By using the same types of sources, learning can then be verified. For example, if a newly learned word has a known synonym, we can verify the proximity of the corresponding meaning operators. Similarly, meaning operators can be verified, which can be derived from the definitions given in different dictioners.A separate advantage of the method is the ability to express a situation or concept known to the system in words. It can enable a more productive dialogue with a user, and a fuller awareness of the difficulties that the system presents is tangible."}, {"heading": "9 Summary", "text": "In this introductory article, we have tried to take some modest steps in this area and describe our approach and ideas. Obviously, a lot of research and experimentation needs to be done before it is possible to evaluate any results. However, we would like to emphasize that the approach described in this article has certain advantages over the known and widespread ones. Semantic net-like representations can relatively easily absorb new knowledge, but the relationships between words contain very little quantitative information. Other systems, such as those based on different logical formalities, encode information in detail, but require human work to enter and edit rules, and do not really treat uncertainty and inaccuracy well. None of the presentations attempts to model the concepts for \"what they are,\" and do not capture their essence in quantitative form. This limits the capabilities of these approaches when it comes to complex understanding and related tasks (such as participating in a dialogue)."}], "references": [{"title": "What's in a Link: Foundations for Semantic Networks", "author": ["W.
