METHODOLOGY", "text": "Deep Learning (feature learning or representation learning) is a new era of machine learning that aims to acquire the high-level features of raw data in order to achieve better performance in classification tasks. Deep Learning is part of a field of machine learning methods based on the representation of data [23].Raw data (e.g. an image) can be presented in many ways using various handmade characteristics. Feature Learning seeks to learn discriminatory features autonomously, which is one of its advantages. The other advantage of feature learning is that the learning process can be completely uncontrolled. One of the goals of deep learning is hierarchical feature extraction. To achieve this goal, Feature Learning seeks to learn a new representation of the input data that is the observed data, and to continue to learn new representations of previously learned characteristics at each level that are able to reconstruct the original data."}, {"heading": "A. Autoencoder", "text": "One of the unsupervised learning methods is the autoencoder algorithm. Unlike traditional neural networks, autoencoders are not able to determine the learning weights of the individual layers."}, {"heading": "B. Convolution and Pooling", "text": "This property shows that not all attributes are useful. It is obvious that more attributes lead to an increase in computational complexity, especially in a classification task. To avoid high computational complexity, redundant data was neglected by capturing and merging random ranges of raw data. After obtaining merged attributes, one can use the pooling method to obtain merged attributes. These merged attributes can be used for classification tasks (Figure 4)."}, {"heading": "IV. PROPOSED SYSTEM", "text": "One of the most important problems in the verification of signatures is the shift of characteristics due to different difficulties in the verification of signatures, such as differences between the same user signatures, different circumstances of the signature, different forms of signatures, etc. Among them, the use of an uncontrolled learning method leads to an improvement of system compatibility with different types of signatures and automatic selection of characteristics from signatures. The proposed signature verification system consists of three steps: feature learning, single-class classification and verification (Figure 5). In the first step, the so-called feature learning, characteristics are learned from the autoencoder. In this step, an unlabeled data set is used, which is discredited from traction and test data sets. In the classification step, a reference model of the system is built on classified data from the user's reference signatures. These two steps are part of the system tracing [Finally, the new working step is classified by the system]."}, {"heading": "A. Preprocessing", "text": "As already mentioned, the first step in the pre-processing phase is the normalization of the signature size. This goal can be achieved by scaling the signature size. In the next step, the mean value of the data for the normalization of the data must become zero. Signature data in databases are based on time, pressure, pen up / down, etc. in x / y positions. In order to resemble the representation of reality, signature points have been continued.This goal was achieved by using the time of the points to observe the sequence of the data and pen up / down to check if the pen has gone up / down, the point must be separated from the next one. Finally, the signatures have been presented on two levels: pressure and time (Figure 6).Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an algorithm that can reduce the dimensions of the signature data and use it to significantly accelerate the unattended features. Since the system is trained on signature imaging, highly correlated pixel values are adjacent."}, {"heading": "B. Feature Learning using Autoencoder", "text": "To learn characteristics from signatures, a low-percentage linear autoencoder was used, the signature was set for input and output, and the autoencoder was checked for maps of input and output. This autoencoder was designed on the basis of gradient differences.Unmonitored learning algorithms have high computing costs.To increase learning performance, raw data (large patch of a signature) was divided into small patches and used as input in the feature learning phase. Afterwards, learned characteristics were linked to large patches. After attaining characteristics by folding, the method of Mean Pooling was used to obtain summarized characteristics, and these pooled characteristics were used for classification."}, {"heading": "C. Classification", "text": "The main problems of classification in this type of problem are differences between the signatures of the same user, different circumstances of the signature, small number of signatures and forged signatures. To solve such problems, the selection of a suitable classifier is very important. The one-class classifier in the proposed system has a target class, that is the class of the user whose signature is compared with the input signature, and the outlier class are the sample signatures of other users. Consequently, the classifier must create a target class model for each user."}, {"heading": "V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "In the evaluation process of the proposed approach, test signatures were summarized by comparing their characteristics with reference signatures. In this section, benchmarks and evaluation parameters are briefly described. In addition, three steps of the proposed system are explained."}, {"heading": "A. Benchmarks", "text": "This year, the time has come for us to put ourselves in a position to lead the way into the future."}, {"heading": "B. Evaluation Parameters", "text": "Below is a brief description of the most commonly used parameters. 1) Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve A single-class classification can be evaluated on the basis of small fractions false negative (wrong reject rate) and false positive (wrong acceptance rate).The ROC curve shows how the fraction false positive varies for different fractions false negative. Traditionally, the fraction true positive is plotted against the fraction false positive. The smaller these fractions are, the more this single-class classifier is to be preferred. 2) Equal Error Rate (EER) When a line connects the points (1, 0) and (0, 1) in the ROC curve of a classifier, EER can be defined so that false positive and false negative fractions are equal. This parameter is an easy method to compare system accuracy. The smaller the EER rate, the more accurate the system is. 3) Under the ROC curve, the fraction (ROC value) between false fractions and negative fractions is summarized."}, {"heading": "C. Feature Learning", "text": "In the feature learning phase, a methodology was defined to learn features based on a signature set, except for test and traction sets. Therefore, all signatures in the ATVS database were used for feature extraction using autoencoders (Figure 10).The autoencoder consists of a hidden layer with 2000 nodes and the limited Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm (L-BFGS) with 700 iterations for minimization."}, {"heading": "D. Classification and Verification", "text": "During this phase, SVC2004 and SUSIG databases were used for a real validation process that was used to categorize tensile and test signatures. Several experiments were conducted to obtain the best values for system parameters, and the size of the hidden layer and iteration value were selected based on an experiment with the hidden size of 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 nodes, in which the iteration value was set from 100 to 700. Results were shown in Table 3 and Table 4."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "This paper introduces a new approach based on self-thought learning to verify the signatures. As can be deduced from experimental results and inherited characteristics of self-thought learning, the proposed system is independent of specific benchmarks, which means that it is invariable in the form of the signature. The characteristics used to verify the signatures were extracted from the ATVS dataset using a sparse autoencoder with a hidden layer. By applying folding and pooling methods, the system has achieved combined characteristics to verify the signatures. In addition, a single-class classifier has been used while modeling the signatures of each user. To compare with similar work, two standard benchmarks called SVC and SUSIG datasets have been used. Our results have shown that the superiority can be tested on both datasets."}], "references": [{"title": "Automatic Signature Verification: The State of the Art", "author": ["D. Impedovo", "G.

Signature verification is one of the most common biometric methods with techniques that employ various specifications of a signature. Recently, deep learning has achieved great success in many fields, such as image, sounds and text processing. In this paper, deep learning method has been used for feature extraction and feature selection, which has enormous impact on the accuracy of signature verification. This paper presents a method based on self-taught learning, in which a sparse autoencoder attempts to learn discriminative features of signatures from a large unlabeled signature dataset. Then, the features learned are employed to present users\u2019 signatures by creating a model for each user based on user genuine signatures. Finally, users\u2019 signatures are classified using a one-class classifier. The proposed method is independent on signature datasets thanks to self-taught learning. The features have been learned from 17,500 signatures (ATVS dataset) and verification process of the proposed system is evaluated on SVC2004 and SUSIG signature datasets, which contain genuine and skilled forgery signatures. The experimental results indicate significant error reduction and accuracy enhancement in comparison with state of the art counterparts.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
