Ideally, the Knowledge Base is the repository for all the information collected from this collection. Most KBP work focuses on large, heterogeneous text collections, such as Wikipedia or the Internet, which contain a variety of topics, each of which has its own set of relevant entities, types of facts, spellings, etc. This variability and diversity is one of the things that makes linking, relationship identification, and other tasks difficult."}, {"heading": "2 Interactive Knowledge Base Population", "text": "This year, more than ever before in the history of the city, where it is as far as ever before, it is a place where it is a place, a place where it is a place, a place where it is a place, a place where it is a place, a place where it is a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place where it is a place, a place, a place, a place where it is a place, a place where it is a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a place, a, a, a place, a place, a"}, {"heading": "3 Relation to Existing Work", "text": "Since 2009, the Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population (TAC KBP) workshops have been running contests on linking companies (identify the speaker of a named company mentioned), filling slots (given a company and a relationship, you will find strings-weighted elements that complete the relationship) and Cold Start (combine the two previous tasks without providing KB). Cold Start is most similar to IKBP in that they both begin with an empty KB. They differ in that TAC focuses on large text bodies and expects offline processing, rather than under the supervision of a user. Nevertheless, an online optimization system Cold Start could be the heart of an ICBP system. Another parallel workline is the Text Retrieval Conference on Knowledge Base Acceleration (TREC KBA) workshop. Vital Filtering evaluates how well a system can link documents into a large document stream."}, {"heading": "4 Our Work on IKBP", "text": "This year, more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a city and in which it is a country."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "IKBP is a new variant of KBP that is tailored to long-term, focused information analysis, gathering knowledge from a user's workflow while providing an opportunity to add a rich structure to their summary reports. Many previous work can be expanded to support IKBP systems. Many aspects of IKBP remain unexplored: the annotation interface, which can have a major impact on the success of an IKBP system; IKBP can benefit from more speculative conclusions based on a human loop, as users can write domain-specific inference rules; connecting IKBP across many users; and merging Pocket KBs is an open problem, and merging two clean Pocket KBs could provide a more reliable result than building a global KBs."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2015, "abstractText": "Most work on building knowledge bases has focused on collecting entities and facts from as large a collection of documents as possible.
