This paper studies distributive subalgebras of qualitative calculi, which are subalgebras in which (weak) composition distributives over nonempty intersections. It has been proven for RCC5 and RCC8 that path consistent constraint network over a distributive subalgebra is always minimal and globally consistent (in the sense of strong $n$-consistency) in a qualitative sense. The well-known subclass of convex interval relations provides one such an example of distributive subalgebras. This paper first gives a characterisation of distributive subalgebras, which states that the intersection of a set of $n\\geq 3$ relations in the subalgebra is nonempty if and only if the intersection of every two of these relations is nonempty. We further compute and generate all maximal distributive subalgebras for Point Algebra, Interval Algebra, RCC5 and RCC8, Cardinal Relation Algebra, and Rectangle Algebra.

Although very simple, the algorithm is able to take advantage of the thrift of problem cases and function very well. A key feature of CRC constraints is that any strong path that affects a consistent CRC constraint network is globally consistent.

The following theorem shows that the same variable elimination method can also be applied to constraint networks via a distributive subalgebra."}, {"heading": "5.2 Partial Path Consistency", "text": "Another efficient method of solving frugal boundary networks is the partial consistency (PPC) algorithms proposed by Bliek and Sam-Haroud.

(PPC has also solved qualitative spatial and temporal constraints [6,23], where the authors have proven that each PPC boundary network is always consistent across a maximum tractable subclass of IA or RCC8. (However, the boundary networks across these subclasses, the boundary capacity of PC on triangulated graphs and their completion are not identical.) In this section, we show that the response to boundary networks via distributed graphs is limited to their boundary capacity, their boundary capacity to PC and their boundary capacity."}, {"heading": "6 Further Discussion", "text": "In this section we discuss the relationship between distributing subalgebras and conceptual neighbourhood graphs (CNGs) [13] and the star distribution [20] of classical CSPs."}, {"heading": "6.1 Distributive Subalgebras and Conceptual Neighbourhood Graph", "text": "As we have seen, the classes of convex IA and RCC8 relationships are maximum distribution subalgebras of IA and RCC8, respectively.

An IA relationship is convex if it is an \"interval\" [\u03b1, \u03b2] containing all relations between its two endpoint relationships \u03b1, \u03b2 in CNG. The subclass of convex IA relations is exactly the maximum distribution subalgebra CIA. Similar idea applies to PA and RCC5 directly.

In [20], Montanari defined two different concepts related to distribution condition. One is a distribution condition that Xk exhibits, and the other is a star-shaped constraint network. The second concept is very similar to our distribution concept except that it only requires the relationships to form a closure of the network. A constraint network over a distributive subalgebra is always star-shaped, but it is not clear whether a star-shaped network always lies above a distributive subalgebra. As we have seen, relationships in a distributive subalgebra exhibit convexity in the Helly sense. In finite CSP, the convex constraints of the T [27] series and (the more general) tree convexes T are always above a distributive subalgebra."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a detailed discussion of the important concept of distributing subalgebra in a recent paper (15).

We have also proposed two neat properties of distributing subalgebras that are used for efficient reasoning of the large limited bounding networks. Future work will implement these two methods and compare them empirically by using real datasets.AppendixHere we give a detailed proof of the distributing subalgebras used for a qualitative calculation, the (6) and (7).

It has been proven for RCC5 and RCC8 that path consistent constraint network over a distributive subalgebra is always minimal and globally consistent (in the sense of strong n-consistency) in a qualitative sense. The well-known subclass of convex interval relations provides one such an example of distributive subalgebras. This paper first gives a characterisation of distributive subalgebras, which states that the intersection of a set of n \u2265 3 relations in the subalgebra is nonempty if and only if the intersection of every two of these relations is nonempty. We further compute and generate all maximal distributive subalgebras for Point Algebra, Interval Algebra, RCC5 and RCC8, Cardinal Relation Algebra, and Rectangle Algebra.
