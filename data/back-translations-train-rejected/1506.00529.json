The equivalence allows us to revisit incomplete preferences from the viewpoint of desirability and through the derived notion of coherent lower previsions. On this basis, we obtain new results and insights: in particular, we show that the theory of incomplete preferences can be developed assuming only the existence of a worst act---no best act is needed---, and that a weakened Archimedean axiom suffices too; this axiom allows us also to address some controversy about the regularity assumption (that probabilities should be positive---they need not), which enables us also to deal with uncountable possibility spaces; we show that it is always possible to extend in a minimal way a preference relation to one with a worst act, and yet the resulting relation is never Archimedean, except in a trivial case; we show that the traditional notion of state independence coincides with the notion called strong independence in imprecise probability---this leads us to give much a weaker definition of state independence than the traditional one; we rework and uniform the notions of complete preferences, beliefs, values; we argue that Archimedeanity does not capture all the problems that can be modelled with sets of expected utilities and we provide a new notion that does precisely that. Perhaps most importantly, we argue throughout that desirability is a powerful and natural setting to model, and work with, incomplete preferences, even in case of non-Archimedean problems. This leads us to suggest that desirability, rather than preference, should be the primitive notion at the basis of decision-theoretic axiomatisations.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Jun 2015 15:22:34 GMT  (87kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00529v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marco zaffalon", "enrique miranda"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.00529"}, "pdf": {"name": "1506.00529.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Desirability and the birth of incomplete preferences", "authors": ["Marco Zaffalona", "Enrique Mirandab"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 150 6.00 529v 1 [cs.A] 1 Jun 201 5We establish an equivalence between two seemingly different theories: one is the traditional axiomatization of incomplete preferences to equine lotteries based on the hybrid axiom; the other is the theory of desirable games of chance (limited random variables) developed in the context of imprecise probability, and which we extend here to deal with vector-rated games of chance.

In fact, A3 is designed in such a way that models will ultimately have to assign positive, low-value usefulness to all elements of cone C, or equivalent, to all games of chance in R. Remember that in the formulation based on R, beliefs and values are naturally represented as common by a set of M linear predictions that are formally equivalent to a set of probabilities (in the sense that not only probability but also usefulness is mathematically represented by a probability function).This allows us to clearly see that under A3 and strict preferences it is necessary for each round X to be countable: because R contains the positive games of chance, including the indicator functions of the subsets of round X; and a probability can assign a positive mass to innumerable events.

As a consequence, the presence of the worst result is in a minimal kind of way.So let us consider a coherent preference relationship at H \u00d7 H.

We will show that if a coherent preference relationship meets the strong Archimedean condition sA3, and that it actually induces finite, then the amount of desirable games of chance that there is a reasonable superset of strictly desirable games of chance.

Indeed, a decision-theoretical problem represented by a coherent quantity of R in L (B x) cannot actually be dissected while retaining the same information represented by R.

Like GK, he considers the case of finite spaces of possibilities and results; in contrast to them, he makes an axiomatization of weak preferences, that is, he uses a weak relationship rather than the strict preferences (relationship) that we have considered in this paper. He discusses this point in some detail in [21, section 4]. From the point of view of this paper, the distinction between weak and strict preferences is not too important: the reason is that there is an alternative formulation of desirability that assumes zero gambling to be desirable, and thus implicitly defines a weak preferential order (see [33, Appendix F]). In such formulation, the vague conditions D3, D4 are the same as before, so that we deal with the remaining two conditions."}, {"heading": "11.3.

They allow a countable space of rewards X and simple lotteries defined on such countable support as \u03c3-additive probabilities. (The space of possibilities is assumed to be infinite, but ultimately only finite divisions of what we can actually consider finite in their approach are used.) \"They allow sentences of expected usefulness that are not necessarily closed; therefore, their representation is richer than others thanks to the additional significance due to the precise treatment of the boundary of such sets.

This somewhat empty condition conflicts with our results in Section 6, so it is useful to take some time to delve into this question. we focus on the worst action that is the subject of our discussion in Section 6.A, that there appears to be problems with SSK Theorem 2.

independence axiom; the other is the theory of desirable gambles (bounded random variables) developed in the context of imprecise probability, which we extend here to make it deal with vector-valued gambles. The equivalence allows us to revisit incomplete preferences from the viewpoint, and with the tools, of desirability and through the derived notion of coherent lower previsions (i.e., lower expectation functionals). On this basis, we obtain new results and insights: in particular, we show that the theory of incomplete preferences can be developed assuming only the existence of a worst act\u2014no best act is needed\u2014, and that a weakened Archimedean axiom suffices too; this axiom allows us also to address some controversy about the regularity assumption (that probabilities should be positive\u2014they need not), which enables us also to deal with uncountable possibility spaces; we show that it is always possible to extend in a minimal way a preference relation to one with a worst act, and yet the resulting relation is never Archimedean, except in a trivial case; we show that the traditional notion of state independence coincides with the notion called strong independence in imprecise probability (stochastic independence in the case of complete preferences)\u2014this leads us to give much a weaker definition of state independence than the traditional one; we rework and uniform the notions of complete preferences, beliefs, values; we argue that Archimedeanity does not capture all the problems that can be modelled with sets of expected utilities and we provide a new notion that does precisely that. Perhaps most importantly, we argue throughout that desirability is a powerful and natural setting to model, and work with, incomplete preferences, even in the case of non-Archimedean problems. This leads us to suggest that desirability, rather than preference, should be the primitive notion at the basis of decision-theoretic axiomatisations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
