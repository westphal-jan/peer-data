Focusing on three different languages (English, Chinese and Japanese), this research analyses Weibo and Twitter accounts of major embassies and news agencies.

We then derive the amount of information that is actually contained in microblog posts authored by selected accounts on Weibo and Twitter. Our results confirm that languages with larger character sets such as Chinese and Japanese contain more information per character than English, but the actual information content contained within a microblog text varies depending on both the type of organization and the language of the post.

ARBITRARY CHARACTER LIMITS?", "text": "Microblogging platforms differ from traditional blogging platforms in that they have a limit on the length of posts. Such length restrictions are reported to reduce the time and thought needed to create new content and allow for a faster and more timely exchange of information. Indeed, most studies examining the impact of length restrictions on the user experience of microblogging do contain English-language content, but there is sufficient reason to believe that a universal length restriction on Twitter has different effects on people writing content in different languages. It has been reported by major media outlets such as the BBC [13] and Atlantic [29] that much more content can be expressed in languages other than English within a given character limit, notably Twitter's 140-character limit and the 140-byte limit on short message services (SMS or text messages). Chinese [2] and Japanese [33] are often cited as examples of more \"expressive\" languages within such spatial restrictions."}, {"heading": "1.1 Reasons for length limitations", "text": "In fact, most people who are looking for a new homeland have to look around them in another country, as if they were living in another country.

[20] The basic idea behind Liberman's research design was simple. Comparing the actual storage space of texts of the same content in different languages, one can see how much \"space\" is needed to store / transmit the same content. This idea is expressed by the following equation: SlangA \u00d7 IClangA = SlangB \u00d7 IClangB (1) 1This suggests that Sina Weibo imposes a byte limit on storing the same content in different languages, using the encoding of most English / Latin characters and two bytes for storing other characters."}, {"heading": "2. METHODS AND DATA SELECTION", "text": "We propose a systematic step-by-step approach that can be extended to other platforms, languages and types of microblogs, with the aim of answering our three main research questions. We focus on news and diplomacy accounts because we expect the length of messages to be an integral part of overall communication strategies, even in potential linguistic or intercultural scenarios. The data selection in this post is limited to two platforms, three languages and the recent contributions of 54 microblogs. However, as the first multiplatform and multilingual study, their contributions are important and lay the foundation for future work with additional account types, languages and platforms. The following sections describe the three steps of the research process, each of which answers one of our research questions: (a) how much can be said, (b) how much is typed and posted, and (c) how much is said in different languages by different organizations."}, {"heading": "2.1 Calculating the cross-lingual ratios of information content based on UDHR and TED talks", "text": "It is clear from what follows that this is a very complex and complex matter."}, {"heading": "2.2 Measuring the text lengths of posts from selected accounts from Twitter and Weibo", "text": "To measure the text length of the microblogs, we analyzed the contributions of 54 news and message organizations. For Twitter, we selected 36 accounts posted in either English, Japanese or Chinese. The most recent 200 tweets for each account were collected on January 22, 2015 via the Twitter REST API. For Weibo, we collected examples from a data intermediary called Weiboscope [7, 8], which provides uncensored and randomly sampled Weibo datasets. Initially, the data was collected by requesting the database for messages posted between January 1 and January 22, 2015. To ensure that the number of posts per account is large enough, we considered only accounts with more than 50 posts. Two Weibo accounts belonging to the World Bank and the Economist (with respective screen labels). \""}, {"heading": "2.3 Estimating the relative information content in a microblog post for cross-lingual comparison", "text": "2We remove URLs from posts before performing our length comparison. Hong et al. [15] found that tweets in different languages contained URLs with varying frequencies, but within our limited set of messages and news organizations, URLs are contained in tweets with similar velocity between the three languages we analyze. The majority of tweets we analyze in each language contained exactly one URL (67% of Chinese tweets, 69% of English tweets and 72% of Japanese tweets we analyze had exactly one URL).The analysis presented here strips URLs from all tweets and compares the results, but repeats the analysis only with tweets that contained exactly one URL yields nearly identical findings.After calculating the ratio of information content to length, we can then derive an estimate of the relative information content (RIC), as in Equation 3.RIClangA = SlangB ratio (B, long A = long A = long A, the long A is the long A, the long A equation is the long A)."}, {"heading": "3. FINDINGS", "text": "The results of the first subsection confirm that Chinese and Japanese contain more information per character.

Even within UTF-8, there are several ways to store accented characters and other characters, so that two pieces of text that appear identical to the user actually require a different number of bytes, which in UTF-8.Figure 3 summarizes the overall message length results (in characters) with box plots on Twitter. The left subplots show the results for Twitter, and the right subplots show the results for Weibo. The top subplots show the results for messages, and the bottom subplots show the results for news organizations. The average lengths of posts from English-language Twitter accounts (105 characters with URLs; 81 without URLs) show the \"ideal length\" of a company's 100 tweets, which is reported by marketing / engagement 71."}, {"heading": "3.3 How much is said: Comparing languages and organizations", "text": "By combining the two findings above, this last subsection derives the amount of information content in posts in different languages. Similar to Figure 3 in the layout, Figure 4 shows the estimated information content using the Chinese language (with sim-multiplied characters) as the starting point. In contrast to the average length of messages in Figure 4, the comparisons of information content show a clear pattern. Most Chinese-language microblog posts contain more information than posts in Japanese or English. In addition, posts on Sina Weibo often contain more content than posts on Twitter.We see greater variation between new organizations compared to messages that reflect differences in character lengths."}, {"heading": "4.
