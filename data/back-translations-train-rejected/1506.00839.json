(2000) on the Conciliation Committee, attempt to predict the best dialogue sequence for a particular conversation. However, our work focuses on detecting dialogue files during a conversation between a dialogue system and its interlocutor. In this scenario, such approaches are not useful as the system, although it may have expectations, cannot be certain how the conversation will develop. Therefore, we have opted for an approach based on prior and current information. As we want to assess the impact of context information on dialogue character recognition, we must be able to limit the amount of information provided. Instead of a sequential approach, such as HMMs or CRFs, we have opted for an approach based on SVMs that are already based on the state of the art approach used for this task (Gamb\u00e4ck, Olsson and T\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m 2011)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Evaluation", "text": "We use accuracy, i.e. the ratio between the number of correct predictions and the total number of predictions, as a benchmark of performance, as it has consistently been chosen as the benchmark for evaluating performance in the detection of dialog files. As there are no fully disclosed corpora training and test partitions, a rigorous comparative study is not possible. Therefore, we opted for 10-fold cross validation as a method of evaluation. However, in order to make comparisons with some of the related work, other fold numbers were also used. Nevertheless, the presented results, unless otherwise stated, were obtained by 10-fold cross validation. In order to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences between the multiple results obtained on the same data, we defined a significance level of 5% and performed the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (Wilcoxon 1945). Thus, if we say that a difference is significant / insignificant, it means that the p value of the test was below 5%."}, {"heading": "5.

(2000), Dielmann and Renals (2007) and Sridhar, Bangalore and Narayanan (2009) show that audio features can also provide important information for the dialog act classification task and are not affected by ASR errors. Therefore, it is our intention to conduct further experiments to investigate the ability of acoustic features to provide context information for dialog act identification. In view of the ASR, it would be interesting to analyze how WHO affects the performance of context characteristics. As we have manual transcriptions of the switchboard corpus, this can be done by generating automatic transcriptions of the same dialogues and observing the performance differences in relation to the ISO 24617-2 standard. Furthermore, it would be interesting to identify communicative functions on the other dimensions and assess whether the pre-aggregated segments may be considered important for the performance of our studies to include, finally, comprehensive information that is not considered important for performing them."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by national funds through the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia (FCT) with reference UID / CEC / 50021 / 2013, the Universidade de Lisboa and the EU-IST FP7 project SpeDial under contract number 611396."}], "references": [{"title": "Instance-Based Learning Algorithms", "author": ["Aha", "Kibler", "Albert1991]Aha", "David W", "Dennis Kibler", "Marc K.

This way, we were able to observe the influence patterns as the amount of context information increased. Our base features consisted of n-grams, punctuation, and wh-words. Context information was obtained from one to five preceding segments and provided either as n-grams or dialog act classifications, with the latter typically leading to better results and more stable influence patterns. In addition to the conclusions about the importance and influence of context information, our experiments on the Switchboard corpus also led to results that advanced the state-of-the-art on the dialog act recognition task on that corpus.
