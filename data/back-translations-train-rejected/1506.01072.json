Previous hybrid analog CMOS-memristor approaches required extensive CMOS circuitry for training, and thus eliminated most of the density advantages gained by the adoption of memristor synapses. Further, they used different waveforms for pre and post-synaptic spikes that added undesirable circuit overhead. Here we describe a hardware architecture that can feature a large number of memristor synapses to learn real-world patterns. We present a versatile CMOS neuron that combines integrate-and-fire behavior, drives passive memristors and implements competitive learning in a compact circuit module, and enables in-situ plasticity in the memristor synapses. We demonstrate handwritten-digits recognition using the proposed architecture using transistor-level circuit simulations. As the described neuromorphic architecture is homogeneous, it realizes a fundamental building block for large-scale energy-efficient brain-inspired silicon chips that could lead to next-generation cognitive computing.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Jun 2015 21:35:51 GMT  (1580kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01072v1", "This is a preprint of an article accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, vol 5, no. 2, June 2015, Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, IEEE Journal on, vol. 5, no.2, June 2015"], ["v2", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 20:32:49 GMT  (1190kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01072v2", "This is a preprint of an article accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, vol 5, no. 2, June 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "This is a preprint of an article accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, vol 5, no. 2, June 2015, Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, IEEE Journal on, vol. 5, no.2, June 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.CV cs.ET", "authors": ["xinyu wu", "vishal saxena", "kehan zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.01072"}, "pdf": {"name": "1506.01072.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["xinyuwu@u.boisestate.", "vishalsaxena@boisestate.edu;", "kehanzhu@u.boisestate.edu)."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they move, in which they move, in which they move, in which they move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live."}, {"heading": "II.

By cascading and / or stacking cross-bars, a large-area system can be constructed. Semiconductor technologies now offer vertical integration capability through silicon vilization (TSV) for multiple chips and 3D packages [67]. As discussed, the proposed neuromorphic system architecture uses only two basic building blocks: a secondary-mineral memristor and a versatile CMOS neuron that operates completely asynchronously.

For dynamic operation, the two-stage OpAmp is designed so that the output stage is divided into a branch and a small branch. The large branch provides high current, while the small low branch works with the first stage to achieve the desired gain. Two complementary signals \u03a6i and \u03a6f are used to distort the OpAmp in low current configuration by disabling the main branch during integration and discharge modes, while it can drive large currents in burning mode. As part of this work, we have modified a compact folding cascotopology [68] with an embedded split-class AB driver to realize a dynamically driven OpAmp."}, {"heading": "C.

If a potential firing is triggered by either the comparison output Vcpr or the monitored learning signal Vtch, the D-Flip-Flop (DFF) locks the immediate bus state and forwards it to \u03a6f.

STDP-Compatible Spike Generator", "text": "The shape of the action potential Vspk has a strong influence on the STDP learning function. A biologically similar STDP pulse with exponentially increasing edges is very difficult to achieve in circuits. However, a bio-inspired STDP pulse can be achieved with a simpler action potential form: a short, narrow positive pulse with high amplitude followed by a longer, slowly decreasing negative tail, as shown in Fig. 5C. This leads to an easy implementation and nevertheless implements an STDP learning function similar to the biological counterpart [20].

PATTERN RECOGNITION APPLICATION", "text": "As an important application of machine learning, optical character recognition (OCR) is widely used to demonstrate and evaluate patterns.

All spikes from the entered neurons spread through a synaptic memristor network to the output neurons. The summary of the input spikes causes a spike from a victorious output neuron in the WTA competition, which then spreads backwards and locally updates the weights of the entered neurons via a STDP learning guideline."}, {"heading": "V.

DISCUSSION", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper describes a homogeneous neuromorphic spiking system that combines the standard CMOS design of a novel silicon integrate-and-fire neuron with a memristor crossbar that can be realized in the nanosystem's advanced semiconductor technology. This system naturally integrates localized online learning and computing by incorporating STDP learning into the memristor synapses, with a winner-takes-all strategy among the local neurons. The CMOS neuron combines its circuit functions in a compact manner based on a single OpAmp using tri-mode operation. In addition, it allows a single terminal connectivity between a neuron and a synapse that fully utilizes the synaptic density increase achieved through the use of memristor crossbeam synapses. Supported by its reconfigurable architecture, a dynamic power supply neural scheme allows the neuron to connect to the neuron with a large number of neurofiber-inspired energy terminations, without requiring a large number of neurofibers."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their help in improving this work with their comments on the manuscript and the presentation of the results.

2015, "abstractText": "A neuromorphic chip that combines CMOS analog spiking neurons and memristive synapses offers a promising solution to brain-inspired computing, as it can provide massive neural network parallelism and density. Previous hybrid analog CMOS-memristor approaches required extensive CMOS circuitry for training, and thus eliminated most of the density advantages gained by the adoption of memristor synapses. Further, they used different waveforms for pre and post-synaptic spikes that added undesirable circuit overhead. Here we describe a hardware architecture that can feature a large number of memristor synapses to learn real-world patterns. We present a versatile CMOS neuron that combines integrate-and-fire behavior, drives passive memristors and implements competitive learning in a compact circuit module, and enables in-situ plasticity in the memristor synapses. We demonstrate handwritten-digits recognition using the proposed architecture using transistor-level circuit simulations. As the described neuromorphic architecture is homogeneous, it realizes a fundamental building block for large-scale energy-efficient brain-inspired silicon chips that could lead to next-generation cognitive computing.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
