A bicluster solution is a series of biclusters represented by B-Bi = (Bi) qi = 1 and contain q-Bicluster. A bicluster is maximum if and only if we cannot include any other object / attribute without violating the coherence threshold. If a solution does not contain maximum biclusters, the result is redundant, because there are biclusters that are part of larger Ones. Madeira & Oliveira [10] categorizes the types of biclusters according to their similarity patterns. They categorize the biclusters structure as biclusters."}, {"heading": "2.1 MicroCluster Aggregation", "text": "MicroCluster [9] is an enumerative proposal which, after the enumeration, comprises two further steps: these steps have the task of deleting or merging bicluster that are not substantially different from other biclusters. The first step is the deletion step. If we find a bicluster in such a way that the ratio of its surface covered by no other bicluster is less than one threshold in relation to its total surface, it can be removed. The second step is the merging step. Let us look at two biclusters and create a third by merging rows and columns of the previous two. If the ratio of the surface of the third bicluster that is not covered by any of the previous two is less than one threshold in relation to its total surface, we can combine the two biclusters into this third. In this method of aggregation, maximum biclusters are not removed in the deletion step, which does not interfere with the final result."}, {"heading": "2.2 Aggregation Using Triclustering", "text": "Since they have been able to improve the biological relevance of the Bicluster for microarray data [14], we will use this method as a contender in this paper. An important point in the overall result is that we want to combine the results that enhance the Bicluster, which seem to be important for several components, and discard those that can arise from noise. Due to the way the Bicluster algorithm handles the optimization step, non-maximum Biclusters can interfere with the end result. Bicluster aggregation differs slightly from Bicluster ensembles. While in ensemble tasks we discard Bicluster, which seem unimportant, and combine those that contribute most to the solution, in Bicluster aggregation we never discard a Bicluster solution."}, {"heading": "2.3 Other Aggregation Methods", "text": "Gao & Akoglu [12] used the minimum description length principle to propose CoClusLSH, an algorithm that returns a hierarchical set of biclusters, which can be considered an aggregation step based on the LSH technique as a hash function; candidates that are hacked on the same bucket are then aggregated until no merger improves the final solution; their work focuses on finding biclusters in a chessboard structure that does not allow for overlapping and is therefore not suitable for the kind of problem we are dealing with. Liu et al. [8] proposed OPC tree, a deterministic algorithm for preserving clusters (OP clusters), a general case of Order Preserving Sub Matrices (OPSM), are not suitable for the kind of problems we are dealing with."}, {"heading": "3 New Proposals for Aggregation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Aggregation with Single Linkage", "text": "With this solution, we transform each bicluster into a binary vector representation as follows: In view of the dimensions of dataset A, Rn \u00b7 m, each bicluster becomes a binary vector x of length n + m. For a bicluster B, which is transformed into the binary vector x, the first n positions represent the rows of dataset A, and if the bicluster contains the ith row, xi = 1, otherwise xi = 0. The last m positions represent the columns of dataset A, and if the bicluster contains the ith column, xn + i = 1, otherwise xn + i = 0. After this transformation, we use the hamming distance to apply the individual line arrangement to the existing biclusters."}, {"heading": "3.2 Aggregation by Overlapping", "text": "It seems intuitive to aggregate the biclusters with an overlap rate above a defined threshold. This proposal is based on aggregation by pairs: While we have two biclusters with an overlap rate above a given threshold, we remove them from the group of biclusters and include the result of the functional aggregates defined in Equation 2, taking these two biclusters as arguments. Letters B, C, D and E are biclusters. Note that for D = aggregates (B, C), ov (D, E) \u2265 ov (B, E) and ov (D, E) \u2265 ov (C, E). Therefore, the order of aggregation does not fit into the final result."}, {"heading": "3.3 Outlier Removal", "text": "After aggregating the results, we have to process each last bicluster to search for objects and / or attributes that can be interpreted as outliers. In this work, this step is always performed after aggregating with one of our two suggestions. Let B = (Br, Bc) be an aggregated bicluster, with | Br | = o, | Bc | = p. We define a participation matrix P, where each element pij indicates the number of biclusters that this element participates in. For example, if one element is part of 15 biclusters that B is composed of, then its value will be on the P matrix 15. Thus, we explain the process of outlier removal using Figure 1. We have two steps of outlier removal: one for the objects, the other for the attributes. To possibly remove outlier objects, we take the mean and the standard deviation of all columns on the partition matrix 1, which means that we view the whole page < 1."}, {"heading": "4 Metrics for Biclustering", "text": "In this paper, we will only be the leaders for the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the red the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green the green"}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "In our experiments we used three artificial datasets: art1, art2 and art3; and two real datasets: GDS2587 and FOOD.

Our proposals exceeded the algorithms compared to the first two artificial data sets and showed that they were more resistant to noise in the third artificial data set. We also checked whether aggregation could obtain enriched biclusters in the case of a gene expression dataset. For different values of the RIn Close algorithm, we could see that the different methods of aggregation produced very similar results. Finally, the main challenge of aggregation with a single link is to decide where to cut the dendrogram, but as we could see, this task was simply to distribute across the tested datasets. Except for triclustering, all aggregations returned only bicluster. Finally, we compared the recommended methods to the biclusters."}], "references": [{"title": "Biclustering of expression data.,", "author": ["Y. Cheng", "G.M.
