Introduction", "text": "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) deals with the automatic assignment of sentences in one human language to another human language. Therefore, it translates from the source language to the target language. SMT aims to analyze automatically existing human sentence translations in order to develop general translation rules. Machine translation has not yet been solved. A lot of research and development work is still needed to achieve the reliability of humans by providing a fluent translation as in humans. Therefore, a method was used to adjust the translation parameters and improve the translation quality."}, {"heading": "2. Literature Review", "text": "In general, many models have been used in machine translation for many years. SMT was the preferred approach for researching and developing machine translation systems within this period. In 2010, Rabeh Zbib conducted a study on how linguistic knowledge can be used in statistical machine translation at MIT, USA [1]. In 2007, Sarikaya and Deng published on common morphological-lexical language modeling for machine translation at the conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics about [2]. Rabih Zbib, Spyros Matsoukas, Richard Schwartz and John Makhoul.In 2010, James conducted a study on the use of lexical smoothing decision trees in statistical machine translation by [3]. Ahmed Ragab Nabhan and Ahmed Rafea in 2005 conducted a study on statistical machine translation parameters at the Central Laboratory for Agricultural Experts (CLAES)."}, {"heading": "3.

PROPOSED MODEL IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "The proposed model in this essay efficiently incorporates many models at different levels, namely: the language model, the alignment model, the phrase model, the reordering model, the translation model, and finally the tuning model. It was found that the benefits achieved from using these models are summarized as follows: The alignment models are used in statistical machine translation to determine the translation correspondences between words in a sentence in a language with words in a sentence with the same meaning in another language. Language models increase the efficiency of word alignment by using words depending on their context within the sentence. Phrase-based model increases the ability of the proposed model by handling words and their equivalents or phrases in both languages at the same time. It increases the effectiveness of this model by translating a group of contiguous words into one language by forming a final sequence of words in the other language."}, {"heading": "7. FUTURE WORK", "text": "The problem of machine translation is not yet solved. A lot of research and development is still needed to earn the reliability of humans by preforming a fluent translation like that of humans. Demand for faster and cheaper translation between languages will only increase with the need for information exchange between nations. Based on this work, future work and recommendations are expected as follows: Clustering is one of the most important techniques to be performed in the Arabic language to solve the tokenization problem. Clustering as a general approach to dealing with problems of language sparseness and morphological analysis is promising. Use large amounts of parallel corpus data to train the proposed model to achieve better results. Use large amounts of data for tuning from the same area of training data to achieve better tuning results. Every time this model is tuned, better results can be achieved so that it would be better to align it as possible. Use test data from the same area of training to achieve better neural results with other learning networks."}], "references": [{"title": "Zbib, \u201cUsing linguistic knowledge in statistical machine translation", "author": ["M.
