INTRODUCTION", "text": "Most current research now focuses on the field of mood analysis and opinion forming, as the number of Internet documents grows rapidly and the Internet has become an area full of important information, views and meaningful discussions. Social media, blogs, forums, e-commerce sites, etc. encourage people to share their opinions, emotions and feelings publicly, which are considered to be very valuable information in the decision-making process. Therefore, statistical studies to evaluate products, famous people and important topics are necessary and influential. SA is the computerized study of how opinions, attitudes, emotions and perspectives are expressed in text; in addition, it contains many methods and techniques that extract this type of evaluation information from large data sets [1]."}, {"heading": "SA can recognize the writer\u201fs feelings as expressed in positive", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules they have set themselves, and they are able to play by the rules they have set themselves."}, {"heading": "2. ARABIC LANGUAGE AND CHALLENGES", "text": "Arabic is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. According to the Egyptian Demographic Centre1, it is the native language of approximately 300 million people (22 countries).By 2013, there are approximately 135 million Arabic Internet users. The alignment of the script is from right to left and the Arabic alphabet consists of 28 letters. The Arabic alphabet can be expanded to ninety elements by writing additional forms, markers and vowels. Most Arabic words are morphologically derived from a list of roots, the tri, quad or pen-literal.Most of these roots are tri-literal. Arabic words are classified into three main parts of the speech, namely nouns, adjectives and adverbs, verbs and particles. In formal writing, Arabic sentences are often delimited by commas and periods.The Arabic language has two main forms: Standard Arabic anddialectal Arabic."}, {"heading": "3.

The selected data are executed under certain conditions: Feel, hold an opinion, MSA, Egyptian dialect, no insult, subjective and contained idioms or proverbs or idioms.

RELATED WORK", "text": "Some recent research has used the Idiom lexicon in their work, such as: Xiaowen in [29] build an opinion-forming system for customer reviews on eight (8) products using a lexicon-based approach. They found that most idioms express strong opinions, although their collection and annotation is time consuming. Song and Wang in [1] built an unattended sentiment classification for recognizing and extracting Chinese idioms from the text. They collected 24395 Chinese idioms and selected 8,160 instances labeled with positive and negative classes to construct their Chinese idiom lexicon."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this essay, we introduced AIPSeLEX, an idiom / proverbs sentiment lexicon of modern Arabic and Egyptian standard dialects for the classification of feelings (SA). We report on the manual efforts made to create the first version of the AIPSeLEX lexicon, using many idioms / proverbs derived from various websites and books specialized in this field. In view of the complexity, costly and time-consuming manual collection and annotations, only 3632 idioms and proverbs are commented on. In addition, the techniques and methods for testing the reach and quality of the lexicon, which have reached a coverage of more than 90%, are explained. Experiments and studies have proven that this lexicon will improve the process of classification of feelings, and this is what has already been achieved. In fact, the lexicon is now used in the Arabic sentiment analysis system (under development) and we believe that it will be very useful."}, {"heading": "6. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] XSong and W.

Consequently, In order to facilitate the task of detection and classification of lexical phrases for automated SA systems, this paper presents AIPSeLEX a novel idioms/ proverbs sentiment lexicon for modern standard Arabic (MSA) and colloquial. AIPSeLEX is manually collected and annotated at sentence level with semantic orientation (positive or negative). The efforts of manually building and annotating the lexicon are reported. Moreover, we build a classifier that extracts idioms and proverbs, phrases from text using n-gram and similarity measure methods. Finally, several experiments were carried out on various data, including Arabic tweets and Arabic microblogs (hotel reservation, product reviews, and TV program comments) from publicly available Arabic online reviews websites (social media, blogs, forums, e-commerce web sites) to evaluate the coverage and accuracy of AIPSeLEX.
