Translation has been a common method of expanding knowledge of different languages in Wikipedia. The editorial activity of the 46 most linguistic editions of Wikipedia shows that 25% of edits by multilingual users are for the same article in different languages (Hale, 2013).There is no need to use any tool to translate Wikipedia articles. c \u00a9 2015 The Authors. This article is licensed under a Creative Commons 3.0 license and is conducted mainly by experienced Wikipedia editors. There have been many attempts to develop tools to support the translation of articles. In this essay we present a new approach to support translation, which has been designed taking into account the unique needs of Wikipedia articles and their community."}, {"heading": "2 Previous work", "text": "There was no such solution for the translation of Wikipedia articles. The first group consists of companies such as Google and Microsoft, but also of smaller companies and researchers. The other group of tools was created only for the translation of Wikipedia articles, mostly by volunteers. Among the earliest tools are Google GTT and Microsoft WikiBhasha, which use their own MT services (Garc\u0131 a and Stevenson, 2009; Kumarana et al., 2011). Later, Casmacat provides professionals and researchers (Alabau et al., 2013) and CoSyne for multilingual MediaWikis (Xiner et al., 2012), as opposed to Wikipedias, which provides a foreign language.Common J for professionals and researchers (Alabau et al., 2013) with what they all integrate into the website (Alabau et al., 2013) and what they need: 1YY2 or another website."}, {"heading": "3 Designing the translation experience", "text": "The design of CX was designed to improve the existing processes that users followed in translating. In accordance with the principles of user-centric design (Norman and Draper, 1986), we organized regular user research sessions to (a) better understand the needs of users during the existing translation process and (b) validate new ideas to improve this process."}, {"heading": "3.1 User research", "text": "We recruited 106 participants through a survey. From their responses, we identified dictionaries (76% of respondents used them) and Wikipedia (60%) as their most commonly used translation tools. MT (53%), spell checking (48%) and glossaries (42%) were also widely used. Less than 6% of participants mentioned tools specifically aimed at translating Wikipedia articles, such as those described in Section 2, and no tool was mentioned by more than one participant. We organized 16 research sessions. Sessions were organized in two parts. In the first part, contextual exploration techniques were used (Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1998) to observe user behavior during translation and identify their needs.The second part was a usability test study (Nielsen, 1994) to evaluate different design ideas in the form of prototypes."}, {"heading": "3.2 Design principles", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules that they play by the rules, and they will have to play by the rules that they play by the rules in order to play by the rules that they play by the rules."}, {"heading": "4 WYSIWYG implementation", "text": "Parsoid5 is a Wikimedia project that implements a second parser for Wikitext. In order to follow the principle of the translation principle, we offer only limited editing and formatting options and, by the way, a lot of complexity of the Wikipedia article structure 5https: / / www.mediawiki.org / wiki / Parsoidan without negatively affecting the translation process. CX is the first translation tool to provide a WYSIWYG editor that uses the commented HTML provided by Parsoid. Some MT services do not support HTML input nor offer reordering of information. Preservation of the markup is an essential prerequisite for CX, as the customization of the wiki text and editing of WYSIWYG are based on the markup. We have developed an algorithm that can reconstruct the information by performing additional work on the MT."}, {"heading": "5 MT evaluation", "text": "We use the subjective evaluation of MT quality for a specific language pair to decide whether to include an MT service for a language pair in the tool. To evaluate an MT for a specific language pair, we ask potential future users of the tool to translate articles that use it and say whether it is useful to them or not. We run an MT service on our servers using the open source project Apertium (Forcada et al., 2011), but we also support other MT providers."}, {"heading": "6 Evaluation", "text": "Currently, the tool is only available to self-selected users (most of them experienced editors), so the results cannot be generalized to the entire community. Further studies on the resulting quality over a long period of time will be helpful. The low deletion rate for articles created with CX suggests that there are no major quality issues. In three months in which the tool was introduced as an opt-in feature, 900 articles were published with CX, with an overall deletion ratio of less than 1% across all languages, which is lower than the deletion rate for all new articles. We found that there is a significant difference between the number of articles created in different target languages Wikipedias, which cannot be explained by the number of active users, the number of available articles that need to be translated, nor by the availability of MT. In three months, for example, the Catalan Wikipedia saw 455 articles collected through translation from Spanish using CX, but both in English-language Wikipedia."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "CX is a computerised translation tool with a WYSIWYG editor and automatic link adaptation. CX supports several different MT providers, but the integration of the Open Source Apertium project has enabled us to quickly provide MT for multiple language pairs. We have developed MT training and tracking capabilities to address community concerns about the prevalence of low-quality translations.
