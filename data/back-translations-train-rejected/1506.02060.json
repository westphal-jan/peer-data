Choosing a measure of similarity or distance for any field of research is not trivial [8,10]. Since Zadeh proposed Fuzzy Sets [11], many scientists have conducted research on similarity measurements between fuzzy sets [9,12]. Other similarity measurements are suggested for Atanassov intuitionist fuzzy sets as a generalization of fuzzy sets [2, 3, 7]. In this paper, a new measure of distance between fuzzy sets [ba and then for bipolar fuzzy sections [9,12] is presented. Based on the new distance, the similarity of bipolar fuzzy sets has been defined as a generalization of fuzzy sets."}, {"heading": "2 The fuzzy sets and its extensions", "text": "Under the Zadeh theory [11], a blurred set A in X is characterized by the membership function] 1.0 [: X. The non-membership function] 1.0 [: X is achieved by denial, and thus both functions define a division of the unit, namely: 1 (2,1) Atanasov has extended the blurred sentences to the intuitionist blurred sentences [1]. Atanasov has loosened the condition (2,1) to the following inequality: 1 (2,2) He has used the third function, the uncertainty index, which confirms the equality: 1 (2,3) In the same way, instead of (2,1) we can consider the following condition: 1 (2,4) Thus we obtain the paraconsistent blurred set [6] and we can define the index of contradictions: 1 (2,5) There is a blur between ABBA, a blurred BA between two blurred units (2,4) and one (1,7)."}, {"heading": "In formulae (2.6) and (2.7), the symbols \u201c  \u201d and \u201c \u201d", "text": "The complement cA for the BFSA is defined by the formulas: AAAAcc (2.8) The dual dA for the BFSA is defined by the formulas: AAAAdd11 (2.9) The negation nA for the BFSA is defined by the formulas: AAAAnn11 (2.10) If A is an intuitionist fuzzy set, then dA and nA are paraconsistent fuzzy sets, and if A are paraconsistent fuzzy sets, then dA and nA are intuitionist fuzzy sets.
