[15] The proposed units of measurement for the similarity / dissimilarity are calculated within the framework of a pentavalent representation of knowledge. The presented formulas describe the entropy / syntropy for a single element belonging to a bifuzzy group. For one sentence, we must sum up the entropy / syntropy of all of its elements. The proposed measure for entropy reaches its maximum for elements in which the membership function of the non-member function equals. The structure of entropy offers the advantage that we are immediately able to indicate possible reasons for the lack of information: the inconsistency, the disambiguity, the disambiguity, the lack of distinction between membership / non-membership and their disambiguities.

Similarly, instead of (2,1) we can consider the following condition: 1AA + revolts (2,4).

For 4 classes, we cannot consider the center of the square in which the entropy of the fuzzy set has its maximum value.

De Luca and Termini [13] have introduced some requirements for the entropy of fuzzy sets. Szmidt and Kacprzyk have extended these requirements from fuzzy sets to intuitionist fuzzy sets. Kosko [11] has proposed measuring the blur of fuzzy sets. We have extended these requirements from fuzzy sets to intuitionist fuzzy sets."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, a method for presenting polyvalent knowledge was presented and a pentaval logic based on five values was presented: true, false, incomplete, contradictory and ambiguous. On the basis of this logic, we obtain new representations for bifuzzy sets. These new representations provide formulas for entropy and syntropy of bifuzzy sets. This approach provides a vector structure with three components for entropy and two components for syntropy. However, the proposed measure is in line with the classical entropy for standard fuzzy sets."}], "references": [{"title": "Intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 20, pp", "author": ["K.
