We denote a variable by a capital letter (e.g., A) and a state or value of that variable by the same letter in lowercase (e.g., a). We denote a series of variables by a bold letter or letter (e.g., X). We use a corresponding bold lowercase letter or letter (e.g., x) to denote an association of state or value with each variable in a givenset. We use calligraphic letters (e.g., G, E) to denote statistical models and graphics. A Bayesian network model for a set of variables U is a pair (G, III). G = (V, E) is a directed acyclic graph for short - or DAG consisting of nodes in one-to-one correspondence with the variables and directed edges that connect it."}, {"heading": "3.1 Greedy Equivalence Search", "text": "In fact, most people are able to determine for themselves how they have behaved, and that they are able to determine for themselves."}, {"heading": "4 SELECTIVE GREEDY EQUIVALENCE SEARCH", "text": "In this case, it is a matter of a mere \"manoeuvre of distraction,\" a \"manoeuvre of distraction,\" a \"manoeuvre of distraction,\" a \"manoeuvre of distraction,\" a \"manoeuvre of distraction,\" a \"manoeuvre of distraction,\" a \"manoeuvre of distraction,\" a \"manoeuvre of distraction,\" a \"manoeuvre of distraction,\" a \"manoeuvre of distraction,\" a \"manoeuvre of distraction,\" a manoeuvre of distraction, \"a manoeuvre of distraction,\" a manoeuvre of distraction, a manoeuvre of distraction, a manoeuvre of distraction, a manoeuvre of distraction."}, {"heading": "4.1 LARGE-SAMPLE CORRECTNESS", "text": "Theorem 2.

In our experiment, we used an oracle scoring function. In particular, our scoring function calculates the minimum description length assuming a data size of five billion records, but without the need to collect data. To estimate the cost of running each algorithm, we counted the number of scoring functions that are required for calculating the expected log losses. This allows us to capture near asymptotic behavior without the need for data."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "Through our selective greedy equivalence search algorithm SGES, we have shown how to use graph-theoretical properties to reduce the need for score graphs during score-based search using equivalence classes of Bayesian networks. In addition, we have shown that for graph-theoretical complexity properties such as maximum clique size, maximum number of parents and V-width, we can guarantee that the number of score ratings is polynomial in the number of nodes and exponential in these complexity measurements. The fact that we can selectively select operators for each hereditary and equivalent invariant graph-theoretical property provides the ability to explore alternative complexity measurements. Another candidate complexity measurement is the maximum number of vstructures. Although the corresponding property does not limit the maximum size of a clique in H, it directly limits the size of H | H for each operator."}, {"heading": "A Additional Background", "text": "In this section we use NonDeHY to denounce the non-descendants of Y."}, {"heading": "B Proofs", "text": "In this area, we are only able to take a series of measures which provide evidence of the A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A A-A A A"}], "references": [{"title": "Learning factor graphs in polynomial time and sample complexity", "author": ["Pieter Abbeel", "Daphne Koller", "Andrew Y.
