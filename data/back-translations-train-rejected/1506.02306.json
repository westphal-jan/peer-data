In the end, they merely quantified formality by means of deixis (percentage difference between deictic and non deictic parts of the speech), which we henceforth refer to as\" F-score. \""}, {"heading": "2.2 Implicature", "text": "A second problem with Heylighen and Dewaele's Fscore is that it is unreliable on small documents, such as sentences and statements (cf. Lahiri et al., 2011). It is therefore interesting to examine whether the implicit implication of the F score implicitly correlates with the human notion of formality at the judgment level (cf. Section 4.2). But perhaps more importantly, it shows a major limitation in the formulation of the F score: it is based only on Deixis and does not take into account the amount of implications contained in a judgment (cf. Section 4.2). It is true that as we add more context to a document (or sentence), it tends to become longer. The opposite is also true: as we see the examples of Potts (2012), the importance of formality has been recognized in the language generation (Hovy, 1990; Abu Sheikha and Inkpen, 2011)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Informativeness", "text": "We will test this hypothesis by testing whether the formality of a sentence positively correlates with its informativeness (Section 4.2). Interestingly, Carston (1998) came to a similar conclusion independently: \"Principles of informativeness... lead to a strengthening or narrowing of the encrypted meaning of the enunciation.\" While Carston's specific reasoning was tied to scalar implications, it is not very far-fetched to see that the same argument would de facto also lead to a deep formality such as Heylighen and Dewaele have. It can be noted that the word informativeness has different connotations in different contexts (in the machine translation community, for example, the word informativeness is a kind of fidelity to be applied to the text."}, {"heading": "3 Corpus Creation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data", "text": "Our data comes from the groundbreaking study by Lahiri et al.

Note from Figure 1 that our body as a whole is dominated by high informativity, medium to high formality, and midi-implication sentences. As our implication sentence is less reliable than the other two evaluations (see Section 3.2), it is relatively unclear whether this midi-implication trend is a real phenomenon or rather a reflection of the central tendency bias among commentators - who, without better choice and interpretation, chose mediate values for the implication sentences. Central tendency in implicit reality and medium in implicit manner. Also, for the three individual genres - news, blog, forums - is observed. The news genre is dominated by high informativity, and in the middle to high-formality sentences are very informative (also blogs are mostly high formality and medium to high informational sentences)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Relationship with Others", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own, and most of them are able to survive on their own; most of them are able to survive on their own, and most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "4.3 Sentential Make-up of Documents", "text": "In our last experiment, we examined how the sentences in a document differ in terms of formality, implication and informativeness - starting with the first sentences, then the middle and finally the last. We divided the sentences into ten consecutive containers (deciles) based on their position in the document and measured the mean formality, informativeness and implication per decile. The results - averaged across all documents of a particular genre (blog, forums, news as a whole) - are presented in Figure 2. Figure 2 also shows the default errors for each decile.Note from Figure 2: News sentences are the most formal and informative, followed by blog sentences, followed by forum sentences. In terms of formality and information trends, news sentences begin with a high formality and informativeness, then gradually decrease in both - perhaps reflecting the fact that in journalistic writing at first few sentences contain the most information (to attract readers \"attention), and the information content thereafter greatly decreases."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we introduced a data set of 7,032 sentences that were evaluated for formality, informativeness, and implication on a scale of 1-7 by human commentators on Amazon Mechanical Turk. To our knowledge, this is the first major annotation effort that combines all three pragmatic variables at the sentence level. We measured the reliability of our annotations by conducting two independent annotation rounds on MTurk and verifying the correlation between the averages between the two rounds. We further investigated the correlation of our annotations with pilot sentence formality annotations conducted in a more controlled setting (Lahiri and Lu, 2011). It was observed that while formality and informativeness can be reliably annotated on a scale of 1-7, implications represent a much more difficult challenge. We analyzed the distribution of formality, informativeness, and implication in three genres (news, blogs, and forums), and found the overall relationship between the documents to be significant - as well as the differences in relation to the human documents."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Rada Mihalcea for their support; MTurk commentators for their comments; Eduard Hovy and Julian Brooke for their valuable discussions; Haiying Li and Nina Dethlefs for their inspiration and record; Francis Heylighen and Jean-Marc Dewaele for their kindness and brilliant ideas, including the I score; and finally, but most importantly, Xi-aofei Lu for his continued encouragement, warm intellectual guidance, excellent advice and camaraderie, solid ideas in the early stages of the study and great help with thought processing.
