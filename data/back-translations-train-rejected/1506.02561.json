A CNF formula \u03a6 is a conjunction (VP) of clauses where a clause is a disjunction (VP) of letters. A letter is a positive (P) or negated (VP) propositional variable. The two letters p and p are called complementary. A CNF formula can also be considered a set of clauses, and a sentence as a set of letters. Let's mention that any propositional formula can be translated to CNF using linear Tseitin's coding [22]. We denote by V ar (DP) the set of position variables that occur in theory. A Boolean interpretation B of a propositional formula is a function that associates a value B."}, {"heading": "3 Frequent Itemset Mining", "text": "Formally, we define the problem of mining common item sets (FMI for short) in the following way. A transaction database is a finite set of items where the attribute tid refers to a unique item set. We say that a transaction (tid, I) supports an item set J if J'I. The coverage of an item set I in a transaction database D is the amount of transactions in D that I support: C (I, D) = {(tid, J). Support of an item set I in D is defined as the size of its coverage: S (I, D) = | C (I, D) |.Let D is a transaction database that supports I: C (I, D)."}, {"heading": "4 A SAT Encoding of Frequent Itemset Mining", "text": "In this section, we describe the SAT encodings for itemset, which are mainly based on the encodings proposed in [12]. [12] To do this, we must perform the SAT encoding (the SAT encoding) on the basis of the SAT encoding (the SAT encoding of the SAT encoding) on the basis of the SAT encoding (the SAT encoding of the SAT encoding). [14] The SAT encoding of the SAT encoding (the SAT encoding of the SAT encoding) is based on the use of propositional variables that represent the items and their covers. [16] Specifically, for each element a (resp.), we associate a propositional variable (resp.)."}, {"heading": "5 Enumerating all Models of CNF Formulae", "text": "One naive way to expand modern SAT solutions to the problem of enumerating all models of a CNF formula is to add a blocking clause to prevent the search for the same model again. This approach is used in the majority of model enumeration methods in the literature. The main limitation of this approach concerns spatial complexity, as the number of blocking clauses can be exponential at worst. In fact, in addition to the clauses learned in each conflict by the CDCL-based SATsolver, the number of blocking clauses added is very important for problems with a huge number of models. This explains why it is necessary to develop methods that avoid the need to keep all blocking clauses."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "Dre rf\u00fc ide f\u00fc die f \u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die f\u00fc die"}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we investigated the impact of modern SAT solvers on the problem of enumerating all models of CNF formulas for encoding common closed item sets in mining. Our goal is to measure the impact of classical components of CDCL-based SAT solvers on the efficiency of model enumeration. Our results suggest that for formulas with a large number of models, SAT solvers need to be adapted to enumerate all models efficiently. We demonstrated that the simple DPLL solver, supplemented by classical Jeroslow Wang heuristics, performs better. As for future work, we plan to continue our investigations to find the best heuristics for enumerating models of data mining problems."}], "references": [{"title": "Rodriguez-Carbonell.
