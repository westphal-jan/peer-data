We describe two algorithms for this task: one based on density estimation, and a novel algorithm benefiting from solid theoretical guarantees and with a very favorable running-time complexity of $O(n S \\log (n S))$, where $n$ is the sample size and $S$ the number of slots. Our theoretical guarantees are more favorable than those previously presented in the literature. Additionally, we show that even if bidders do not play at an equilibrium, our second algorithm is still well defined and minimizes a quantity of interest. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply learning algorithms to the problem of reserve price optimization in GSP auctions.

However, as the name suggests, this mechanism generalizes the standard second price auction of Vickrey (1961) to several points. However, in the case of sponsored search engine advertising, these items correspond to the advertising revenue ranked by their position. In light of this ranking, the GSP auction works as follows: First, each advertiser submits a bid; second highest topic based on the bids assigns each bidder a score assigned to the slot in the best position, that is, the one with the highest probability of being clicked on. The second highest score is awarded to the object and so on until all advertisers have been assigned or all advertisers have been assigned to a slot. As with second price auctions, the payment of the bidder is independent of his bid."}, {"heading": "2 MODEL", "text": "For the most part, we will use the model defined by Sun et al.

We will adopt the common assumption that cs > cs + 1 (Gomes and Sweeney, 2014; Lahaie and Pennock, 2007; Sun et al., 2014; Thompson and Leyton-Brown, 2013).

If it is chosen too low, the seller may lose some revenue. On the other hand, if it is set too high, advertisers cannot bid above this value and the seller will not receive any revenue from the auction. Mohri and Medina (2014), Pardoe and CesaBianchi et al. (2013) have provided learning algorithms that estimate the optimal reserve price for a second auction in various information scenarios. The scenario we are looking at is closely related to that of Mohri and Medina (2014), but extending this work to the GSP auction is not easy."}, {"heading": "4 LEARNING ALGORITHMS", "text": "Here, we present and analyze two algorithms for determining the optimal minimum price for an APS auction when advertisers play a symmetrical balance."}, {"heading": "4.1 DENSITY ESTIMATION ALGORITHM", "text": "First, we derive an extension of the algorithm of Guerre et al.

In fact, in an efficient equilibrium, it is not difficult to verify whether the bidder must be assigned to the highest rating of the S-th. Therefore, a bidder is assigned to the s-highest rating of position s if and only if s \u2212 1 bidder have a higher rating and p a lower value.For a rank-by-bid auction, Gomes and Sweeney (2014) showed the following results.

Although it is necessary for advertisers to play in balance for our algorithm in order to converge to optimality when bidders do not play a balance, our algorithm is still well defined and minimizes a quantity of interest when it has a smaller set.

Our theoretical guarantees are more favorable than those previously presented in the literature. Additionally, we show that even if bidders do not play at an equilibrium, our second algorithm is still well defined and minimizes a quantity of interest. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply learning algorithms to the problem of reserve price optimization in GSP auctions. Finally, we present the first convergence analysis of empirical equilibrium bidding functions to the unique symmetric Bayesian-Nash equilibrium of a GSP.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
