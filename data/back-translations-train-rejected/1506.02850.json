To cope with this issue, a common countermeasure is the usage of cheap but wide-ranged sensors, able to detect suspicious events that occur in large areas, supporting patrollers to improve the effectiveness of their strategies. However, such sensors are commonly affected by uncertainty. In the present paper, we focus on spatially uncertain alarm signals. That is, the alarm system is able to detect an attack but it is uncertain on the exact position where the attack is taking place. This is common when the area to be secured is wide such as in border patrolling and fair site surveillance. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Patrolling Security Game model where a Defender is supported by a spatially uncertain alarm system which non-deterministically generates signals once a target is under attack. We show that finding the optimal strategy in arbitrary graphs is APX-hard even in zero-sum games and we provide two (exponential time) exact algorithms and two (polynomial time) approximation algorithms. Furthermore, we analyse what happens in environments with special topologies, showing that in linear and cycle graphs the optimal patrolling strategy can be found in polynomial time, de facto allowing our algorithms to be used in real-life scenarios, while in trees the problem is NP-hard. Finally, we show that without false positives and missed detections, the best patrolling strategy reduces to stay in a place, wait for a signal, and respond to it at best. This strategy is optimal even with non-negligible missed detection rates, which, unfortunately, affect every commercial alarm system.

Motivation scenarios", "text": "In large environments, continuous monitoring is not affordable, while concentrated alarm-triggered inspections are more convenient. Real-world applications include monitoring large infrastructure by drones [19], detecting wildfires with CCD cameras [20], monitoring agricultural fields [21] and monitoring based on wireless sensor networks [22], and border patrols [23]. In practice, alarms are affected by detection uncertainties, such as missed detections and false alarms, and localization uncertainties (even as spatial), such as the alarm system being uncertain about the exact target being attacked. In summary, we describe two practical safety issues that can be attributed to this category. We report them as examples and present features and requirements that our model can adequately handle. In the rest of the work, we will inevitably adopt a general stance, but we encourage the reader to consider these two cases as real-world applications for our model."}, {"heading": "1.1.1. Fight to illegal poaching", "text": "Poaching is a widespread environmental crime that puts wildlife at risk in several regions of the world. Its devastating effects make the development of surveillance techniques to compare these types of activities one of the most important topics in national and international debates. Poaching typically occurs in vast and wild areas, making it costly and ineffective to rely solely on sustained patrols by ranger squads. To address this problem, recent developments have focused on equipping rangers with environmental monitoring systems to better plan their inspections and focus them on areas with high probability of detecting a crime. Such systems include the use of drones flying over the area, alerted fences and sensors on the ground that attempt to detect abnormal activity. In all of these cases, technologies are designed to function as an alarm system: Once the illegal activity is detected, a signal is sent to the ranger base station that is unable to detect, for example: http / securit..org / a"}, {"heading": "1.1.2. Safety of fair sites", "text": "Trade fairs are large public events attended by thousands of visitors and where the problem of ensuring security for the host facilities can be very difficult. Expo 2015, the most recent world exhibition in Milan, Italy, estimates an average of around 100,000 visitors per day. This is due to the need to carefully address security risks, which may also arise from planned vandalism or terrorist attacks. In addition to security patrols, the exhibition halls are often equipped with locally installed surveillance systems. Expo 2015 employs about 200 barrier gates and 400 metal detectors at the entrance of the site. Internal areas are constantly monitored by 4,000 surveillance cameras and 700 security guards. If one or more of these devices / employees detect a security breach, a signal is likely to be sent to the control room, along with a limited request for intervention. This approach is necessary because, especially in this type of environment, a security breach can be detected and neutralised, with very different tasks."}, {"heading": "1.2. Alarms and security games", "text": "While the problem of managing a sensor network to optimally guard safety-critical infrastructure in restricted areas has been studied, e.g. [24], the problem of integrating alarm signals along with hostile patrolling is almost entirely unexplored; the only work that can be classified within this framework is [25]. The paper proposes a skeletal model of an alarm system in which sensors do not exhibit spatial uncertainty in detecting attacks on individual targets. Authors analyze how sensory information can improve the effectiveness of patrol strategies in harsh environments. They show that if sensors are not affected by false negatives and false positives, the best strategy dictates that the patrol driver merely responds to an alarm signal without patrolling the environment. Consequently, the model treatment in such cases becomes trivial. On the other hand, if sensors are affected only by false negatives, the treatment can be carried out by a simple variation of the algorithm for the case without sensors."}, {"heading": "1.3.

Time is discredited in curves. We define T-V as the subset of meaningful vertices that must be called targets that must be protected from possible attacks. Each target t-T is characterized by a value-value characterized by a value index (0, 1) and a penetration time d (t), which measures the number of turns needed to complete an attack.

However, this reduction keeps the size of the game tree exponentially within the parameters of the game, especially O (T).6 The exponential size of the game tree does not prove that finding the equilibrium strategies of an SRG-v requires exponential time in the parameters of the game, because it does not exclude the existence of some compact representation strategies of D."}, {"heading": "3.2.

The algorithm we present in this section lists all coverage sets and also returns the corresponding coverage costs for each of them. Initially, we observe that we can limit our attention to a certain coverage class that we consider appropriate to pursue each target. Definition 10 (Proper Covering Set) While in the worst case, the number of correct coverage sets is equal to the number of coverage sets (consider, for example, fully linked graphs with uncommon coverage costs) in realistic scenarios, we expect the number of coverage sets to be much smaller than the number of coverage sets that we expect for the number of coverage sets (consider the number of fully connected graphs with uncommon coverage costs)."}, {"heading": "3.2.2.

Our goal is to design a polynomial time algorithm that generates a polynomial number of good coverage routes. We observe that if we have a total order of the coverage routes and we work on the complete targets where each edge corresponds to the shortest route, we can find in polynomial time the maximum coverage routes that are subject to the constraint that any pair of targets t, \"in a route, t\" can precede a route."}, {"heading": "3.3.

These variables contain closed capture routes, namely captured routes that cannot be extended further without violating the penetration time of at least one target during the visit. CLmax contains the capture routes returned by the algorithm (step 8 of algorithm 3), while CLmin is used for truncating as discussed below.

surveillance of every area is not affordable. To cope with this issue, a common countermeasure is the usage of cheap but wide\u2013ranged sensors, able to detect suspicious events that occur in large areas, supporting patrollers to improve the effectiveness of their strategies. However, such sensors are commonly affected by uncertainty. In the present paper, we focus on spatially uncertain alarm signals. That is, the alarm system is able to detect an attack but it is uncertain on the exact position where the attack is taking place. This is common when the area to be secured is wide such as in border patrolling and fair site surveillance. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Patrolling Security Game model where a Defender is supported by a spatially uncertain alarm system which non\u2013deterministically generates signals once a target is under attack. We show that finding the optimal strategy in arbitrary graphs isAPX\u2013hard even in zero\u2013sum games and we provide two (exponential time) exact algorithms and two (polynomial time) approximation algorithms. Furthermore, we analyse what happens in environments with special topologies, showing that in linear and cycle graphs the optimal patrolling strategy can be found in polynomial time, de facto allowing our algorithms to be used in real\u2013life scenarios, while in trees the problem is NP\u2013hard. Finally, we show that without false positives and missed detections, the best patrolling strategy reduces to stay in a place, wait for a signal, and respond to it at best. This strategy is optimal even with non\u2013negligible missed detection rates, which, unfortunately, affect every commercial alarm system. We evaluate our methods in simulation, assessing both quantitative and qualitative aspects.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
