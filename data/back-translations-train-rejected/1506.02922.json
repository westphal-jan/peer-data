We consider the task of automatically generating feedback summaries for students describing their semester-long performance in the laboratory of a computer science module. 9 learning factors have been identified that contribute to students \"learning: (1) grades, (2) hours studied, (3) comprehensibility, (4) difficulties, (5) deadlines, (7) personal problems, (8) lectures attended and (9) revision (Gkatzia et al., 2013). Analysis by Gkatzia et al. (2013) showed that there are four ways to refer to a learning factor: 1. < Trend >: Description of the trend, 2. < Weeks >: Description of what happens at a time stamp, 3. < Average >: Mention of the average or 4. < other >: a general statement."}, {"heading": "2 Multi-label Classification", "text": "The classification refers to the identification of a category l from a series of disjunct categories L (with | L | > 1) to which an instance belongs, given the characteristics of the instance.

If the learning task is referred to as multi-class classification, then it is referred to as a task in which the classifier can associate a running area as good, bad or ok. In the Multi-Label Classification (MLC), the instances are specified with a series of labels Y L (Tsoumakas et al al al al al al al., 2010)."}, {"heading": "3 Evaluation", "text": "We compare our approach to four meaningful baselines: DT (Decision Trees) (no history): 29 classifiers were trained, each of which is responsible for each template. History is not taken into account (see Figure 1). DT (with predicted history): 29 classifiers were also trained, but this time the input included the previous decisions of the previous classifiers (i.e. history) and the set of time series data to mimic the dependencies in the dataset (see Figure 2). Majority Class: It designates each instance with the most common template. DT (with real history): A modification of the previous approach, but the real expert values were used in the model for the story instead of the predicted one."}, {"heading": "4 Results and Conclusions", "text": "MLC - RAkEL (Gkatzia et al., 2014) achieves higher accuracy, precision, retrieval and F score compared to (1) DT (no history), where each template is independently predicted by a separate classifier, (2) DT (with predicted history), where the decision of the previous template is taken into account in the next decision, similar to classification chains, and (3) a majority class basis. This method is powerful due to its ability to take into account data correlations (Gkatzia et al., 2014).
