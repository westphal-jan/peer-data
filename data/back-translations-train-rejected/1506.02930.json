It follows that this method can solve any problem (provided the problem has a finite solution), although the time required, depending on the number of candidates for solving it, is usually enormous. Therefore, blind search is a universal but not an effective method if there are too many candidates for solving it to be checked individually. Solomonoff (1986) used a probability theory theorem in his general problem-solving system, which states that if an appropriate sequence could be imposed on the candidates for solving a problem, then checking them in that sequence would probably provide the optimal problem-solving strategy. Theorem 2.1 (Solomonoff, 1986) Let m1, m2, m3... be candidates / ideas that can be used to solve a problem. Let pk be the probability that the candidate mk will solve the problem, and let tk be found the minimum time required to test this candidate and then the candidate can generate a \u2212 the solution."}, {"heading": "3 Cognitive mechanisms related to the effective human problem", "text": "In this section, we propose a list of six cognitive abilities or mechanisms that, we argue, essentially help humans to develop the appropriate candidate ideas for solving (partial) problems in an effective sequence and in a short time. So, in our opinion, these are the mechanisms that justify the effectiveness of human problem-solving and, as such, should be implemented in cognitive architecture.Proposal 3.1. The following processes (mechanisms, capabilities) are related to the effectiveness of human problem-solving (with respect to theorem 2.1, in particular to the second point of Conclusion 2.2): 1. Discovery of similarities 2. Discovery of relationships, connections and associations 3. Generalization, specification 4. Abstraction 5. Intuition 6. Context sensitivity and the ability to focus and forget"}, {"heading": "3.1 Discovering similarities", "text": "Hypothesis 3.2. Similar problems often have similar solutions.The arguments for this hypothesis in 1993 can also be found in Case-based Thinking (Slade, 1991; Kolodner, 1992) - a process of solving new problems on the basis of solving similar past problems. A general case of looking for similarity between problems is when the solver identifies a set of problem concepts (properties, features, structure,...) on the basis of which he can quickly access similar concepts stored in his memory, associated with an idea of how to solve a known problem. In such a case, the new problem and the known problem are similar across this set of concepts. According to Hypothesis 3.2, this process provides relevant solution candidates with relevant solution candidates and vice versa, which are not similar to the current problem in this way. With respect to Theorem 2.1 and Corollsolution 2.2, the solutions of similar (and therefore relevant) problems with high probability have a high probability value."}, {"heading": "3.2 Discovering relations, connections, associations", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "3.3 Generalization, specification", "text": "In the case of generalization, the problem concepts are replaced by more general, more abstract versions. In addition, some (specific) parts of the problem (e.g. some limitations of problem solving or non-important details) can be omitted. Consider, for example, the gravitational force between the Earth and an apple - Newton generalized this relationship to the force between two physical objects (by omitting the peculiarity of the original objects). More generally, one new problem and one known about a number of concepts are similar, and the solution of the known problem can help the solver to solve the new one (see the upper part of Section 3.1). However, for some reason, the solver may not be able to discover this similarity at 3http: / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Zebra _ Puzzle, on February 28, 2015."}, {"heading": "3.4 Abstraction", "text": "Hypothesis 3.4. Problems with the same grit / core probably have the same or similar solution. Abstraction is the ability to see a problem in simplified, abstract, general concepts (terms), i.e., the construction of the problem object or core that represents what the problem is really about (as far as the knowledge, experience of the solver and his cognitive abilities allow). Consider, for example, a problem where two cyclists 50 miles apart race at constant speeds of 18 miles per hour and 22 miles per hour at each other. A fly swirls back and forth between the noses of the cyclists until it is shattered when the cyclists collide. How far did the fly travel before it died? This problem becomes very simply \"distance = speed x time\" problem when we abstract from the shape of the fly. Abstraction extends to the level of discovery of similarities."}, {"heading": "3.5 Intuition", "text": "By intuition, we mean something similar to a preschooler learning a grammar; the child can mostly apply the rules correctly, but cannot formulate them. However, the rules are stored in the child's memory in some accessible way. Therefore, intuition is based on the ability to find similarities and / or relationships (connections, associations), with the only difference that the solver cannot now articulate the reasons for this. Thus, intuition and the discovery of similarities and relationships (connections, associations) participate for the same reasons in the cognitive realization of the second part of episode 2.2."}, {"heading": "3.6 Context sensitivity and the ability to focus and forget", "text": "Concepts in the memory of the solver generally have many associations (Ohlsson, 1992). Each of these associations is a potential clue to the problem, and thus a contender for a solution. However, it can happen that only a few concepts are really relevant to the solution - those that do not fit the context or the problem situation are unlikely to be part of the solution and should therefore not be considered preferentially (although they can later be taken into account in problem-solving if nothing else works). Cognitive skills that block these seemingly incoherent concepts help to increase the effectiveness of problem-solving because candidates (which are represented by concepts) with little chance of success are unable to impede candidates with higher potential. The act of not remembering these probably incoherent concepts and information can be interpreted as giving them a low probability of success (which is partially consistent with Theorem 2.1)."}, {"heading": "3.7 Final remarks", "text": "It follows that each of these cognitive mechanisms contributes to the effectiveness of the solution of human problems in terms of the innate quality of these mechanisms and the knowledge and experience base of the solver (according to the logical conclusion 2.2). However, the effectiveness of the general human problem solving process depends on the extent to which these cognitive mechanisms are involved in this process. In other words, if these cognitive mechanisms are sufficient for general problem solving (i.e., if there is no other decisive mechanism of which we know little), the solution of human problems guided by these cognitive mechanisms would be effective in the expected case, according to Solomonoff. On the other hand, the order in which the solver tests the candidates found does not exactly correspond to the Solomonoff order of Theorem 2.1. This depends on the knowledge and experience of the solver, on the quality of his cognitive abilities and on his system to choose between several alternatives \u2212 this differentiates from the problem solver from the or2.1."}, {"heading": "4 General human problem solving mechanisms", "text": "The topic of this section is mechanisms that are necessary and probably sufficient for the successful solution of human problems in general (see below), because the mechanisms described in the previous section, even if applied during problem solving, may not be the whole story. Specifically, if we want to look at these general problem-solving mechanisms in general, then we need to determine what mechanisms are actually used in this process. Once this has happened (see Propositions 4.5 and Hypothesis 4.6), we can compare these general problem-solving mechanisms with the effective cognitive mechanisms from Proposition 3.1 (see Proposition 4.7 and Hypothesis 4.8)."}, {"heading": "4.1 General human problem solving schema", "text": "Vrlrrrrlrrrlrrlrlrlrrlrrlrlrrrlrrrlrrrrlrrrrlrrrrrlrrrrlrteeeeeeeeoiueteeteerlrrlrrrrrrrrrrrrlrrrrrrrrrrrlrrrrlrteeeeeeeeeteerlrrrrrrrrrrrrrrlrrrlrrrlrrlrrrlrrrlrrrlrrrrrlrlrrrlrrrrlrrrrrrrlrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr teeteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr teeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"}, {"heading": "4.2 General human problem solving mechanisms", "text": "In this section we are mainly interested in obtaining new information (new in terms of people's attention), that is, replacing the first macro process of Proposition 4.2 with other, more subtle cognitive processes; other macro processes from this point of view are left untouched. 8Groups, fields, block designs are abstract mathematical concepts that probably cannot be expressed without correct language.
