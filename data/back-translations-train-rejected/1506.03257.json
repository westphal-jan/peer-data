Therefore, the aim of this paper is to create ordered timelines for a series of events related to a target unit, based on two problems: a) cross-document resolution of events and b) cross-document time extraction. To arrange event mentions in a timeline, it is necessary to know which event refers to the same event or fact and occurs simultaneously. Our approach seeks to formalize the idea that two or more event mentions refer to each other when they are not only temporally compatible (the events occur simultaneously), but also semantic compatibility (the event mentions refer to the same facts, places, entities, etc.)."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "Two or more event mentions refer to each other when they relate to the same real fact or event. Moreover, two events may refer to the same fact, while linguistic mentions have a different syntax structure, other words, or even a different meaning. Whatever the case may be, both event mentions must be semantically linked to each other. An event mention consists of an event header (usually a verb or a deverbal noun) that is related to a semantic structure (linguistically presented as an argument structure with an agent, patient, theme, instrument, etc., i.e. the semantic roles) in which there are some event participants (units) and which are located in place and time (Levin and Rappaport-Hovav, 2005; Hovav et al., 2010). The meaning of an event mention is therefore not only the meaning of the event header, but also the compositional components of all time components and their relationships: time, place, etc."}, {"heading": "3 Our Approach", "text": "In our approach, we present each mention of an event as a header word (the event etiquette in the TimeML annotation scheme (Saur\u0131 \u0301 et al., 2006), referring to a temporal expression (implicit or explicit), a set of units (0 or more), and a set of topics that represent what the mention of the event refers to. This essay focuses on time information processing and topic-based semantic representation."}, {"heading": "3.1 Temporal Information Processing", "text": "The annotation scheme TimeML (Saur\u0131 \u0301 et al., 2006) has since been adopted as the default by a large number of researchers in the field of annotation of temporal information. It represents not only events and temporal expressions, but also links (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). Manual annotation of event mentions and DCT of texts was considered to be the input of the system, and an automatic system was used to perform annotation with temporal expressions and temporal associations in order to be able to represent a complete timeline of input texts. When a pure text is considered, systems such as TIPSem (Temporal Information Processing using Semantics) (Llorens et al., 2013; Llorens et al., 2012) 1 can automatically include all temporal expressions (TIMEX3), events (EVENT), and links between them. Once the temporal associations are established, all temporal information is considered to be specific for each event."}, {"heading": "3.2 Topic-based Semantic Representation", "text": "The meaning of each event structure was represented by using Topic Modeling (Lead, 2012) on a reference corpus. Topic Modeling is a family of algorithms that automatically find topics from a collection of documents. Specifically, we apply the latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Lead et al., 2003), which follows a bottom-up approach. Each word is assigned to a topic according to the concurrent words in the context (document) and the topics associated with that word in other documents. Formally, a topic is a distribution on a fixed vocabulary. We have applied the LDA to the WikiNews corpus.2 Each topic in this corpus is represented by the twenty most prominent words."}, {"heading": "4 Architecture of the System", "text": "Our approach to creating timelines from written messages in English implies event correlation resolution by applying three cluster processes in sequential order: a temporal cluster, a lemma cluster, and a theme cluster.

For the final timeline, only those events are selected that are part of sentences containing the target unit or a core resolution of the target."}, {"heading": "4.2 Temporal Clustering Approach", "text": "A simple text was considered, and we use the TIPSem system to automatically annotate all temporal expressions (TIMEX3), events (EVENT), and links between them. TLINKS annotated in the text are used to extract the temporal context of each event and to derive both the time at which each event occurs and the temporal order between the events in the text. Furthermore, if we are able to determine the timing of the event, we can determine the temporal compatibility between events, even if they are contained in different documents, which means that the resolution of the event references between the cross documents is also possible.In this first step, therefore, all events from the different documents occurring on the same date will be part of the same cluster. The clusters are positioned in ascending order based on the assigned date."}, {"heading": "4.3 Semantic Clustering Based on Lemmas", "text": "Once all events that have temporal information in common with the target audience are grouped, we apply a simple cluster based on keyword lemmas.

Therefore, this last clustering tries to solve this problem by extracting the semantic roles from each event and presenting their meaning by using topics on a reference corpus. This approach has three steps: 1. Using SENNA (Collobert et al., 2011) as a semantic role designation, we have identified roles A0 and A1.7 that are related to the event, mentioning header word. For each role, we only extract the nouns. 2. We have extracted 500 arguments from WikiNews using Topic Modeling with MALLET. All of these topics are used as a knowledge base. We will only use the most representative words for each topic (the twenty words with the most weight) and the weights they have in each topic. 3. Finally, we have created an event topic matrix. Each event (raws) is represented by a vector. The values of the vector are the weighting of each argument."}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation Results", "text": "SemEval-2015 Task 4 consists of building timelines of written messages in English in which a target unit is involved. Therefore, the input data provided by the organizers consists of a set of documents and a set of target units related to these documents. In the task, two different timelines are proposed, along with their subtraces: \u2022 Track A: This consists of using raw text as input and obtaining complete timelines. Subtrace B has the same input data, but the output will be timelines of only ordered events (not assignment of time anchors). \u2022 Track B: This consists of using texts with manual annotation of event mentions as input data. Subtrace B has the same input data, but the output will be timelines of only ordered events. In the Semester-2015 Task 4 contest, we participated in Track B and subtrace B. The results for the micro-average F-Score measurement, which is achieved by our python approach, are very high in comparison with the results obtained in the competition B, although the results of our python are:"}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "The results show that our approach is suited to the task at hand. On the one hand, temporal information is automatically extracted using a temporal information processing system that makes it possible to derive and determine the point in time at which each event occurred. On the other hand, the semantic similarity based on the verb is sufficient to group Korean events. \u2022 The basic method (Run 1), consisting of searching for similar verb lemmas, ultimately proved to be the best. Therefore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the results obtained for Run 2 and observed three main drawbacks in the topic modeling approach: \u2022 The K-mean algorithm forces us to specify the number of clusters in advance, and this was set to 2. However, there is often only one right cluster. Another approach without a fixed number of topics will improve the approach. Bejan and Harabagiu (2014), for example, suggest deriving this value from the data. \u2022 The representativeness of each topic depends directly on the topics extracted previously."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions and comments.
