However, the problem of classifying the sentiment of user comments on news sites has not been addressed yet. News sites cover a wide range of domains including politics, sports, technology, and entertainment, in contrast to other online social sites such as forums and review sites, which are specific to a particular domain. A user associated with a news site is likely to post comments on diverse topics (e.g., politics, smartphones, and sports) or diverse entities (e.g., Obama, iPhone, or Google). Classifying the sentiment of users tied to various entities may help obtain a holistic view of their personality, which could be useful in applications such as online advertising, content personalization, and political campaign planning. In this paper, we formulate the problem of entity-specific sentiment classification of comments posted on news articles in Yahoo News and propose novel features that are specific to news comments.

An interesting feature of news sites is that they cover a wide range of domains such as politics, sports, technology and entertainment, as opposed to other online social sites, including forums (e.g., UbuntuForums and TripAdvisor) and review sites (e.g., dpreview.com for digital cameras and Notebookreview.com for laptops) that are specific to a particular domain. Hence, a user's activity in relation to posting comments is potentially much more diverse in news sites than compared to other social platforms. Although it is not unusual for users to make general comments / statements on various topics or comments related to them."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are able to integrate themselves, in which they are able to live, in which they are able to live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they are able to change the world, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they are able to integrate themselves, in which they are able to live, in which they are able to live, in which they are able to change the world, in which they are able to live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they"}, {"heading": "Extracting the Context of an Entity", "text": "The context of an entity contains the words, phrases, or sentences that refer to the entity 3. We use multiple heuristics to extract the contexts. Below, the three most important modules of our context extraction algorithm are listed: 1. Preprocessing, where the number of entities in a comment is checked. For individual entity comments, the entire comment is taken as context for the entity. If a comment contains multiple entities, it is segmented into sentences and given as input to the anaphora resolution. Anaphora resolution: We use a rules-based approach to anaphora resolution. We check the type of entity: PERSON vs. NON-PERSON."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Data Description", "text": "Since there is no annotated dataset for classifying comments on the Internet, we prepared our own dataset. We randomly selected comments for commentary that met certain limitations to ensure the quality and diversity of the dataset. We first highlighted all the comments with the entities in them and ranked the entities by their commentary frequency. From the ranking, we selected 43 entities that covered areas such as politics (e.g. Obama, Romney), software (e.g. Google, Microsoft), online retail (e.g. Walmart, Ebay), hardware (e.g. Samsung, Apple), and insurance (e.g. Medicare, Obamacare), among others. The entities were selected based on their popularity and relevance from the point of view of user targeting.
