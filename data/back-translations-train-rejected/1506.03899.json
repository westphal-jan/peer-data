It is a nontrivial classification problem which has attracted many research. In recent years, there is a high exploitation of Artificial Intelligent algorithms in robotics applications. Inspired by the recent successes of deep learning methods, we propose an end-to-end learning approach for the place classification problem. With the deep architectures, this methodology automatically discovers features and contributes in general to higher classification accuracies. The pipeline of our approach is composed of three parts. Firstly, we construct multiple layers of laser range data to represent the environment information in different levels of granularity. Secondly, each layer of data is fed into a deep neural network model for classification, where a graph regularization is imposed to the deep architecture for keeping local consistency between adjacent samples. Finally, the predicted labels obtained from all the layers are fused based on confidence trees to maximize the overall confidence. Experimental results validate the effective- ness of our end-to-end place classification framework in which both the multi-layer structure and the graph regularization promote the classification performance. Furthermore, results show that the features automatically learned from the raw input range data can achieve competitive results to the features constructed based on statistical and geometrical information.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 Jun 2015 05:45:36 GMT  (564kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03899v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["yiyi liao", "sarath kodagoda", "yue wang", "lei shi", "yong liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.03899"}, "pdf": {"name": "1506.03899.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Place classification with a graph regularized deep neural network model", "authors": ["Yiyi Liao", "Sarath Kodagoda", "Yue Wang", "Lei Shi", "Yong Liu"], "emails": ["yongliu@iipc.zju.edu.cn)."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is so that it is a matter of a way, in which it is about the terminology and the way, in which the terminology and the way, how the terminology and the way, how the terminology and the way, how the terminology and the way, how the terminology and the way, how the terminology and the way, how the terminology and the way, how the way, and the way, how the terminology and the way, how the terminology and the way, how the terminology and the way, how the terminology and the way, how the terminology and the way, how the way, how the way, how the way, how the way and the way, how the way, how the way and the way, how the way and the way, how the way, how the way and the way, how the way and the way, how the way and the way, how the way and the way, how the way and the way, how the way, how the way and the way, how the way and the way, how the way and the way, how the way and the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way, the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way, the way and the way and the way and the way, the way, the way, the way and the way, the way, the way and the way and the way and the way, the way and the way, the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way, the way and the way and the way and the way, the way and the way, the way and the way, the way, the way, the way and the way and the way, the way and the way, the way and the way and the way, the way and the way, the way and the way,"}, {"heading": "II.

In this section, we will discuss the classification problem of how to train with the input data at each level and obtain the predicted labels of the test cards. This is implemented through a deep learning structure, with the ability to automatically learn features from the raw input data. The L-layer of input is trained by L-independent deep learning modes, as shown in Figure 1, although these models have the same structure, where raw laser domain data is the input and predicted labels, as shown in Figure 6. Therefore, the discussion in this section is not limited to a specific layer and therefore the superscripts are omitted. It should be noted that our training process is semi-monitored, as both the training map and the test map are used for model training, where only the labels of the training map are available.

In this section, we describe the details of the construction of the two-step neighbourhood graph S. First, we define the associated relations between the samples and then calculate their weight of the connected edges. In the problem of space classification, the associated relations in the topological diagram GVG are applied directly to the neighbourhood graph. Then, the samples with narrow coordinates are forced to be represented by the characteristics with narrow distances. As regards weights corresponding to the strength of the graph regulation, it is inversely linked with two distances, i.e. the distance between the coordinates and the distance between the input data, which can be formulated as follows: sij = \u03b1dij + \u03b2 = xi \u2212 xj \u00b2 2 (7), where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are constant weights, dij are the euclidean distance between the samples.

EXPERIMENTS", "text": "To confirm the effectiveness of our multi-layered learning system, we are conducting experiments with six indoor data sets collected from six international universities (including the Centre for Autonomous Systems at the University of Technology Sydney, several buildings at the University of Freiburg, the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Saarbr\u00fccken, and the Intel Laboratory in Seattle). As we have already explained, the range data collected at the GVG nodes with the 2D rangefinder, which has a maximum range of 30 meters and a horizontal field of view of 180 meters, can be noted that the classes defined by humans are somewhat vague and rich according to the different functions of the locations. However, the 2D range data does not contain enough discriminatory information to classify all of these human-designed classes. Therefore, we consider three target classes as: Class 1 room designed for a small number of individuals, office, kitchen, stairwell as elevator."}, {"heading": "A.

In these experiments, we pay more attention to the geometric neighborhood, so we use \u03b1 = 2 / 3 and \u03b2 = 1 / 3 in (7) to construct the adjacent graph. Classification results are shown in Table III and Table IV, which are trained on Intellab and Fr79, respectively. Results show the same trends as in Table I and Table II, where higher layers lead to better accuracy. Further comparisons of Table I and Table III show that the Learning feature works better with graph regulation than without it.

The merged test results trained on Intellab are shown diagrammatically in Figure 7. It should be noted that mixtures between Class 1 (office room and other rooms) and Class 2 (meeting room) are responsible for the most important misclassifications, especially in the Fr79 test card. This could be due to the fact that Class 1 is depicted with a tight environment including massive couplers, while Class 2 is characterized with relatively larger rooms, so the corners of the meeting room are largely classified as offices and other rooms and some central locations of the office room as a code table."}, {"heading": "VI.

By conducting semi-supervised learning with or without graph regulation, we also demonstrated that graph regulation helps to enhance classification performance by maintaining local consistency. In addition, the trust-based merger results achieved results comparable to the state-of-the-art method. In short, we achieved generalization capability and preserved local consistency in our end-to-end classification framework. Future work is to apply our framework to other types of sensor data, such as RGB-D data, which have more representative and discriminatory capabilities."}], "references": [{"title": "Search in the real world: Active visual object search based on spatial relations", "author": ["A.

classification is a fundamental ability that a robot should possess to carry out effective human-robot interactions. It is a nontrivial classification problem which has attracted many research. In recent years, there is a high exploitation of Artificial Intelligent algorithms in robotics applications. Inspired by the recent successes of deep learning methods, we propose an end-to-end learning approach for the place classification problem. With the deep architectures, this methodology automatically discovers features and contributes in general to higher classification accuracies. The pipeline of our approach is composed of three parts. Firstly, we construct multiple layers of laser range data to represent the environment information in different levels of granularity. Secondly, each layer of data is fed into a deep neural network model for classification, where a graph regularization is imposed to the deep architecture for keeping local consistency between adjacent samples. Finally, the predicted labels obtained from all the layers are fused based on confidence trees to maximize the overall confidence. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our end-to-end place classification framework in which both the multi-layer structure and the graph regularization promote the classification performance. Furthermore, results show that the features automatically learned from the raw input range data can achieve competitive results to the features constructed based on statistical and geometrical information.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
