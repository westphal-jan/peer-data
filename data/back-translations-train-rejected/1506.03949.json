Background", "text": "In this section, we will first review previous research on CGT values for domineering and related research, mainly on the Game of Amazons (Section 2.1), then give an introduction to CGT, in particular various types of CGT values (Section 2.2), and show Conway's [8] Bridge Splitting Theorem for Domineering (Section 2.3), and finally describe how the endgame domineering databases used during this research were built (Section 2.4)."}, {"heading": "2.1. Related Research", "text": "Some related work on domineering was done by Conway [8] and by Berlekamp, Conway and Guy [4], where they provided CGT values for all domineering positions up to 7 squares and for some positions up to 12 squares. Furthermore, they provided values for several sequences of domineering positions. Berlekamp [3] determined CGT values for many classes of 2 x n and 3 x n domineering games, based on the idea of a general overheating and heating of these games. Wolfe [26] and Kim [15] analyzed one-dimensional domineering positions with corners and kinks (so-called snakes, see also subsection 3.2). Shankar and Sridharan [18] investigated many domineering positions for their temperatures. Another way to solve domineering boards was reported by Lachmann et al. [17], which used translational symmetry rules for board games to establish theoretical values for smaller boards."}, {"heading": "2.2. Introduction to the Combinatorial Game Theory", "text": "Here we will first give a general introduction to CGT as far as domineering is concerned. In particular, we will report on definitions and the meaning of CGT values as in Section 3. \u2212 For more detailed information about the CGT, we will refer to many standard works in this area, in particular [8, 4, 1]. In games applied to domineering, it is customary to show the two players to the left (vertical) and to the right (horizontal). To better understand this recursive definition, it is easiest to start analyzing the simplest (horizontal) options where options are games again. A left option describes a legal move that left can make by giving the game position a position after making the turn, while a right option can make a legal move to the right."}, {"heading": "2.2.1. Numbers", "text": "The numbers can be positive and negative integers, but they can also be fractions. In games with finite game trees, all numbers are dyadic rational, i.e. rational numbers whose denominators are a power of two. Numbers are represented by the options for left and right: G = {GL-GL-GR}, where GL and GR are either {} = \u2205 or sets of other numbers. For all numbers with two non-empty options, GL < GR applies. Generally, the sign of a number indicates which player wins the game, while the value 0 indicates a victory for the player who made the last move, i.e. the previous player. Numbers and combinations of multiple numbers thus have a predetermined result."}, {"heading": "2.2.2. Infinitesimals", "text": "There are several types of infinitesimal values, and this subsection presents three of them: ups / downs, tinies / minies, and nimbers.Ups / DownsThe two games up and down are the opposites and are defined as: \"0\" and \"0,\" three of which are nimber each (see below). Up is a positive infinitesimal, and down is its opposite, i.e. negative, i.e. these positions are common in combinatorial games and represent an average threat to one of the players. An example of an upward position and its left and right options is Figure 2. In this game, Left is best at moving to 0."}, {"heading": "2.3. The Bridge Splitting Theorem", "text": "Although the previous theory is applicable to any combinatorial game, Conway formulated a beautiful theorem that is specifically applicable to domineering [8]. Because of its importance, we repeat the theorem and its proof. We call it the Bridge Splitting Theorem in order to contrast it with another theorem to be formulated later. Theorem 1 (Bridge Splitting Theorem for Domineering). If its value for any game G is equal to that of the game G alone, then the value of G H is the sum of the values of G and H, provided that G and H have no common edges. Proof G H \u2264 G + H = G + H \u2264 G HThe first inequality is justified, since the division of a horizontal line can only favor verticals. Equality is the condition of the theorem. The second inequality is justified, because the connection of two horizontally adjacent squares only has verticals."}, {"heading": "2.4. Construction of the CGT Endgame Databases", "text": "To use CGT values for domineering games, we have all domineering endgame databases for sizes 1-15. Positions that have mirror symmetry (left / right and / or top / bottom) are combined in a single entry. Currently, no 90-fold rotation symmetry, i.e. player rotation, is used. CGT values for domineering games are calculated using the cgsuite software tool [19]. These values are in so-called canonical form, making them a unique representation of values."}, {"heading": "3. Values in Domineering", "text": "In this section we give an overview of the contents of our databases. First we give a statistical overview of our databases (see Section 3.1), then we focus on \"pure\" values, i.e. numbers (Section 3.2), ups and downs (Section 3.3), tinies and minies (Section 3.4) and nimmers (Section 3.5), and finally some interesting other values in Section 3.6."}, {"heading": "3.1. Statistical Analysis of the Databases", "text": "We have generated the endgame databases up to a maximum position size of 15 fields. Beyond this point, the number of entries quickly grows too large to fit into the main memory of the average home computer. An examination of the completed databases shows that the number of entries increases approximately by a factor of 3 to 4 with each additional field. At the final size of 15, the databases contain a total of about 9.3 million entries. Table 1 gives an overview of how fixed-size positions are distributed across the different types of CGT values. Generally, each column describes a specific value type or subset of them. The first block takes into account the pure number games, with the first column listing the numbers that are zero, i.e. wins for the previous player, the second column taking into account all non-zero number games, and the third column, which summarizes all number games. The second block takes into account the pure infinite number games, with the numbers of the last number combinations being compatible with previous number combinations \u2191 / n the numbers."}, {"heading": "3.2. Numbers", "text": "First, we repeat that the only numbers that occur in domineering (and all finite combinatorial games) are dyadic rationals, i.e. those rational numbers whose denominator is a power of 2. An integer n occurs for a linear chain of 2n empty squares, vertical chains for positive integers (an n-move advantage for verticals), horizontal chains for negative integers (an n-move advantage for horizontals). 0 is the value of the empty game or game consisting of a single empty square. Before turning to other numbers, let us first formulate another theorem analogous to the Bridge Splitting Theorem, which can be considered an extension of the Bridge Splitting Theorem. Theorem 2 (Bridge Destroying Theorem for Domineering): If its value for any game G alone is equal to the value of the game G, its value for any game H alone, for a game J its value, then its value for the game alone is the sum of the game G, and the sum of the game I alone."}, {"heading": "G, H, I, and J , provided that G, H, I, and J have no common edges. Games", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "G, H, I, and J might be empty.", "text": "Proof.G HJ I \u2264 G + H J I \u2264 G + H J = G + H + J = G + I + J = G + H + I + J = G + H + J \u2264 G + H + J \u2264 G + H + J \u2264 G HJ IThe first two inequalities are justified because they can only favor a horizontal line, and the first two inequalities are justified because linking along a vertical line can also favor verticalities. This evidence also includes the cases where a fourth equality is an application of the horizontal line, and the last two inequalities are justified because linking along a vertical line can only be favored. We also have the cases where each subset of {G, H, J} we are empty games because the value of the empty square is equal."}, {"heading": "3.3. Ups and Downs", "text": "Another interesting type of single-component positions are \"pure\" heights and multiple heights, e.g. \"vertical,\" \"vertical,\" \"vertical,\" \"vertical,\" \"vertical,\" \"vertical,\" \"vertical,\" \"vertical,\" \"vertical,\" \"vertical,\" etc. We study only positives, since each positive is accompanied by the equivalent negative (\"\u2191,\" \"\u2191,\" etc.), which is achieved by a rotation of 90. \"In our databases up to size 15, there are 15,145 different positions, the smallest being the size-6, which is shown on the left in Figure 15, with canonical form [0]. Note that there are many other single-component positions with value \u2191, but they need at least a size of 7. As they are also not of particular interest, we omit to give examples. In total, we found 540 different positions with value 2 \u00b7\" vertical, \"which can be understood as the smallest positions on the right (the middle of the size, or the 15), which can be mapped as the middle of the two (or 15)."}, {"heading": "3.4. Tinies and Minies", "text": "Another interesting type of positions are the \"pure\" interest rates in the form x = 0 | | 0 | \u2212 x}, with x > 0. Here, too, we examine only positive positions, since each miniscule is accompanied by the equivalent miny, which is defined by a rotation of 90%. In Table 2, we give an overview of the frequency of the various types of interest rates that occur in our databases. Figure 17 shows an example with smallest size for each of these 11 categories. We have omitted the trivial 0, which by definition is 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | \u2212 0} = 0 | 0 | 0} =. In our endgame databases, we do not have multiple interest rates of the form n \u00b7 x for n > 0 and arbitrary x 6 = 1,2 2-3 / 2 3-3 / 2 \u2012 1-3 / 4 1 / 4 1 / 4 1 / 4 1 / 4."}, {"heading": "3.5. Nimbers", "text": "Interestingly, the simple positions of size 11 with value 2, 15 with value 2, 8 with value 4, 14 with value 3, 15 with higher values. (Drummond-Cole notes that \"I have not been able to find any ordinary positions of size 1 with value 2, and suspects that if such positions exist, they will be different from the positions constructed here, which depend greatly on their value in the corners.\" [10] While having several positions of value 2, none of these positions can be reproduced in a game of domineering with a regular board. In contrast, the positions shown in Figure 18 are shown and found in the database generation to be accessible by normal play, i.e., in standard domineering values of 2 and 3, respect. Overall, the databases up to size 15 contain different positions with values 2 and 3, 1 position of size 3 with value 2, 15 positions of size 2 with value 2. \""}, {"heading": "3.6. Other Interesting Values", "text": "In this subsection, we report on positions with interesting values for one reason or another. 1First, we searched for positions with the largest number of (left plus right) canonical options. We came across seven positions with the maximum number of options, in all cases five links plus five rights options. They are all size 15. There is only one such position that fits a 5 x 5 board given in Figure 23 (a). (a) (b) (c) The gray cells in this figure denote covered squares. We immediately notice that due to these squares covered inside, this position is not attainable in the standard domination, i.e., starting from a rectangular board. Drummond-Cole calls this a \"generalized domination\" position. Two other positions with the maximum number of options on a 6 x 6 board fit and are given in Figures 23 (b) and 23 (c), both of which are rotationally symmetrical."}, {"heading": "4. Temperatures in Domineering", "text": "Berlekamp assumed that 2 is the highest possible temperature in domineering (as reported in [18]). Drummond-Cole [9] discovered such a position (see Figure 26). Shankar and Sridharan [18] extensively examined all domineering positions that fit on boards of dimensions 5 x 6, 4 x 8, 3 x 10 and 2 x 16 in search of new temperatures. They also found the same temperature 2 position and no positions with higher temperatures. In our analysis of CGT endgame data bases, we also tracked the temperatures of the positions encountered as a byway. Although Shankar and Sridharan examined many other positions, our databases were not limited to fitting within a certain range just to have a maximum size, so it was worth looking for other temperatures. However, we also found exactly one position with temperature 2, which is shown in Figure 26, and no positions with higher temperatures. Berlekamp's guess therefore remains."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions and Future Research", "text": "We can divide our main results into two categories: the first is more practical. Inspecting our CGT endgame databases, we have discovered a wide variety of interesting CGT values that can be achieved in the standard domination, including many numbers, ups and downs, tiines and mines and nimmers. In the latter category, the discovery of two and three positions is of particular interest as they have not been found before. Furthermore, we have shown that within the domination positions up to size 15, there is exactly one (ignoring symmetries) with temperature 2 and none with higher temperatures. All these results show that domination positions are an exciting game in which all pitfalls and many complexities are still to be discovered. Second, based on our results, we have been able to formulate several theorems that are generally applicable to domination positions."}], "references": [{"title": "Lessons in Play: An Introduction to Combinatorial Game Theory.

single-component positions up to 15 squares for Domineering. These databases have been filled with exact Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT) values in canonical form. We give an overview of several interesting types and frequencies of CGT values occurring in the databases. The most important findings are as follows. First, as an extension of Conway\u2019s [8] famous Bridge Splitting Theorem for Domineering, we state and prove another theorem, dubbed the Bridge Destroying Theorem for Domineering. Together these two theorems prove very powerful in determining the CGT values of large single-component positions as the sum of the values of smaller fragments, but also to compose larger single-component positions with specified values from smaller fragments. Using the theorems, we then prove that for any dyadic rational number there exist single-component Domineering positions with that value. Second, we investigate Domineering positions with infinitesimal CGT values, in particular ups and downs, tinies and minies, and nimbers. In the databases we find many positions with single or double up and down values, but no ups and downs with higher multitudes. However, we prove that such single-component ups and downs easily can be constructed, in particular that for any multiple up n\u00b7\u2191 or down n\u00b7\u2193 there are Domineering positions of size 1+5n with these values. Further, we find Domineering positions with 11 different tinies and minies values. For each we give an example. Next, for nimbers we find many Domineering positions with values up to *3. This is surprising, since Drummond-Cole [10] suspected that no *2 and *3 positions in standard Domineering would exist. We show and characterize many *2 and *3 positions. Finally, we give some Domineering positions with values interesting for other reasons. Third, we have investigated the temperature of all positions in our databases. There appears to be exactly one position with temperature 2 (as already found before) and no positions with temperature larger than 2. This supports Berlekamp\u2019s conjecture that 2 is the highest possible temperature in Domineering. \u2217Corresponding author. Email address: uiterwijk@maastrichtuniversity.nl (J.W.H.M.
