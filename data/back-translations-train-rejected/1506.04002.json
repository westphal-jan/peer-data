In each category, the underlying rule representation schema and the format of classifier condition to support the corresponding representation are presented. Furthermore, a precise explanation on the way that each technique partitions the problem space along with the extensive experimental results is provided. To have an elaborated view on the functionality of each technique, a comparative analysis of existing techniques on some conventional problems is provided.

Holland (Holand, 1976). LCSs were originally inspired by the general principles of Darwinian evolution and cognitive learning, and the LCS system was reformed to use reinforcement techniques such as Q-Learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998) to ensure adequate reward and propagation. LCS is also known as the rules-based evolutionary online learning system. It is a heuristic method in which a population of production systems exists and is adapted using genetic algorithms and reinforcement techniques of learning. Any production system can cover a small region of the environment and represent some parts of the overall solution. An LCS system is therefore able to solve a problem by using the best developed production systems in its popular era."}, {"heading": "2 Learning Classifier Systems in Brief", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of us are in a position to put ourselves in a different world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they are able to put themselves into another world, in which they are able to move, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they"}, {"heading": "3 Knowledge Representation", "text": "In other words, the solution system must be able to model the regularities of the problem area in order to make decisions in relation to its experience. In rule-based systems, its rule set is the one responsible for such a modeling, where each rule represents a part of the problem area and makes the best decision in the corresponding subspace. Consequently, a rule-based system is able to solve a problem efficiently if the rule set can adequately cover the entire problem area, and also if each rule makes an effective decision in which each rule represents a part of the problem area and makes the best decision in the corresponding subspace. Knowledge representation, knowledge representation, representation in the dissemination of knowledge in the Learning Classifier System: A Survey 5has an essential role in rule-based systems. In particular, a rule-based classification such as XCS can achieve all three main objectives of the classification task, which are high accuracy, intelligibility and compactness, provided that there is proper rule-based representation."}, {"heading": "4 Relative Strength and Weakness of Knowledge Representation Techniques", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to recognize and understand the problems they have. In this sense, it is also necessary that they get a grip on the problems they have in their entirety. In this area, we have a few simple problem solutions and analyze the relative strength and weakness of each of them. We look at the following categories of problems that we address."}, {"heading": "5 Summary and Conclusion", "text": "In this study, we focus on the progress of XCS as a rules-based learning system, with particular emphasis on improving one of its most important components, knowledge representation. As this component seeks to play a prominent role in the generalization capacity of the system and has implications for rule-based systems in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, we have seen a growing interest over the last decade in proposing different knowledge representation techniques in the LCS domain in general and XCS in particular. Here, after reviewing some basic information, we collect various knowledge representation techniques proposed in the LCS field in Michigan and group them into different categories based on the classification approach in which they are incorporated. In each category, the underlying rule representation scheme and the format of the classification condition are presented to support the corresponding representation. In addition, a precise explanation can be given of how each technical knowledge represents representation in learning systems based on knowledge that serves as a guideline for other systems."}], "references": [{"title": "Learning Classifier Systems: Looking Back and Glimpsing Ahead", "author": ["J Bacardit", "E Bernad\u00f3-Mansilla", "MV Butz"], "venue": "In Learn Clasif Sys From Found to Appl,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Accuracy-based learning classifier systems: Models, analysis and applications to classification tasks", "author": ["E Bernad\u00f3-Mansilla", "M Garrell J"], "venue": "Evol Comput", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2003}, {"title": "XCS and GALE: a comparative study of two learning classifier systems with six other learning algorithms on classification tasks", "author": ["E Bernad\u00f3-Mansilla", "X Llor\u00e1", "JM Garrell"], "venue": "In Fourth Inter Workshop on Learn Clasif Sys", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition", "author": ["CM Bishop"], "venue": "Proc of EUFIT \u201993 ELITE Found,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 1995}, {"title": "Some methodological issues about designing autonomous agents which learn their behaviors: the ELF experience", "author": ["A Bonarini"], "venue": "R.

This component brings insight into how to partition the problem space what in turn seeks prominent role in generalization capacity of the system as a whole. Recently, knowledge representation component has received great deal of attention within data mining communities due to its impacts on rule based systems in terms of efficiency and efficacy. The current work is an attempt to find a comprehensive and yet elaborate view into the existing knowledge representation techniques in LCS domain in general and XCS in specific. To achieve the objectives, knowledge representation techniques are grouped into different categories based on the classification approach in which they are incorporated. In each category, the underlying rule representation schema and the format of classifier condition to support the corresponding representation are presented. Furthermore, a precise explanation on the way that each technique partitions the problem space along with the extensive experimental results is provided. To have an elaborated view on the functionality of each technique, a comparative analysis of existing techniques on some conventional problems is provided. We expect F.
