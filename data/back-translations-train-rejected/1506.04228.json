INTRODUCTION", "text": "The correct identification of the normalized form of a word is of particular importance for several other NLP tasks and can improve the accuracy of tasks such as information extraction and information gathering. Implementing a lemmatizer can be a difficult task, especially in cases of highly inflexible languages such as the Bulgarian language. For example, the Bulgarian adjective \"r\u00e2d\u01cek\" - \"rare\" - has 9 inflected word forms (Table 1).

USING THE BGLEMMATIZER PLUGIN FOR GATE", "text": "GATE (General Architecture for Text Engineering) is a sophisticated language processing framework that handles various word processing1. It is an open source project with over 15 years of development time. We have implemented support for running BGLemmatizer as a GATE plugin. To make the BGLemmatizer plugin work properly, language information is required for each token. This information can be automatically retrieved from POS taggers such as the LingPipe POS tagger, which is also available as a GATE plugin. A sample configuration of the BGLemmatizer plugin is shown in Figure 1, where the plugin is configured to retrieve the POS tag of a token from the \"category\" feature of the \"token\" comment and the resulting problem can be found in the same annotation.1 http: / / gate.ac.uk /"}, {"heading": "4. FUTURE WORK", "text": "We plan to integrate the BGLemmatizer with other linguistic software tools. One of our goals is to achieve better results and accuracy of partial linguistic annotations of Bulgarian texts with a high degree of grammatical errors, which is the case with texts written by people learning Bulgarian as a foreign language. We also plan to add APIs to BGLangTools that will be useful in the areas of automatic text generation and information extraction."}, {"heading": "5.
