INTRODUCTION", "text": "The entry for \"lemmatize\" in the Collins English Dictionary states that lemmatization is the process of grouping the various flexed forms of a word so that they can be analyzed as a single term (Collins English Dictionary1). Lemmatization is a fundamental task of natural language processing (NLP), which automates the process of word normalization. Correctly identifying the normalized form of a word is important for NLP tasks such as gathering and gathering information. It becomes of particular interest when applied to highly inflexible languages such as Bulgarian, which is a South Slavic language.The total amount of relevant information in a sample is controlled by two factors: \u2022 The sample plan or experimental design, which represents the method of collecting the information; \u2022 The sample size n or the amount of information that is collected [4].The corpus we studied consists of 2733 tokens [1]."}, {"heading": "2. SURVEY", "text": "As mentioned above, we conducted a pilot study in which 40 observations from each district were evaluated, with the numbers in the three sample districts = 28q = 33q = 33q number [4]: N1 = 80509 / for the nouns / N2 = 23159 / for the adjectives / N3 = 45393 / for the verbs / The numbers n1, n2, n3 were evaluated randomly in the three layers as follows: (1) K = \u00b1. \"By substituting our sample estimates instead of quantities (1), we found that we: n1 = 0.534, n; n2 = 0.224, n; n3 = 0.242, n We have now assigned the proportions to the total sample."}, {"heading": "3. CONCLUSION", "text": "The above frequency distribution tables can be used to analyze errors and identify types of errors with a view to eliminating them, which will contribute to increasing the precision and efficiency of the developed software and improve the application possibilities for various NLP tasks, such as information extraction and information gathering. We suggest that the samples be randomly conducted in accordance with the proportions shown in the frequency distributions. The suggested method for selecting the sample size can be used in performing the estimation procedure for the three above cases. The estimated parameters and the standard error margin are determined on the basis of your point estimator."}, {"heading": "4.
