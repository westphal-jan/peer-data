In this essay, we intend to provide a more fine-grained evaluation of arguments based on the graph structure of the reasoning system. Our basic starting point is that argument x is more acceptable than argument y iff PRO more defenders for x and OPP less attackers against x.For such an idea, our approach is to count the number of attackers and defenders for each argument. The fewer attackers and the more defenders an argument has, the more acceptable the argument is. In this approach, the main limitation is that we must be able to identify all attackers and defenders for each argument, which is quite simple in the case of argument graphs without cycles. In this section, we will first introduce a matrix approach to record and track all attackers and defenders of varying lengths for each argument, regardless of whether the argument graph is acyclic or cyclic."}, {"heading": "Finding attackers and defenders", "text": "In this subsection we will use a series of matrices to store the number of steps with different lengths between two arguments (< A > AF = 1) and will present a matrix product approach to calculate these matrices.

The attacker and defender who counts semantics for such AF is for all arguments X, v = lim k \u2192 \u221e v (k) the strength value of each argument xi is called v (xi).

Our model can be considered a linear model and has significant arithmetic advantages. In the short term, future work will mainly focus on the following aspects: First, the damping factor plays an important role in our counting semantics. How the damping factor affects the results and how it is decided are two pressing problems. Second, argumentation through Web 2.0 has become a social activity in our daily lives 3. How we can extend our work to the evaluation of arguments in the social context is another point of research."}], "references": [{"title": "On the acceptability of arguments and its fundamental role in nonmonotonic reasoning, logic programming and n-person games", "author": ["P.M.
