We advance formal definitions for these concepts by way of a notion of normality related to an expected (optimal) theoretical speedup when adding useful information (other theorems as axioms), as compared with actual strategies that can be effectively and efficiently implemented. We propose the existence of an ineluctable tradeoff between this normality and computational time complexity. The argument quantifies the usefulness of information in terms of (positive) speed-up. The results disclose a kind of no-free-lunch scenario and a tradeoff of a fundamental nature. The main theorem in this paper together with the numerical experiment---undertaken using two different automatic theorem provers AProS and Prover9 on random theorems of propositional logic---provide strong theoretical and empirical arguments for the fact that finding new useful information for solving a specific problem (theorem) is, in general, as hard as the problem (theorem) itself.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Jun 2015 04:17:45 GMT  (26kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04349v1", "14 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["santiago hern\\'andez-orozco", "francisco hern\\'andez-quiroz", "hector zenil", "wilfried sieg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.04349"}, "pdf": {"name": "1506.04349.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Rare Speed-up in Automatic Theorem Proving Reveals Tradeoff Between Computational Time and Information Value", "authors": ["Santiago Hern\u00e1ndez-Orozco", "Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez-Quiroz", "Hector Zenil", "Wilfried Sieg"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Experimental mathematics; automatic theory testing; statement calculation; trade-offs in complexity measurements; computational complexity; algorithmic complexity."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "So the question is what information can be added so that a proof is much shorter than it is considered from a very abstract point of view, of course there is a simple (and trivial) answer: add the theorem itself and the proof becomes minimal! But adding all detectable theorems to an axiomatic system makes it pointless. On the other hand, a system is subject to memory limitations that are not minimal (i.e. that it can store a set of useful theorems away from the axioms of a theory), but at the same time would be limited by a realistic degree if it only stores the most useful theorems for a given task (i.e. those that can shorten a proof)."}, {"heading": "2 Methodology", "text": "We have a theory that aims to find a normal natural deduction of theorems in which the propositions and predicate logic are used to approximate the proof of complexity via randomly generated sets of axiomatic systems and propositions. We later propose a necessary but possibly insufficient property (in definition 7) to assess the appropriateness of the described approaches."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "First of all, we have performed more than 15 experiments with Prover9. The following table summarizes a selected number of results: As the table shows, Prover9 does not exhibit normal behavior as defined in 7. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig. 3, the acceleration matrix does not correspond to the expected periodic diagonal acceleration instances. Then, we present the incidence acceleration matrix obtained from AProS under four different conditions: the basic experiment (the four logical connectives and classical deduction) (3.1); the exclusion of the disjunction as connective (3.3); the basic experiment with intuitionist logic (3.2); the intuitionist logic while confining to the negative fragment as in 3.3 (3.4). The same set of cases has been used where possible, i.e. 3.1 with 3.2 and 3.3 with 3.4. Also included is the matrix that we do not keep positive values for Prover9 while experimenting.It is important to note that it is not negative."}, {"heading": "3.4 AProS speed-up incidence matrix with intuitionistic deduc-", "text": "Positive \u03b4: 862, percentage: 12.94%.

In particular, two deduction systems for propositional logic were proposed to determine the appropriateness of these approximations (Def. 7). Given the velocity-up matrices achieved, it is obvious that neither AProS nor Prover9 correspond to the normality condition defined: Prover9 cannot detect trivial cases with regularity; instead of the expected periodic diagnostic patterns induced by the presence of trivial accelerations, we find a number of vertical acceleration clusters with no discernible regular distribution. This behavior is incompatible with the second condition of normality."}], "references": [{"title": "Program-size Versus Time Complexity", "author": ["J. Joosten", "F. Soler-Toscano", "H.
