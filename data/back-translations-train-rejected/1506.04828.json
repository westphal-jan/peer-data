An objective critical distance (OCD) has been defined as that spacing between adjacent formants, when the level of the valley between them reaches the mean spectral level. The measured OCD for synthetic vowels lies in the same range (viz., 3-3.5 bark) as the critical distance determined by subjective experiments for similar experimental conditions. The computed OCD is vowel dependent and varies over a wide range. The level of spectral valley serves a similar purpose as that of the spacing between the formants with an added advantage that it can be measured from the spectral envelope without an explicit knowledge of formant frequencies. To demonstrate this, vowels have been classified into front/back based on the relative level of the spectral valley giving an accuracy of about 98 %. Information relating to the spectral valleys seems promising, which needs to be explored further.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 04:03:06 GMT  (829kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04828v1", "20 pages, 5 figures, submitted to JASA-EL"], ["v2", "Mon, 5 Oct 2015 12:44:54 GMT  (258kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04828v2", "39 pages, 6 figures, submitted to JASA"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, 5 figures, submitted to JASA-EL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SD", "authors": ["t v ananthapadmanabha", "a g ramakrishnan", "shubham sharma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.04828"}, "pdf": {"name": "1506.04828.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Significance of level of spectral valleys of vowel sounds", "authors": ["T.

Influence of formant levels", "text": "Since we use a cascaded formant model, we can obtain different formant levels by controlling the bandwidths. Bandwidths (B1 and B2) of the first two formants are varied over a wide range to obtain different spectral levels in dB, referred to as L1 and L2, respectively. B3 and B4 are fixed at 100 Hz. The size of the square spectrum of the impulse response of the cascaded four-formant model is calculated. Figure 4 shows RLSV, V12 as a function of the difference in formant levels in dB. V12 in dB is seen to be consistently negative for case (a), for the x-axis range of about \u00b1 6 dB, while it is consistently positive for case (b), for the x-axis range of about \u00b1 10 dB.

CONCLUSION", "text": "Based on the fact that the plane of the spectral valley is determined by the spatial distances of the arrangements, a term has been defined as objective critical distance, which is defined as distance when the plane of the valley corresponds to the middle spectral plane. This concept includes the criterion of separation of arrangements 2,3,7,12,13 and the spectral template criterion 9-11. We have shown that the behavior of the OCD is similar to the subjectively derived critical distance for similar experimental conditions such as different arrangement distances, arrangement levels and the presence of higher arrangements. However, the measured OCD is strongly dependent on the vowel. It is shown that the plane of the spectral valleys, which can be measured from the spectral shell of an arrangement value without explicitly estimating the arrangement values, can be used as an acoustic feature for distinguishing front and rear with an accuracy of approximately 98%."}], "references": [{"title": "Control methods used in a study of the vowels,", "author": ["G.
