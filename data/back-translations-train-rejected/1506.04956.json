Their primary data were eye-fixation studies (i.e. the sequence in which the subjects look at the different parts of the diagram or the instructions), although accuracy and response time were also reported.

Inherent limitations of simulation", "text": "However one approaches the simulation hypothesis, there is a deeper problem: simulation is simply not as general as it first appears, especially for a layman. It is easy for a layman to overestimate the state of the art in physical simulation and to assume that there is a plug-and-play physics engine that works for pretty much all physical situations. If computer scientists actually knew how to build a comprehensive physics engine, the notion that humans could have an instantiation of something like this seems more plausible, but the reality is that physics engines, as they exist in 2014, are brittle things when it comes to anticipating the full complexity of the real world. Plug-and-play engines only capture narrowly defined environments; more complex applications require hard work by experts. A few seconds of realistic CGI in a disaster movie may require several days of work; an accurate and complex scientific calculation may require several months."}, {"heading": "3.1 Finding an appropriate modeling approach", "text": "For a programmer building a simulation, the first hurdle to implementing a simulator is the development of a domain model. In some cases, such as pendulums and blocks, this is quite understandable. However, it can often be difficult to find a suitable model, even with familiar objects, materials and physical processes. Consider cutting materials with tools. An ordinary household may have a dozen types of cutting tools: a few types of kitchen knives; more specialized kitchen appliances such as graters and peelers; a few types of scissors; a drill, a saw, a lawnmower, etc. (A specialist such as a carpenter or a surgeon has many more.) Most people understand how they should be used and what would happen if you used the wrong tool for the material; for example, if you tried to cut firewood with scissors. But it would be difficult to find good models for it in physics or engineering literature, where the best minds do not yet have the detailed computer science to solve the situations of engineers."}, {"heading": "3.2 Choosing an idealization", "text": "This year, more than ever before in the history of the country in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is not a country, but in which it is a country, a country, a city and a country."}, {"heading": "3.3 Rapid, approximate inferences", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to a different world in which they are able to escape than to another world in which they are able to escape."}, {"heading": "3.4 Extra-physical information", "text": "Suppose you see a baseball pitcher throw a ball. If you simulate the movement of the ball using the best information you can gather about the angle, velocity, etc. of the ball as it leaves the hit zone, and include the inaccuracy of that information, you will predict that it is more likely to land somewhere near the batter. You would achieve better results - by predicting that the ball will land near the hit zone, directly inside or outside the hit zone - by relying instead on the pitcher's known accuracy, plus very specific information about the state of play and the pitcher's willingness to risk a pitcher pitch outside the hit zone, rather than a hit. Pure physical simulation, limited by real-world measurement errors, could yield far less accurate results."}, {"heading": "3.5 Incomplete information", "text": "Performing a physical simulation is generally only possible if the geometric and physical characteristics of the initial state are precisely known. In many real-world situations, people often carry out physical considerations based on partial, sometimes extremely limited, information. Perception, for example, can be imperfect or incomplete. Knowledge of aspects of the situation can be partially obscured. (An opaque object always closes itself to its own side, far from the viewer.) Knowledge of the physical situation can come from natural language texts or sketches. Knowledge of aspects of the situation can arise from inferences; for example, when someone tries to pick up a suitcase, one can conclude that the suitcase is unusually heavy; one can then use this conclusion for future predictions. Or the exact details are not yet determined."}, {"heading": "3.6 Tasks other than prediction", "text": "Simulations are most likely to be used in the task of making predictions, such as where a pendulum will be at a given time. However, there are many other important types of physical brainteasers for which simulation-based techniques are generally less well suited, such as: interpolation between two states at two different times; planning; inferring the shape of an object; inferring the physical properties of an object; design and comparative analysis. All of these tasks arise constantly for people in ordinary situations; a cognitive theory of physical thinking must therefore take them all into account."}, {"heading": "4. Further limitations of simulation in cognitive modeling", "text": "Even where simulations could be applied in principle, there is often reason to doubt that they will be applied in practice."}, {"heading": "4.1 Systematic errors in physical reasoning", "text": "I can't imagine that it will come this far, \"he told the German Press Agency.\" I can't imagine that it will come this far, \"he said.\" I can't imagine that it will come this far, \"he said.\" But I can't imagine that it will come this far. \"\" I can't imagine that it will come this far. \"\" I can't imagine that it will come this far, \"he said.\" But I can't imagine that it will come this far. \"\" No. \"\" No. \"\" No. \"No.\" \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"No.\" No. \"I.\" I \"I can't imagine that it will come this far.\" I cannot imagine that it will come this far. \"he said.\" I cannot imagine that it will come this far. \"I cannot imagine that it will come this far.\" he said. \"I cannot imagine that it will come this far.\" he said. \"I cannot imagine that it will.\" I cannot imagine it will come this far. \"I cannot imagine that it will come that it will come this far.\" he will. \"I cannot.\" I cannot imagine it will. \"I cannot imagine it will come this far.\" I cannot imagine it will come. \"I cannot imagine it will come this far.\" he will come. \"he will come.\" I cannot. \"I cannot imagine it will.\" I cannot imagine it will. \"I cannot imagine it will.\" I cannot imagine it will. \"I cannot imagine it will.\" I cannot imagine it will come. \"\" but it will. \"I cannot imagine it will come this.\" but it will come. \"but it will come.\" but it will come. \"but it will come.\" but it will. \"I cannot.\" but it will. \"I cannot.\" I cannot. \"I cannot.\" I cannot imagine it will. \"\" I cannot. \"\""}, {"heading": "4.2 Intermittent use of a correct physical theory", "text": "s accuracy can vary greatly depending on the framing of a particular problem, even if the underlying physics is essentially identical. In fact, in some cases, two tasks that differ only in the desired form of the answer are quite different. For example, when the subjects are asked to think about the pendulum's flight after the cut, participants perform well when asked to place a basket to catch the basket or place a blade so that the bob reaches a certain point (Smith and Vul (2013)), but the same study found that participants perform poorly when asked to draw the bob's path to fit the basket or place a blade so that the bob reaches a certain point (Smith and Vul (2013)."}, {"heading": "As a result, the predictive power of the \u201cnoisy Newton\u201d theory is severely limited. It is not the case that", "text": "Humans reliably use a noisy Newton method or any kind of Newton-based method for problems with rigid solid objects. It is not even the case that they reliably use these methods for the specific problem of predicting the behavior of intersecting pendulums. Until there is a characterization of which problems produce \"noisy Newtons,\" the theory does not make general, verifiable predictions."}, {"heading": "4.3 Implausibly rich tacit theories", "text": "As I said, the discovery of Newtonian physics was a significant intellectual achievement, and its principles remain difficult for people to learn. \"Of course, we know that people have tacit knowledge that is very difficult to explain; for example, linguists struggle to characterize language without articulating the underlying rules. Nevertheless, both the gap between human achievements and Newtonian physics and the inherent difficulty of characterizing the complexity of the world in terms of scientific principles are important."}, {"heading": "4.4 Simulation as the result, rather than the mechanism, of physical reasoning", "text": "In a series of cognitive studies on the visualization or embodied simulation of the bride, it becomes clear from the observation that most physical considerations have to be done before the simulation can be constructed; and that simulation cannot therefore be the cognitive mechanism supporting the physical reasoning. Zwaan and Taylor (2006), for example, report on an experiment in which the subjects read one of the following two texts: 1) The carpenter turned the screw, the boards were too tightly connected. 2) The carpenter turned the screw, the boards were too loosely connected to each other. 4 This despite the fact that a bicycle is a fairly simple system; for a stability analysis, a bicycle with two wheels on the ground consists of four rigid objects (the two wheels, the handlebars and the frame) with six degrees of freedom and numerous symmetrical movements related to the visualization."}, {"heading": "5.
