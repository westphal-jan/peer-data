BI analysis results of Alzheimer's gene expression through rroresources, DNA, RNA and protein sequence data, iii) protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, iv) signaling data and v) genontology (GO) databases. Although other types of data such as human disease networks and disease gene networks are also used, and very important for many research directions, including disease diagnosis. In gene expression analysis, the expression levels of thousands of genes are analyzed across different conditions, such as individual developmental stages of treatments or diseases. Microarray-based gene expression profiles are usually used to record the expression levels for analysis. There are three types of microarray data, namely gene time and genome sample time. Gene expression profiles across the sample space record the expression levels for different conditions during the course of time they are expressed."}, {"heading": "1.3 Big data problems in bioinformatics", "text": "The solutions for cloud-based big data analysis, such as the Bina box for genome analysis, are very new. In the field of bioinformatics, there are a number of other big data problems that have yet to be explored. In view of the recent big data boom in bioinformatics, as discussed above, there is an urgent need to address many of these problems. In this paper, we categorize the big data analysis problems in bioinformatics into seven categories. They are discussed below."}, {"heading": "1.3.1 Microarray data analysis", "text": "The size and number of microarray datasets is growing rapidly, mainly due to decreasing costs and widespread usage. www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp 8. rdp.cme.msu.edu 9. www.mirbase.org 10. dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu 11. string.embl.de 12. thebiogrid.org 13. www.geneontology.orgof microarray experiments. In addition, microarray experiments are also conducted for the period of the gene sample to capture changes in expression levels over time or at different stages of a disease. Big data technologies are needed to rapidly build up co-expression and regulation networks using extensive microarrays. Since gene expression data is captured over time in different progression stages of a disease, the ability to identify genes affected by the disease in order to identify biomarkers for the disease makes the computational analysis of the third dimension of the analytics much more complex over time."}, {"heading": "1.3.2 Gene-gene network analysis", "text": "Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN) changes underlie many anomalous conditions, such as cancer. Inferring GRN and its changes from high-throughput microarray data is a fundamental but challenging task. With the rapid growth of high-throughput sequencing technologies, systems biologists are now able to derive gigabytes of data from gigabytes of data. In many cases, the movement of such large amounts of data is impractical. Integration of large, multiple GRNs from different sources helps to rebuild a unified GRN. On-site reconstruction of GRNs and then their integration by cloud infrastructure can help systems biologists better analyze a diseased network. In addition, the inference can be transferred to genomic medicine. Although there are many GRN inference mechanisms, its relative strength is unknown due to the lack of large-scale validation. To find the most effective inference mechanism to identify the abnormal networks and to achieve gene reliability, rapid gene expression and drug safety can be achieved."}, {"heading": "1.3.3 PPI data analysis", "text": "PPI complexes and changes in them inhibit high levels of information about various diseases.

It requires an efficient and scalable architecture to enable fast and accurate generation, validation and ranking of PPI complexes."}, {"heading": "1.3.4 Sequence analysis", "text": "Given the increasing volume (in the order of petabytes) of DNA data coming from thousands of sources, current DNA sequencing tools have been found to be insufficient. Therefore, the development of high throughput and a compact architecture for DNA sequence analysis with a renewed focus on big data management is a bioinformatics problem that has been in high demand in recent days. RNA sequencing technology has emerged as a strong successor to microarray technology due to its more accurate and quantitative gene expression measurements. However, RNA sequence data also contains additional information that is often overlooked and the extraction of which requires complex machine learning techniques. Big data technologies can be used to identify mutations, allele-specific expressions and exogenous RNA constituents such as viruses from RNA sequence data using sophisticated machine learning methods."}, {"heading": "1.3.5 Evolutionary research", "text": "Recent advances in molecular biology technology have become an important source of big data generation, generating huge amounts of data through various microbial-level projects such as whole genome sequencing, microarrays, and metabolomics.

The multi-objective associations between diseases in heterogeneous networks are useful for understanding the relationships between networks. Complex networks of molecular phenotypes characterize causal or predictive genes or mechanisms for disease-associated traits. The ability to quickly process this data allows researchers to analyze more data sets that could not previously be analyzed. Although large collections of this data can be analyzed with existing technologies, data integration techniques are still inefficient. Optimal integration methods are needed to analyze multiple, heterogeneous economic databases. In addition, major problems arise before the large amounts of data can be analyzed with existing technologies."}, {"heading": "1.4 Techniques for big data Analytics", "text": "In fact, it is the case that we will be able to go in search of a solution that is capable, that we are able, that we are able to find a solution that is capable of us, that we are able, that we are able to stay in the world, \"he said."}, {"heading": "1.5 Contributions", "text": "This paper provides an in-depth study of the sources and types of big data in bioinformatics, the existing methods of machine learning and big data for their analysis, as well as the limitations and future research. The contributions of this paper are listed hereinafter 1) Two additional features to the traditional definition of big data are introduced; accordingly, big data is also distributed incrementally and geographically. 2) Problems in bioinformatics, which face the challenges of huge, ever-growing and heterogeneous data sets, are categorized into seven classes. Research questions are identified in each of these problem categories. 3) State-of-the-art big data technologies are divided into three classes based on their overall system architectures; the generic architectures for each of the classes are presented; 4) Methods of machine learning for large-scale data analysis are presented; the limits of traditional methods and their incremental versions for fast, scalable and precise big data solutions are discussed."}, {"heading": "1.6 Organization of the paper", "text": "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents generic architectures for existing computational models of big data analytics; Section 3 discusses traditional and big data-oriented methods of machine learning and their possibilities and limitations; Section 4 discusses the problems and challenges associated with big data analytics; Section 5 presents existing big data tools for bioinformatics and presents our conclusions on the study in Section 6."}, {"heading": "2 ARCHITECTURES FOR BIG DATA ANALYTICS", "text": "Based on our study, we classify big data solutions into three major architectures. Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages, and their suitability depends on the type and requirements of the algorithm to be implemented. These are discussed below."}, {"heading": "2.1 MapReduce architecture", "text": "MapReduce is a data-parallel architecture originally developed by Google [31], but parallelism is achieved by multiple machines or nodes performing the same task on different data. Apache Hadoop18 is a widely used open source implementation of MapReduce. However, a MapReduce daemon runs on the node all the time. There is a master node that performs the configuration and control during the execution of the problem, and the other nodes are referred to as workers nodes and perform an actual calculation on data. The master node splits the data, assigns them to workers nodes, and puts them into global memory as (key, value) pairs. Figure 3 shows the basic architecture of MapReduce where the workers nodes are. MapReduce operates in rounds, each consisting of two phases, namely Map and Reduce phases."}, {"heading": "2.2 Fault tolerant graph architecture", "text": "While MapReduce and its various implementations process data in batch mode, they are not very meaningful when there are complex computational dependencies between the data. Most machine learning and statistical methods inhibit high data dependencies, so MapReduce is not the best architecture for them. To achieve this, alternative architectures are needed to efficiently handle complex and iterative problems, while fault tolerance is also important for scalability, since they are unreliable networks like the Internet. To achieve this, an error-tolerant graph-based architecture, called GraphLab, was first proposed by Low et al. [34] and later by many other big data solutions that adopted similar architectures. In this architecture, computation is divided among nodes in heterogeneous ways, each of which performs certain tasks. The data model is divided into two parts, i) a graph node with computational nodes, and ii) a shared global memory."}, {"heading": "2.3 Streaming graph architecture", "text": "The graph architecture discussed above enables scalable distributed computation, complex data dependence between operations, efficient iterative processing, and error tolerance. However, due to its high disk read / write load, it is not efficient for stream data. Although there are packages to perform analysis of stream data on the MapReduce architecture, such as Spark Streaming21, they convert stream data internally into batches for processing. Stream applications also require in-memory processing for high bandwidth. However, the well-known Message Passing Interface (MPI) [35] is a good solution to this problem. At the application level, MPI has a similar API to MapReduce, and almost all MapReduce programs can be implemented with MPI. Figure 5 shows the graph architecture for large-scale distributed processing, high-bandwidth, and iterative applications with high data dependence between operations."}, {"heading": "3 MACHINE LEARNING FOR BIG DATA ANALYTICS", "text": "In fact, most people are able to feel as if they are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "3.1 Feature Selection", "text": "The main focus of the selection is on selecting relevant and non-redundant data that can enhance the performance of a learning method."}, {"heading": "3.2 Supervised Learning", "text": "The goal of a supervised learning model is to predict the class ratios of test instances based on the knowledge gained from the available training instances. [48] The goal of a supervised learning family is to differentiate between classification models that focus on predicting discrete (categorical) outputs or regression models that predict continuous results that are linear and nonlinear density-based classifiers, decision trees, naive bayes, supporting vector machines (SVMs), neural networks, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) are the most commonly used methods in many applications. [47] [48] In big data analysis, we need some advanced superordinate approaches for parallel parallel parallel and distributed learning such as multi-hyperplane machine (MM) classification model [49], dividing, and neural network classifiers."}, {"heading": "3.3 Unsupervised learning", "text": "Unattended learning does not use the class names of objects for learning [63]. Clustering is an uncontrolled technique that attempts to group objects to optimize the criterion that minimizes the distance between objects within the same cluster and maximizes the distance between objects in different clusters [61]. An important problem with clusters is calculating the distance between an object pair. A cluster is a group of objects that are close to each other in terms of their mutual distance. In other words, they are similar in nature across the entire set of characteristics. However, in a number of applications, all characteristics are used while the distance between an object pair is calculated. A cluster is a group of objects that are close to each other in terms of their mutual distance. In other words, they are similar in nature across the entire set of characteristics."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Existing clustering methods", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where it is only a matter of time before a solution is found, in which a solution is found."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Clustering methods for Big Data", "text": "This year, it has reached the point where it will be able to retaliate."}, {"heading": "3.4 Deep Learning", "text": "Deep Learning attempts to model high-level abstractions into data using monitored and / or unattended learning algorithms to learn from multiple levels of abstractions. It uses hierarchical representations of data for classification. Deep Learning methods have been used in many applications, namely: pattern recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Due to the exponential growth of data in these applications, deep learning is useful for accurately predicting voluminous data. In recent years, researchers have developed effective and scalable parallel algorithms for training depth models [106]. Many organizations use deep learning for decision making, information gathering, and semantic indexing. A deep learning architecture is shown in Figure 7. Input data is divided into multiple samples for data start-ups. Intermediate layers are used to process functions on multiple levels for predicting data."}, {"heading": "3.5 Inference of Large Scale GRN with Association Rule Mining", "text": "In systems biology, complex dynamic behavior of a group of genes and how it influences the expression of other genes can be represented as GRN. By comparing normal and diseased networks, potential drug targets for the target disease can be identified [110]. Research laboratories produce a large number of expression data, and therefore the most advanced inference techniques are insufficient to handle such large, continuous, and heterogeneous data. Microarray experiments conducted in different growth environments lead to heterogeneous data. [111], [112] The presence of stability and disturbance expression data makes the task of concluding more difficult. Considering the extent of difficulties in handling such large, continuous, and heterogeneous data, the task of GRN inference can be considered a big data analysis problem [111], [117]. Specialized inference methods in the big data paradigm are much more necessary. [A number of inference 115-116, 117] they have been proposed in the last 113 years [117]."}, {"heading": "3.5.1 Serial Association Mining", "text": "The AIS (Agrawal, Imielinski, Swami) [120] and Apriori [121] are two groundbreaking algorithms for the mining association rule Although they are robust, two major limitations are that they generate too many candidate item sets and require too many passes across the entire database. SETM [122] was motivated by the desire to use SQL to calculate large item sets, while DHP (Direct Hashing and Pruning) attempts to reduce the number of candidate item sets [123]. The partition approach [124] mines frequent item sets from large data sets by splitting them into smaller partitions, while the sample [125] reduces the number of database scans."}, {"heading": "3.5.2 Distributed and Parallel Association Mining", "text": "Sequential techniques are insufficient to provide scalability in terms of dimension, size or data distributed across geographically dispersed locations. To cope with such circumstances, researchers are looking for powerful parallel and distributed association techniques. In recent years, a number of such techniques have been developed, mostly extensions of existing sequential methods.The Count Distribution [131] is a simple parallelization of apriori counting. This algorithm minimizes communication since only the counts are exchanged between the processors. However, the algorithm replicates the entire hash tree on each processor and does not effectively use the memory of the aggregate system. PDM [132] is based on DHP [123]. In PDM, each processor generates the local supports of 1-item sets and approximate counts for the 2-item sets with a hash table. Next, PDM inherits local counts for all 13 candidates and exchanges them between all 13 global processors and 1-item counts."}, {"heading": "3.5.3 Dynamic Association Mining", "text": "In practice, no transaction database is static. A later update of the data set could potentially invalidate existing association rules. Database updates require a rediscovery of the rules by scanning all of the old and new data. Rediscovering rules with database updates leads to time-consuming calculations and leads to significant I / O overhead costs. Database dynamics can be represented as i) incremental updates and ii) decreasing updates. A number of efficient techniques have been developed for the removal of dynamic datasets.Fast UPdate (FUP) [136] has been proposed to calculate large item sets in a dataset that is updated regularly. The framework of FUP is similar to that of Apriori and DHP and is called the k-pass algorithm because it k-times scans the datasets."}, {"heading": "4 CHALLENGES AND ISSUES IN BIG DATA ANALYTICS", "text": "Bioinformatics research has rapidly become a big data problem in recent years. Big data not only has volume, speed and diversity, but it is also incremental and dispersed. These characteristics of big data make it extremely difficult for traditional data analysis to work extremely quickly and accurately. Machine learning methods can prove useful in dealing with big data analysis, as they have evolved in the field of computer science with goals such as performance and efficiency. In the previous section, the methods of machine learning for bioinformatics, the existing ones as well as those developed for dealing with big data, are discussed. In this section, some of the challenges and research questions in big data analysis are summarised with methods of machine learning."}, {"heading": "4.1 Challenges in big data analytics", "text": "The techniques used to analyze and visualize traditional databases are not enough for big data. Volume, speed, diversity, distribution and incremental nature of such data pose challenges to traditional methods of data analysis, and the volume and speed of data transmission is growing rapidly. Napatech, a manufacturer of high-speed network accelerators, reported in 2014 that all network data will grow at an annual rate of 23% by 2018. Exponential growth in the use of handheld devices and related sensors in recent years has largely contributed to the growth of big data. Along with the increase in data volume, the speed of data generation and transmission is also increasing. According to the Cisco report [140], the average speed of mobile network connectivity in 1683 kbps is expected to reach approximately 4.0 Mbps by 2019. Real-time analytics on big data is hampered by high data speeds."}, {"heading": "4.2 Issues in big data Analytics", "text": "Big data analytics requires processing an enormous amount of structured, semi-structured, poly-structured and unstructured data that grows over time. Real-time analytics is an additional requirement for time-bound computation. AI techniques can be used to find patterns and relationships in unstructured data. Similarly, big data analytics can be scaled using parallel and distributed computer technologies without compromising the accuracy of results. 2) Distributed computing is the primary solution for dealing with the huge volume of data discussed hereafter 1) An integrated big data analytics architecture that is fault-tolerant and capable of processing large and diverse data in batches and in a continuous stream in real-time is still the best solution to handle the enormous volume of data."}, {"heading": "5 TOOLS FOR BIG DATA ANALYTICS IN BIOINFORMATICS", "text": "The tools that were developed before the great data age are largely standalone and not designed for very large amounts of data. Over the last decade, many large data analysis tools have been developed for different problems, such as microarray data analysis, which is not suitable for processing large amounts of data, but for analyzing cloud computing infrastructures, PPI complexity tools, PPI complexity, and sequence analysis, which are also suitable for analyzing cloud computing infrastructures. In addition to specific tools, several cloud-based bioinformatics platforms, several cloud-based bioinformatics platforms have also been developed to integrate specific tools and to provide a quick comprehensive solution to multiple problems, such as the expression of Galaxy [144] and CloudBLAST].1) Microarray data analysis tools have been provided large tools to perform various analysis tools on a microarray data base."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper discusses the recent rise of bioinformatics data repositories in terms of both volume and dimension, and with the advent of new high throughput and cheap data acquisition tools, this rapid growth of data will continue over the coming years. Bioinformatics data is voluminous, heterogeneous, incremental and geographically distributed around the world. Consequently, the methods of big data analytics are needed to solve the problems in bioinformatics. Problems, data sources and data types in bioinformatics are manifold. Existing big data architectures do not offer a comprehensive solution for big data analytics that is fast, fault tolerant, large, incremental, distributed and optimized for iterative and complex calculations."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The authors would like to thank the Indian Ministry of Human Resources Development Govt. of India for funding as a centre of excellence with a focus on machine learning research and big data analytics for the period 2014-2019."}], "references": [{"title": "Data-intensive applications, challenges, techniques and technologies: A survey on big data", "author": ["C.P.

The machine learning methods used in bioinformatics are iterative and parallel. These methods can be scaled to handle big data using the distributed and parallel computing technologies. Usually big data tools perform computation in batch-mode and are not optimized for iterative processing and high data dependency among operations. In the recent years, parallel, incremental, and multi-view machine learning algorithms have been proposed. Similarly, graph-based architectures and in-memory big data tools have been developed to minimize I/O cost and optimize iterative processing. However, there lack standard big data architectures and tools for many important bioinformatics problems, such as fast construction of co-expression and regulatory networks and salient module identification, detection of complexes over growing protein-protein interaction data, fast analysis of massive DNA, RNA, and protein sequence data, and fast querying on incremental and heterogeneous disease networks. This paper addresses the issues and challenges posed by several big data problems in bioinformatics, and gives an overview of the state of the art and the future research opportunities.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
