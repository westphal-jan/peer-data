Individuals who are linked to each other by different types of relationships, such as dependencies of goals, conflicts over resources, similar beliefs and so on compose organizations and alliances. Since the eighties, several studies have been conducted with the theory of MAS to represent models of social phenomena. Axelrod in [1] argues that the object of these studies is the use of the theory of MAS to break down simplified definitions on a particular subject, due to the need of the model to be mathematically comprehensible, which represent social phenomena models of social phenomena that are able to materialize."}, {"heading": "2. Background", "text": "In this section we present an overview of the literature on the research areas Multiagent Systems (MAS) and Social Network Analysis (SNA)."}, {"heading": "2.1. Multi-Agents Systems", "text": "The metaphor of intelligence used by these systems is the intelligent community in which social behavior is the basis for system intelligence. On this basis, we can distribute agents in areas of specialization, and through interaction between them, a complex problem can be solved more quickly and dynamically [2]. The metaphor often used to structure the agent society is the human social groups in which teams of experts can solve problems cooperatively, and the complexity exceeds the individual abilities of each of their members [3]. An agent's autonomy allows him to make his own decisions in order to achieve his goals [4]. In this way, agents can enter and exit society, their rules, roles, interdependent relationships with other agents, etc. This characteristic leads to a new generation of systems and distributed applications based on intrinsically dynamic, open, and complex models. The notion of agents and multi-agent systems has been incorporated into the modeling of various systems, which include a variety of logistics. [6]"}, {"heading": "2.2. Social Network Analysis", "text": "In this area, the relative links (a.k.arelational ties) between the social actors are examined. SNA is fundamentally different from other studies, which focus not on the attributes of the actors, but on the connections between them. Relations between the actors are established by the relative ties or links."}, {"heading": "3. Social Network Analysis and Multi-Agent Systems", "text": "One of the biggest questions about social network analysis is: \"It is well known that social networks can be used to analyze human societies, but these can also be used for societies of agents?\" An uncomfortable and often questionable point on social network analysis is that usually a transcription of social structures into sociological meanings is made in a clear and artificial way, due to the complexity of individuals and their relationships. On the other hand, the simplicity in the social terms of multiagent systems suggests that the analysis of social networks can be applied to them, including even better results. In the networking of two areas of studies, one of the points of attention is the level of approach to be carried out. A multiagent system is built from the specification of the smallest entity: the agent. Behaviour and structures are emerging consequences of their interaction with social networks."}, {"heading": "4. Social Network Analysis\u2019 based Reasoning for Multi-Agent Team Composition", "text": "On the basis [18], the proposed prototype of the multi-agent company is made up of N agents, A {1} agent is a simple but intuitive multi-agent cooperation system. It is a multi-agent company for the dynamic formation of teams, where teams of agents are formed spontaneously and in a decentralized form as soon as the decision of an agent in the fulfillment of a team of tasks is carried out from the base in his local social network. In the proposed model, a series of tasks is generated periodically and are advertised globally for the multi-agent company. The role of the agents in this company forms teams to solve these tasks. The participating agents of this company are involved in a social network, in which an agent involved in a team must have a social connection (i.e. an edge in the network) with at least one member of the team. Once this prototype focuses on the team building process, when these teams are considered to have completed the task."}, {"heading": "4.3. Communication Protocols", "text": "All SNA-based arguments can be mapped using a set of communication protocols to establish a standard mechanism for forming a task-solving team. This protocol consists of a series of messages with ACL (Agent Communication Language) that specify which actions are performed on the agent's social network. The process begins when the manager agent sends a suggestion message to the task agent. The task agent sends this message to all task agents. If a particular task agent has one of the skills required for the task, it sends an acceptance-suggestion message to the task agent. After all suggestions are received, the task agent justifies the use of SNA metrics and sends acceptance-suggestion messages to the agents who have been accepted, and rejects them. Agents who receive acceptance are now obliged to a team and no longer respond to the suggestions of the task agent. The dispatcher agent checks fully after a period of time."}, {"heading": "5. Final Considerations", "text": "These two theories contribute to shaping and understanding social phenomena in a variety of ways. This work concerned understanding how social networks can improve the process of modelling multi-agent systems.The integration between the two areas can take place in two ways: macro and micro-modelling. Macro-modelling consists in using the existing metrics in SNA to analyse multi-agent behaviourals.Given the inherent distribution of multi-agent systems and the high degree of interaction in the MAS society, it is important to have a tool that helps validate the proposed model. On the other hand, micro-modelling builds agents that use social network metrics in their behaviour.Thus, the interaction between agents can generate new social phenomena and allow them to make a decision based on their social network.The prototype used this approach and showed how an agency can be built to solve a set of tasks in the social network structure."}], "references": [{"title": "Advancing the art of simulation in the social sciences", "author": ["R.
