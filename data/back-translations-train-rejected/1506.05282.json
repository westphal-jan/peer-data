We started talking about Dynamic Logic when I was a doctoral student, when we met at seminars at MIT (my consultant Albert Meyer was at MIT even though I was at Harvard, and Rohit was at Boston University at the time). I appreciated Rohit's breadth, his quick insights, his intellect, and his inviting and endearing style. Rohit has been interested in the interplay of logic, philosophy, and language since I've known him. Over the years, we've both been interested in game theory. I'd like to devote this short section to discussing all these issues."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "When economists know this, they usually do it on a semantic (or secondary) level.

Indeed, one of the most important questions of logicians when considering a particular syntactic formalism is its expressiveness, that is, what events can be described by formulas in language. However, using an expressive formalism has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are well illustrated by considering the characterization of common previous assumptions. (CPA) Syntactically, a language that has knowledge operators and, moreover, the belief in the form of language (f), which is interpreted as \"agent i,\" is the probability of f. \"Feinberg has no general knowledge in his language."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "The point of this brief remark should be obvious: there are times when the syntax is useful, despite its overhead. Moreover, game theorists like Molie Yres \"M. Jourdain, who discovers that he has spoken prose all his life [Molie Yre 2013], have often used syntax without recognizing it (or at least without explicitly acknowledging its use), but they have not always used it to its full extent. That is, as I have shown in [Halpern 1999], there are times when semantics is useful, and the overhead of the syntax is not worth it. Semantic proofs of validity are typically much easier to perform than their syntactic counterparts (as anyone who has tried to prove the validity of even a simple formula like K)."}], "references": [{"title": "Notes on interactive epistemology", "author": ["R.J.
