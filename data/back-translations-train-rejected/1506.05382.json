The system predicts the success of a movie based on its profitability by leveraging historical data from various sources. Using social network analysis and text mining techniques, the system automatically extracts several groups of features, including \"who\" are on the cast, \"what\" a movie is about, \"when\" a movie will be released, as well as \"hybrid\" features that match \"who\" with \"what\", and \"when\" with \"what\". Our experiments with movies during an 11-year period showcase the system's decent performance in predicting movie success. Moreover, experiment results also suggest that different groups of features, including novel features we proposed, all contribute to the prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Jun 2015 16:40:48 GMT  (397kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05382v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 29 Jan 2016 20:10:52 GMT  (1109kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05382v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SI", "authors": ["michael t lash", "kang zhao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.05382"}, "pdf": {"name": "1506.05382.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Early Predictions of Movie Success: the Who, What, and When of Profitability", "authors": ["Michael T.

The first phase is data collection, as we base our prediction on historical data. While there are various online archives of movie data, we chose two popular and complementary sources - IMDb and BoxOfficeMojo. IMDb provides better coverage of movie action synopses, while BoxOfficeMojo, as the name suggests, provides more comprehensive data on movie revenue and budgets. In other words, the two data sources can be used together for many movies. As with data collection methods, the two sources are different. IMDb has a handy API that can be used to collect movie data in JSON or XML. Data from BoxOfficeMojo can only be obtained from websites. To get a more comprehensive dataset, our system uses scripts that interact with APIs as well as a webscaper to retrieve and analyze HTML data from websites."}, {"heading": "4 Feature engineering", "text": "Based on historical data from online archives, we derive new and proven characteristics for our prediction model.

Talented individuals like these can use not only their ingenious skills in the industry to make high-quality films, but also the associated \"brand effect\" that attracts crowds and increases revenue [2, 8, 22], an effect typically referred to as \"star power.\" Our star power characteristics for a film are as follows: 1. An actor's tenure reflects how much experience he can have in the industry. It is calculated as the time difference (in years) between the film in which an actor / actress last appeared and the one in which he / she first appeared. For each film, we calculate the average and total tenure for his / her first cast / actor."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Network-based Features", "text": "It is one of the greatest challenges in the history of the country, in which we have set out to travel the world, to experience the world, how the world has moved into a new world, to experience the world, in which we are moving into a new world, in which we are moving into a new world, in which we are moving into a new world, in which we are moving into a new world, in which we are moving into a world, in which we are moving into a new world."}, {"heading": "4.2 \u201cWhat\u201d Features", "text": "In order to reflect what a film is about, the \"what\" characteristics in our model are both meta-characteristics such as genre (e.g. action, science fiction, family) and ratings (e.g. PG13 and R), as well as a fine-grained description of the content of a film - its plot connections. In text mining, texts from plot summaries can be presented as traditional unigrams and bigrams, but such representation will have a high dimensionality and consequently suffers from scarcity. At a higher level, theme model techniques, such as latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) [4], can give a better picture of what an action is about. Input for LDA is a text corpus of plot summaries and the output is a group of themes."}, {"heading": "4.3 \u201cWhen\u201d Features", "text": "Since the film industry is a path to entertainment, its market sees peaks and troughs over time that indicate how well a pre-production film might fare in the future. Therefore, we have included the following \"when\" characteristics in our model: 1. Average annual profit: is the average profit of all films in the year preceding the planned release of the film. This feature captures the overall profitability of the film industry prior to the release of a film. 2. Release dates: combines several features about when a film is released, including whether it is a holiday start and which season of the year (spring, summer, autumn, winter). While a holiday or summer start can attract more audiences and thus generate more revenue [1], it also requires a higher budget for marketing and distribution during these competitive periods. Although the exact release date before shooting is not fully set, a target path usually exists in the early stages of film production."}, {"heading": "4.4 Hybrid Features", "text": "In addition to standalone features about \"who\" is in a movie, \"what\" is in a movie \"and\" when \"a movie will be released, it is also important to note the\" consistency \"between those features. Our hybrid features try to reflect such similarities between\" what \"and\" who \"and between\" what \"and\" when. \"For example, it may be important to build a team of actors based on their previous experience with the genre of the planned film, rather than just on their star power. Similarly, investing in a movie whose genre is gaining popularity can increase the chances of success."}, {"heading": "4.4.1 \u201cWhat\u201d + \u201cWho\u201d", "text": "In looking at the film industry as a whole, and the actors who tell the stories, we can distinguish various so-called \"roles\" that these actors seem to take on. For example, Seth Rogan is typified by his appearance in comedies, and Bruce Willis shows a skill as an action movie star. If a movie then allows this observation, we try to include those who have extensive experience in their genre, a surprising cast will attract a larger audience to the cinema (for example, with Bruce Willis in a comedy or with action star Arnold Schwartzenegger in a romantic love story)? To measure the experience and expertise so far in films that we define, for each actor or actress, a genre vector Aj = 1, aj, k, K], K, where the percentage of actors is equal to the number of actors."}, {"heading": "4.4.2 \u201cWhat\u201d + \u201cWhen\u201d", "text": "Similar to the overall market volume for films, which can vary from year to year, consumer preferences for movies can change over time. For example, while movies like \"American Pie\" and \"National Lampoon's Van Wilder\" were popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, moviegoers have recently flocked to horror films like \"Paranormal Activity\" and superheroes like \"The Avengers\" and \"Captain America.\" Although the latter category is nothing definitively new on the big screen, the film industry has experienced greater success in recent years with this particular focus and, as such, a greater influx of such films. So, in addition to capturing \"when\" a movie is released, we also look at how films of a similar genre fared profitably last year with the following characteristics: 1. Annual share of genre profitability is the percentage of profit-derived movies of genre that derive the same genre from genre."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Dataset and Basic Statistics", "text": "Our original dataset, collected by both BoxOfficeMojo and IMDb, consisted of 14,097 films, along with 4,420 actors. While the films in our dataset date back to 1921, we focused our study on films released during the 11-year period of 2000-2010 (including), as this period is young enough to reflect the current state of the industry, and there has been sufficient time elapsed since the films were released for revenue data to be accurately updated. Since our goal is to predict the success of the film based on profits, our dataset for experimentation included only those films that have both budget and revenue, and we excluded films with an \"unknown\" genre or \"unknown\" MPAA rating. Movies with a \"documentary\" genre were also excluded, as they are generally not released in theaters and may not involve professional actors."}, {"heading": "5.2 The measure of success", "text": "To predict whether a film is successful, we first need to measure the return on investment (ROI) of a film. As both revenue and budget data are available for each film in our dataset, we can calculate the gross return (i.e. the return budget) for each film. Gross return distribution in Figure 4 seems to follow a normal distribution - a large number of films have near-zero returns. As only 36% of the films in our dataset have positive returns, investors need a decision support system to help them choose the right film to invest in. Although using return values is intuitive, the $10,000 gain from a film that costs $1 million to produce is certainly not an attractive investment. Therefore, in our experiments we have chosen a popular metric for return on investment (ROI), as in [9]. It takes into account both profit and budget and is defined in Equation 6. The higher the ROI, the more profitable a film is and vice versa."}, {"heading": "5.3 Classification results", "text": "Predicting the success of a film is essentially a classification problem, where we classify films into discrete containers or classes. Then, the problem is to decide whether a film should be considered a success or not, based on ROI. Although there is no agreed \"gold standard\" for an ideal ROI (except that \"higher is better\"), it is reasonable to assume that you want to see some substantial returns from a successful film, since millions of dollars are invested with significant risks. Also, any form of profit is better than a loss. Against this background, we have chosen to define the boundary between successful and unsuccessful films in different ways, for both binary and multi-class predictions."}, {"heading": "5.3.1 Binary classification", "text": "In the case of binary classifications, a film is divided into one of two classes: successful or unsuccessful films. Two decision limits are evaluated, and both ensure that a sufficient ROI is garnished if a film is considered successful. 1. The first decision limit is that a film is considered successful if its ROI is within 30% of all films. To our dataset, this profitability threshold means a ROI of 24%. The performance of the two best classification algorithms is listed in Table 2, with a Random Forest classifier (n = 200) generating the highest AUC and a logistic regression classifier leading in accuracy and F1 Score.Table 3 shows the results when a group of features is removed from the classifier. As can be seen, the performance of the classifier deteriorates when a group of features is removed, indicating that each of the five groups, including the novel features we have proposed, contributes to predicting child success."}, {"heading": "5.3.2 Multi-class classification", "text": "In the case of multi-class classifications, we define three possible classes for a film: positive (\"success\"), negative (\"failure\") or neutral (\"average\"), in order to provide the investor with more information on where he could expect a film to decline in terms of profitability. In terms of multi-class prediction, we investigated the costs associated with a misclassification, because the three classes are ordinary, while binary classes are nominal. In other words, not all errors in misclassification of a film are equally serious. For example, predicting success in supporting investment decisions would be worse than predicting a neutral film. The cost matrix for multi-class classification is in Table 6 - the penalty for classification of a successful film as failure is 2, and vice versa, while the penalty for only a misclassification by a proper category (i.e., success as neutral as failure, etc.) is higher than the multi-class classification is in Table 6 - the penalty for classification of a successful film as failure is 2, and vice versa, the penalty for only a misclassification by a proper category (i.e. success as neutral as failure, etc.) is higher than the multi-class classification, but the multi-class classification results in a higher cost of a successful film as a failure is 2, while the cost of a pre-negative classification is 2 is higher than the positive classification of a pre-negative classification of a positive-negative 1-negative 1."}, {"heading": "6 Discussions", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Important features for prediction", "text": "In illustrating the performance of our prediction models, we also showed that each of the five sets of characteristics contributed differently to the prediction. In addition to the five sets of characteristics, it is also important to understand the contributions of our individual characteristics. First, we ranked characteristics based on their information gain. Table 8 lists top characteristics in each characteristic category and their overall ranking among all 111 characteristics of our prediction model. As we can observe, each category contains characteristics that rank among all characteristics in the top 50. Many of the new characteristics that we have proposed are highly rated in several categories, such as cast novelty, change in clustering coefficient, annual weighted profitability by genre, and annual profitability performance by genre. We also acknowledge that several \"classic\" characteristics that were typically included in film-related prediction models were also considered significant contributors, including an \"R\" rating success by genre and the Foreign Relationship of an actor's \"star rating among all of the categories."}, {"heading": "6.2 Predictability", "text": "In order to better understand which types of films are more predictable in terms of profitability, we analyzed the predictability of films based on the period of release and the Star Powers, since films released during the holidays or with high Star Powers often generate high box office revenues [19, 20]. Predictability is measured by predictive accuracy. However, it turns out that these films, which are likely to generate high revenues, are also the most difficult to predict: films that sell better at the box office (6a) and films with the highest Star Powers (6b) receive the least predictability. The low predictability of profits for these films, which are likely to generate high revenues, further illustrates the discrepancy between revenues and profits: films that sell better at the box office may also require larger investments and therefore do not necessarily guarantee satisfactory returns for investors. This uncertainty about the success of high-stakes films underscores the need for our decision-making component, in addition to the fact that we always anticipate high performance from the previous system."}, {"heading": "6.3 Limitations", "text": "Admittedly, our study has limitations. First, as we have already mentioned, there are potential distortions in our sample. As Figure 3 shows, our data set is relatively representative in terms of film genres. However, the limited availability of both budget and revenue data could lead to a distortion of our data set for the experiment, even though we exclude only 17% of all films produced within the 11-year period, as both types of data are missing. Another limitation is that the profit we calculate is based on production budgets and box office revenue. For many films, box office revenue is only one source. For example, Disney's animated films often generate a significant portion of their revenue from the sale of film merchandise such as clothing and toys. In addition to ticket sales, some films also depend heavily on the sale and rental of DVDs. However, capturing this revenue outside the box office is more difficult as they may continue to accumulate for many years after the release of a film."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and future work", "text": "MIAS learns from freely available historical data from various sources and tries to predict the success of films that are defined by profitability, not revenue, as most studies have done. Because investment decisions are made very early in the production process, our system uses only data that is available early. These features include both classic and novel features that were first proposed, describing \"who\" is cast from both an individual and a network perspective, \"which\" includes a movie in terms of genre, rating and plot synopsis issues when \"a movie is released, as well as\" hybrid \"features that\" coincide with \"what\" and \"when.\" Our experiments are based on 11 years of films that show that MIAS can do a decent job in predicting the success of films. In addition, various sets of features, including new features that we propose to capture the impact of this framework, will not coincide with the popularity of films. \""}], "references": [{"title": "Prediction of Movies Box Office Performance Using Social Media", "author": ["K.R.
