While promoting the quality of research in many cases, an intense competition among scientists can also trigger unethical scientific behaviors. To increase the total number of published papers, some authors even resort to software tools that are able to produce grammatical, but meaningless scientific manuscripts. Because automatically generated papers can be misunderstood as real papers, it becomes of paramount importance to develop means to identify these scientific frauds. In this paper, I devise a methodology to distinguish real manuscripts from those generated with SCIGen, an automatic paper generator. Upon modeling texts as complex networks (CN), it was possible to discriminate real from fake papers with at least 89\\% of accuracy. A systematic analysis of features relevance revealed that the accessibility and betweenness were useful in particular cases, even though the relevance depended upon the dataset. The successful application of the methods described here show, as a proof of principle, that network features can be used to identify scientific gibberish papers. In addition, the CN-based approach can be combined in a straightforward fashion with traditional statistical language processing methods to improve the performance in identifying artificially generated papers.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Jun 2015 14:46:15 GMT  (2802kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05702v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 28 Jul 2015 15:50:56 GMT  (2802kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05702v2", "To appear in Scientometrics (2015)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["diego r amancio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.05702"}, "pdf": {"name": "1506.05702.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Comparing the topological properties of real and artificially generated scientific manuscripts", "authors": ["Diego Raphael Amancio"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords scientific fraud \u00b7 SCIgen \u00b7 complex networks \u00b7 plagiarism"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "2 Related works", "text": "Several methods have been developed to identify the authenticity of scientific manuscripts. Such methods can be classified according to the type of information used as characteristics of classifiers. Normally, the list of references plays an important role in the task. Thus, for example, it has been shown that if many cited references cannot be found online, then there is a high probability that the paper to be analyzed is forged [17]. Many heuristics rely on the text content to derive the authenticity of documents [18, 19]. The study developed in [20] proposes some useful rules. One of the main rules checks whether keywords occur frequently in the title and in the abstraction in the body of the paper. If such a pattern does not occur, the document is considered forged. Another interesting observation underlines that real scientific work usually mentions keywords from the titles of cited papers."}, {"heading": "3 Complex networks and text analysis", "text": "Of particular interest to the objectives of this study are the applications in automatic summary [26, 27], machine translation [28, 29], complexity analysis [30-34] and author recognition [35,36]. In all these tasks, the networks derived from the so-called word adjacency model (see section 4.1) enabled a precise characterization of texts in terms of specific textual characteristics. Networked models even allowed the characterization of unknown manuscripts [37] and many other linguistic aspects [38-42. Interestingly, the individual characteristics of each language can also be classified in terms of the topological structure of complex networks [43-45]. A more detailed overview of the application of network methods in text analysis can be found in [46]. Unlike conventional approaches, the method proposed here focuses on the structure and organization of texts and not on textual setic content."}, {"heading": "4 Methodology", "text": "The method used to compare real and forged manuscripts is illustrated in Figure 1. Firstly, the text of the scientific article is obtained by automatically removing the latex tags from the original texts. As some unwanted symbols may still remain in the text, the output is checked manually. Subsequent studies quantify the styles of each text by means of topological characterization of complex networks (graphics). Therefore, the texts are modeled as complex networks. Then, several connectivity measurements are extracted from the networks. In the next step, the measurements are used as characteristics to distinguish between real and forged manuscripts. Discrimination is performed using pattern recognition methods.The most important steps represented in Figure 1 below.4.1 Modeling texts as complex networksA networks are defined as a set of nodes connected by edges. To represent a network, it is taken into account that {A = matrix} is the structure of the matrix."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "In this study, the style of real and forged manuscripts was compared. < As forged manuscripts, the texts generated by the SCIGen algorithm were successfully compared with the style of real manuscripts obtained from the following sources: (a) the Pattern Recognition Letters Journal (PRL) [60]; (b) the arXiv repository, which includes computer science papers (arXiv / cs) [61]; and (c) the Journal of Informetrics (JI) [62]. Four hundred manuscripts were used in the experiments. Note that most of the measurements presented in Section 4.2 are local measurements, so each node is associated with a certain value. To characterize each manuscript, I used the global distribution of measurements for all the words in the manuscript."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In the current paper, I have examined the hypothesis that artificially generated manuscripts can be distinguished from real scientific work by topological characterization of complex networks (worst case scenario).The combination of network features (taken from the word neighborhood model) and machine learning methods enabled the correct identification of SCIGen work (worst case scenario) in 89% of cases, meaning that there are hidden patterns in the organization of work produced by SCIGen that differ from the structural patterns resulting from real text. Although the techniques presented in this manuscript do not exceed those based on textual content, they could be used in applications where the complementarity of the proposed attributes plays a prominent role in distinguishing texts with similar content [42,63]."}], "references": [{"title": "Diffusion of scientific credits and the ranking of scientists", "author": ["F.

witnessed the increase of competition in science. While promoting the quality of research in many cases, an intense competition among scientists can also trigger unethical scientific behaviors. To increase the total number of published papers, some authors even resort to software tools that are able to produce grammatical, but meaningless scientific manuscripts. Because automatically generated papers can be misunderstood as real papers, it becomes of paramount importance to develop means to identify these scientific frauds. In this paper, I devise a methodology to distinguish real manuscripts from those generated with SCIGen, an automatic paper generator. Upon modeling texts as complex networks (CN), it was possible to discriminate real from fake papers with at least 89% of accuracy. A systematic analysis of features relevance revealed that the accessibility and betweenness were useful in particular cases, even though the relevance depended upon the dataset. The successful application of the methods described here show, as a proof of principle, that network features can be used to identify scientific gibberish papers. In addition, the CN-based approach can be combined in a straightforward fashion with traditional statistical language processing methods to improve the performance in identifying artificially generated papers.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
