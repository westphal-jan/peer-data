Although it is an open problem and also a crucial problem in the field of computer visualization, many tasks in the real world depend heavily on it or can be improved by a good estimate. For example, robots will know where to sit, how to avoid a collision while walking, and the estimate is also applicable to automatic driving."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Works", "text": "In general, there are two typical lines of research: one based on 2D representation and the other on 3D information.Among 2D-based research, [6,7,8] is based on point matching, which is now obsolete. By linking diagnostic parts of the object from different angles, [9] an object category represents a collection of visual invariant regions. Sun et al. [10] and Su et al. [17] used a generative approach to group local features into parts and then learn sub-locations from different angles. [11] A SIFT-like [18] spatial pyramid of histograms have a feature to form an SVM classifier for each discrete pose. Inspired by the success of the deformable partial model [12], [13] trained a DPM using a semi-latent approach where the components coincide with discrete points of view."}, {"heading": "2 Data Collection and", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Training Data", "text": "As we mentioned in Section 1, we gathered our training data from ShapeNet, an emerging 3D shape model database. With 9,135,135 semantically annotated 3D models across thousands of object categories, ShapeNet was able to provide ample information for many visual tasks. In our task, we used these 5,057 chair models in ShapeNet. For each model, we rendered it to 16 evenly distributed viewing angles on the horizontal circle shown in Figure 1. We selected 4,000 models, corresponding to 64,000 images, to create the training data set, and left the remaining 1,057 models as our rendered image test set (validation set). Before extracting the image features, we first resize the images to 112 x 112 pixels and then divide them into 6 x 6 overlapped patch grids, with patch size 32 x 32 and patch strips 16 on both axes. After preprocessing, we extract a 576-36-dimensional image that can be represented by any workout-dimensional Hock 7G feature."}, {"heading": "2.2 Test Data", "text": "In order to comprehensively assess the performance of our learning algorithm, we have built three different test kits with increasing difficulty: rendered image test kits, real image test kits with clean backgrounds, and crowded test kits with real backgrounds. As already mentioned in paragraph 2.1, the rendered image test kits consist of 1057 x 16 rendered images, also from ShapeNet. Clean background and cluttered real image test kits are collected from ImageNet [3], which contains 1309 and 1000 images, respectively, both with manually labeled ground truth of view. Some sample images are shown in Figure 3. Obviously, these three data sets are increasingly noisy and therefore difficult to manipulate.For image preprocessing and the extraction of functions on the test kits, we used the same scheme as the train set, meaning that each image is converted into a 20736-dimensional HoG function."}, {"heading": "3 Model", "text": "Instead of using the global image function as input for the classification, our Pose estimation model is patch based. By dividing the image into patches and creating a classifier for each patch, our model can be more resistant to occlusion and background noise. In addition, this approach reduced the feature dimension for each classifier, thus reducing sample complexity. In fact, we have tried global features, while the classification accuracy is 30% lower than the HoG function of the entire image, V = {1, \u00b7 \u00b7, V} as a discredited pose space. For each patch, we build a classifier that learns from the training data and predicts the conditional probability P (v | Fi)."}, {"heading": "4 Methods", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Learning Algorithms", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Random Forest", "text": "In this project, we chose random forest [1] as the primary classification algorithm based on its following advantages: \u2022 Suitable for classification with multiple classes. \u2022 Not parametric, easy to agree. \u2022 Fast, easy to parallel. \u2022 Robust due to randomized processing. During the classification, 36 random forest classifiers are trained for 36 fields. To balance spatial and temporal complexity and performance, we set the forest size to 100 trees. In addition, we set the maximum depth of the trees by means of cross-validation, with the optimal depth being 20. Consequently, each random forest produces a probability vector P (v | Fi). After smoothing Laplace, we calculated P (v | I), estimated the pose to v = arg maxv P (v | I)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Optimization", "text": "Building training data sets from rendered images has many advantages, but there are also disadvantages. As I mentioned in Section 1, the previous probability of a pose in real images can be very different from that in rendered images. As we know, the distribution of poses in the training set is uniform, but in real images there are many more chairs from the front than from the back.

From the test results in Figure 5, we have observed that if \u03b1 is too small, the point of view with the highest initial probability P-point (v-point) will soon take on a different point of view, and P-point (v-point) will converge to a completely distorted distribution. Whereas if \u03b1 is too large, the smoothing effect is too strong to affect P-point (v-point), this results in P-point (v-point) = P-point (v-point). However, there is an intermediate value of \u03b1 to maximize the accuracy of classification and lead to an optimal estimate P-point (v-point). In Figure 4 and 5, we will perform a deep analysis of the relationship between stable point-point (the P-point) and P-point (the P-point) curve."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Classification Performance", "text": "In Table 1, our patch-based random classification algorithm for forests (referred to as RF) often shows a promising classification result for all three sets of tests. According to our scheme, the random forest achieves 80% accuracy on a clean background and 77% accuracy on a crowded background.
