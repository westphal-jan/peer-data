Such models are used to interpret the notions of conditional belief, degrees of belief, and safe belief. The logic of conditional belief contains that modality and also the knowledge modality, and similarly for the logic of degrees of belief and the logic of safe belief. With respect to these logics, plausibility models may contain too much information. A proper notion of bisimulation is required that characterises them. We define that notion of bisimulation and prove the required characterisations: on the class of image-finite and preimage-finite models (with respect to the plausibility relation), two pointed Kripke models are modally equivalent in either of the three logics, if and only if they are bisimilar. As a result, the information content of such a model can be similarly expressed in the logic of conditional belief, or the logic of degrees of belief, or that of safe belief. This, we found a surprising result. Still, that does not mean that the logics are equally expressive: the logics of conditional and degrees of belief are incomparable, the logics of degrees of belief and safe belief are incomparable, while the logic of safe belief is more expressive than the logic of conditional belief. In view of the result on bisimulation characterisation, this is an equally surprising result. We hope our insights may contribute to the growing community of formal epistemology and on the relation between qualitative and quantitative modelling.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 Jun 2015 08:17:32 GMT  (71kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07990v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 21:43:40 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07990v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["mikkel birkegaard", "ersen", "thomas bolander", "hans van ditmarsch", "martin holm jensen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.07990"}, "pdf": {"name": "1506.07990.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Mikkel Birkegaard Andersen", "Thomas Bolander", "Hans van Ditmarsch"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 150 6.07 990v 1 [cs.A I] 2 6Ju n20 15"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of us are able to abide by the rules that they have applied in practice.

[12] In the following, we demonstrate that the identity found in [12] is also a valid identity in our logic, which is not given, since our semantics differ in essential ways. [12] In particular, we point out that our work in [12] is a standard modality for [12], whereas our semantics use the derived relation a.

Indeed, LS (equivalent to LCS cf.) falls short when it comes to expressing the degree of faith that we now continue to prove.

Our plausibility models are what [12] considers uniform and locally connected epistemic4etic models when we consider infinite versions of modalities in our logical languages, in other words, general belief modalities, we preserve the bisimulation results (for a more refined notion of bisimulation), but it is to be expected that all three logics become equally expressive (oral communication by Tim French).less plausibility models also consider the limitations of plausibility models."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Hans van Ditmarsch is also a research associate at the IMSc (Institute of Mathematical Sciences), Chennai, and thanks him for the support of the European Research Council EPS 313360.

Such models are used to interpret the notions of conditional belief, degrees of belief, and safe belief. The logic of conditional belief contains that modality and also the knowledge modality, and similarly for the logic of degrees of belief and the logic of safe belief. With respect to these logics, plausibility models may contain too much information. A proper notion of bisimulation is required that characterises them. We define that notion of bisimulation and prove the required characterisations: on the class of image-finite and preimage-finite models (with respect to the plausibility relation), two pointed Kripke models are modally equivalent in either of the three logics, if and only if they are bisimilar. As a result, the information content of such a model can be similarly expressed in the logic of conditional belief, or the logic of degrees of belief, or that of safe belief. This, we found a surprising result. Still, that does not mean that the logics are equally expressive: the logics of conditional and degrees of belief are incomparable, the logics of degrees of belief and safe belief are incomparable, while the logic of safe belief is more expressive than the logic of conditional belief. In view of the result on bisimulation characterisation, this is an equally surprising result. We hope our insights may contribute to the growing community of formal epistemology and on the relation between qualitative and quantitative modelling.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
