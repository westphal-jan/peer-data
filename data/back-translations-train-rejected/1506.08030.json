An interpretation I that I consider to be a model of ontology O (I, O) when I am responsible for all languages O (O, O). O, contains a language C (O, c) when each model of O unfolds c.

If \u03b4B \u2192 (B) > 0, then PK (c [\u221e]) = 1. In particular, if B \u2192 is irreducible and aperiodic, \u2206 B contains only a stationary distribution, which simplifies the calculation of function \u03b4. Unfortunately, such a simple characterization of PK (c [\u221e]) cannot be given if \u03b4B \u2192 (\u03c6) = 0. In this case, the result may depend greatly on the initial distribution. Example 16. Leave V = {x}, O2 = {< A v B: {x} >}, and consider the TBN B \u2032 \u2192 over V defined by P (x | x) = 1 and P (x | \u00ac x) = 0. It is easy to see that any distribution over the evaluations of V is stationary. For each initial distribution B, if K = (D, O2), where D = (B, B \u2032 \u2192 \u2192), then PK (x)."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "We have introduced a general approach to the extension of ontology languages to handle time-evolving probabilities using a DBN. Our approach can be instantiated to any language with a monotonous relationship, including, but not limited to, all members of the family of descriptive logic of knowledge representation formalisms. Our approach extends to ideas originally introduced for static probabilistic reasoning. The essence of the method is to divide an ontology into different contexts identified by a consistent set of statement variables from a previously selected finite set of variables V. Probabilistic knowledge is expressed by a probability distribution across the evaluations of V encoded by a DBN. Interestingly, our formalism allows to argue methods that exploit the properties of both, the ontological and the probabilistic components that we know best to calculate the probability components of DBN well."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Ceylan is supported by the DFG in the Research Training Group \"RoSI\" (RTG 1907), Rafael Pen aloza was partially supported by the DFG through the excellence cluster \"cfAED,\" while he was still associated with the TU Dresden and the Center for Advanced Electronics Dresden."}], "references": [{"title": "Automata-based Axiom Pinpointing", "author": ["Baader", "Pe\u00f1aloza 2010a] Franz Baader", "Rafael Pe\u00f1aloza"], "venue": "J. of Automated Reasoning,", "citeRegEx": "Baader et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baader et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Axiom Pinpointing in General Tableaux", "author": ["Baader", "Pe\u00f1aloza 2010b] Franz Baader", "Rafael Pe\u00f1aloza"], "venue": "J. of Logic and Computation,", "citeRegEx": "Baader et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baader et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Pushing the EL envelope", "author": ["Baader"], "venue": "In Proc. of IJCAI\u201905,", "citeRegEx": "Baader,? \\Q2005\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baader", "year": 2005}, {"title": "PatelSchneider, editors.
