In this paper, we consider designing wind farms composed of collaborating wind turbines. Computational intelligence is combined with rapid prototyping whereby candidate designs are physically instantiated and evaluated under fan-generated wind conditions. It is shown possible to use surrogate-assisted coevolutionary algorithms to aerodynamically optimise the potentially heterogeneous morphology of an array of 6 small scale and closely positioned vertical-axis wind turbines using the total angular kinetic energy of the array as the objective. This approach performs optimisation in the presence of complex inter-turbine wake effects and multi-directional wind flow from nearby obstacles, which is extremely difficult to achieve accurately under high fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulation. The general approach is equally applicable to the design of other forms of sustainable energy where the characteristics of the environment and/or materials involved are too difficult to accurately simulate.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Jun 2015 18:57:34 GMT  (1297kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08781v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1410.0547"], ["v2", "Sat, 25 Jul 2015 14:05:42 GMT  (1296kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08781v2", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1410.0547"], ["v3", "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 17:29:20 GMT  (1296kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08781v3", "8 pages"], ["v4", "Mon, 15 Feb 2016 14:43:39 GMT  (3288kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08781v4", null], ["v5", "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 22:09:08 GMT  (972kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08781v5", null], ["v6", "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 20:24:17 GMT  (1074kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08781v6", null]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1410.0547", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.CE", "authors": ["richard j preen", "larry bull"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.08781"}, "pdf": {"name": "1506.08781.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On Design Mining: Coevolution and Surrogate Models", "authors": ["Richard J.

In their model, an individual is represented by a genome of N (binary) genes, on which each epistatically depends on K other randomly selected genes in his genome. Thus, the elevation of K in relation to N increases epistatic linkage, thereby increasing the robustness of the fitness landscapes by increasing the number of fitness peaks overall, increasing the steepness of the sides of fitness peaks and decreasing their typical heights. Each gene is also supposed to depend on randomly selected traits in each other X species with which it interacts, increasing the number of species overall S. The adaptive movements of a species can deform the fitness landscape of its partner (s)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Evolving Wind Farms", "text": "This year, it will be able to live in a country like Germany, where it is a country, where it is a country, where it is not a country, but a country where it is a country."}, {"heading": "3 Surrogate-assisted Coevolution", "text": "The basic coevolutionary genetic algorithm (CGA) is outlined in Algorithm 1. First, all individuals in each of the species / populations must be evaluated. As no initial fitness values are known, a random individual is selected in each of the other populations to form a global solution, but if there is a known good individual, it can be used instead. CGA then cyclizes between populations, selecting the parents via a tournament and producing offspring with mutation and / or crossover, and the offspring are then evaluated with representative members from each of the other population. At each point in evolution, each individual is assigned the maximum team fitness achieved by a team in which the team ability is the sum of the fitness values of each collaborating species."}, {"heading": "4 NKCS Experimentation", "text": "In order to simulate this interacting system, we examine the case in which S = 6 and each species are influenced by their immediate neighbours, i.e. X = 1 for the first and sixth species and X = 2 for all others.

When using a substitute model, the model parameters are: N-input neurons, H = 10 hidden neurons, 1 output neuron, \u03bbm = 1000, T = 50, \u03b2 = 0.1.

mining is the use of computational intelligence techniques to iteratively search and model the attribute space of physical objects evaluated directly through rapid prototyping to meet given

It enables the exploitation of novel materials and processes without formal models or complex simulation. In this paper, we focus upon the coevolutionary nature of the design process when it is decomposed into concurrent sub-design threads due to the overall complexity of the task. Using an abstract, tuneable model of coevolution we consider strategies to sample sub-thread designs for whole system testing and how best to construct and use surrogate models within the coevolutionary scenario.
