Subtlety then consists in finding a suitable argument preference relationship so that it matches the conclusions of the justified arguments and the extensions of the PDT. We showed that none of the ASPIC + commands results in a match, and even the intuitive disjunctive elite order does not match. Then, we developed the structure preference sequence, which mimics how defaults in PDL are added when constructing extensions. We then showed that ASPIC + defense graphs constructed by LPDTs have unique stable extensions.
