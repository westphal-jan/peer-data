Representing texts as networks", "text": "There are several ways to convert texts into networks [12,15,19,28-30]. The most appropriate form depends on the context of the application. In cases where semantics is relevant, the words are linked together [20, 22, 31-33]. Similarly, other semantic models link words that appear in a given context [34, 35] (e.g. in the same sentence or paragraph). A general model for creating significant \"semantic\" links between coexisting elements was developed in [36]. More specifically, the model considers the existence of a series of elements V = {v1,.,. [vn] that may occur in one or more sentences of a given collection of texts, [S1,.]. [SN}.3 Given two elements \u03b1 V and \u03b2 \u00b2 V, the model calculates the probability that more than r-sentences in this model contain both elements."}, {"heading": "3. Topological characterization of networks", "text": "A network is defined as G = {V, E}, where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges used to connect nodes. An unweighted network can be represented by an adjacence matrix A = {aij}, where each element stores information about the connectivity of the nodes. If me and j are connected, then I can describe the most important measurements used for text analysis: Degrees: the degree of edges connected to the node, i.e. a relevant attribute related to the degree of usefulness."}, {"heading": "4. Traditional stylistic features", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Frequency of words and characters", "text": "An important contribution to styleometry was introduced by Mosteller and Wallace [50], who showed that the frequency of function words (such as of, of, a and beyond) is useful for characterizing the style in texts. Frequent words were also used in strategies developed by physicists that used the spacing of frequency levels to calculate the similarity between texts [51-53]. Another relevant feature for the characterization of styles in texts is the frequency of character bigrams (i.e. a sequence of two adjacent characters) that have proved useful, e.g., for recognizing style characteristics of certain authors [54]."}, {"heading": "Intermittence", "text": "The uneven spatial distribution of words along texts is a feature useful for characterizing the text style > > Time = > 11. Quantifying the homogeneity of the distribution of words along texts can be done by using repetition times, a standard measure used to study time series [55]. In texts, the concept of time is represented by the number of words occurring in a given interval. For each word i, the repetition time Tj is defined as the number of words occurring between two consecutive occurrences of i plus one. For example, the repetition time of the word \"stone\" is represented in the lemmatized text shown in Table 1: T1, T2 = 3, T3 = 3, T4 = 11, T5 = 1 and T6 = 5. If a word i occurs within a text, the repetition time of the word Ni-times within a text is not relevant."}, {"heading": "5. Supervised classification", "text": "In this section I will describe the two methods used to combine different strategies of classification, the aim of which is to combine evidence from both traditional and CN-based methods. Before introducing the methods for combining classifiers, the most important concepts relating to the supervised learning task will be presented.

The first component of the tuples xi = (f1 = a1, f2 = a2,.) represents the values of the attributes used to describe the i-th instance.

The second element yi-Y = {y1, y2,."}, {"heading": "Hybrid classifier", "text": "To define this classifier, consider the following definitions. Let mij be the strength that the i-instance assigns to the j-class, where 0 \u2264 mij \u2264 1. The term mij, henceforth referred to as membership strength, can be interpreted as the probability that instance i belongs to class j. Note, however, that the quantification of mij depends on the classifier used. A detailed description of the methods for calculating membership strength can be found in [27, 58-61]. Let m (R) ij be the membership strength used by the instance of complex networks, and m (T) ij the membership strength obtained in the analysis of traditional statistical characteristics. According to the hybrid strategy, the combination of both topological and traditional methods is linked to the following convex combinationm (H) ij = m (R) ij + (1 \u2212 H) ij, where the limit of membership is correct, (T) between the [ij], where the difference is topological, and the [ij]."}, {"heading": "INSTANCE OF THE TEST DATASET", "text": "is the same class as the left training instance. Note that the test instance belongs to class c1 because r1 and r? are topologically similar."}, {"heading": "Tiebreaker classifier", "text": "Similar to the hybrid classifier, this classification scheme uses as attributes both traditional and topological characteristics of texts modelled as networks. The aim of this approach is to use the topological attributes only if the classification with 12 traditional characteristics is not reliable, as shown by the values of membership strength. Consider that the two most likely classes to which the unknown instance belongs are j and k according to the traditional characteristics. As a result, m (T) ij \u2212 m (T) ik. If such a difference exceeds the threshold, the tiebreaker performs the classification by using only traditional attributes. Conversely, topological attributes are used to derive the class of the unknown instance, i.e., y (T) ij \u2212 m (T) ij if the tiebreaker performs the classification only with traditional attributes. Conversely, topological attributes are used to derive the class of the unknown instance."}, {"heading": "6. Results and discussion", "text": "The effectiveness of combining traditional textual characteristics and topological measurements of networks was evaluated in the context of two natural language processing tasks based on the characterization of stylistic characteristics of texts. Tasks investigated were the assignment of authorship and genre recognition problems. 13 classifiers selected for the combination of techniques were: kNN, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RFO) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). These classifiers were selected because they usually provide good accuracy rates with standard parameters [64]."}, {"heading": "6.1. Authorship recognition", "text": "The data set used here includes books written by eight authors: Arthur Conan Doyle (ACD), Bram Stoker (BRS), Charles Dickens (CHD), Thomas Hardy (THH), Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (PGW), Hector Hugh Munro (HHM) and Herman Melville (HME). To show how the topological properties of the network modeling books can be useful to improve the characterization of author styles in texts, the following combination of attributes was considered: \u2022 INT + CN: the intermittence of the stopwords was considered together with the topological measurements of the network that model the text. As stopwords, he considered all words that appeared at least once in all books of the dataset."}, {"heading": "6.2. Style identification", "text": "In this section, I will examine whether the topological characteristics of complex networks are useful to supplement traditional textual characterization for the style identification task [66].1718The data set used was the Brown corpus [67], which comprises documents classified as either informative prose (e.g. press reportage, popular folklore and scientific manuscripts) or imaginative prose (e.g. general fiction, romance and love stories). Unlike the task of assigning authorship, the goal here is to summarize documents written using the same style independently of their authorization. Results for style identification in the Brown corpus using the hybrid technique are shown in Tables 6 and 7. Considering the INT + CN combination, the highest performance gain was 29.0% and 25.8% for the kNN methods (k = 4) and SVM methods were observed with minor improvements in the accuracy of the traditional combinations (159% were observed in the other 99)."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusions", "text": "In this study, I have shown that the styles of texts can be captured by measuring the topological properties of the corresponding network representation. More important than just establishing a dependence between the structure of networks and stylistic characteristics of texts, techniques were developed in this study to combine traditional and topological characteristics, which proved to be of crucial importance for improving the quality of current classification strategies. Two traditional stylistic tasks were examined: the assignment of characteristics to authorship and problems in identifying genres. In both tasks, the addition of topological characteristics led to an improvement in classification performance. The largest improvement occurred with the hybrid classifier, which uses a linear convex combination of characteristics from different textual evidence. The different nature of the quantities used to characterize texts suggests a complementary role in capturing different aspects of written texts. Since the appropriate selection of parameters for the proposed technique is anything but an automatic task, I intend to develop for each one as a future task."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "I acknowledge the financial support of the Sa'o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP-Brazil) (grant number 14 / 20830-0)."}], "references": [{"title": "Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort", "author": ["GK Zipf"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1949}, {"title": "The city as a giant component: a random graph approach to Zipf\u2019s law", "author": ["R Kali"], "venue": "Appl.

In recent years, methods from complex and dynamical systems proved useful to create several language models. Despite the large amount of studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a limited number of studies have shown how the properties of the underlying physical systems can be employed to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, I address this problem by devising complex networks methods that are able to improve the performance of current statistical methods. Using a fuzzy classification strategy, I show that the topological properties extracted from texts complement the traditional textual description. In several cases, the performance obtained with hybrid approaches outperformed the results obtained when only traditional or networked methods were used. Because the proposed model is generic, the framework devised here could be straightforwardly used to study similar textual applications where the topology plays a pivotal role in the description of the interacting agents.
