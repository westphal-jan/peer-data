Specifically, we could define the previous polarity of a term as polarity for its ambiguous meaning, outside of any context. Unlike the previous polarity of a word, the adjective cold (in most cases) evokes quite a negative mood, since it is used in sentences as cold man, cold winter or cold. However, depending on the context, we may find this term in sentences with positive acceptance, as in I love cold berry.Unlike the previous polarity of a word, the polarities associated with any sense of the word are called posterior polarities in literature."}, {"heading": "2.1 Polarity Lexicons", "text": "This year, it will be able to fix and fix the mentioned bugs."}, {"heading": "3 New broad Lexical Resources for the Italian Language", "text": "In this section, we present SABRINA1 (Sentiment Analysis: a Broad Resource for Italian Natural Language Applications), a manually commented previous polarity lexical resource for Italian natural language applications in the field of opinion formation and sentiment induction. The resource consists of two different sets, an Italian dictionary of more than 277,000 words marked with their previous polarity value, and a series of polarity modifiers containing more than 200 words that can be used in combination with non-neutral terms of the dictionary to induce the mood of Italian compound terms. In recent years, sentiment analysis in Italian texts has attracted attention due to Evalita, an initiative dedicated to the evaluation of Natural Language Processing and Speech tools for Italian. In the recent Evalita 2014 issue of Spolentic (SENTIment POLarity Classification) task2 [] was proposed."}, {"heading": "3.1 Italian Polarity Lexicon", "text": "Most sentiment dictionaries in the literature contain lists of tagged lemmas, i.e. the canonical form (or dictionary form) of a word. For example, the latest version of MultiWordNet (1.39) contains about 58 000 Italian word senses and 41 500 lemmas organized into 32, 700 synsets, which are aligned whenever possible with Princeton WordNet English synsets. When using such resources in sentiment analysis, it is necessary to perform a prior step of definition of meaning in order to identify the corresponding problem of a word. Our lexicon contains 277,387 words of the Italian language, including its inflexibility, which is used to use various grammatical categories such as tension, person, gender, etc. The dictionary contains the verb correre (to run) and its conjugations correcting1, correra, corressi, etc.Search sentence of words has been provided manually with their previous polarities."}, {"heading": "3.2 Polarity Modifiers", "text": "In this case, it is a reactionary act that is able to retaliate and retaliate."}, {"heading": "4 A Web Based Frontend", "text": "We have implemented a simple web-based tool to access the lexical resource presented in this thesis. In order to allow blind verification of the work, we have uploaded the tool to a free hosting server. The tool is located at http: / / www.dmi.unict.it / \u02dc faro / sabrina / The tool allows the evaluation of individual Italian terms or compound terms in which words with a non-neutral polarity are associated with modifiers, as described above. In addition, each example you find above in the thesis is provided with an anchor that redirects the reader to the website of the tool to evaluate the mood value of the example itself. In particular, when a whole set of the tool containing more than one term with non-neutral previous polarity is tested, a simple approach is used to calculate an approximation of the polarity of the entire set. Specifically, the set of values contained in the set of polarity values is set from the mean polarity values to the highest half of the polarity number."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this article, we introduced a new lexical resource for the Italian language that contains more than 277,000 words manually marked with their previous polarity values, i.e. a value that indicates the mood such words evoke when they are torn out of any context. We also provide an additional lexical resource that contains a set of more than 200 polarity modifiers that can be used to induce the mood polarity of Italian compound terms."}], "references": [{"title": "Sentiment analysis on italian tweets.
