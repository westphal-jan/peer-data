As a result, the sample size must grow exponentially to achieve a reasonable estimate. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, Dyer et.al. is proposed to implement a polynomial time randomized approach algorithm (Multiphase Monte-Carlo Algorithm) [6]. The theoretical complexity of the original algorithms is O-23, and has recently been reduced to O-4. [12] Based on the Monte Carlo method, we implemented our own tool PolyVest (Polytopic Volume Estimation) to estimate the volume of the convex polytopes [8]."}, {"heading": "3.2 Volume Estimation for SMT(LRA) Formula", "text": "Now we will describe how to estimate the \"volume\" of the solution space of the SMT (LRA) formulas. (Here, LRA stands for linear real arithmetic.) The basic procedure is very similar to that of the volume calculation, as described in [13]. As in [13], a consistent combination of linear constraints is called by the Boolean skeleton of the SMT (LRA) formula as a feasible (partial) mapping. Whenever VolCE receives a feasible (partial) mapping, it calls PolyVest, the volume of the polytopic corresponding to this mapping. The sum of the estimated volumes of all (partial) mappings is approximately the volume of the entire formula. Note that the \"volume calculation in bundles\" strategy can be applied."}, {"heading": "4 Using the Tool", "text": "Input of VolCE is an SMT formula in which theory T is limited to linear arithmetic = 48. It can be considered a Boolean combination of linear inequalities. There are two input formats. For the first format, the input formula is a Boolean formula \u03c6 (b1,.., bn) in conjunctive normal form (CNF). And any Boolean variable bi can stand for a linear arithmetic condition (LAC). The entire input file is an extension of the DIMACS format for solving SAT. An alternative input format is SMT-Lib style. Currently, VolCE supports the main features of the \"SMT-LIBv2\" syntax. VolCE has several command line options: - V asks the Vinci tool to calculate the volume. - P asks the tool to call PolyVest to approximate the volume."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Results", "text": "In this case, most of them will be able to orient themselves in a different direction than in a different direction, namely, in the direction in which they have gone."}, {"heading": "6 Related Works", "text": "Fredrikson and Jha [7] link a number of privacy and confidentiality issues to the so-called satisfaction problem of model counting and present an abstract decision-making process for it. They implemented this procedure for linear integer arithmetic. Their tool is called countersat and is not available to us.Zhou et al. [18] propose a BDD-based search algorithm that reduces the number of conjunctions. For each conjunction, they propose a Monte Carlo integration with a radiation-based scanning strategy that approaches the volume. Their tool is called RVC. It can handle formulas with up to 18 variables, but the runtime is dozens of minutes.Another approach is described in [4]. It reduces an approximate version of # SMT to SMT. The approach does not need to modify existing SMT solvers. It has been applied to solve a value problem for certain types of programs where there are no clear identifiers."}, {"heading": "7 Concluding Remarks", "text": "VolCE is a tool for calculating and estimating the volume of the solution space (or number of solutions), as a formula / constraint is a Boolean combination of linear arithmetic inequalities. VolCE is very flexible to use. For medium-sized SMT (LA) formulas, it can provide accurate volume calculation results or exact number of solutions. For larger SMT (LA) formulas, it can quickly perform volume estimates with high accuracy, due to the use of effective heuristics. We believe that the tool will be useful in a number of areas, such as program analysis and probability verification."}, {"heading": "E Examples", "text": "= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ="}, {"heading": "1 0.24338 * 1", "text": "= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7"}], "references": [{"title": "Hit-and-run algorithms for the identification of nonredundant linear inequalities", "author": ["H.C.P.
