It plays an important role in understanding and representation. With rapid and continual expansion of texts, pictures and videos in cyberspace, automatic summarization becomes more and more desirable. Text summarization has been studied for over half century, but it is still hard to automatically generate a satisfied summary. Traditional methods process texts empirically and neglect the fundamental characteristics and principles of language use and understanding. This paper summarizes previous text summarization approaches in a multi-dimensional classification space, introduces a multi-dimensional methodology for research and development, unveils the basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding, investigates some fundamental mechanisms of summarization, studies the dimensions and forms of representations, and proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanisms. Investigation extends to the incorporation of pictures into summary and to the summarization of videos, graphs and pictures, and then reaches a general summarization framework.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 12:39:50 GMT  (22952kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00209v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["hai zhuge"], "accepted": false, "id": "1507.00209"}, "pdf": {"name": "1507.00209.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Dimensionality on Summarization", "authors": ["Hai Zhuge"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: natural language processing, classification, semantic link, dimension, text summary, video summary, graphic summary, image summary.

Multi-Dimensional Methodology", "text": "For example, rationalism believes that the meaning of the text is determined by its structure and rules of derivation; the principles underlying the structure of language are biologically determined and genetically transmitted by the human mind; people share the same underlying linguistic structure [Chomsky, 1986, 2006]; the innate mental structure that involves a person (especially a child) in interacting with the world is more than Chomsky's universal grammar of linguistic structure; evoluism concerns the process of mental development and innate mental structures [Stern, 1985]; and the innate mental structure that equips a person to interact with the world is more than Chomsky's universal grammar of linguistic structure."}, {"heading": "3. Basic Characteristics and Principles of Language Use and Understanding", "text": "These basic characteristics of language use cannot, however, lead directly to each other. (2) People create and use languages to recognize the interaction between the heads. (3) Knowledge in the head develops and organizes itself through language use. (4) The use of language is based on knowledge and understanding. (5) The representation of knowledge is not unique, and the understanding of representation is not unique. These characteristics lead to the following principles: Separation Principle. The following three types of separations are involved in language: (1) Structure (grammar) and semantics are separate. Semantics cannot be derived directly from structure. In fact, people do not rely on grammar to communicate with each other in everyday life. (2) Knowledge of representation is separate. (grammar) and semantics are separate."}, {"heading": "4. General Citation \u23af Definition, Measure and Axiom", "text": "It's the time you need to find a solution.

Conclusion", "text": "Basic interactions include selecting, quoting, and organizing representations according to requirement and motivation.Texts have been the most important means of reflecting the evolution of human society.It is necessary to explore the automatic summary of texts, which is rapidly spreading in cyberspace. However, the existing approaches are empirical and are based mainly on statistics, structure, and linguistic analysis, neglecting the nature of representation and comprehensive.This paper summarizes earlier approaches and examines the basic theory and method for summarizing from multiple dimensions.The central point of view is that the summary is carried out with various interactions associated with man, machine, and various representations, including text, image, and video.Authors and readers represent this work mainly through explicit or implicit citations. Studying the summary of images, videos, and graphics achieves a general summary."}], "references": [{"title": "Summarization from Medical Documents: A Survey", "author": ["S. Afantenos", "V.

It plays an important role in understanding and representation. With rapid and continual expansion of texts, pictures and videos in cyberspace, automatic summarization becomes more and more desirable. Text summarization has been studied for over half century, but it is still hard to automatically generate a satisfied summary. Traditional methods process texts empirically and neglect the fundamental characteristics and principles of language use and understanding. This paper summarizes previous text summarization approaches in a multi-dimensional classification space, introduces a multi-dimensional methodology for research and development, unveils the basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding, investigates some fundamental mechanisms of summarization, studies the dimensions and forms of representations, and proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanisms. Investigation extends to the incorporation of pictures into summary and to the summarization of videos, graphs and pictures, and then reaches a general summarization framework. Further, some basic behaviors of summarization are studied in the complex space consisting of cyberspace, physical space and social space. The basic viewpoints include: (1) a representation suitable for summarization should have a core, indicated by its intention and extension; (2) summarization is an open process of various interactions, involved in various explicit and implicit citations; and, (3) the form of summary is diverse and summarization carries out through multiple dimensions.", "creator": "Word"}}}
