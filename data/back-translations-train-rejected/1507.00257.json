The first two are relatively new research areas in databases, and the third one is an established subject in knowledge representation. We show how to obtain database repairs from causes, and the other way around. Causality problems are formulated as diagnosis problems, and the diagnoses provide causes and their responsibilities. The vast body of research on database repairs can be applied to the newer problems of computing actual causes for query answers and their responsibilities. These connections, which are interesting per se, allow us, after a transition -inspired by consistency-based diagnosis- to computational problems on hitting sets and vertex covers in hypergraphs, to obtain several new algorithmic and complexity results for database causality.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 15:20:29 GMT  (64kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00257v1", "Journal submission.

Usually, the various deletions are taken into account, such is the case of S and C repairs that we have considered in this work. We could go beyond the notion of a prioritized repair and consider them.

(...) It may be that the views of a database into endogenous and exogenous tuples could also be of interest in the context of repairs. (...) We may prefer endogenous repairs that are only endogenous tuples in this case. (...) However, it may be possible to assume that combinations of (only) exogenous tuples never violate the integrity limitations that could be verified in the upload time. In this sense, there would be a part of the database that is considered causal while the other possible repairs are subject. (...) Going a bit further, we might violate the integrity limitations that could be verified in the upload time. (...) It would be a part of the database that is considered consistent while the others are exploited to be possible repairs."}], "references": [{"title": "Repair Checking in Inconsistent Databases: Algorithms and Complexity", "author": ["F.
