Therefore observational studies based on passively observed data are widely accepted as an alternative to RCTs. However, in observational studies, prior knowledge is required to generate the hypotheses about the cause-effect relationships to be tested, hence they can only be applied to problems with available domain knowledge and a handful of variables. In practice, many data sets are of high dimensionality, which leaves observational studies out of the opportunities for causal discovery from such a wealth of data sources. In another direction, many efficient data mining methods have been developed to identify associations among variables in large data sets. The problem is, causal relationships imply associations, but the reverse is not always true. However we can see the synergy between the two paradigms here. Specifically, association rule mining can be used to deal with the high-dimensionality problem while observational studies can be utilised to eliminate non-causal associations. In this paper we propose the concept of causal rules (CRs) and develop an algorithm for mining CRs in large data sets. We use the idea of retrospective cohort studies to detect CRs based on the results of association rule mining. Experiments with both synthetic and real world data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of CR mining. In comparison with the commonly used causal discovery methods, the proposed approach in general is faster and has better or competitive performance in finding correct or sensible causes. It is also capable of finding a cause consisting of multiple variables, a feature that other causal discovery methods do not possess.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 16 Aug 2015 12:33:18 GMT  (142kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03819v1", "This paper has been accepted by ACM TIST journal and will be available soon"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper has been accepted by ACM TIST journal and will be available soon", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jiuyong li", "thuc duy le", "lin liu", "jixue liu", "zhou jin", "bingyu sun", "saisai ma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.03819"}, "pdf": {"name": "1508.03819.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "From Observational Studies to Causal Rule Mining", "authors": ["JIUYONG LI", "THUC DUY LE", "LIN LIU", "JIXUE LIU", "ZHOU JIN", "BINGYU SUN"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "00From Observational Studies to Causal Rule MiningJIUYONG LI, University of South Australia THUC DUY LE, University of South Australia LIN LIU, University of South Australia JIXUE LIU, University of South Australia ZHOU JIN, University of Science and Technology China BINGYU SUN, Chinese Academy of Sciences SAISAI MA, University of South Australia Randomised controlled studies (RCTs) are the most effective approaches to causal discovery, but in many cases it is impossible to perform RCTs.

RELATED WORK AND CONTRIBUTION", "text": "In fact, the focus of research is on how to develop good observational studies, including the selection of subjects or records, methods for identifying exposed and unexposed groups that are able to replicate RCTs as accurately as possible, and ways to analyze the data. However, as far as we know, there has been little work using observational studies for automated causal discovery in large, especially high-dimensional databases. In the field of computer science, the causal discovery of observational data has been attracted by huge research efforts over the past three decades. Currently, Bayesian network techniques are at the core of methodologies for causal discovery in computer science [Spirtes 2010]. Bayesian networks provide a graphical representation of conditional independence among a number of variables."}, {"heading": "3.

In a prospective cohort study, we follow cohorts over time to observe their development of a particular outcome. In a retrospective study, researchers look back at events that have already occurred.

In the potential outcome model, each individual in a population has two potential outcomes in terms of treatment: when taking the treatment (Ti = 1), the potential outcome is Z1i; and if one does not take the treatment (Ti = 0), the potential outcome is Z0i, where each individual i in a population has two potential outcomes in terms of treatment: random variables taking values in {0, 1}.

However, in the following, we will discuss how to represent such a control variable set.Let X represent the set of all predictor variables, and as before P is the exposure variable, and C is a set of control variables. However, let us discuss how to represent such a control variable set.Let X represent the set of all predictor variables, and how previously P is it is relevant. Otherwise, it is irrelevant, and P is not a control of irrelevant variables, hence C = X\\ P.

Candidate causal rule generation", "text": "This algorithm uses the pruning criteria set out in Section 4.1 (Observations 1 and 2) and therefore seeks a much smaller search space than Apriori. The algorithm is based on a prefix tree structure for candidate generation, storage and counting. The prefix tree structure was shown to support efficient implementation for branch and bound search [Borgelt 2003]. A prefix tree is a ordered tree to store ordered records (see Figure 1). In our algorithm, each node stores a set of unequal variable values (or a potential LHS of a rule). A prefix tree is an ordered tree to store ordered records (see Figure 1)."}, {"heading": "4.4.

The irrelevant variables determined above are excluded from the set of control variables, which are determined by lines 6 and 12. Second, we identify the exclusive variables of an exposure variable, say P, according to definition 4.2, where the same value as the minimum local support is set. We exclude the identified exclusive variables from the set of control variables. These are determined by lines 11 and 12. The remaining variables then form the set of control variables.

Causal rules vs. association rules", "text": "Causal rules have advantages over causal rules. A causal rule may represent an incorrect relationship between two variables, since a statistical association does not necessarily mean that the two variables are related or directly related to each other (while a causal rule indicates that the two variables have a direct relationship in view of the variables observed). These false association rules could not be eliminated by raising thresholds; they can only be identified by analyzing the relationship by shielding the effects of other (association) rules. In order to investigate the difference between association rules [Agrawal et al. 1996], non-redundant rules [Zaki 2004] and the results of different types of association rules mining, we compared the results of different types of association rules mining. Table II shows that the number of causal rules is significantly lower than the number of other types of (association) rules, including association rules [Agrawal et al al. 1996], non-association rules [Zredaki 2004] and Li are measured on the basis of the Rules of ACM, Quantitative Rules of 2004 and Optimal Rules of 2004 and Li."}, {"heading": "5.3.

As the original CCC and CCU algorithms do not assume a fixed response variable, we executed them with the restriction to search only for the triplets that contain the response variable. For our method, we executed them in two different versions: CR-CS1 and CR-CS2 respectively. With CR-CS1, we limited the length of the rules to 1, making them comparable to CCC, CCU and PC-select. With CR-CS2, the length of the rules was limited to 2 to allow for the discovery of combined causes."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we proposed the concept of causal rules and developed a method to find causal rules from observational data by integrating association rule mining with retrospective cohort studies. By integrating, our method was able to exploit the high efficiency of association rule mining to establish causal relationships between candidates from large data sets and then to use the idea of cohort studies to obtain reliable causal rules based on the candidates. Validity of the definition of causal rules was justified to be consistent with the potential outcome model. Results of the experiments showed that the proposed method is able to find more reasonable causal relationships compared with existing causal discovery methods. Furthermore, our method was able to find causes that consist of combined variables that cannot be detected by the other existing methods.

Therefore observational studies based on passively observed data are widely accepted as an alternative to RCTs. However, in observational studies, prior knowledge is required to generate the hypotheses about the cause-effect relationships to be tested, hence they can only be applied to problems with available domain knowledge and a handful of variables. In practice, many data sets are of high dimensionality, which leaves observational studies out of the opportunities for causal discovery from such a wealth of data sources. In another direction, many efficient data mining methods have been developed to identify associations among variables in large data sets. The problem is, causal relationships imply associations, but the reverse is not always true. However we can see the synergy between the two paradigms here. Specifically, association rule mining can be used to deal with the high-dimensionality problem while observational studies can be utilised to eliminate non-causal associations. In this paper we propose the concept of causal rules (CRs) and develop an algorithm for mining CRs in large data sets. We use the idea of retrospective cohort studies to detect CRs based on the results of association rule mining. Experiments with both synthetic and real world data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of CR mining. In comparison with the commonly used causal discovery methods, the proposed approach in general is faster and has better or competitive performance in finding correct or sensible causes. It is also capable of finding a cause consisting of multiple variables, a feature that other causal discovery methods do not possess.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
