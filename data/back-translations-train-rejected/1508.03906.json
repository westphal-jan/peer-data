Variability is achieved by selecting the characteristics that will be present in the final product. In associated feature models, quantitative, non-functional characteristics of the characteristics are captured by attributes that are assigned to each characteristic. The use of assigned feature models is particularly useful for the decision-making process [20], as each stakeholder can make decisions that take into account both the characteristics and properties of the end product. A number of techniques allow the configuration of feature models based on functional and non-functional requirements."}, {"heading": "2 Case Study", "text": "The concept is simple: a user reaches a station, takes a bicycle, uses it for a while and takes it to another station. A BSS can be considered convenient and can be designed as a product line. Automation of these systems allows to monitor the stations to check whether rented bikes are returned to make the user pay for the use, etc. A user is interested in tracking the status of all bikes and to get a complete picture of which bikes are docked at each station and which are currently rented. For rented bikes, the system keeps track of the user name and departure time. A user is interested in knowing the status of all bikes. In case that the station is empty, the system can predict when a bike is rented."}, {"heading": "3 An Introduction to Machine Learning", "text": "The term data-driven refers to the fact that ML approaches are based on (numerical) information encoded in the data, which is typically vector (i.e. multivariate data in a vector space), but can also be of a relational type (i.e. composite information with a graph-based representation, where edges encode relations between the atomic pieces of information) [11]. ML is an active and broad field of research that encompasses several paradigms, such as neural, probabilistic, kernel-based approaches, where the edges encode the relationships between the atomic pieces of information. ML is an active and broad research model that encompasses several paradigms, such as neural approaches for predicting mathematical learning processes, kernel-based approaches, and addressing a variety of computer-based learning task types. For the purpose of product line features modeling and evaluation, we focus on the algorithms and the solution of supertarget tasks."}, {"heading": "4 Machine Learning for BSS Features", "text": "Assisted learning approaches can be used to model product line features in our BSS scenario, using protocols from previous bicycle use as training examples for the ML model. Here, we focus on implementing the functions UserProfile and LocationPreview. These two features are paradigmatic for two classes of learning tasks that require learning models of different types and abilities, i.e. static models for vector data and dynamic models for sequential data."}, {"heading": "4.1 User Profile", "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "4.2 Location Preview", "text": "The LocationPreview function predicts the same performance as the UserProfile function with different input data, i.e. it corresponds to the journeys of BSS users. Trajectory data encodes a form of dynamic information in relation to the context determined by the preceding or subsequent elements of the sequence. Such contextual information also plays a role in the learning task in which the decision for the arrival station is made."}, {"heading": "4.3 Discussion", "text": "The work described in [10] applies ML to BSS data, but mainly focuses on mining utilization models of BSS with the aim of identifying template behaviors that can be used as demand profiles for system management. In contrast, we propose to use ML as a modeling tool to develop system functions that can be used by the user application at runtime. At the same time, as explained in the next section, we propose to use the error functions of the learning model as part of the pre-deployment analysis to evaluate the cost-performance compensation of the features to be included in the final deployment of BSS. Finally, we also take into account the dynamics of trajectory data by using appropriate ML models such as the RC approach, rather than adapting static models to perform spatio-temporal data analysis [12]."}, {"heading": "5 Performance evaluation of ML models", "text": "A key aspect of ML models is the evaluation of their predictive performance. Good ML practice provides for a three-step process to build effective predictive models and reliably assess their performance."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We discussed the case study of the European project QUANTICOL regarding the quantitative analysis of bike sharing systems (BSS). The features required in the case study are paradigmatic for two classes of learning tasks that require learning models of different nature and abilities, i.e. static models for vectorial data and dynamic models for sequential data. Such models are trained on historical usage data to realize a reliable implementation of the feature. Furthermore, a trained computational learning model is characterized by a measurement of predictive performance that can be used to evaluate the cost-performance comparison of the function before it is put into operation.We are currently in the process of verifying a learning model for the UserProfile function based on real usage data that more than 280,000 entries in the form < UserID, leave station, date and time, return > we provide a general concept in Pisa two years."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was partly supported by the EU FP7-ICT FET-Proactive project QUANTICOL (600708) and the Italian MIUR project CINA (PRIN 2010LHT4KM)."}], "references": [{"title": "Clafer Tools for Product Line Engineering", "author": ["Micha\u0142Antkiewicz", "Kacper B\u0105k", "Alexandr Murashkin", "Rafael Olaechea", "Jia Hui (Jimmy) Liang", "Krzysztof Czarnecki"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 17th International Software Product Line Conference Co-located Workshops, SPLC \u201913 Workshops,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2013}, {"title": "An experimental characterization of reservoir computing in ambient assisted living applications", "author": ["Davide Bacciu", "Paolo Barsocchi", "Stefano Chessa", "Claudio Gallicchio", "Alessio Micheli"], "venue": "Neural Computing and Applications", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Challenges in Modelling and Analyzing Quantitative Aspects of Bike-Sharing Systems", "author": ["M.H. ter Beek", "A.
