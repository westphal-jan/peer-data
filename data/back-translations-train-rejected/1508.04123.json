Nigerian Bilingual Cybercriminals and 419 Scams", "text": "This work examines the detection of 419 scams within an abilingual community of cybercriminals. These scams are known as advance fraud or 419 scams [9], [10]. 419 scams originated in Nigeria on a smaller scale in the 1970s, but escalated into posted letters in the 1980s during the oil boom, and then culminated in the commercialization of the Internet into e-mails in the 1990s. [11] Over time, the origin of 419 scams expanded to various West African countries such as Ghana, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, and other parts of the world. Although these scams are not usually reported, a 2013 report found that victims lost $12.7 billion this year to this category of cybercriminals [11]. Cyber criminals, which include 419 scams, speak bilingual English."}, {"heading": "B.

Bosma et al., develop a social spam detection framework that uses linking analysis and implements this in a popular social network [15]. Bhat et al., propose a community-based framework and use ensemble classifiers to detect spammers within community nodes in online social networks [16], [17].

The algorithm implements Bayes Theorem, which assumes conditional independence in characteristic variables of a learning set to predict statistical outcomes [22], [23].b) Support vector machines: This other-level algorithm uses hyperfidelity in order to predict statistical outcomes."}, {"heading": "A. Dataset Description", "text": "For our experimental study, we first generated two primary datasets from datasets randomly selected from the 150 Facebook accounts with high PageRank values. Primary dataset 1 (PD1) contains only English datasets, while Primary dataset 2 (PD2) has half the datasets in English and the other half in Nigerian Pidgin, as shown in Table 1. The data in each primary dataset is labeled and then pre-processed to remove all non-ASCII characters, symbols and punctuation marks, except for the apostrophes we escape. The data used in our classification problem are in two languages, namely English and Nigerian Pidgin, which both use Latin characters and therefore do not use special symbols or non-ASCII characters, which is typical in languages such as French, Spanish, etc., which use such characters to highlight accents for certain words. However, there was evidence in the ASCII form for the use of non-ASCII characters in some emoticons."}, {"heading": "B. Classifier Evaluation Metrics", "text": "Our study uses binary classifications to train and test instances of text in the records as fraud or non-fraud. To evaluate our classifiers, we use recall, precision and F1 measurements of uniform and Bigram word vectors. Recall measures the percentage of fraud messages detected, so this measure determines how well a classifier performs in identifying a condition. However, precision measures how many of the fraud messages are correctly detected, so this is a measure of the likelihood that a predicted result is the correct one [28]. F1 measurement is a harmonious tool for precision and recall. Let's leave xns \u2192 ns the number of non-fraud posts that are classified as non-fraud, xns \u2192 s the number of non-fraud posts that are classified as fraud, xs \u2192 ns the number of non-fraud posts that are classified as fraud, xs \u2192 ns the number of incorrect fraud posts, xs = the number of rectified posts."}, {"heading": "C.

In addition, we used a 10x cross-validation method to improve the performance of the classifiers. By means of cross-validation, each of the four subdata sets was divided into 10 sets in equal parts."}, {"heading": "NB 0.915 0.911 0.911 0.964 0.96", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A.
