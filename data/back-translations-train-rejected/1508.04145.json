An action confirms itself if and only if it causally maximizes the expected benefit in a world model based on the evidence that this action is taken. Consider, for example, the setting of a matching pennies game in which players can accurately predict each other. However, the fact that player A plays \"heads\" and play \"tails\" in response is evidence that player A would play \"tails\" and so that the \"heads\" action \"does not ratify itself.\" However, the mixed strategy of dealing with the coin-ratifying world is \"evidence that player A plays\" tails \"and that player B plays\" plays \"tails.\""}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced reflective oracles, a kind of probabilistic oracle that is capable of answering questions about the behavior of oracle machines with access to the same oracle.
