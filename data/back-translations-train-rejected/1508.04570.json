It will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to create new versions of it. The SP system is a unique attempt to simplify and integrate observations and concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, mathematics, and human perception and cognition, with information compression as a unifying theme. Potential benefits and applications include helping to solve problems associated with big data; facilitating the development of autonomous robots; unsupervised learning, natural language processing, several kinds of reasoning, fuzzy pattern recognition at multiple levels of abstraction, computer vision, best-match and semantic forms of information retrieval, software engineering, medical diagnosis, simplification of computing systems, and the seamless integration of diverse kinds of knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence. Additional motivations include the potential of the SP system to help solve problems in defence, security, and the detection and prevention of crime; potential in terms of economic, social, environmental, and academic criteria, and in terms of publicity; and the potential for international influence in research. The main elements of the proposed facility are described, including support for the development of \"SP-neural\", a neural version of the SP machine.
