First, each causal diagram consists of vertices (variables) and arrows (direct causal effects); you can either create the diagram directly from the DAGitty graphical user interface (explained in the next section), or create a description of the word processor and then import that description into DAGitty. In addition, DAGitty contains some predefined examples to familiarize you with the program and the DAGs in general, simply by selecting one of the predefined examples from the \"Examples\" menu."}, {"heading": "3.1 DAGitty\u2019s textual syntax for causal diagrams", "text": "DAGitty's textual syntax for causal diagrams is based on that used by Sven Knuppel's DAG program. [6] A diagram description (model code, somewhat clumsily called model text data in older versions of DAGitty) consists of two parts: 1. A list of variables in the diagram m2. A list of arrows between the variablesThe list of variables consists of one variable per line. After each variable name follows a character indicating the status of the variable, which can be one of \"1\" (normal variable), \"A\" (adapted to), \"U\" (latent / unnoticed), \"E\" (exposure) or \"O\" (result). If you prepare your diagram description in a word processor instead of constructing the diagram in DAGitty itself, you may encounter problems using spaces or other special symbols in the variable names (e.g. \"patient\")."}, {"heading": "3.3 Modifying the graphical layout of a diagram", "text": "To arrange the vertices and arrows of your chart more clearly than DAGitty did, simply drag the vertices onto the canvas. You may notice that DAGitty immediately changes the information in the \"Model Code\" field and adds additional position information for each vertice. Generally, any changes you make to your chart within DAGitty are immediately reflected in the model code."}, {"heading": "3.4 Saving the diagram", "text": "To save your chart locally, simply copy the contents of the \"Model Code\" field into a text file and save this file locally to your computer3. If you want to edit the chart further, copy the model code back to DAGitty as described above."}, {"heading": "3.5 Exporting the diagram", "text": "DAGitty can export the diagram as a PDF or SVG vector image (publishing quality) or as a JPEG or PNG bitmap image (e.g. for embedding in PowerPoint). Select the appropriate function from the \"Model\" menu. If you want to edit or comment on the graphical layout of the diagram, it is recommended to export the diagram as an SVG file and open it in a vector graphics program such as Inkscape."}, {"heading": "3.6 Publishing diagrams online", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to play by the rules we have imposed on ourselves, \"he told the German Press Agency."}, {"heading": "4 Editing diagrams using the graphical user interface", "text": "You are free to make changes directly to the text description of your chart, which will be reflected on the canvas the next time you click \"Update DAG.\" You can also use the mouse to create, modify and delete vertices and arrows graphically."}, {"heading": "4.1 Creating a new diagram", "text": "To create a new chart, select \"New Model\" from the \"Model\" menu. You will be prompted for the names of the exposure and result variables, and a first model containing exactly these variables and an arrow in between will be drawn. You can then add variables and arrows to the model as explained below."}, {"heading": "4.2 Adding new variables", "text": "To add a new variable to the model, double-click on a free area in the desktop (i.e., not on an existing variable) or press the \"n\" key. A dialog will open asking for the name of the new variable. Type the name into the dialog and press Enter or click \"OK.\" If you click \"Cancel,\" no new variable will be created."}, {"heading": "4.3 Renaming variables", "text": "To rename an existing variable, move the mouse cursor over this variable and press the \"r\" key. A dialog will open in which you can change the variable name."}, {"heading": "4.4 Setting the status of a variable", "text": "Variables can have one of the following states: \u2022 Exposure \u2022 Result \u2022 Unused (latent) \u2022 Adjusted \u2022 OtherTo convert a variable into exposure, move the mouse cursor over this variable and press the \"e\" key; for a result, press the \"o\" key instead. To toggle whether a variable is being observed or not, press the \"u\" key; to toggle whether it is being adjusted, press the \"a\" key. Changing the variable status can change the colors of the chart corners to reflect the new structure and information flow in the graph (see below)."}, {"heading": "4.5 Adding new arrows", "text": "To add a new arrow, double-click on the starting point (highlighted) and then on the destination point. The arrow will be inserted. If there was previously an arrow pointing in the opposite direction, this arrow will be deleted, otherwise there would now be a cycle in the model. Instead of double-clicking on a vertex, you can also move the mouse cursor over the vertex and press \"c.\" Arrows are drawn with a straight line by default, but you can move the mouse cursor to the line by pressing and holding down the left mouse button and dragging the line accordingly."}, {"heading": "4.6 Deleting variables", "text": "To delete a variable, hover the mouse over that variable and press the \"del\" key on your keyboard or alternatively the \"d\" key (the latter comes in handy if you're on a Mac that doesn't have a real delete key).All arrows to that variable are deleted along with the variable. Unlike versions of DAGitty before 2.0, all variables, including exposure and result, can now be deleted."}, {"heading": "4.7 Deleting arrows", "text": "An arrow is deleted exactly as it was inserted, i.e. by double-clicking first on the start variable and then on the target variable. An arrow is also automatically deleted when a new one is inserted in the opposite direction (see above)."}, {"heading": "4.8 Choosing the style of display", "text": "Currently you can choose between two DAG diagram styles: \"classic,\" where nodes and their labels are separated from each other, and REM-like, where labels are inside nodes. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. \"REM\" refers to the modeling of structural equations, by the way."}, {"heading": "5 Analyzing diagrams", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Paths", "text": "Causal diagrams contain two different types of paths between exposure and result variables. \u2022 Causal paths start at exposure, contain only arrows pointing away from the exposure, and end at the result. That is, they have the form e \u2192 x1 \u2192... \u2192 xk \u2192 o. \u2022 Distortive paths are all other paths from the exposure to the result. Such paths can, for example, have the form e \u2190 x1 \u2192.. \u2192 xk \u2192 o. With respect to a number of conditioning variables (which can also be empty if we do not condition anything), paths can be either open or closed (also called d-separated [8]). A path is closed by Z if one or both of the following holds: \u2022 The path p contains a chain x \u2192 m \u2192 y or a bifurcation x \u00b2 m \u2192 y, so that m is in Z. \u2022 The path p contains a collision x \u2192 c \u00b2 y, so that c is not in Z, and beyond that Z contains no successor of the arc. Otherwise, the path is always open because it only exists."}, {"heading": "5.2 Coloring", "text": "Especially in larger diagrams, it is not easy to manually determine which paths are open and which are closed. DAGitty marks all arrows that lie on open paths in red and all arrows that lie on open paths in green. This highlighting is optional and is controlled by the checkboxes \"mark causal paths\" and \"mark causal paths.\""}, {"heading": "5.3 Effect analysis", "text": "As mentioned above, arrows in DAGs represent direct effects. That is, in a DAG with three variables X, M, and Y, people tend to forget this aspect and just think about whether any causal effect exists, without paying attention to how it is mediated. This can lead to DAGs with too many arrows. To help users do this, George Ellison (Leeds University) suggested to implement a function that identifies arrows for which there is also an appropriate indirect path. After creating an initial DAG, you could rethink these arrows and assess whether they are really necessary given the indirect paths already present in the diagram. For example, after thinking about the pair-by-pair causal relationships between our variables X, M, Y, and Y, let us assume that these causal paths - X M YFor the bold arrows, there is no corresponding indirect path - a direct path between our variables X, Y, and Y - that they can be removed completely from the DAG."}, {"heading": "5.4 View mode", "text": "There are several ways to transform a GivenDAGso that it is more suitable for a specific purpose. We call such a transformed DAG a derivative graphic. Currently, DAGitty can display two types of derivative graphics: correlation graphics and moral graphics. These derivative graphics can be displayed by clicking on the corresponding radio button in the View Mode field on the left of the screen."}, {"heading": "5.4.1 The correlation graph", "text": "The correlation graph is not a DAG, but a simple graph with lines instead of arrows. It connects each pair of variables that could be statistically dependent according to the diagram. In other words, variables that are not connected by a line in the correlation graph must be statistically independent. These pair-by-pair dependencies are also listed in the \"Testable Implications\" field on the right of the screen, so the correlation graph could be regarded as encoding a subset of these implications. Although this is not yet implemented in DAGitty, it is also possible to take a given correlation graph (which can be achieved, for example, by the threshold of a covariance matrix) and list all DAGs that are \"compatible\" with it in the sense that they contain exactly the given correlation graph [17]."}, {"heading": "5.4.2 The moral graph", "text": "In order to determine minimum, sufficient settings, DAGitty uses the so-called \"moral graph,\" which results from a transformation of the model into an undirected graph. This method is also highly recommended if you want to check the calculation by hand. Details on this method can be found in the nice explanation by Shrier and Platt [13]."}, {"heading": "5.5 Causal effect identification", "text": "Some of the most important features of DAGitty address the question: How can causal effects be estimated on the basis of observational data? Currently, two types of causal effects identification are supported: adaptation theorems and instrumental variables."}, {"heading": "5.5.1 Adjustment sets", "text": "The fact is that you are able to move to another world, where you have to move to another world, where you can move to another world."}, {"heading": "5.5.2 Instrumental variables", "text": "This does not mean that it is impossible to estimate the causal effect at all. Instrumental variable regression, however, is a technique often used in situations of unobserved confusion. Note that this technique depends on linearity assumptions. For more information on instrumental variables, please refer to the literature [2, 5]. Instrumental variables in DAGs can be found as explained below. The validity of an instrumental variable depends on two causal conditions: exogenicity and exclusion constraint. These two conditions can be expressed in the language of DAGs and paths as follows: (1) Theremust is an open path between me and the exposureX; and (2) all paths between me and the result Y must be closed by a variable."}, {"heading": "5.6 Testable implications", "text": "Any implications arising from a causal diagram, such as possible adjustment sets or instrumental variables, are, of course, dependent on the assumptions encoded in the diagram. To some extent, these assumptions can be tested by the (conditional) dependencies that the diagram implies: If two variables X and Y are d-separated by a setZ, assumptions X and Y should be conditionally independent. In this case, the diagram implies that X and Y are unconditionally independent of each other. DAGitty displays all minimally verifiable implications in the \"Testable Implications\" text field. It only displays those implications that are actually verifiable, i.e. that do not contain any unobserved variables. Note that the set of verifiable implications represented by the DAGitty text field does not produce \"more stable versions.\""}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgements", "text": "I would like to thank my colleagues Maciej Lis \ufffd kiewicz and Benito van der Zander (both at the Institute of Theoretical Computer Science at the University of L\u00fcbeck) for their collaboration in developing efficient algorithms for the analysis of causal diagrams.
