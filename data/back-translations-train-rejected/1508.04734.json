Accelerometer (a) Standard error: Standard error is a measure of the amount of error in the recognition of y for a single x in regression, where x and y are the sample mean and \"n\" is the sample size.Wide deviation: This is a measure of the effective energy or power content of the vibration signal. The following formula was applied to compress the standard deviation, where x and \"n\" is the sample size and \"is the sample size. Sample deviation: It is the deviation of the signal points and the following formula was used to compress the sample deviation."}, {"heading": "4. Large Margin K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm", "text": "The large margin K-nearest adjacent algorithm is a variant of the original K-nearest adjacent algorithm for classification [Bremer et al. [6]. The basis of the algorithm is the construction of a distance metric. If any two objects (vectors in a attribute space) x and y are defined as metrics, provided they meet the following criteria: -1. (non-negativity or separation axiom) 2. if and only if x = y (coincidence axiom) 3. (symmetry) 4. (sub-additivity / triangular inequality). A distance measure that meets conditions 1, 2 and 4 is called a pseudo-metric. In statistical data-mining algorithms, a metric or a pseudo-metric can be used as a quantitative dissimilarity measurement."}, {"heading": "4.1 Training Phase", "text": "The first step of the algorithm requires the construction of a pseudo-metric. The metric can be described as follows: - () () (6) Here and (are two observations or instances. In the particular case of M, the metric is identical to the Euclidean distance. The algorithm distinguishes between two types of instances called target neighbors and cheaters, which are described in the next two subsections.4.1.1 Target neighbors are instances that are selected before learning. Each instance has exactly k different target neighbors within D, all of which share the same class designation. The target neighbors are the data points that should become the closest neighbors under the learned metric. 4.1.1 Target neighbors of the target are instances that are selected before learning. Each instance has exactly k different target neighbors within D, all of which share the same class designation. The target neighbors are the data points that are supposed to be the closest neighbors under the learned metric."}, {"heading": "4.2 Problem Restatement and Solver Algorithm", "text": "The problem is minimized in relation to an optimization problem."}, {"heading": "4.3 Test Phase", "text": "For do: -1.

Determine the weight of the instances each with. Now allow it to = argmax.

Results and Discussion", "text": "The sound signals were recorded for normal and abnormal conditions of the helicopter transmission. A total of 420 samples were collected, of which 60 were in healthy condition. For faulty loads with 10%, 20%, 60%, 80% and 100% errors, the statistical characteristics were treated as inputs to the algorithm. The corresponding status or state (10%, 20% error, 40% error, 60% error, 80% error, 100% error and sound) of the marked data is considered the required output of the algorithm. This input and corresponding output form the dataset. The dataset is used with the decision tree J48 to complete the decision tree, 100% error marked."}, {"heading": "7.
