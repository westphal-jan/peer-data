Probability of searching for a SAT assignment. We begin in Fig. 1 to show the probability that the BSP algorithm finds a SAT assignment with different values of the r threshold (r = 0, 0.5 and 0.9) to random 4-SAT problems of different size (N = 5 \u00d7 103 and N = 5 \u00d7 104).

Beating the freezing threshold, i.e. finding a solution in a region where the majority of solutions belong to clusters of frozen variables, is difficult, but not impossible, because intelligent algorithms can look for solutions with nofrozen variables. In fact, we have shown that all solutions found by BSP have no frozen variables, even for \u03b1 > \u03b1f. This is consistent with recent assumptions about the location of the algorithmic threshold, which is the threshold unattainable from any polynomic time algorithm."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "The SID algorithm is proposed to find solutions to random satisfiability problems in the region where solutions are broken up into an exponentially large number of different clusters. [27] The SID algorithm begins by iteratively solving the survey propagation equations: after convergence to the fixed point, each variable receives some messages (called surveys) that represent simplified (projected) marginal information about the proportion of clusters in which the variable i is forced to be positive (w + i), negative (w \u2212 i) or not forced at all."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "WethankK.

combinatorial discrete optimization. Here we study random Ksatisfiability for K = 3 and K = 4 by the Backtracking Survey Propagation algorithm. This algorithm is able to find, in a time linear in the problem size, solutions within a region never reached before, very close to SAT-UNSAT threshold, and even beyond the freezing threshold. For K = 3 the algorithmic threshold practically coincides with the SAT-UNSAT threshold. We also study the whitening process on all the solutions found by the Backtracking Survey Propagation algorithm: none contains frozen variables and the whitening procedure is able to remove all variables, following a two-steps process, in a time that diverges approaching the algorithmic threshold. The K-satisfiability (K-SAT) problem is a combinatorial discrete optimization problem of N Boolean variables, submitted to M constraints. Each constraint, called clause, is in the form of an OR logical operator of K literals (variables or their negations), and the problem is solved when exists one configuration of the variables, among the 2N possible ones, that satisfies all constraints. The K-SAT problem for K \u2265 3 is a central problem in combinatorial optimization: it was the first problem to be shown NP -complete [1, 2, 3] and is still very much studied. Efforts from the theoretical computer science community have been especially devoted to the study of the randomK-SAT ensemble [4, 5], where each formula is generated by randomly choosing M = \u03b1N clauses of K literals [6]; indeed formulas from this ensemble become extremely hard to solve when the clause to variable ratio \u03b1 grows [6] and still the locally tree-like structure of the factor graph [7], representing the interaction network among variables, makes the randomK-SAT ensemble a perfect candidate for an analytic solution. The study of random K-SAT problems and of the related solving algorithms is likely to shed light on the origin of the computational complexity and to allow the development of improved algorithms. Both numerical [8] and analytical [9, 10] evidences suggest that a threshold phenomenon, i.e. a 0\u2212 1 law, takes place in random K-SAT ensembles: in the limit of very large formulas, N \u2192 \u221e, for \u03b1 < \u03b1s(K) a typical formula has a solution, while for \u03b1 > \u03b1s(K) a typical formula is unsatisfiable. It has been very recently proved in Ref. [11] that for K large enough the SAT-UNSAT threshold \u03b1s(K) exists in the N \u2192 \u221e limit and coincides with the prediction from the cavity method [12]. A widely accepted conjecture is that the SAT-UNSAT threshold \u03b1s(K) exists for any value ofK. The best prediction on the location of the SATUNSAT threshold \u03b1s(K) for any K value comes from the cavity method [12, 13, 14, 15]: for example, \u03b1s(K = 3) = 4.2667 [14] and \u03b1s(K = 4) = 9.931 [15]. The cavity method also allows us to count clusters of solutions as a function of their internal entropy [16] and from this very detailed description of the space of solutions several phase transition have been identified [17, 15]. Before reaching the SAT-UNSAT threshold \u03b1s, typical formulas undergo at \u03b1d a shattering of the solutions space in a number of distinct clusters growing exponentially with the system sizeN , with vey high barriers (both energetic and entropic) separating the clusters and an even larger", "creator": " XeTeX output 2015.08.20:2224"}}}
