One of the applications is the use of text mining in digital newspapers to perform political mood analysis. In this paper, mood analysis is applied to obtain information from digital news articles about their positive or negative mood in relation to certain policy areas. In this paper, a simple model is proposed for analyzing the digital mood polarity of newspapers using the naive Bayes classification method. Initially, the model uses a set of initial data that is updated when new information emerges; the model showed promising results when tested and can be applied to some other mood analysis problems.

Almost every day there is news about politicians covering many topics, including corruption and regional elections. Mass media play an important role in delivering news and can therefore influence public opinion. For example, news media give positive ratings on a candidate while others give negative ratings. Today, news media can deliver their content via digital media. This accessibility opens up new possibilities for analyzing news content through text mining. Digital news media can be viewed as unstructured data. Today, this vast amount of data available on the Internet creates an information congestion problem [5]. Text mining has been implemented in many applications such as [1,2,3,4,6,8]. One of the proposed implementations is the analysis of readers \"attitudes to certain news. Research results from [1] suggest that naive Bajesian classification and support vector machines can be used to identify readers\" opinions, whether positive or negative, on English film reviews and Indonesian daily newspapers."}, {"heading": "2. BASIC MODEL AND ASSUMPTION", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "4. SYSTEM DESIGN AND TEST MODEL", "text": "This paper creates a system design to test the model, using articles from Indonesia's digital newspaper to create such a system. To test accuracy, the system will attempt to determine another article. Set ound are previously used by human interpreters. Prior to the test, a general system flow is established. The general system flow consists of five modules, readers and parsers, cleaners, analysers and displays. Readers and parsers separate each word and punctuation marks from the text. Then, these words are filtered by cleaners. The filter removes special words and adverbs from the sentence by comparing them to a set of predefined filter words such as \"seorang,\" a formula in English), \"Adalah\" (\"is in English),\" yang \"(meaning that a negative word in English), and adverbs from the sentence by comparing them to a set of predefined filter words such as\" seorang \"(a\" is a pronunciation in English, \"is an adalah word in English)."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The algorithm in the model is fairly general to be used in many other sentiment analysis problems with only a few modifications. The prompt test shows promising results, but further tests with larger data sets and more complex slang languages have yet to done.One main problem in applying this model is the \"who\" and \"who\" that are passed in the articles about the precise context. Finding the meaning in the context behind each sentence and associating it with whole articles is still a challenge for the future.
