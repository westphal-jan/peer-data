Conclusions", "text": "s approach to processing the causal order of a structure is NP-hard; \u2022 by building on the work of Simon [1] and Nayak [4] (cf. sentences 1 and 2), we have provided an approach to efficiently extract the basic information (a total causal mapping) for processing the causal order implicit in a given system of mathematical equations; \u2022 by concluding 1, we know how to process the complete structure of a set of mathematical equations into a total causal mapping in a time limited by O (| S | 3). \u2022 By noting 1, we know how to extract the causal order of a complete structure in a time limited by O (| S | 3)."}, {"heading": "Appendix A. Proof of Theorem 1", "text": "\"Let S (E, V) be a complete structure. Extraction of its causal order by Simon's COA (S) is NP-hard.\" Proof 6. We show that at each recursive step of the COA to find all the minimal substructures, S (S) S is translated into an optimization problem related to the decision problem BPBP, which we know is NP-complete. First, we show that for each bilateral graph G = (V1, V2, E) set with primary vertex V1 and a positive integer K corresponds to BPBP to decide whether there is a complete substructure S (E), set for S (E) and | E (V) and | V (K) is a minimum structure V1 \u2192 E and V2 \u2192 V (n.b., primary vertex set V1)."}, {"heading": "Appendix B.

Intuitively, it is shown that if we reduce ourselves to the variable 1 + 2 x + 2 x + 2, which is based on an equation f + 2 x.\" We show the first containment, the second being understood from a symmetrical point of view.
