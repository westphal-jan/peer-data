The nonnegative least-mean-square (NNLMS) algorithm and its variants allow to address this problem in an online manner. A nonnegative least mean fourth (NNLMF) algorithm has been recently proposed to improve the performance of these algorithms in cases where the measurement noise is not Gaussian. This paper provides a first theoretical analysis of the stochastic behavior of the NNLMF algorithm for stationary Gaussian inputs and slow learning.
