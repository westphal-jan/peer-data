Moreover, to solve the problem of kernel function selection and kernel parameter tuning, we proposed to construct an optimal kernel by weighted linear combination of some candidate kernels. The learning of the classifier parameter and the kernel weight are unified in a single objective function considering to minimize the upper boundary of the given multivariate performance measure. The objective function is optimized with regard to classifier parameter and kernel weight alternately in an iterative algorithm by using cutting plane algorithm. The developed algorithm is evaluated on two different pattern classification methods with regard to various multivariate performance measure optimization problems. The experiment results show the proposed algorithm outperforms the competing methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 19:45:06 GMT  (105kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06264v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["jingbin wang", "haoxiang wang", "yihua zhou", "nancy mcdonald"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.06264"}, "pdf": {"name": "1508.06264.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Multiple kernel multivariate performance learning using cutting plane algorithm", "authors": ["Jingbin Wang", "Haoxiang Wang", "Yihua Zhou", "Nancy McDonald"], "emails": ["jingbinwang1@outlook.com", "nancya.mcdonald@yahoo.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to play by the rules they have set themselves, and that they are able to play by the rules they have set themselves."}, {"heading": "II.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS", "text": "Lately, a multivariate method for optimizing performance measurements is proposed to estimate a given complex multivariate performance measurement as a linear function. This method is based on the kernel trick. However, it is difficult to select a suitable kernel function with the appropriate parameter. To solve this problem, we have in this essay the first multivariate-learning-based algorithm for the problem of optimizing multivariate performance measurements proposed. We build a unified objective function for learning both the weight of multiple cores and the classification parameter for the purpose of multivariate performance measurement on.

Moreover, to solve the problem of kernel function selection and kernel parameter tuning, we proposed to construct an optimal kernel by weighted linear combination of some candidate kernels. The learning of the classifier parameter and the kernel weight are unified in a single objective function considering to minimize the upper boundary of the given multivariate performance measure. The objective function is optimized with regard to classifier parameter and kernel weight alternately in an iterative algorithm by using cutting plane algorithm. The developed algorithm is evaluated on two different pattern classification methods with regard to various multivariate performance measure optimization problems. The experiment results show the proposed algorithm outperforms the competing methods.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
