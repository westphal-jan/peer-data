In previous work we introduced a concept of \"algorithmicity\" and of \"programmability\". Biology has already taken steps towards becoming a computer science aiming at reprogramming nature after the realisation that nature herself has reprogrammed organisms by harnessing the power of natural selection. We further unpack these ideas related to computability, algorithmic information theory and software engineering, in the context of the extent to which biology can be (re)programmed, and with how we may go about doing so in a more systematic way with all the tools and concepts offered by theoretical computer science in an translation exercise from computing to molecular biology and back. These concepts provide a means to a hierarchical organization thereby blurring previously clear-cut lines between concepts like matter and life, or between tumour types that are otherwise taken as different and may not have however a different cause. This does not diminish the properties of life or make its components and functions less interesting. On the contrary, this approach makes for a more encompassing and integrated view of nature, one that subsumes observer and observed within the same system, and can generate new perspectives and tools with which to view complex diseases like cancer, approaching them afresh from a software-engineering viewpoint that casts evolution in the role of programmer, cells as computer programs, the immune system as a program debugging tool, and diseases as a battlefield where these forces deploy.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 19:38:03 GMT  (1232kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06538v1", "28 pages, 8 figures.

These ideas can then be further developed to develop new concepts, classifications and tools that can be used to reprogram cells against disease. This is a direction in which biology is moving by deploying new immunotherapies against diseases such as cancer. An information-based approach to cancer and human diseases could be the key to understanding molecular medicine from a new perspective. The most promising approach, as in the software engineering phase, may include prevention through permanent monitoring of the immune system (see Figure 8), based on systematic screening of the immune system over time to detect trends in the response to disease, including when the strategy to detect the early course of disease is influenced by the immune system."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank the team of the Unit of Computational Medicine at the Karolinska Institutet and the support of AstraZeneca, the Strategic Area Neuroscience (StratNeuro), the Foundational Questions Institute (FQXi), the John Templeton Foundation and the Algorithmic Nature Group, LABORES."}], "references": [{"title": "Repeated nebulisation of non-viral CFTR gene therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis: a randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled, phase 2b trial", "author": ["E.W.

These concepts provide a means to a hierarchical organization thereby blurring previously clear-cut lines between concepts like matter and life, or between tumour types that are otherwise taken as different and may not have however a different cause. This does not diminish the properties of life or make its components and functions less interesting. On the contrary, this approach makes for a more encompassing and integrated view of nature, one that subsumes observer and observed within the same system, and can generate new perspectives and tools with which to view complex diseases like cancer, approaching them afresh from a software-engineering viewpoint that casts evolution in the role of programmer, cells as computing machines, DNA and genes as instructions and computer programs, viruses as hacking devices, the immune system as a software debugging tool, and diseases as an information-theoretic battlefield where all these forces deploy.
