Each project k is characterized by a valuation function; v_k(S) is the value generated by a set S of agents working on project k. We study the following classic problem in this setting: \"how should the agents divide the value that they collectively create?\". One traditional approach in cooperative game theory is to study core stability with the implicit assumption that there are infinite copies of one project, and agents can partition themselves into any number of coalitions. In contrast, we consider a model with a finite number of non-identical projects; this makes computing both high-welfare solutions and core payments highly non-trivial.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Aug 2015 09:53:40 GMT  (67kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06781v1", "Under Review"]], "COMMENTS": "Under Review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["elliot anshelevich", "shreyas sekar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.06781"}, "pdf": {"name": "1508.06781.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Computing Stable Coalitions: Approximation Algorithms for Reward Sharing", "authors": ["Elliot Anshelevich", "Shreyas Sekar"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "How should a central agency contribute to the achievement of these goals? \"This question is the central theme of this paper.\" We model a number of selfish actors in a combinatorial environment aimed at maximizing social welfare, \"the explanatory statement states."}, {"heading": "1.1 The Core", "text": "Considering an instance (N, P, (vk) k, P) with N agents (N) and \u03b2 projects, payments are jointly improved.

With unlimited copies of a project, core stability refers to the inability of each set of agents to form a group and receive more value than the payments they receive. (Sk) The stability requirement that we are considering is a natural extension of core stability to settings with a limited number of fixed projects. That is when a number of agents deviate from the inability to displace the agents who are already working on this project.

The limits we derive from this are quite strong: we are able to find both the notation (\u03b1, c) -core stable solution and the individually best possible lower limit. In a purely algorithmic sense, our problem can be considered as one of the design of adjustment algorithms that require the additional property of stabilization.

Each project k \u2208 P is characterized by a valuation function; vk(S) is the value generated by a set S of agents working on project k. We study the following classic problem in this setting: \u201chow should the agents divide the value that they collectively create?\u201d. One traditional approach in cooperative game theory is to study core stability with the implicit assumption that there are infinite copies of one project, and agents can partition themselves into any number of coalitions. In contrast, we consider a model with a finite number of non-identical projects; this makes computing both high-welfare solutions and core payments highly non-trivial. The main contribution of this paper is a black-box mechanism that reduces the problem of computing a near-optimal core stable solution to the purely algorithmic problem of welfare maximization; we apply this to compute an approximately core stable solution that extracts one-fourth of the optimal social welfare for the class of subadditive valuations. We also show much stronger results for several popular sub-classes: anonymous, fractionally subadditive, and submodular valuations, as well as provide new approximation algorithms for welfare maximization with anonymous functions. Finally, we establish a connection between our setting and the well-studied simultaneous auctions with item bidding; we adapt our results to compute approximate pure Nash equilibria for these auctions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
