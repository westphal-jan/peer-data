This is the philosophical principle underlying our conception of natural law (Jung and Pauli, 2012). According to the principle of causality, an event A can have more than one cause, none of which is sufficient to produce A. Causality is usually: (1) transitive, if an event A is a cause of B and B is a cause of C, then A is also a cause of C; (2) inflexible, an event A cannot cause itself; and (3) antisymmetrical, if A is a cause of B, then B is not a cause of A (Spirtes et al., 2000).The essence of causality is the emergence and determination of one phenomenon by another. Causality enables the presentation of our knowledge in relation to a given context through experience. Experience, we believe that the observation of the causality between events enables the discovery of irrelevance in the domain."}, {"heading": "3 Acausal Connectionist Principle", "text": "The synchronicity principle can occur as a single event in a chain of related events and can be defined by a significant coincidence occurring between a mental state and an event in the outer world (Martin et al., 2009). Jung believed that two acausal events did not arise by chance, but by a common meaning. Thus, in order to experience a synchronized event, one must extract the meaning of its symbols for the interpretation of synchronicity. Thus, the synchronicity principle can be regarded as a correlation between two acausal events linked by meaning (Jung and Pauli, 2012). Jung defended that the connection between a mental state and matter is due to the energy associated with the synchronicity event (Jung and Pauli, 2012). This metaphysical assertion is based on the fact that it is the interpretation of the person who defines the meaning of a synchronous event."}, {"heading": "4 Quantum-Like Bayesian Networks: Combining Causal and Acausal Principles for Quantum Cognition", "text": "The reason why we turn to Bayean networks is that they are inspired by human cognition (Griffiths et al., 2008). It is easier for a person to combine evidence and think about it, rather than calculating all possible events and their respective beliefs. Likewise, Bayean networks also represent this link between human cognition and rational inductive reasoning. Instead of representing the complete common distribution, Bayean networks represent the decision problem in small modules that can be combined to make conclusions, calculating only the probabilities that are actually needed to make the conclusions."}, {"heading": "4.1 Classical Bayesian Networks", "text": "A classic Bayesian network is a directional acyclic graph structure. Each node represents a different random variable from a particular domain, and each edge represents a direct influence from the source node to the target node. The graph also represents independence relationships between random variables and is followed by a conditional probability table specifying the probability distribution of the current node to its parents (Koller and Friedman, 2009).A Bayesian network represents a complete common probability distribution by conditional declarations of independence to answer questions about the domain.The complete common distribution (Russel and Norvig, 2010) of a Bayesian network in which X is the list of variables is represented by Equation 1.Prc (X1,.., Xn) = n-i = 1 Pr (Xi | Parents (Xi)))) variable (1) To answer queries, the network allows the combination of the relevant entries of the probability distribution of the common X in the probability completeness process."}, {"heading": "4.2 From Classical Bayesian Networks to Quantum-Like Networks", "text": "Let's assume that we have a Bayesian network with three random variables with the following structure: B \u00b2 A \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 (A = t) Pr (A = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (A = f) Pr (B = t = t) Pr (B = t = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (A = t) Pr (A = t) Pr (A = f) Pr (B = t = t) Pr (B = t = t) Pr (B = t = t) Pr (A = t = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (B = t) Pr (P = p = p) Pr (B = p = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p = p (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p (A) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr (A (B = p) Pr (B = p) Pr ("}, {"heading": "4.3 Quantum-Like Bayesian Network", "text": "A quantum-like Bayesian network can be defined in the same way as a classical Bayesian network with the difference that real probability numbers are replaced by quantum probability amplitudes (Tucci, 1995; Leifer and Poulin, 2008).The quantum counterpart of the complete common probability distribution corresponds to the application of Born's rule to Equation 1.

It corresponds to a directed or undirected graph in which nodes represent concepts and edges reflect semantic relationships. Extracting the semantic network from the original Bayesian network is a necessary step to find variables that are connected only in a meaningful way (and not necessarily by cause-and-effect relationships), just as it is randomly indicated in synchronicity. Consider the Bayesian network in Figure 1 (Russel and Norvig, 2010; Pearl, 1988). To extract its semantic meaning, we need to take into account the context of the network. Suppose that you have installed a new intrusion alarm at home. It can detect an intrusion, but sometimes also respond to earthquakes. John and Mary are two neighbors who promised to call you when they hear the alarm. John calls whenever he hears the alarm, but sometimes confuses the Mary and the phone to call."}, {"heading": "4.5 Setting Quantum Parameters According to the Synchronicity Principle", "text": "In Section 4.3 it was explained that Eq.11 generates an exponential number of quantum constellations = quantum constellations influenced by the number of unknown variables. If nothing is said about how these quantum parameters can be assigned, then we end up with an interval of possible probabilities. This means that one needs some kind of heuristic function that is able to automatically assign these quantum parameters. We define the synchronicity heuristically in a similar way to the Jung principle: two variables are supposedly synchronized when they share a meaningful connection between them. This meaningful connection can be achieved by a semantic network representation of the variables in question, which will allow the emergence of new meaningful connections that would only arise with regard to cause / effect relationships."}, {"heading": "5 Example of Application", "text": "We queried each variable of the network in Figure 1 without providing an observation, and we also performed the following queries: Pr (JonhCalls = true), Pr (MaryCalls = true), Pr (Alarm = true), Pr (Burglar = true), and Pr (Earthquake = true). We then extracted both classical and quantum conclusions, and presented the results in Figure 5, which shows that if nothing is known about the state of the world, quantum probabilities tend to increase and overcome their classical counterpart. In quantum theory, if nothing is observed, all nodes of the Bayesian network are in an overlay state. For every possible configuration in this overlay state, a probability amplitude is associated with it. During the overlay state, the amplitudes of the probabilities of the nodes of the Bayesian network are modified by the action."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we analyzed a quantum Bayesian network that brings together cause-and-effect relationships and semantic similarities between events, which represent causal connections based on the synchronicity principle and establish new relationships with the graphical models. As a result, events can be presented in vector spaces where quantum parameters are determined by the similarities these vectors share between them. In the field of quantum cognition, quantum parameters could represent the correlation between events (beliefs) in a meaningful acoustic relationship shift. The proposed quantum-like phenomena are quantum physical phenomena that benefit from the same advantages of classical Bayesian networks: (1) it allows visual representation of all relationships between random variables of a given decision scenario, (2) we can draw conclusions about unobserved variables, i.e., we can deal with uncertainty. (3) it makes it easier to detect independent and dependent variables."}], "references": [{"title": "Quantum structures: An attempt to explain the origin of their appearence", "author": ["D.
