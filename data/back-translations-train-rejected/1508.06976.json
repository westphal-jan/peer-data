Existing approaches to causal prediction queries have a number of limitations. First, they exhaustively search over an acyclic causal network to find the most likely k effect events; however, data from real event streams frequently reflect cyclic causality. Second, they contain conservative assumptions intended to exclude all possible non-causal links in the causal network; it leads to the omission of many less-frequent but important causal links. We overcome these limitations by proposing a novel event precedence model and a run-time causal inference mechanism. The event precedence model constructs a first order absorbing Markov chain incrementally over event streams, where an edge between two events signifies a temporal precedence relationship between them, which is a necessary condition for causality. Then, the run-time causal inference mechanism learns causal relationships dynamically during query processing. This is done by removing some of the temporal precedence relationships that do not exhibit causality in the presence of other events in the event precedence model. This paper presents two query processing algorithms -- one performs exhaustive search on the model and the other performs a more efficient reduced search with early termination. Experiments using two real datasets (cascading blackouts in power systems and web page views) verify the effectiveness of the probabilistic top-k prediction queries and the efficiency of the algorithms. Specifically, the reduced search algorithm reduced runtime, relative to exhaustive search, by 25-80% (depending on the application) with only a small reduction in accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Aug 2015 15:02:09 GMT  (819kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06976v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["saurav acharya", "byung suk lee", "paul hines"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.06976"}, "pdf": {"name": "1508.06976.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Real-time Top-K Predictive Query Processing over Event Streams", "authors": ["Saurav Acharya", "Byung Suk Lee", "Paul Hines"], "emails": ["phines}@uvm.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 150 8.06 976v 1 [cs.D B] 2Keywords: top k query; event stream; causal network; prediction."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able to survive themselves are not able to survive themselves.

However, the traditional causal network cannot be used for query processing due to the causal information loss and its lack of support for cyclic causality. To solve this problem, since we already know that every causal relationship is always a temporal precedent relationship, we propose to derive causality during query processing from the event precedent network in order to determine the possible effects. In our work, the predictive query is a continuous query, so that the ranking of results may change each time a new event is observed. The idea is to examine the event precedent network (EPN), which represents all precedent relationships (including cyclical precedent relationships) among the event types, in order to determine the predictive effects of the cause of the variable fraction effects are always available."}, {"heading": "5.2 Exhaustive Search Algorithm", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Approach", "text": "The simplest solution to the top-k prediction problem is to search for all possible effects exhaustively during runtime causal conclusion via EPN and then sort them, according to their results, in no increasing order to determine the k effects with the top scores. We call this solution the Exhaustive Search (ES) approach.The ES approach should be a robust strategy for researching the EPN to derive effects. As discussed earlier, an outward-looking breadth initial search via the EPN for runtime causal conclusion can be executed. However, the score calculation of the effects is not straightforward. In order to apply the multiplicative property of conditional probability, which is described in Section 5.1, the results of the parents of an event type should be calculated which is not always calculated, which is not always possible, as shown in Figure 6.

First, an outward-looking search via G from EOP (the latest cause-event type CB) is executed to determine the causal search order; line 1 shows this step.Second, the marginal independence tests between the event types are performed during the search to remove weak relationships (lines 2-7)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Reduced Search Early Termination Algorithm", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.3.1 Approach", "text": "The ES algorithm searches exhaustively in the EPN during query processing to determine the top k results, and therefore it can be quite slow. More importantly, it scales very poorly and therefore this approach is probably insoluble for a large network. Of course, there is a need for an alternative method that is faster. There are two problems to deal with for this purpose. Runtime: With the full search for ES on EPN to find all possible results, the search space increases with the number of variables and performs unnecessary calculations. A good quantum processing method should avoid redundant and unnecessary calculations to reduce runtime. Accuracy: Normally, the goal conflict for reducing runtime is the loss of accuracy of the results. Runtime is reduced by reducing the search space, which can skip the correct effects events.

Intuitively, the accuracy of the FCNI algorithm would suffer increasingly as the number of cycles increases over the number of cycles in the EPN. Therefore, despite its reduced runtime, the FCNI algorithm is not suitable for processing predictive queries on event streams.The accuracy of the RSET algorithm is comparable to the accuracy of the ES dataset."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "This work focused on the problem of continuous top-k prediction of event flows. We therefore proposed a novel causal inference mechanism, called runtime causal inference (RSET), to support cyclical causal relationships and overcome causal information loss. Then, we proposed two algorithms for query processing, the so-called Reduced Search with Early Termination (RSET) algorithm and the Exhaustive Search (ES) algorithm, which uses causal inference to continuously predict top-k effects. Finally, we demonstrated through experiments that the proposed approach overcomes the two main limitations of the traditional causal inference approach - acyclic causality and causal information loss. We showed that the proposed RSET and ES algorithms predict the causal inference force for real data that nowadays in different areas of application we anticipate that there will be significant improvements to the series of future events in the timetable.There are a number of problems we anticipate in the current."}], "references": [{"title": "Fast causal network inference over event streams.

are most likely to occur next, over historical real-time event streams. Existing approaches to causal prediction queries have a number of limitations. First, they exhaustively search over an acyclic causal network to find the most likely k effect events; however, data from real event streams frequently reflect cyclic causality. Second, they contain conservative assumptions intended to exclude all possible non-causal links in the causal network; it leads to the omission of many less-frequent but important causal links. We overcome these limitations by proposing a novel event precedence model and a runtime causal inference mechanism. The event precedence model constructs a first order absorbing Markov chain incrementally over event streams, where an edge between two events signifies a temporal precedence relationship between them, which is a necessary condition for causality. Then, the run-time causal inference mechanism learns causal relationships dynamically during query processing. This is done by removing some of the temporal precedence relationships that do not exhibit causality in the presence of other events in the event precedence model. This paper presents two query processing algorithms \u2013 one performs exhaustive search on the model and the other performs a more efficient reduced search with early termination. Experiments using two real datasets (cascading blackouts in power systems and web page views) verify the effectiveness of the probabilistic top-k prediction queries and the efficiency of the algorithms. Specifically, the reduced search algorithm reduced runtime, relative to exhaustive search, by 25\u2212 80% (depending on the application) with only a small reduction in accuracy.", "creator": "gnuplot 4.2 patchlevel 4 "}}}
