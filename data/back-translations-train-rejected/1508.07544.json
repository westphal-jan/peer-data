Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to another world, in which they will be able to move to another world, in which they will be able to move, in which they will be able to move."}, {"heading": "1.1 Rationale for a Survey of Computational Sociolinguistics", "text": "The increased interest in studying a social phenomenon such as language use from a data-driven or computational perspective illustrates a more general trend in the scientific agenda. The study of social phenomena by computational methods is commonly referred to as \"Computational Social Science.\" [152] The growing interest of social scientists in computational methods can be seen as evidence of the general increase in attention to cross-disciplinary research perspectives. \"Multidisciplinary,\" \"interdisciplinary,\" \"disciplinary\" and \"transdisciplinary\" terms are among the terms used to illustrate the shift from monodisciplinary research formats to models of collaboration that take diversity into account in the selection of data and methodological frameworks. However, despite various attempts to harmonize terminology, the adoption of such terms is often insufficiently supported by definitions, and they tend to be used in alternate ways."}, {"heading": "1.2 Scope of Discussion", "text": "Given the breadth of this field, we will limit the scope of this survey as follows: First, the coverage of sociolinguistic topics will be selective and will be determined primarily by work within computational linguistics that touches on sociolinguistic topics. For readers seeking a more complete overview of sociolinguistics, we recommend the following introductory readings [20, 119, 169]. The availability of social media and other online data is one of the primary driving factors behind the emergence of computational approaches to computational sociolinguistics. One relevant area of research that goes beyond the scope of this survey is therefore the study of computer-mediated communication (CMC) [109]. Given the strong focus on language data within sociolinguistics, there is much potential for computational approaches that apply to linguistic data. Furthermore, the increased availability of language data and transcribed speaking is a revival in the study of multilinguistic themes across the 130 social dimensions [as well as the] the multidimensions of language [and the multilinguistic relationships between the]."}, {"heading": "1.3 NLP Applications", "text": "In addition to new insights into language usage in social contexts, research in computer sociolinguistics could potentially have implications for the development of applications for processing textual social media and other content. For example, user profiling tools could benefit from research on automatic recognition of gender [33], age [186], geographical location [68], or other affiliations of users [204] based on their texts. The challenge is that the cases where it is most helpful to use variables such as age and gender to correctly treat the interpretation of language are the same cases where it is most difficult to automatically recognize these variables. Nevertheless, there is some published conceptual evidence that points to potential value in hiding the typical \"static\" view of language embodied in current NLP tools."}, {"heading": "2. Methods for Computational Sociolinguistics", "text": "As discussed, an important objective of this article is to promote cooperation between the fields of sociolinguistics in particular and social sciences research related to communication in the broader sense on the one hand and computational linguistics on the other. By focusing on the relationship with methods from sociolinguistics and the social sciences in general, we are able to underline two expectations. First, we are convinced that sociolinguistics and related fields can help the field of computational linguistics to develop richer models that are more effective for the tasks for which they can be used. Second, the time seems right for the CL community to contribute to sociolinguistics and social sciences, not only by developing and adapting tools for sociolinguists, but also by refining theoretical models within sociolinguistics through computational approaches and contributions to understanding the social dynamics of natural language."}, {"heading": "2.1 Validation of Modeling Approaches", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to a different world in which they are able to live than in a world in which they are able to live and live."}, {"heading": "2.2 Theory versus Empiricism", "text": "In order to explain why this is the case, it is necessary to discuss the value of theory against empiricism. Within the CL community, a paradigm shift took place after the mid-1990s. Approaches combining symbolic and statistical methods were of interest, but with the focus on very large enterprises and new frameworks for large-scale statistical modeling, symbolic and knowledge-driven methods were largely set aside. Besides older symbolic methods, which require carefully crafted grammars and lexicographs, the concept of the knowledge source was strongly associated with the concept of theory, which is in line with the philosophical conception of linguistic theory."}, {"heading": "2.3 Quantitative versus Qualitative Approaches", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "2.4 Spotlight on Corpora and Other Data", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move to another world, in which they are able to move to another world, in which they are able to move to another world, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in fact, in which they, in fact, in which they, in fact, live, in which they, in which they, live, in which they, in which they, in fact, in which they, in which they, in fact, in fact, are able to put themselves, in a different world, in which they, in which they are able to live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they are able to live, in which they, in a different world, in which they, in which they are able"}, {"heading": "3.

Dadvar et al. [46] trained gender classifiers to detect cases of cyberbullying, noting that the language used by harassers varies by gender. To improve predictive performance in detecting the direction of performance between participants in e-mails, Prabhakaran et al. [212] included the gender of participants in e-mail conversations and the general \"gender environment\" as characteristics in their model. Volkova et al. [259] investigated gender differences in the use of subjective language on Twitter. Presenting gender as a binary trait was not effective, but the use of traits based on gender sentient concepts, improved gender-specific subjectivity and sentification [12-1]."}, {"heading": "4. Language and Social Interaction", "text": "In the previous section, we explored computer-aided approaches to examine how language shapes our identity. We discussed variables such as gender, age, and geographical location, focusing on the variation between speakers. Speakers, however, do not act in isolation, but are part of couples, groups, and communities. Therefore, there is a lot of variation within individual speakers, as language also varies according to context, including the recipient or target audience, the topic, and the social goals of speakers. Next, we discuss computer-aided approaches to examine how language reflects and shapes our social relationships (Section 4.2). Much of this work revolves around the role of language in power dynamics by exploring how speakers use language to maintain and change power relationships."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data Sources", "text": "Many of the types of data relevant to the study of concepts of social identity are also relevant to work on communication dynamics in couples, groups, and communities, and the availability of detailed interaction records in online data has driven and enabled much of the work on this topic within computational linguistics. A variety of online discussion forums have been analyzed, including online cancer support communities [184, 263] and even a street gang forum [204]. Review sites such as TripAdvisor [170], IMDb [108], and beer review communities [52] have also been used in studies of language in online communities. Enron's email corpus occurs in analyses of power relationships [56, 85, 208, 212] because Enron's organizational structure is known and can be integrated into studies of hierarchical power [52]. For studies that include more dynamic notions of power (e.g. identifying people pursuing power through political talk), other resources, including Wikipedia [24], including 250."}, {"heading": "4.2 Shaping Social Relationships", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far in the United States as it has this year."}, {"heading": "4.3 Style Shifting", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want.

We will begin by exploring automatic language identification, which is an important step in the processing of many language-specific analysis tasks. Automatic language identification is often the first step for systems that process mixed language texts. We will then engage in a discussion about various NLP tools (e.g. parsers, theme modeling)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Analysis and Prediction of Multilingual Communication", "text": "According to Thomason [252], Gardner-Chloros and Edwards [80] and Bhatt and Bolonyai [23], social factors (e.g. speaker attitudes and motives, social and political context) can play an important role in addition to linguistic factors in multilingual contexts. A comprehensive analysis of social factors in multilingual contexts has only recently become possible due to the availability of automatic language identification tools. Twitter is often used as a resource for such studies. Focusing on user-level language choice, researchers have extracted network structures based on followers and followers [71, 138], or mentions and retweets [103], and analyzed the relationship between the composition of such networks and the language choice of users. Users who tweet in multiple languages are often found as a bridge between communities that tweet in one language."}, {"heading": "6.

Developing models that can guide users of data analysis systems in the next steps. Sociolinguists are primarily interested in new insights into linguistic usage. In contrast, much of the work within CL focuses on highly specific analysis tasks that are isolated from application scenarios, and the focus on the performance indicators obtained for such tasks is fairly dominant. Only a few analytical methods have validated the results (have we measured the right thing?) in terms of the potential for integrating models outside laboratory environments. In addition, many of the models developed within CL use thousands of characteristics. As a result, it is often difficult to apply the predictions in a real environment, and their value for practical data exploration tasks is therefore often limited. Scanty models (e.g. [69] that identify small groups of pre-explored data tasks as suitable for sociolinguistic biometric analytical tasks) are therefore not written in a practical environment."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "While the field of computational linguistics has historically focused on the interpretation and manipulation of the sentence content of language, a different valid view of language is that it is a dynamic, social entity. While some aspects of language are predictable from a social perspective and therefore behave similarly to other aspects that are more frequently the subject of research in this area, we must acknowledge that linguistic action has played a large part in how language is used to construct social identities, build and maintain social relationships, and even define the boundaries of communities. With the increasing research into social media data and in parallel with the advent of computational social science, we have observed a sharp increase in interest within the computational linguistic community in sociolinguistic topics. In this article, we have defined and set out a research agenda for the emerging field of \"computational sociolinguistics.\" We have set ourselves the goal of providing a comprehensive overview of studies published in the field of CL that touch on sociolinguistic topics, in order to provide a sociolinguistic overview of what has been achieved so far for sociolinguistic space and where there is a socio-space."}], "references": [{"title": "Combination of recurrent neural networks and factored language models for code-switching language modeling", "author": ["Heike Adel", "Thang Ngoc Vu", "Tanja Schultz"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers),", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2013}, {"title": "An unsupervised system for identifying English inclusions in German text", "author": ["Beatrice Alex"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the ACL Student Research Workshop,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Online data collection", "author": ["Jannis Androutsopoulos"], "venue": "Data Collection in Sociolinguistics: Methods and Applications.

In this article we present a survey of the emerging field of \u2018Computational Sociolinguistics\u2019 that reflects this increased interest. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of CL research on sociolinguistic themes, featuring topics such as the relation between language and social identity, language use in social interaction and multilingual communication. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for synergy between the research communities involved, by showing how the large-scale data-driven methods that are widely used in CL can complement existing sociolinguistic studies, and how sociolinguistics can inform and challenge the methods and assumptions employed in CL studies. We hope to convey the possible benefits of a closer collaboration between the two communities and conclude with a discussion of open challenges.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
