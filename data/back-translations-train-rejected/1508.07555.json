Gigantic volumes of data are created all over the world. This information is available to us by connecting to the Internet. Events (e.g. the Ebola virus, the Islamic State) make us easy and free. Millions of comments spread over the Internet. Access to this information is conducive to our decision-making. We consume information, but we also produce it. Social media (e.g. Twitter) make us express opinions."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "These representations can be roughly divided into three paradigms: a logical semantic network (e.g. ontology), a scalable knowledge database (e.g. freebase), and a semantic network that refers to networks constructed with human labor. They mainly focus on a closed domain, for example conceptual graphics that represent logic as graphics (Sowa, 1984). These networks support questions and assertions from natural language to a relative database. Logically based semantic networks are constructed by domain experts and used as domain-specific ontologies."}, {"heading": "3 Motivation and Definition", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "4 Implementation", "text": "This section discusses our method of building event networks, which are used to identify methods discussed in Section 5."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data Sets", "text": "We use the Chinese Corpus ACE 2005. It contains 633 documents commented on with 15,264 entities and 33,932 entities1. 7 entities types (e.g. person, organization, etc.) and 44 entity subtypes are defined. The corpus is also commented on with 6 main relationship types and 18 kinship subtypes. Each kinship instance has two named entities as arguments. There are 9,244 kinship mentions collected as positive instances. The Chinese Corpus ACE 2005 is used to train named entity and relation classifiers. To demonstrate our method in an open field, we also use the corpus of the fifth issue of the Chinese Gigaword. It uses the Peoples Daily source, which contains 145,001 news wire texts for the period from November 2006 to December 2010."}, {"heading": "4.2 Events Detection", "text": "The purpose of document capture is to group documents into events. We use the LDA toolkit provided by Phan and Nguyen (2007) to accomplish this task. In the LDA model, a corpus is first represented as a matrix, with each column pointing to a document vector, and each line representing the distribution of a term in documents. LDA then maps documents from a term space into a topic space. Topics are hidden variables. Because we focus on message delivery texts, which often use short texts. We use omni-word features suggested by Chen and others. (2014), which consider each potential word as terms of documents. It is a subset of n-gram features. In the pretreatment process, we remove high and low frequency words from an applied lexicon. Words with frequencies below 10 are also removed. Hyperparameters are needed to develop an LDA model."}, {"heading": "4.3 Named Entity Recognizing", "text": "In our proposal, we use a Boundary Assembly Method (BA) to perform the detection task of the named entity. The idea of the BA Method is that instead of recognizing the mention of the entity in a unified style, it first recognizes the boundaries of mentioning the entity and then merges the detected boundaries into candidates for mentioning the entity. Each candidate is further judged by a classification. In our work, we recognize three types of the named entity: \"PER\" (person), \"LOC\" (place) and \"ORG\" (organization). To filter the noise, detected named entities with Chinese characters below two and above six are discarded."}, {"heading": "4.4 Relation Recognizing", "text": "To detect relationships between named entities, we use the method proposed in Chen et al. (2014), which proposes an omni-word characteristic and a soft-constraint method for Chinese relation extraction, using each potential word in a relation reference as lexical characteristics, and then selecting a suitable constraint condition for each atomic characteristic used to combine it with additional information to maximize classification determination. In our three entity types, five relationship types commented on in the ACE corpus are detected: \"PER-SOC,\" \"GEN-AFF,\" \"ORG-AFF,\" \"PART-GANZ,\" and \"PHYS.\" Sentences with more than ten entities are ignored because the extraction of relationships in a long sentence is error-prone."}, {"heading": "4.5 Merging and Visualizing", "text": "As described above, the results of recognized document events, named entities, and relationships are listed in Table 1. In the following, we will use the igraph toolkit provided by Csardi and Nepusz (2006) for the analysis of event networks, which shows extracted entity mentions and relationships as a diagram. For visualization, a toolkit for network analysis (Pajek) by Batagelj and Mrvar (1998) is used."}, {"heading": "5 Application", "text": "In our work, we emphasize analyses of event networks. After event networks have been built, techniques such as social networks, complex networks can be used to analyze event networks. For example, we can navigate units around them by specifying a person's name as a central unit. By filtering irrelevant information, we can show character relationships within an event. Moreover, the \"PART-GANCE\" relationships can support the visualization of multi-granularity. Since event networks have a graphical representation, topological information is available. Therefore, various approaches (e.g. statistical relational learning) can be used to improve network quality. In addition, event networks support the exploration of human-oriented information. When people explore open information, manual interventions can be used to modify the quality of event networks. In this section, we will select a document Event in Time Step 0 as an example that contains 1,041 documents. There are 436 named units and 6.2 represent the most probable relationships, \"the most likely words in this context and the\" event. \""}, {"heading": "5.1 Information Filtering", "text": "The simplest way to analyze event networks is to filter information that is irrelevant or uninteresting. Figure 2 (a) leaves only person names and \"PER-SOC\" relationships to show character relationships in an event network. (a) Information Filtering (b) PLA AnalysisThis example can be formalized as: Let N be an event network. The filtered event network N \"= {V,\" E \"} is a subgraph of N, so that N.\" And N \"suffices for N\" v \"V\" (v.type = PER) and \"E\" (e.type = PER-SOC). Using information contained in vertex and vertex frames, information filtering can provide effective approaches for exploring open information. For example, in vertex frames and vertex frames we can require that the value in weight frames be greater than a predefined threshold. Using information in vertex and vertex frames, we can directly collect information that we can see in specific timeframes or in Figure."}, {"heading": "5.2 PLT Analysis", "text": "It can be used to track a person to find trajectories of targets. Person, location are extracted by methods for identifying designated entities. While the T ime is different, a document distinguishes between two types of T ime: implicit temporal information and explicit temporal information. Extracting this information requires information extraction or text comprehension techniques. In many applications, it is ignored. Generally, all documents in open fields have explicit temporal information, which includes the creation, modification and transmission of document timestamps. They are metadata that are distributed with documents. In our paper, because we focus on message wire texts, where the explicit temporal information of documents is published together."}, {"heading": "5.3 Action Analysis", "text": "rE \"s rf\u00fc ide rf\u00fc ide f\u00fc die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f der f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f der die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f die f e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e"}, {"heading": "5.4 Social Network Analysis", "text": "Techniques (e.g. Short Path, Cohesive Subgroup, Center, etc.) proposed in social networks are mainly implemented on a network designed by domain experts. A precise network is required to detect the underlying structure of the social network. As event networks are automatically extracted, they are prone to errors, making it difficult for some of these techniques to obtain reliable results. However, some results generated by social networks also show meaningful information for us. Figure 2 (d) provides an example. Data in this example comes from information filtering and PLT analysis results. The left of Figure 2 (d) seeks a short path between \"real\" (Hamid Karzai) and \"real\" (the Minister of Foreign Affairs), which are connected by \"PER-SOC\" relationships.
