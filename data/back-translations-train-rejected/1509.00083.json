However, accurate automated segmentation remains challenging due to the presence of noise, inhomogeneity and the high appearance variability of malignant tissue. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised metastatic liver tumour segmentation framework using a machine learning approach based on discriminant Grassmannian manifolds which learns the appearance of tumours with respect to normal tissue. First, the framework learns within-class and between-class similarity distributions from a training set of images to discover the optimal manifold discrimination between normal and pathological tissue in the liver. Second, a conditional optimisation scheme computes nonlocal pairwise as well as pattern-based clique potentials from the manifold subspace to recognise regions with similar labelings and to incorporate global consistency in the segmentation process. The proposed framework was validated on a clinical database of 43 CT images from patients with metastatic liver cancer. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves a better performance on two separate datasets of metastatic liver tumours from different clinical sites, yielding an overall mean Dice similarity coefficient of 90.7 +/- 2.4 in over 50 tumours with an average volume of 27.3 mm3.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Aug 2015 21:45:40 GMT  (3569kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00083v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["samuel kadoury", "eugene vorontsov", "an tang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.00083"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.00083.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Metastatic Liver Tumor Segmentation from Discriminant Grassmannian Manifolds", "authors": ["Samuel Kadourya", "Eugene Vorontsov", "An Tang"], "emails": ["samuel.kadoury@polymtl.ca", "eugene.vorontsov@polymtl.ca", "duotango@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Early detection, diagnosis and monitoring of liver cancer progression can be achieved with precise delineation of metastatic tumors.

Subsequently, the segmentation process of a new CT scan uses the multiple potentials in a conditional random segmentation process to pinpoint the region of interest."}, {"heading": "2.1. Imaging data", "text": "The first clinical dataset was the public dataset of the 2008 MICCAI segmentation challenge, used by several other groups for tumor segmentation [22]. The second clinical dataset consisted of a total of 30 images provided by radiology departments from two different clinical institutes, a total of 40 tumors. The first dataset included 12 contrast-enhanced CT scans, a total of 15 tumors with ground truth segmentation.

Learning Discriminant Grassmannian Manifolds", "text": "Diverse learning algorithms are based on the premise that data is often of artificially high dimensions and can be embedded in a lower dimensional space. However, the presence of outliers and multi-class information, on the other hand, can affect the ability to distinguish and / or generalize the multiplicity. We present here the mechanism of learning the optimal separation between normal and pathological tissue by using a discriminatory graph embedding based on Grassman's manifolds proposed by [23], where they are adapted to the segmentation process. Here, we describe the Grassman cores applied to the input data, which are embedded in a discriminatory multidimensional domain embedded within and between similarity diagrams."}, {"heading": "2.2.1.

The relationship between diagonal D and laplac L matrices is modeled using L = D \u2212 W. Here, each element of D describes the sum of the weight matrix W. By representing an architecture as fixed nodes and edges, the goal of embedding diagrams is to increase the discriminatory power of embedded data by mapping the high-dimensional distribution data to another low-dimensional space. In the context of embedding, similarities between the pairs of labels remain the same in both areas by solving a general self-analytical problem [24]."}, {"heading": "2.2.3. Within and between similarity graphs", "text": "In our work, the manifold embedding of M is constructed with a graph W w located within the class, which describes the similarity of regions with the same type (tumor and normal liver tissue), and a penal graph W b located between the classes, which is used to distinguish between normal and tumor tissue. In the construction of the discriminatory LLE graph, elements are divided between these two classes. (Intrinsic graph G is initially generated by assigning edges only to nodes of the same class (tumor or or normal).The local reconstruction coefficient matrix M (i, j) is achieved by minimizing: min M \u2211 j (i), xi \u2212 M (i, j) xj (2)."}, {"heading": "2.2.4.

Fully-Connected Graph Segmentation", "text": "In this subsection, we describe the segmentation framework with the minimization of the energy concept used in the process, as well as the definition of energy concepts defined in the manifold space.We use random random fields of higher order [21, 10] where instead of using direct voxel intensities, which is a high-dimensional problem, clique potentials are derived from the trained discriminatory embeddings to perform an unverified tumor segmentation.The potentials describing the smoothness concepts limit traditional techniques in the segmentation of small structures in specific regions of interest, such as hyper-vascular tumors and irregularly shaped metastases. Indeed, models that provide intelligent potentials generated with regular CRFs are very smooth results that do not follow the actual region of interest."}, {"heading": "2.3.1. Manifold-based potentials", "text": "Here we describe the three potentials that represent the objective function of the CRF, defined in Eq = q (11).Unary potentials in the CRF model, represented by the term \u0432 (vi) of the energy function, represent the probability of assigning a patch i with a specific label. Typically, the uniary potential is determined by the cruelty scale value of the voxel and the appearance model for each region of interest. However, intensity alone is not sufficient to distinguish between similar groups and often produces erroneous tumor delineations. Instead, we propose to use sophisticated potential functions based on multiple representations of the classification model (ci | vi) = \u2212 log (P (ci | vi)), which evaluates the probability that the extracted patch belongs to the region of interest based on its embedded position within the Grassmannian multiplicity. The probability is calculated on the negative value of the log functionality."}, {"heading": "2.3.2. Energy minimization", "text": "Kohli et al. [21] showed that Ro-bust functions of higher order can be found by extending or replacing the clique function with additional binary terms. Optimal shifts are calculated for these algorithms to minimize the clique potential. Therefore, the high-order displacement terms are converted into submodular quadratic functions and optimized based on diagram segmentation. Finally, we apply a primary-dual algorithm called FastPD [27], which can solve the problem efficiently by formulating the duality theory in linear programming, compared to other methods that do not offer optimal solutions or require long start-up times to guarantee the optimal speed of global generation of PD, without ensuring optimum generationality."}, {"heading": "2.4. Validation methodology", "text": "In order to evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a controlled environment and to help determine parameter values for the proposed framework, a data set was created from synthetic phantoms using uniform aggregates (8% agar w / v), as shown in Fig. 3 (a), used for an initial clinical evaluation. Phantoms provide a medium to generate artificial data in a controlled environment, whereby each model encompasses a tumor region consisting of diluted dyes comparable to real patient images. Previous studies have shown that significant information on the behavior of image processing algorithms was provided [28]. In total, nine phantoms were created, with each model comprising a diluted dye region consisting of dyes in the center of the phantom model. The size of the tumor (between 1 and 5 cm), as well as the contrast of the tumor in each synthetic image was adjusted from one phantom to one C12 for each resolution."}, {"heading": "3. Results", "text": "In this section we present the experiments carried out with both synthetic and clinical data sets of CT images of liver tumors.

Artificial data", "text": "The Grassmannian multiplicity was trained with soil-truth data sets and the optimal neighborhood size was found at k1 = 10 for within the class similarity graph (Nw), and k2 = 5 for between class neighborhoods (Nb). The optimal multiplicity dimension was set at d = 6 when the trend of nonlinear residual error curve stabilized throughout the training. Fig. 4a shows the ROC curves when using different types of cores (k [CC], k [CC], k [CC + proj]), showing the increased accuracy when using the combined kernels (\u03b11 = 1, \u03b12 = 5, h = 1), each of which extract complementary features from the training data.

The average time for tumor segmentation was 53 sec, with an input ROI.

The mean and RMS surface spacing (1.4 \u00b1 0.3 and 1.6 \u00b1 0.4mm) of the proposed method were significantly lower (p \u2264 0.05) than the distances generated by [30] and [10].

However accurate automated segmentation remains challenging due to presence of noise, inhomogeneity and high appearance variability of malignant tissue. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised metastatic liver tumor segmentation framework using a machine learning approach based discriminant Grassmannian manifolds which learns the appearance of tumors with respect to normal tissue. First, the framework learns within-class and between-class similarity distributions from a training set of images to discover the optimal manifold discrimination between normal and pathological tissue in the liver. Second, a conditional optimization scheme computes non-local pairwise as well as pattern-based clique potentials from the manifold subspace to recognize regions with similar labelings and incorporate global consistency in the segmentation process. The proposed framework was validated on clinical database of 43 CT images from patients with metastatic liver cancer. Compared to stateof-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance on two separate datasets of metastatic liver tumors from different clinical sites, yielding an overall mean Dice similarity coefficient of 90.7\u00b1 2.4 in over 50 tumors with an average volume of 27.3mm.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
