Therefore, various personalized recommendation systems have been proposed. However, they ignore that the accelerated proliferation of social media data has led to the big data era, which has greatly impeded the process of video recommendation. In addition, none of them has considered both the privacy of users' contexts (e,g,. social status, ages and hobbies) and video service vendors' repositories, which are extremely sensitive and of significant commercial value. To handle the problems, we propose a cloud-assisted differentially private video recommendation system based on distributed online learning. In our framework, service vendors are modeled as distributed cooperative learners, recommending videos according to user's context, while simultaneously adapting the video-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks (reward). Considering the sparsity and heterogeneity of big social media data, we also propose a novel \\emph{geometric differentially private} model, which can greatly reduce the performance (recommendation accuracy) loss. Our simulation shows the proposed algorithms outperform other existing methods and keep a delicate balance between computing accuracy and privacy preserving level.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Sep 2015 09:01:07 GMT  (3385kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00181v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1307.0781by other authors"], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Sep 2015 03:03:14 GMT  (4107kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00181v2", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1307.0781by other authors"], ["v3", "Sat, 10 Oct 2015 04:59:08 GMT  (4575kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00181v3", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1307.0781by other authors. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1307.0781by other authors"], ["v4", "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 07:46:32 GMT  (4575kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00181v4", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1307.0781by other authors. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1307.0781by other authors"], ["v5", "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 08:30:28 GMT  (4575kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00181v5", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1307.0781by other authors"], ["v6", "Mon, 11 Jan 2016 06:20:50 GMT  (4108kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00181v6", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1307.0781by other authors"], ["v7", "Mon, 1 Feb 2016 05:06:37 GMT  (4108kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00181v7", null]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1307.0781by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["pan zhou", "yingxue zhou", "dapeng wu", "hai jin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.00181"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.00181.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Differentially Private Online Learning for Video Recommendation with Social Big Data over Media Cloud", "authors": [], "emails": ["hustzhouyx@gmail.com,", "panzhou@hust.edu.cn", "wu@ece.ufl.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to survive themselves, and they will be able to survive themselves, \"he said in an interview with The New York Times."}, {"heading": "II.

Content-based filtering (CB) recommendation systems [20] - [22] focus on the similarities of content titles, tags and descriptions and find user-oriented elements based on the individual reading history of the user. CB recommendation systems are easy to implement. Nevertheless, it is not enough to represent the user's profile information with a bag of words to capture the exact interests of the user. Collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation systems [23], [24] rely on abundant transaction histories and content. CF systems require sufficient records and feedback on consumption, which is not suitable for real-time recommendation. Graph-based (GB) recommendation systems [25] form a graph to calculate the correlation between recommendation objects and content. Then, the recommendation problem turns into a node problem guaranteed to be based on a social network and behavior."}, {"heading": "B. Privacy Preservation", "text": "When it comes to the privacy of social media users, anonymity has been the main tool in social networks [11], [12] and recommendations [13], [14]. However, especially with rich, high-dimensional big data, most referral techniques seem to paralyze the usefulness of the data [28], [29]. Moreover, anonymity cannot guarantee privacy when opponents collude or those with additional information [31]. On the other hand, previous work has focused on cryptography [30], but it often requires high computing and communication costs. Moreover, none of them can guarantee the extent to which privacy is respected. Differential privacy [15], which has been proposed in recent years, has been included in the recommendation by several studies. McSherry and Mironov [17] show how to adapt the leading algorithms used in the Netflix price competition."}, {"heading": "C. Online Learning", "text": "Our proposed method of distributed learning is derived from context-dependent bandits [32]. This algorithm learns the contextual information available at all times, which in this case is the social profiles of the user. Subsequently, an index is kept that weights the estimated performance and uncertainty of each action (in this case video) and selects the action with the highest index in each case. In addition, the indices for the next period of time for all actions are updated based on the feedback generated by the chosen action. There are some papers that deal with the context-dependent bandit [32], [33] in which the best action (video) is learned online in view of the context. Furthermore, the studies in context-dependent bandits postulate the learning of a single learner (service provider) over time who has difficulties in dealing with enormous multiple distributed data sources. C. Tekin et al. initially proposed a distributed context-dependent bandit framework to expand the framework for this 35 [large data classification]."}, {"heading": "III.

There are M distributed service providers distributed in the Media Cloud, indexed by set M = {1, 2, 3..., M}. They operate independently and cooperatively in a discrete time setting t = 1, 2,..., T. Each provider owns a series of videos. We refer to the set of videos Mi = {k1, k2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, kK} for service providers i. For each time slot, the following events occur sequentially for service providers i: 1) a social media user with his unique extracted contextual information xi (t) comes to service providers i (2), the service provider i selects one of his videos in the repository Wed to recommend that user, or sends the contextual information to another service provider and requests other service providers j for help; 3) At the end of each time slot, the user has click feedback."}, {"heading": "B. Solution Concept", "text": "Definition 1 (Optimal Arm). Our benchmark for evaluating the performance of the learning algorithm is the optimal solution that selects the arm k with the highest accuracy for the learner. (2) The optimal solution means that the learner knows the arm in Ki that delivers the highest expected accuracy for each x-level. Choosing the best arm for each context x requires evaluating the accuracy for each context and is computationally intractable because the context space X has an infinite number of d-dimensional dots. We will use the adaptive partition method (detailed in Section IV) to handle this problem. definition 2 (The Regret of Learning)."}, {"heading": "IV. DIFFERENTIAL PRIVATE DISTRIBUTED LEARNING WITH ADAPTIVE CONTEXT SPACE PARTITION FOR SOCIAL BIG DATA COMPUTING", "text": "Since the recommendation accuracy of each recommended video has unknown stochastic distributions for different users, the natural way to learn the performance of a video is to record and update its average reward (recommendation accuracy) for the same context. Using such an empirical value to evaluate the expected reward is the basic approach to help service providers learn. To address the problem of social big data, it is almost impossible to record and update the average reward of different videos for the same context. Context space X can be extremely large and the dimension is prohibitively high. The storage capacity of the server cannot meet the need to maintain an average reward for all contexts. To overcome this difficulty, we dynamically divide the entire context space into several smaller contexts (according to the number of incoming users) and then maintain and update the average sample reward estimates for each subspace."}, {"heading": "A. Algorithm Description", "text": "In this area, we are able to capture our own context. (P-DAP) In this context, we are able to capture the entire context of the entire context.

(P-DAP) In this context, the number of segments of the individual dimensions is partitioned, and l is the partitioning inequality of the context when we specify the context of the context.

Algorithm Analysis", "text": "The characteristics of the proposed algorithm are analyzed in this subsection. To simplify the representation, we replace service providers with learners. We prove that regret has converged over time and our P-DAP guarantees a differential gap. We define the optimal arm for subspace C as k = argmaxk, C = supx, Ki uk, x and uk, C = infx, for learners i in subspace C can be written as follows: Ss, l, B = {k: uk, C > Bm \u2212 \u03b1l}, (7) where B is a constant and \u03b1 > 0. We are bound to B to obtain the optimal solution."}, {"heading": "V. GEOMETRIC DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY", "text": "In the previous section, we maintain privacy in the same way for all subspaces. That is, we set the same evaluation of privacy for the entire context space. In this section, we present our sophisticated geometric, differentiated private model. In view of the sparseness and heterogeneity of big data, some context subspaces can be scattered with innumerable data points, but other subspaces are almost empty. There is no need to guarantee the same private level for each subspace \u2212 \u2212 In addition, a large and increasing number of statistical analyses can be carried out in differentiated ways while little noise is added. We can reduce the private level by increasing the density of the data sets (l denotes the density of the subspaces). In this way, the loss of performance due to the randomness caused by the differentiated privacy can be greatly reduced. For current active subspaces, we set different values of density. Figure 5 illustrates this method."}, {"heading": "VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS", "text": "In this section, we show the theoretical limits of regret for our algorithms based on empirical results based on very large real-world datasets, including massive multimedia data and big data generated by social media users. We show that: 1) Limits of regret converge sublinearly over time; 2) Our differentiated private methods work well and do not come at the expense of recommendation accuracy; 3) The geometric differential privacy method has a lower limit of regret and higher accuracy. Finally, we use user context vectors refined from real datasets to test the recommendation accuracy of our algorithms."}, {"heading": "A. Experimental Setup", "text": "We collect numerous context vectors extracted from large real data sets in Sina Microblog, a popular online social networking site in China. These data sets contain the social profiles and multimedia content of the users who shared them. We also compare public information from Youku, a widely used video sharing site (VSS) in China, such as video attributes, popular videos. After preprocessing, approximately 74,000 video elements, 578,000 user context vectors are stored with 13900-dimensional content. For simplicity, we use the recommendation system on a small frame with four distributed video service vendors. Using collected video data, we construct a series of 1,000 videos for each service vendor, following the real situation, we make various video elements available to different service providers. We stitched 200,000 users (context vectors) from our stored data sets, which we incorporate into our simulation system."}, {"heading": "B. Results and Analysis", "text": "In the meantime, we compare DAP, CAP and UAP and plot the regret lines in Fig. 6.Fig. 6 (a) shows the comparison with DAP, CAP and DUP in terms of regret, where the horizontal axis of regret is the number of user arrivals. From the tendency of the \"regret\" lines we can conclude that the regret of DAP has converged sublinearly over time. And obviously, DAP has lower privacy losses than DUP and CAP all the time. Fig. 6 (b) records the average accuracy of arrivals (normalized by number of arrivals) of DAP, CAP and DUP, where the horizontal axis is the number of user arrivals. As we can see, our primary model DAP converges quickly and has a lower average accuracy then CAP and DUP. Also the results show the average regret of DAP in the back lines is extremely small."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "To accommodate the great value and heterogeneity of big data, we use dynamic spatial allocations for distributed contextual bandits. To protect the privacy of social network users and video service providers, we simultaneously use exponential mechanisms and laplace mechanisms. In addition, we refine our framework to a new geometric, differentiated private model. We have theoretically analyzed our algorithms in terms of loss of performance (repentance) and privacy preservation. We have also evaluated our algorithms and demonstrated their sublinear convergent repentance, their delicate compromise between loss of performance and privacy protection, and their comprehensive reduction."}], "references": [{"title": "Social media recommendation", "author": ["Z.

In addition, none of them has considered both the privacy of users\u2019 contexts (e,g,. social status, ages and hobbies) and video service vendors\u2019 repositories, which are extremely sensitive and of significant commercial value. To handle the problems, we propose a cloud-assisted differentially private video recommendation system based on distributed online learning. In our framework, service vendors are modeled as distributed cooperative learners, recommending videos according to user\u2019s context, while simultaneously adapting the video-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks (reward). Considering the sparsity and heterogeneity of big social media data, we also propose a novel geometric differentially private model, which can greatly reduce the performance (recommendation accuracy) loss. Our simulation shows the proposed algorithms outperform other existing methods and keep a delicate balance between computing accuracy and privacy preserving level.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
