At the same moment, most software packages for blogs, content management systems (CMS), and shop applications support the consumption of feed formats, namely RSS and Atom. In this technical report, we demonstrate an on-line tool that fetches e-commerce data from a SPARQL endpoint and syndicates obtained results as RSS or Atom feeds. Our approach combines (1) the popularity and broad tooling support of existing feed formats, (2) the precision of queries against structured data built upon common Web vocabularies like schema.org, GoodRelations, FOAF, VCard, and WGS 84, and (3) the ease of integrating content from a large number of Web sites and other data sources in RDF in general.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Sep 2015 09:25:07 GMT  (282kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00190v1", "Technical report, 5 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical report, 5 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["alex stolz", "martin hepp"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.00190"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.00190.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Alex Stolz", "Martin Hepp"], "emails": ["alex.stolz@unibw.de", "martin.hepp@unibw.de"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In e-commerce, major retail portals such as sears.com, bestbuy.com, wayfair.com, rakuten.de and numerous smaller stores have added RDFA and Microdata markups to their site templates, revealing more than 30 million daily updated offers. A number of SPARQL endpoints already collect this structured e-commerce data. However, retrieving useful information usually involves contacting the right endpoints, creating proper SPARQL queries, and finally converting results into data formats understood by target applications. Average web developers and website owners are quickly overwhelmed by the technical challenges of these tasks. At the same time, there are popular data formats for publishing dynamic content on the web, namely RSS [4] and the Atom Syndication Format [3,5]. Both feed formats have excellent tool support; i.e. most blogs, content management system software packages (CMS, external CDF, data structures) support."}, {"heading": "2 GR2RSS Tool", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "3 Demonstration", "text": "The following is an example of how to integrate a generated feed into a web page. Suppose we are looking for products within a $100 to $500 price range that contain the keyword \"camcorder\" and include product images. Fig. 2 shows the filled form fields of the Query Builder. The image also shows a single camcorder article after the feed has been integrated into a web page. Similar examples can be found in the tooldocumentation8 and 6 http: / / georss.org / 7 http: / / purl.org / xro / example page9."}, {"heading": "4 Related Work", "text": "We compared our work with existing approaches, namely (1) dialogs to define individual feeds as offered by major websites (e.g. eBay and Amazon) and (2) feed aggregation services, i.e. Yahoo Pipes 10 and DERI Pipes [2]. The former approaches typically fail to integrate different data sources (e.g. list five cheapest offers between Amazon and eBay feeds), whereas aggregation services are limited to filtering results using brittle regex-based expressions (e.g. show only shops in New York) and lack simple conversion of units (e.g. display all prices in euros) (see [7])."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "The presented online service aims to address the problem of integrating Linked Open Data (LOD) content into web pages. To this end, it generates RSS and Atom feeds from structured e-commerce data retrieved from a SPARQL endpoint, leveraging excellent support for content syndication formats. The service enables different levels of query building assistance, implements caching, incorporates geolocation data and RDFa annotations, and uses currency conversion at the endpoint. We consider our approach to be similarly useful for other areas of Linked Open Data outside the narrow scope of e-commerce."}], "references": [{"title": "GoodRelations: An Ontology for Describing Products and Services Offers on the Web", "author": ["M.
