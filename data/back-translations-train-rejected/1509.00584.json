Intuitively, the function EQ (N) is the maximum number of machines that can be run together on the Universal Orchestrated Machine and vice versa, IQ (Z) is the maximum number of steps that can be taken by the machines. At the heart of the concept of orchestrated machines is the test of the ability to cooperate with each other. The Turing Test also serves a similar goal in the sense that it is designed to test the ability of a computer program to communicate with a human, and it may therefore be appropriate to think about the Turing Test from the point of view of the orchestrated machines."}], "references": [{"title": "Can Winograd Schemas Replace Turing Test for Defining Human-Level AI", "author": ["Evan Ackerman"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Are there intelligent turing machines", "author": ["N.
