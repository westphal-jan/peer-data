We have also described the mathematical model and algorithm details related to implementing these cluster algorithms in order to discover the user session clusters. From the results presented in the previous section, we conclude the following points. K-mean clustering produces a fairly higher accuracy and lower cluster errors compared to the cluster algorithms. K-mean algorithm can lead to the formation of an empty cluster, whereas it is not the case with k-medoids algorithm. Our result shows that k-medoids algorithm provides a relatively better time performance than that of the kmeans algorithm.
