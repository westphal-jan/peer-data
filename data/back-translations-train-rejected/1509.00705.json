Enron was an American energy conglomerate based in Houston, Texas. In the 1990s, it was considered one of the most powerful and successful companies in the world. However, Lay remained the boss of Enron throughout its existence. From the late 1990s, Enron managers such as Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow were allowed to launch a campaign to conceal business losses from shareholders and the general public. Enron was subsequently granted - government deregulation. As a result of this declaration of deregulation, Enron managers were allowed to maintain agency over the earnings reports that were released to investors and employees.2.1 Doubtful practices Enron and other utilities earned profits by providing services such as wholesale and risk management, as well as the maintenance of power plants, natural gas pipelines, storage and processing facilities."}, {"heading": "3 Previous work", "text": "Some of the well-known research on this corpus were: research on the dynamics of the structure and properties of organizational communication networks as a function of time (Diesner et al 2005); the recognition of community structures based on link mining (Qian et al 2006); linguistic perspective work on formal communication as a factor of social distance, relative power and weight of imposition (Peterson et al 2011); recall, which improves methods of identifying designated entities with Enron email as a case study (Minkov et al 2005); and the study of the use of the word \"virtual\" in the Enron corpus to establish polysemic use in contemporary contexts (Greg et al 2009)."}, {"heading": "4 Research Motivations", "text": "The primary motivation for this research was to investigate and uncover patterns of fraudulent communication by using existing research results to detect deceptions and to create author profiles. Enron Email Corpus was introduced because it represented real communication on a large scale in the real world, where the emails of employees were available to the public for research without concerns about privacy and also the simplicity of identifying fraudulent employees using the available legal records and comprehensive examination of their communication patterns. However, this data set proved unsuitable for research (fully treated in Section 5), which adopted the primary objectives of the research and stated as follows (S1 real employees and S2 fraudulent employees): - (TASK 1 / 3) Analyze the communication patterns of S1 with S2 (closed or open, transpar or opaque, formal or incidental, in order to infer the degree of trust they had in S2 and S2) and their level of transparency (as compared to S2 and S2)."}, {"heading": "5 Datasets-The problems and splits", "text": "In recent years, the number of those who are able to reform has multiplied.

Consequently, the following strategy was followed: -A flag list of words for possible signs of fraud was created, including words such as: \"Bribery, bribery, corrupt, corrupt, fraudulent emails, kick-back, graft, gift, law, auditing, incentive, Eidi, Chewc o, hedge fund...\" The flag list totaled 40 words. Emails in the inboxes of these four people that take into account the non-junk, non-forwarded criteria were taken, and every word in the message is compared with the words in the flag list."}, {"heading": "8 Task 3/3 Communication network analysis", "text": "For the analysis of the network as a function of time, I made a binary separation of \"Incline\" period and \"Decline\" period. The date July 1, 2001 was chosen as the exit date because Enron rose to the pinnacle and was crowned as the \"Most Innovative Company\" until 2001. Although Jan 2001 to June 2001 was an uncomfortable time for Enron, during which some senior executives resigned and stock prices fell by a few percentage points, it was during July-September 2001 that Enron began to end, in August 2001, Jeff resigned from Enron, news agencies began to uncover the fraud and stock prices nosedived. Therefore, the split was a binary split and was aptly called \"Incline\" by Enron and \"Decline\" by Enron."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions", "text": "Today, we know that the real employees were serious about communicating, maintaining and respecting strict hierarchical order, and never complaining about corporate policy from senior executives. We also see that the fraudulent employees never communicated their plans via the company's e-mail for fear of being exposed. Although the conclusion cannot be generalized without proper records and methods, maintaining a bulwark against subordinates, executing treason without a shadow of a doubt, and collusion without a trace really make them the \"smartest guys in the room\" (Film, 2005)."}, {"heading": "10 References", "text": "Wikipedia References-Enron-Enron Scandalswww.nytimes.com / Enron timelineType Token Ratio What They Really Tell Us?
