Traditionally, temporal expressions such as some date and time expressions have been considered as designated entities and included within the scope of designated entity recognition systems (NER). For example, the Measure Understanding Conference (MUC) uses series of temporary expressions (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996) that have been conducted over several years to promote research in information extraction, some date and time expressions have been considered within the scope of the NIS task, and related guidelines recommend these expressions to be annotated with the TIMEX tag."}, {"heading": "2.
