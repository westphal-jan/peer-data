It fulfils this task in a multi-stage process. The algorithm consists of the following stages: (i) horizontal projection profile of the text into different lines of text, (ii) distribution of the blob heights and its center, (iii) classification by typographic characteristics, (iv) mapping by script type, (v) creation of an equivalent image pattern, (vi) extraction of the image pattern according to texture analysis, (vii) classification of extracted characteristics."}, {"heading": "2.2 Typographical Features", "text": "The first stage of the proposed algorithm is the extraction of typographic features from the text image. It comprises three steps mentioned above, which are specified as horizontal projection profiles of the text, around different lines of text, the distribution of the blob height and its center and its classification by typographic characteristics. Therefore, the algorithm starts with the horizontal projection profiles, which define the position of the text line. Then, the blob extraction is classified according to the previous text height segmentation. Fig. 1 shows the initial text as well as its blob (letter) segmentation by the Bounding Box extraction method. Then, each Bounding field is used to extract its height and the center of the line. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of character heights given by the Bounding boxes."}, {"heading": "2.3 Mapping Script Types", "text": "The second stage of the algorithm is the mapping by font type and the generation of an equivalent image pattern. Thus, the resulting mapping of the letters on base, ascendant, descendant and full letter is mapped into the encoded text corresponding to the image texture. In this way, the following mapping is performed: base letter on 0, ascendant on 1, descendant on 2 and full letter on 3 [3]. According to the proposed mapping, the initial text is converted into encoded text specified in Fig. 5. The given encoded text can be painted into the image. Each line of text is continued on the next line to the end of the text. Furthermore, each of four different numbers corresponds to a different grayscale in the image. Accordingly, the image is displayed as a 1-D image with four grayscales. Fig. 6 illustrates the procedure of generating an image pattern from the encoded text."}, {"heading": "2.4 Feature Extraction of the Texture", "text": "The texture is a measure of the intensity variations of the image surface [7] and is therefore suitable for information extraction, with which one can quantify properties such as image smoothness, roughness and regularity. Accordingly, the texture can be used to calculate statistical measurements of the image."}, {"heading": "2.4.1 Run-length Statistics", "text": "It is used to extract the texture characteristics and to quantify the total intensity of the runs. A run represents a series of consecutive pixels marked with the same grayscale intensity in a particular direction of the texture. Therefore, the emphasis of fine textures is placed on the long runs, while rough textures contain short runs. Suppose we have an image with X-rows, Y-columns and L-planes of gray intensity. First, the maximum number of gray layers p (i, j) is extracted by specifying the direction and then counting the occurrence of runs for each gray level and length in that direction. Its number of rows corresponds to M, i.e. the maximum number of gray layers corresponds to N, i.e. the maximum frequency corresponds to the running length. In our case, each element of the length matrix p (i, j) is the gray plane of the pirix."}, {"heading": "2.4.2 Adjacent Local Binary Pattern", "text": "Local Binary Patterns (LBP) represent the texture operator. It determines a size relationship between a central pixel and its adjacent pixels in a window of interest [11]. In fact, it measures local image contrast fluctuations. LBP is calculated by comparing the intensity of the surrounding pixels with the intensity of the central pixel. Fig. 8 illustrates such a circumstance. In this way, the pixels in the block are threaded by their central pixel value. If the intensities of adjacent pixels are higher than those of the central pixel, the corresponding pixel is assigned as 1, otherwise it is assigned as 0. \u2212 Then they are multiplied by different powers of two depending on the pixel position. At the end, they are merged to obtain a central pixel name. Typically, the neighborhood of the central pixel is eight pixels."}, {"heading": "2.5 Feature Classification", "text": "In this context, it should be mentioned that this is not a purely theoretical consideration, but a purely theoretical consideration."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "The proposed method is based on two tailor-made databases of short documents (labels) in Cyrillic, square and round Glagolitic script. Each of the documents has less than 100 characters. The first database consists of 15 labels, with 5 labels written in Cyrillic script, 5 labels in square Glagolitic script and 5 labels in round Glagolitic script. Then, the first database is expanded to create a second database of 20 labels. Specifically, a new set of 5 labels in square Glagolitic script is added to the original set. The 5 labels added to the square Glagolitic script were established in the early historical period when the round Glagolitic script was in the process of conversion to square Glagolitic script."}, {"heading": "4 Results and Discussion", "text": "This year, it has come to the point where there is only one person who is able to take care of another person who is able to take care of another person."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "The work proposed a new method of marking the font using the example of ancient medieval inscriptions written in South Slavic scripts: ancient Cyrillic, angular and round glagolitics. The algorithm combines statistical analysis of the running length and subsequent analysis of the local binary patterns of the encoded text obtained by mapping the original text document (markup character). It shows a significant distinction between the three different font types. Therefore, an extension of a modern classification method for strong classification of the fonts and identification of the obtained statistical characteristics is applied. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a tailor-made database and extended to a more complex inscription set consisting of inscriptions in ancient Cyrillic, angular and round glagolitic scriptions. The experiments yielded very positive results. Future work will extend the experiment to larger sets of inscriptions."}], "references": [{"title": "Text extraction from natural scene image: A survey", "author": ["H. Zhang", "K.
