We consider single/parallel machine E-T problems that may or may not consider some additional features such as idle time, setup times and release dates. In addition, we also consider those problems whose objective is to minimize either the total (average) weighted completion time or the total (average) weighted flow time, which arise as particular cases when the due dates of all jobs are either set to zero or to their associated release dates, respectively. The developed local search based metaheuristic framework is quite simple, but at the same time relies on sophisticated procedures for efficiently performing local search according to the characteristics of the problem. We present efficient move evaluation approaches for some parallel machine problems that generalize the existing ones for single machine problems. The algorithm was tested in hundreds of instances of several E-T problems and particular cases. The results obtained show that our unified heuristic is capable of producing high quality solutions when compared to the best ones available in the literature that were obtained by specific methods. Moreover, we provide an extensive annotated bibliography on the problems related to those considered in this work, where we not only indicate the approach(es) used in each publication, but we also point out the characteristics of the problem(s) considered. Beyond that, we classify the existing methods in different categories so as to have a better idea of the popularity of each type of solution procedure.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Sep 2015 14:26:31 GMT  (235kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02384v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 16:43:51 GMT  (162kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02384v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 17:12:00 GMT  (165kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02384v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["arthur kramer", "anand subramanian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.02384"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.02384.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["arthurhfrk@gmail.com,", "anand@ci.ufpb.br"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In the literature of the last 50 years, much attention has been paid by many scientists and practitioners around the world in this way to the problems of complex real life that are raised by different types of companies, but also by the challenge of solving them, an enormous number of planning variants and solutions have been proposed during this period of half a century. Therefore, it is safe to say that scheduling is one of the most important topics in the fields of Operations Research and Management Science.A particular branch of planning theory articulates itself in the context of JIT (Just-In-Time) manufacturing systems. Problems of this branch of planning are commonly referred to as erdliness-tardiness (E-T), where penalties are taken when a job is completed before or after its due date."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "This work proposes a unified heuristic algorithm for a large class of earliness-tardiness (E-T)<lb>scheduling problems.
