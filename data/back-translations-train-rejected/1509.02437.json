Introduction", "text": "These traditional methods are often extremely time-consuming and expensive, and they do not always deliver the desired results that companies have been looking for due to environmental factors and poorly designed survey tools. In this work, the results of sentiment analysis are performed to obtain the public perception of the company \"Apple.\" The Twitter Streaming API was used to receive tweets in real-time as text about the company for sentiment prediction. Real-time collection of tweets in three phases, i.e. after the first announcement of the product, during the product launch and after the product launch; helped in analyzing the mood toward compression. Decision trees such as Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random Forests were used to classify tweets as positive or negative feelings. They also provided visual insights into which words as characteristics most prominently affect the perception of the company. This would help the company identify the services and products that are used to classify these Sentifying methods (from Sentification and Sentification)."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "Due to the widespread presence of the Internet and the growth of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, online analysis of social networks has become a hot topic of research. Twitter has an easy-to-use API that provides text data for a variety of purposes. In a paper [1], authors Alexander Pak et al. focus on Twitter for the task of sentiment analysis, performing linguistic analyses of the collected corpus and explaining the phenomena discovered. They build a classification based on the multinomic classifier Na\u00efve Bayes, who uses N-gram and POS tags as traits. Share predictions using Twitter corpora are an important area of research and indicate the direction of work. In the study [2], authors use Vu, Tien-Thanh et al., usage characteristics of Twitter messages to capture the public sentiment associated with four tech companies for predicting the daily ups and downs of these companies."}, {"heading": "3. Proposed Work", "text": "It is the way in which the data (based on the terms they contain) is bundled into a cluster. Unsupervised learning processes are mostly used in conjunction with the extraction stage of the data. After performing K-middle clustering, tweets are led to clusters of tweets from data points, so that similar tweets (based on the words they contain) are bundled into a cluster. Data is divided into training and test sets, each containing 70% and 30% of the data. Afterwards, the proposed learning model is applied to each of the training data individually. There are various verified learning methods for building the model, but the author (s) has determined that the Random Forests algorithm is suitable for the problem because it provides the trade-off between accuracy, clarity and interpretation."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusions", "text": "This paper introduces a hybrid mechanism - the \"Cluster Thenpredict Model\" to improve the accuracy of predicting Twitter feelings. The ability to combine both unsupervised learning and supervised learning in the form of K-mean clusters or random forests is better than various supervised learning algorithms such as CART, SVM, logistical regression, etc. The architecture of this model is scalable so that it can accommodate large amounts of Twitter text data. This hybrid model will function even better when the raw data is very large and varied. In future work, authors will try to include emotions from emoticons, to make the classification multi-level, i.e. to show strongly negative, neutral, positive or strongly positive emotions.563"}], "references": [{"title": "Twitter as a Corpus for Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining.", "author": ["Pak", "Alexander", "Patrick Paroubek"], "venue": "LREC.
