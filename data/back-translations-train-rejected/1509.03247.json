CONCLUSION", "text": "In this thesis, we propose a novel regressor -HFTSVR by minimizing structural risks. -FTSVR provides the motivation for the development of the regressor based on -FTSVR, which is achieved by applying trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to -TSVR. -FTSVR addresses uncertainties arising from prediction problems. It determines a pair of -insensitive proximal functions by solving two interrelated SVM problems. It solves the problem by introducing the regularization term into primary problems of -FTSVR and addressing the dual alternative. This improved general regression performance. Subsequently, -HFTSVR is formulated as hierarchical layers, each containing - FTSVR. Experimental results on synthetic and real data sets show that -HFTSVR is superior to the Otherregressor. However, the appropriate parameter selection of - HFTSVR remains a practical problem for future research."}], "references": [{"title": "A Tutorial on Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition", "author": ["C.
