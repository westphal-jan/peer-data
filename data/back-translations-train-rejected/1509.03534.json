Introduction", "text": "This year it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "2.2 Recording dependencies", "text": "Dependencies are an essential part of machine learning for theorems, as they provide the examples on which predictors can be trained. We focus on recording dependencies between named theorems because they are directly accessible to a user. The time sign of our method slows down the application of all rules by a negligible amount. Since the statements of 951 HOL4 theorems are conjunctions, which sometimes consist of many top-level subjunctions, we have refined our method to record dependencies between top-level conjunctions. Example 4: (Dependencies between conjunctions) ADD CLAUSES: 0 + m = m-SUC m + n = SUC (m + n)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Implementation of the recording", "text": "This year it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "3. Evaluation", "text": "In this section we describe the settings used in the experiments: the ATPs, the transformation of HOL to the formats of the ATPs, the dependencies available in the various experiments, and the features used for machine learning."}, {"heading": "3.1 ATPs and problem transformation", "text": "HOL (y) Hammer supports translation into the formats of various TPTP ATPs: FOF, TFF1, THF0, and two experimental TPTP extensions. In this paper, we limit ourselves to the first-order monomorphic logic, as these ATPs have been the most powerful to date, and their integration into HOL4 already poses an interesting challenge. The transformation HOL (y) Hammer uses is strongly influenced by earlier work by Paulson [21] and Harrison [9]. It is described in detail in [15], here we only recall the crucial points. Abstractions are removed by \u03b2-reduction, followed by the removal of predicates as arguments by the introduction of existentially quantified variables, and the applied radio gate is used to reduce all applications to the first order. By default, HOL (y) Hammer uses the marked polymorphic encodings [3]: a special tag that requires two arguments, and for all variable instances we use, the first argument that ATP is the first."}, {"heading": "3.2 Accessible facts", "text": "Since HOL (y) Hammer was originally designed for HOL Light, it treats accessible facts in the same way as the accessibility relationship defined there: any fact that is present in a theory that is loaded chronologically before the current one is available. In HOL4, there are explicit theory dependencies, and as such, another accessibility relationship is more natural. The facts that are present in the same theory before the current one, and all the facts in the theories on which the current one depends (possibly in a transitive way), are accessible. In this subsection, we discuss the four different accessible sets of lemmata that we will use to test the performance of HOL (y) Hammer. Exact dependencies (recalling) They are the closest ancestors of a theorem in the evidence tree. It is tested how much HOL (y) Hammer could reject if it had perfect predictions. In these settings, no relevance theory is filtered because the number of dependencies is small."}, {"heading": "3.3 Features", "text": "In grand theory, automated reasoning features must be assigned to each theorem, based on the syntactic and semantic properties of the statement of the theorem and its attributes. HOL (y) Hammer represents features by strings and characterizes theorems by string lists. Characteristics arise from the names of type constructors, type variables, names of constants, and printed terms that come to the conclusion. An important thought is the normalization of characteristics: for sub-terms, their variables and type variables must be normalized. For this, various scenarios can be considered: \u2022 All variables are replaced by a common variable. \u2022 Variables are replaced by their de Bruijn index numbers [30]. Variables are replaced by their (variable-normalized) types."}, {"heading": "3.4 Predictors", "text": "In all our experiments, we have used the modified k-NN algorithm [13], which provides the most accurate results in the HOL (y) Hammer experiments for HOL Light [15]. At a fixed number (k), the k-next learning algorithm finds k-premises that come closest to the conjecture, and uses their weighted dependencies to find the predicted relevance of all available facts. All facts and conjectures are interpreted as vectors in the n-dimensional attribute space, where n is the number of all characteristics, and the distance between a fact and the conjecture is calculated on the basis of Euclidean distance. To efficiently find the neighbors of the conjecture, we store an association list listing characteristics that have these characteristics, making it possible to skip the theorems that have no characteristics in common with the conjecture."}, {"heading": "4. Experiments", "text": "In this section, we present the results of several experiments and discuss the quality of the consulting system based on these results. The hardware used in the experiments for improvement and accessibility is a 48-core server (AMD Opteron 6174 2.2 GHz. CPUs, 320 GB RAM and 0.5 MB L2 cache per CPU).In these experiments, each ATP for each problem is executed on a single core with a time limit of 30 seconds. The reconstruction and interactive experiments were carried out on a laptop with an Intel core processor (i5-330M 4 x 2.60 GHz with 3.6 GB RAM)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Reproving", "text": "In this case, the number of subjects is lower than the number of subjects who are able to follow their respective strategies."}, {"heading": "4.2 With different accessible sets", "text": "In Table 5, we compare the quality of predictions in different evidence environments. We remember that only the transitive dependencies, loaded theories, and linear order settings use predictions, and that the number of these predictions is adapted to the ability of each subject. The exact dependency settings (auditors) are copied from Table 3 for easier comparisons. We first note the lower success rate in the transitive dependency setting. There may be two justifications. First, the transitive dependencies provide a poor training set for the predictors; the set of samples is quite small and the available lemmats all relate to the conjecture."}, {"heading": "4.3 Reconstruction", "text": "The examiners we use in the experiments can return the unsatisfactory core: a small set of premises used during the proof. HOL representation of these facts can be given to Metis to refute the theorem with the solidity guaranteed by its construction. We are investigating the reconstruction of evidence found by Vampire in the loaded theory experiments (which are used in our interactive version of HOL (y) Hammer). We found that Metis with a second time limit could refute 95.6% of these theorems. This result is encouraging for two reasons: first, we have not shown the solidity of our transformations, and this shows that the premises found do indeed lead to a valid proof in HOL. Second, the high reconstruction rate suggests that the system can be useful in practice."}, {"heading": "4.4 Case study", "text": "Finally, we present two sets of lemmas found by E-prover advise on the loaded multiple libraries. We discuss the difference with the lemmas used in the original proof.The theorem EULER FORMULE states that any complex number can be presented as a combination of its norm and argument. In the human-written proof script ten theorems are provided to a circumscription tactic. The user is mostly hindered by the fact that they would not terminate the commutativity of multiplication as the tactic. Free from these limitations, the guessing system returns only three lemmas: the commutativity of multiplication, the polar representation COMPLEX TRIANGLE, and the Euler formula EXP IMAGINARARY.Example 10. (In theory complex) Original proof: val EULER _ FORMUAL _ RUM (\"LEUER _ MORM _ THL\")."}, {"heading": "4.5 Interactive version", "text": "In our previous experiments, all the different steps (export, learning / prediction, translation, ATPs) were performed separately, and simultaneously for all theorems. Here, we compose all these steps to produce a HOL4 step that, in the face of conjecture, proves that it is usable in any HOL4 development in an interactive consulting loop. It proceeds as follows: The conjecture is exported along with the currently loaded theories, properties for the theorems and the conjecture are calculated, and dependencies are used for learning and selecting the theorems that are relevant to the conjecture. HOL (y) Hammer translates the problem into the formats of the ATPs and uses them to prove the resulting problems."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we present a customization of the HOL (y) Hammer system for HOL4 that enables universal, learning-assisted automated thinking. As HOL (y) Hammer uses machine learning for relevance filtering, we need to calculate dependencies, define the access relationship for theorems, and adapt the feature extraction mechanism to HOL4. Furthermore, since we export all data for detection of wizards (types, constants, named theorems) into a common format, we define the namespaces that cover both HOLLight and HOL4. We evaluated the resulting system at the top level of the HOL4 standard library: for about 50% of them, a sufficient number of dependencies can be found automatically. We compare success rates depending on the accessibility relationship and the handling of theorems whose statements are conjunctions. We provide a HOL4 command that delivers the current target, the premises and the evidence of which is available under the HOL, the premises and the evidence of which is used to execute a statement."}, {"heading": "5.1 Future Work", "text": "The libraries of HOL Light and HOL4 are currently being processed completely independently of each other. However, we have made sure that all data is exported in the same format so that the same concepts and theorems about them can be detected automatically [7]. By combining the data, one could get goals in one system that are solved with the help of theorems from the other, which can then be converted into lemmas in the new system. A first challenge might be to define a combined accessibility relationship in order to evaluate such a combined correction assistant library [2]. The format we use for the exchange of HOL4 and HOL Light data is strongly influenced by the TPTP formats for higher order monomorphic logic [27] and first order polymorphic logic [2]. However, it is slightly different from the one used by Sledgehammers to ensure the completeness of the data."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Josef Urban and Michael Fa \ufffd rber for their comments on the previous version of this paper, which was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): P26201."}], "references": [{"title": "CVC4", "author": ["C.

In this paper, we present an add-on to the HOL4 proof assistant and an adaptation of the HOL(y)Hammer system that provides machine learning-based premise selection and automated reasoning also for HOL4. We efficiently record the HOL4 dependencies and extract features from the theorem statements, which form a basis for premise selection. HOL(y)Hammer transforms the HOL4 statements in the various TPTP-ATP proof formats, which are then processed by the ATPs. We discuss the different evaluation settings: ATPs, accessible lemmas, and premise numbers. We measure the performance of HOL(y)Hammer on the HOL4 standard library. The results are combined accordingly and compared with the HOL Light experiments, showing a comparably high quality of predictions. The system directly benefits HOL4 users by automatically finding proofs dependencies that can be reconstructed by Metis.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
