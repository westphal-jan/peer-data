Those semantics partition the powerset of the set of arguments into two classes: extensions and non-extensions. In order to reason with a specific semantics, one needs to take a credulous or skeptical approach, i.e. an argument is eventually accepted, if it is accepted in one or all extensions, respectively. In our previous work \\cite{ref-pu2015counting}, we have proposed a novel semantics, called \\emph{counting semantics}, which allows for a more fine-grained assessment to arguments by counting the number of their respective attackers and defenders based on argument graph and argument game. In this paper, we continue our previous work by presenting some supplementaries about how to choose the damaging factor for the counting semantics, and what relationships with some existing approaches, such as Dung's classical semantics, generic gradual valuations.

In order to get a finer-grained view of the status of arguments, we have proposed a new semantics called a generalized classical semantics [1], called counting semantics. In this section, we provide the basic concepts of counting semantics and add some examples to represent the calculation of counting semantics. The basic intuition used to formalize the degree of acceptance is essentially the same as the arguments found in abstract reasoning theory: argument x is more acceptable than argument y iff x has a better defense (for) and a lower attack (against)."}, {"heading": "IV.

It not only provides a more differentiated treatment of the different length of attackers and defenders, but also controls the convergence speed of the calculations. How to select the damping factor \u03b1 in practical application is therefore an important question for counter semantics.

RELATING WITH GENERIC GRADUAL VALUATIONS", "text": "Generic Gradual Assessments is one of two proposals to introduce a gradual interaction-based assessment, namely a local approach and a global approach [11]. It is local because the arguments are assigned strength values solely on the basis of their direct attackers (so that defenders are also taken into account by the attackers). However, in the global approach, the value of an argument represents the totality of all attacks and all lines of defence of varying length for this argument. Overall, generic Gradual Assessments are a very versatile and meaningful framework for assigning names to arguments, with the names indicating a number of possible acceptance or truth values for each argument. In this section, we will make comparisons between our approach and these two approaches."}, {"heading": "A. Comparison with Global Valuation", "text": "At first glance, the global approach is similar to ours. It assigns a pair of tuples to each argument: the first tuples contains the lengths of the defense branches (even integers), the other contains the lengths of the attack branches (odd integers). This approach is called \"global\" because it calculates the value of the argument using the entire attack graph that affects the argument. However, there are three main differences between our approach and the tuples approach: First, we use vectors to store the number of attackers and defenders of different lengths. Second, we use a matrix approach to calculate the number of attackers and defenders, i.e., the computational power of the attack matrix. While the tuples approach proposes a propagation algorithm to calculate the tupled values; third, to determine which argument is more acceptable, in the tupled approach, we use a double comparison (first quantitative, then qualitative), while the classical argument suggests a propagation algorithm to calculate the values."}, {"heading": "B.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we continue our previous work on a novel semantic concept for abstract frameworks of argumentation: the counting of semantics. Instead of extensions, the counting semantics assigns strength values to the arguments by counting the number of attackers and defenders for arguments. We discuss how to select the damping factor for the counting semantics. We show several interesting relationships between the counting semantics and Dung's classical semantics using Boolean algebra. We relate the counting semantics to two suggestions of general gradual evaluations. Finally, we present an axiomatic analysis of the rank derived from our counting semantics. Count semantics generalizes Dung's extension-based semantics for abstract argumentation and allows a finer differentiation of the status of arguments. It is an objective evaluation model (based solely on the graphical structure of the argument framework)."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The research reported here was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under contract numbers NSFC61171121 and NSFC61572279."}], "references": [{"title": "Attacker and defender counting approach for abstract argumentation", "author": ["F.

a set of interacting arguments and a series of semantics for evaluating them. Those semantics partition the powerset of the set of arguments into two classes: extensions and nonextensions. In order to reason with a specific semantics, one needs to take a credulous or skeptical approach, i.e. an argument is eventually accepted, if it is accepted in one or all extensions, respectively. In our previous work [1], we have proposed a novel semantics, called counting semantics, which allows for a more fine-grained assessment to arguments by counting the number of their respective attackers and defenders based on argument graph and argument game. In this paper, we continue our previous work by presenting some supplementaries about how to choose the damaging factor for the counting semantics, and what relationships with some existing approaches, such as Dung\u2019s classical semantics, generic gradual valuations. Lastly, an axiomatic perspective on the ranking semantics induced by our counting semantics are presented.
