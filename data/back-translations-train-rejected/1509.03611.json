However, our corpus is parallel - this facilitates the use of additional information for the task of identifying the translation system; that is, the decision on the status of a translation of a piece of text can be based on both the English side and its French (or German) counterpart. In the next experiment, we use the bilingual Europarl data set by generating an extended feature set based on the frequencies of the English functional words (extracted from the English chunk) and frequencies of the French functional words 14 extracted from the corresponding French chunk. Overall, for a parallel English text, we come up to about 900 feature values. We use the same classifier as specified in Section 4.1 and rate it with ten-fold cross-references (Figure 3 shows the accuracy of the classification based on bilingual information)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "This work presents several parallel bilingual English-French and English-German corpora with precise direction of translation. To evaluate the quality of the corpus, we have replicated and expanded several previous results of the supervised identification of the translation system, and expanded the experiments to include additional sets of data, including an additional language pair and the use of bilingual information. The potential value of these records stimulates further corpus development and exploration activities. Our future plans include the expansion of the corpus to include additional language pairs (especially English-Hebrew). We also intend to advance the identification of the translation system by reducing the size of logical units (chunks) that are subject to classification, and finally a single sentence pair.It has been shown in a series of works (Kurokawa et al., 2009; Lembersky et al., 2013, 2011, bilingb; Twitto-Shmuel, 2015) that awareness of this translation work can be used in a more positive way."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Noam Ordan for much advice and encouragement.

The corpus is diverse, consisting of parliamentary proceedings, literary works, transcripts of TED talks and political commentary. It will be instrumental for research of translationese and its applications to (human and machine) translation; specifically, it can be used for the task of translationese identification, a research direction that enjoys a growing interest in recent years. To evaluate the quality of the corpus, we replicate and expand on previous results of supervised identification of translationese, and further extend the experiments to additional datasets, including an additional language pair, and exploiting bilingual information.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
