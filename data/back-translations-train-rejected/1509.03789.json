Principally, we have defined a novel and robust form features applying active basis model as form extractor in form pathway in the biological inspired model. An unbalanced synergetic neural net-work classifies shapes and structures of human objects along with tuning its attention parameter by quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) via initiation of Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations. These tools utilized and justified as strong tools for following biological system model in form pathway. But the final decision has done by combination of ultimate outcomes of both pathways via fuzzy inference which increases novality of proposed model. Combination of these two brain pathways is done by considering each feature sets in Gaussian membership functions with fuzzy product inference method. Two configurations have been proposed for form pathway: applying multi-prototype human action templates using two time synergetic neural network for obtaining uniform template regarding each actions, and second scenario that it uses abstracting human action in four key-frames. Experimental results showed promising accuracy performance on different datasets (KTH and Weizmann).", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 13 Sep 2015 00:34:18 GMT  (1322kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03789v1", "author's version, SWJ 2014"], ["v2", "Sun, 21 Feb 2016 00:04:24 GMT  (1323kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03789v2", "author's version, SWJ 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "author's version, SWJ 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["bardia yousefi", "chu kiong loo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.03789"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.03789.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Bio-Inspired Human Action Recognition using Hybrid Max-Product Neuro-Fuzzy Classifier and Quantum-Behaved PSO", "authors": ["Bardia Yousefi"], "emails": ["ckloo.um@um.edu.my"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it is so far that it will only take one year to move on to the next round."}, {"heading": "3.1 Form features using Active basis Model", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most people who are able to move in the world, to move into another world, in which they are able to understand the world, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they"}, {"heading": "3.2 Motion features.", "text": "A mask that reveals the visibility of the individual layers is the main difference between estimating the traditional and layer-by-layer optical flow.

These tools utilized and justified as strong tools for following biological system model in form pathway. But the final decision has done by combination of ultimate outcomes of both pathways via fuzzy inference which increases novality of proposed model. Combination of these two brain pathways is done by considering each feature sets in Gaussian membership functions with fuzzy product inference method. Two configurations have been proposed for form pathway: applying multi-prototype human action templates using two time synergetic neural network for obtaining uniform template regarding each actions, and second scenario that it uses abstracting human action in four key-frames.
