INTRODUCTION", "text": "Among the 22 planned languages, Kannada is one of the most important Dravidian languages of India, spoken predominantly in the state of Karnataka. The Karnataka Official Language Act 1963 recognizes Kannada as its official language. Kannada's native speakers are about 40 million, making it the 33rd most widely spoken language in the world. It uses forty-nine thousand phonemic letters, and the character set is almost identical to that of other Indian languages. Kannada is a highly agglutinating and inflexible language. It is a language with a rich heritage and great grammar. The processing of Kannada language and the extraction of named units is a challenge. This language is infested with three genders (male, female and neutral)."}, {"heading": "2. EXISTING WORK AND CHALLENGES IS CURRENT WORK", "text": "The NLP work was already discussed in the 1940s. From 1940 to 1980, the NLP systems were based on complex sets of handmade rules. After 1980, NLP took on a new dimension, with machine learning algorithms. There is an enormous amount of data available for languages such as English, but for Indian languages it is in the early stages of NLP algorithms. Newer NLP algorithms are based on statistical machine learning. The term Named Entity was introduced in the Sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6), Gobinda Chowdhury (2003) [4]. The various techniques for dealing with the NERC problem include: Maximum Entropy Models (Max Entity) (Jaynes 1957), Hidden Markov Models (HMM) (Baum et al. 1966), Support Vector Machines (SVM) et al. 1992), Decision 2003 (Treaffine Seaffkom) and Conditional (Random CRL) (Fields)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Challenges and Issues specific to Kannada language", "text": "The Kannada language is not capitalized.

CONCLUSION", "text": "Natural language processing is an important area of research with challenging topics that need to be explored. NERC is a class of NLP used to extract designated units from unstructured data. In this context, this paper focuses on NERC in the Kannada Language, as it notes that little work is being done in this area. To this end, we have conducted a comprehensive survey in the related area of NLP and, based on the survey, have proposed a problem and the formulated methodology. Various modeling techniques are examined from which a design of the monitored MNB is developed. The results obtained are recorded and evaluated. We developed an efficient model and trained on a corpus of approximately 95170 words. From this training corpus, some test samples are selected and submitted as input to the MNB. Interestingly, the model recognizes the designated units with an average F-measure of 81% and a 10-fold cross-validation F-measure of 77.2%."}], "references": [{"title": "Natural Language Processing", "author": ["Elizabeth D Liddy"], "venue": "In Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science. 2nd edition,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Natural Language Understanding", "author": ["James Allen"], "venue": "Pearson Publication Inc.,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Natural Language Processing.
