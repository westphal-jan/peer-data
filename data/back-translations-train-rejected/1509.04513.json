In this approach, one singleton property is created to uniquely represent a relationship in a particular context, and in general, generates a large property hierarchy in the schema. It has become the subject of important questions from Semantic Web practitioners. Can an existing reasoner recognize the singleton property triples? And how? If the singleton property triples describe a data triple, then how can a reasoner infer this data triple from the singleton property triples? Or would the large property hierarchy affect the reasoners in some way? We address these questions in this paper and present our study about the reasoning aspects of the singleton properties. We propose a simple mechanism to enable existing reasoners to recognize the singleton property triples, as well as to infer the data triples described by the singleton property triples. We evaluate the effect of the singleton property triples in the reasoning processes by comparing the performance on RDF datasets with and without singleton properties. Our evaluation uses as benchmark the LUBM datasets and the LUBM-SP datasets derived from LUBM with temporal information added through singleton properties.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Sep 2015 12:10:37 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04513v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["vinh nguyen", "olivier bodenreider", "krishnaprasad thirunarayan", "gang fu", "evan bolton", "n\\'uria queralt rosinach", "laura i furlong", "michel dumontier", "amit sheth"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.04513"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.04513.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "On Reasoning with RDF Statements about Statements using Singleton Property Triples", "authors": ["Vinh Nguyen", "Olivier Bodenreider", "Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan", "Gang Fu", "Evan Bolton", "N\u00faria Queralt Rosinach", "Laura I.

For example, to represent the fact that ProfessorA worked for two universities at different times, we create two singleton property instances that are described by the pairs of meta property and meta value (mpj, m v j) with j-1.. n. Generally, we create the following RDF representation, which is summarized in Table 3.

A generic property is more generic than all its sub-properties. A generic property is also more generic than its singletonPropertyOf property. For example, the generic property WorksFor property is more generic than the singletonPropertyOf property. So you can ask whether the singletonPropertyOf property is equivalent to the property subPropertyOf. However, the extension of a singletonProperty-4, e.g. WorksFor-1 property, has only one element (ProfessorA, University1). Therefore, the SingletonPropertyOf property does not only carry the semantics of its generic property subPropertyOf 4 (like sub-PropertyOf properties), but it also carries the semantics of the singletonProperty-4 property through its extension. Therefore, is SingletonPropertyOf property not equivalent to the subProperty-4 Property-4. If the two properties singletonTriple PropertyOf properties are similar to Property-4, then Property-of them cannot be considered as Property-4 Property-of-4, then Property-of-of-property-4Property-can-be-of-of-of-them-property-property-of-4."}, {"heading": "2.3 Deriving Data Triples", "text": "For example, from Section 1, how do we derive the triple M0: ProfessorA worksleton for University1 from the example set of singleton property triples?

You can add singleton property axioms to the application scheme and perform reasoning tasks with arguments that calculate the RDFS closure, such as Jena or the Oracle Inference Machine [28,29,33]. Although this addition is simple, it requires the support of the tools that are employed. Reasoner tools. Support for the singleton property within an argument can also be done by the creators of the tool. We chose Jena for our implementation because Jena is a popular open source Java API for RDF. We have integrated the RDF property class SingonProperty and Singleton property class of property package into the Java property package."}, {"heading": "4 Knowledge Base Benchmark", "text": "In order to provide a benchmark for evaluating various aspects of the singleton real estate approach as well as for future comparisons with other approaches, we have developed LUBM-SP by extending the LUBM data generator [10]."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data Generator", "text": "The LUBM Knowledge Base describes relationships between instances of 43 classes, including faculty, student, course, publication, and organization. Relationships asserted between two instances do not carry contextual information, such as duration or source. LUBM has been expanded to include the time dimension for RDF triples as in [19] by stamping triples with dynamic or static temporal properties. However, the representation of this extended knowledge base is not in the standard form of RDF triples, so it cannot be used to evaluate tasks related to RDF or SPARQL. While we also share the goal of enriching the LUBM Knowledge Base with the time information for the assertions, our approach differs from [19] in that we represent the time-enriched LUBM properties by using the time-enriched LUBM data."}, {"heading": "4.2 Queries", "text": "We create a set of SPARQL queries for each of the two types of queries: data-triple queries and mixed triple queries. Data-triple queries. LUBM contains an initial set of 14 SPARQL queries that contain only data-triple queries. We use the same set of queries to evaluate the performance of LUBM and LUBM-SP. This allows us to measure the additional time needed to derive and query singleton properties. From this set of queries, we create an equivalent set of SEMATCH queries executed in Oracle. For each query, we tested that the sets of results obtained from LUBM and LUBM-SP were the same size as expected."}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation", "text": "In this section, we present our experiments to evaluate the impact of the singleton property representation on the brainteasers. In particular, we evaluate the performance of the brainteasers at the RDFS level both at the in-memory level (Jena) and at the storage persistent level (Oracle). We measure the time needed to calculate the RDFS closure and the number of derived triples in each knowledge base. We measure the response performance of the query by running the same query on both knowledge bases and recording the execution time."}, {"heading": "5.1 Experiment setup", "text": "We used a single machine with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with 256 GB of RAM and three hard disks. On this machine, we used the newly created Jena Core package with singleton property support, as described in Section 3. We also installed Oracle 12c Release 1 on this machine. We used the automatic memory management function and distributed tablespace to different hard disks. This setting serves our evaluation purpose, as we build the different knowledge bases on the same system and database configuration, so the performance difference is due to the effects of the singleton property representation. Disclaimer: Oracle has no official support for Ubuntu. Although we managed to install Oracle 12c on Ubuntu 12.02 LTS and set it up for the experiments, we did not attempt to optimize the system to get the best performance from Oracle database."}, {"heading": "5.2 Loading and Indexing Entailment Rules", "text": "We have created six Knowledge Base (KBs). Each KB consists of either a LUBM or a LUBM-SP dataset created as described in Section 4. In Oracle, we have loaded each KB into an RDF model. For each model, we have performed the PL / SQL procedure SEM APIS.CREAT ENTAILMENT to create an RDFS rule data index with standard options. Table 5 shows the number of inferred triples and the time required for each index. The number of inferred triples in the LUBM-SP KBs is greater than the number of inferred triples in the corresponding LUBM-SP KBs. The time required to create the originating index increases proportionally with the number of inferred triples. We have observed that the performance was tied to the heavy I / O processes during which the three seconds of increasing the performance of the KM models are already loaded in 79 seconds."}, {"heading": "5.3 Query Answering", "text": "Queries with mixed triple patterns are not applicable (N / A) to LUBM KBs, as these KBs do not have triple singleton property patterns. We have performed queries with mixed triple patterns for each model with a fresh database. Table 6 reports on the average execution time after three runs for both Jena and Oracle. On average, queries executed with the LUBM-SP KBs take 10% (Jena) and 12% (Oracle) longer than queries executed with the LUBM KBs. This is expected due to the size of the KBs. In Jena, queries longer than two hours were aborted. Queries 8 and 9 executed in [10] running Jena in-memory with LUBM 1 (generated with 1 university) also have time off in our case. Compared to Jena, these long queries are executed much faster than queries from LUM."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "We can divide these approaches into three categories: triple-based (reification [14], singleton property), quadruple-based (named graph [5]), and quadruple-based (singleton property [24]), as in Section 1. Our work is based on the singleton property approach. A major advantage of the singleton property approach over maturation is that the original data can be derived threefold by the singleton property threefold. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that makes it possible to derive the EDF data described threefold by RDF threefold by an RDFS argumentator. This kind of reasoning is different from the stream reasoning [19], where the temporal dimension is not directly represented by RDF. It is also different from the temporal RDF [11], where temporal reasoning is included by reification in DF."}, {"heading": "7 Future Work", "text": "In the near future, we plan to address the following aspects: Performance Optimization. During implementation and evaluation, our goal was to support the reasoning of Singleton properties. We did not attempt to optimize the reasoning performance. However, the hierarchy of Singleton properties is usually large and better reasoning performance is always desirable for scalability. Assessment of this reasoning of Singleton properties with more optimized EDF stores should also be performed. As the EDF approach provides a mechanism for incorporating metadata such as the time dimension into the EDF tripel, work [11,18] to argue for temporal EDF stores can also be reviewed and newly implemented on Singleton properties. Similarly, considerations should be investigated regarding other types of metadata describing Tripel. Performance comparison. We plan to compare the inference-centered interrogation performance with that of other approaches such as N-ary and Nopub using NEK2s bioChPT and BioChubem."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "We have shown that this mechanism complies with all semantic web standards and is technically easy to implement. Our evaluation results also show an acceptable effort in the argumentation tasks related to knowledge databases enriched with metadata such as time, place and origin for assertions, taking into account in particular the conceptual simplicity and theoretical soundness."}], "references": [{"title": "Bio2rdf: towards a mashup to build bioinformatics knowledge systems", "author": ["F.

In this approach, one singleton property is created to uniquely represent a relationship in a particular context, and in general, generates a large property hierarchy in the schema. It has become the subject of important questions from Semantic Web practitioners. Can an existing reasoner recognize the singleton property triples? And how? If the singleton property triples describe a data triple, then how can a reasoner infer this data triple from the singleton property triples? Or would the large property hierarchy affect the reasoners in some way? We address these questions in this paper and present our study about the reasoning aspects of the singleton properties. We propose a simple mechanism to enable existing reasoners to recognize the singleton property triples, as well as to infer the data triples described by the singleton property triples. We evaluate the effect of the singleton property triples in the reasoning processes by comparing the performance on RDF datasets with and without singleton properties. Our evaluation uses as benchmark the LUBM datasets and the LUBM-SP datasets derived from LUBM with temporal information added through singleton properties.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
