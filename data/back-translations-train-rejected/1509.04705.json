The simple fact is that when developing the forecast TS models it is necessary to take into account not only the trends of forecast TS, but also trends of other TS that may affect them. For example, such macroeconomic indicators as gross domestic product and the level of exports described by a TS are explicitly dependent, as are the average level of income and level of education, health care and average life expectancy. At the same time, it is clear that many TS have similar laws of changing the values of its components and they can be combined into a subgroup according to the criterion of similarity of these laws."}, {"heading": "2 Theoretical part", "text": "Suppose that there is a group of TS T: (1,) it i m. Thus, we make each TS dependence appear as follows: n (10 30) n elements (1,).jit j nSignificant interest is in solving the problem of developing predictive models for all TS in a group with reasonable expenditure of time. (Time series, as well as other objects of data analysis, can be grouped into clusters (subgroups) taking into account certain characteristics. They are expectation values, scattering and others. They can be calculated on the basis of TS element values, maximum and minimum values of TS, etc. The problem of selecting an analytical dependency is usually solved in the process of forecasting model development for the purpose of calculating TS values. This analytical dependence describes the variation of TS values of the elements in time. Thus, it seems appropriate to use similar mathematical laws of changing TS values in time."}, {"heading": "3 Experimental studies", "text": "Approval of the proposed approach to predicting grouped TPs was carried out using TS for 22 macroeconomic indicators of the Russian Federation from 1999 to 2014 (http: / / databank.worldbank.org / data / views / tableview.aspx? isshared = true #).All indicators were divided into 4 clusters (subgroups), with information on cluster contents given in the first column of the table. General prediction models for each cluster were defined on the basis ofantibodies, which are compared to TS-centrodes clusters: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 _ cos cos cos cos ones of TS-cos cos cos cos cos."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "The offered forecasting approach for grouped TS implements the combined use of FCM algorithms and forecasting models based on SBT and MCSA and provides individual forecasting values for all TS in the group with acceptable expenditure of time. The results of experimental studies obtained during the forecasting of macroeconomic indicators in the Russian Federation confirm the prospects for application and further development of the offered approach. The use of the algorithms of cluster analysis allows the formation of clusters (subgroups) of the connected TS with similar laws of change of the values of the elements and leads to an increase of the TS forecasting speed. The application of the general forecasting models (forecasting models for TS centroids of clusters) for private TS entering the relevant subgroups does not lead to a significant reduction in forecasting accuracy. Thus, the required forecasting accuracy for private TS can be achieved in the course of improving the general forecasting model of the application of MSA."}], "references": [{"title": "Time series forecasting by means of modified clonal selection algorithm and clustering mechanisms, Modern Informatization Problems in Simulation and Social Technologies", "author": ["N.N.
