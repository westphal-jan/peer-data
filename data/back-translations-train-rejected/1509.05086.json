Given the amount of solutions offered and the maturity rate of application development it is not a matter of \"if\" but a matter of \"when\" in regards to these technologies becoming ubiquitous in control centers around the world. While the benefits are numerous, the functionality of operator-level applications can easily be nullified by injection of deceptive data signals disguised as genuine measurements. Such deceptive action is a common precursor to nefarious, often malicious activity. A correlation coefficient characterization and machine learning methodology are proposed to detect and identify injection of spoofed data signals. The proposed method utilizes statistical relationships intrinsic to power system parameters, which are quantified and presented. Several spoofing schemes have been developed to qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate detection capabilities.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Sep 2015 00:21:22 GMT  (14662kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05086v1", "8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR", "authors": ["jordan landford", "rich meier", "richard barella", "xinghui zhao", "eduardo cotilla-sanchez", "robert b bass", "scott wallace"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.05086"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.05086.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Fast Sequence Component Analysis for Attack Detection in Synchrophasor Networks", "authors": ["Jordan Landford", "Richard Barella", "Xinghui Zhao"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is not as if we go in search of new ways that lead us astray.

BACKGROUND", "text": "Attacks in which fake data is injected into a SCADA system to disguise an attack have been documented, notably Stuxnet [7] - [9]. Stuxnet was a computer worm designed to attack industrial facilities, in particular Siemens PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers). However, Stuxnet's intention was to physically destroy a specific target, in this case thousands of Iranian uranium centrifuges. Stuxnet was a sophisticated multimodal attack that spoofed was used to mask malicious activity. Specifically, Stuxnet regularly varied the mechanical frequency of centrifuges while at the same time masking these changes by producing fake process control signals. As such, the PLCs would not shut down because they could not observe the abnormal behavior. One lesson from Stuxnet is that physical infrastructure can come under the control of malware. Even isolated industrial systems are vulnerable to physical attacks, and such a means can be used to attack a sensor."}, {"heading": "III. METHODOLOGY", "text": "We use PMU data from ten electrically closely related PMUs from Bonneville Power Administration's 500 kV PMU network, making persuasion difficult. These data were recorded at 60 frames per second. Intra-PMU parameters correlation PMUs measures phasers of line voltages and line currents for all voltages (A, B, C) and currents (A, B, C, N). From these parameters, a number of other parameters are derived, including the size and phase angle for the positive, negative and zero sequence voltages and currents; frequency of change in frequency (ROCOF); among others [22]. Some of these parameters show a moderate correlation between each other, but most do not. We use the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) to quantify the degree of correlation between PMU parameters. Intra-PMU parameters that are weakly correlated can be used to detect spoofing experiments."}, {"heading": "C. Modeling a Spoofing Event", "text": "Our fake data set was derived by recording 30 seconds (1800 cycles) of PMU data from one of our ten PMU sites and then playing back that data in modified form to generate the last 30 seconds of a complete minute. We looked at the following playback schemes: \u2022 S1: Mirroring, where the initial 30 seconds of data are played backwards to generate the last 30 seconds of data. \u2022 S2: Polynomial Fit, where a 3rd degree polynomial is suitable for the initial 30 seconds of data so that the signal appears stretched over time. This polynomial is combined with a noise profile to generate the last 30 seconds of data. \u2022 S3: Timing, where we record a full 60 seconds of data from the fake PMU but re-evaluate the last 30 seconds of data so that the signal appears stretched."}, {"heading": "IV. SPOOF DETECTION USING PMU CORRELATION", "text": "(a) 120 cycle (2 seconds) Window sizeFigure 2 shows the effects of data injection (S1: Mirroring Spoof) on the correlation of frequency measurements between PMUs. Correlation of frequency measurements between all PMUs is greater than 0.5 before the spoofing event at 1800 cycles, as shown by the yellow-red and blue-green gradient4 curves on the left side of the figure. Color gradients show the electrical distance between each pair of PMUs; PMUs that are electrically close show a higher correlation. Injection of fake data at one PMU affects the correlation between that PMU and the nine others. As such, after the spoofing event, a set of nine curves (marked by the yellow-red gradient) begins to decouple quickly from the others. As shown in Figure 2, the nine r (f) correlations between the target CD and all others that begin shortly after the data injection."}, {"heading": "V. SPOOF DETECTION VIA SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES", "text": "The results presented in Section IV show that for PMUs that are electrically close, the counterfeit signals tend to differ rapidly from the normal signals, as shown in Figure 2. This makes it possible to detect the spoofing attack by monitoring correlations between PMU pairs. However, simple monitoring of a signal correlation (e.g. the frequency correlation r (f)) may not be a guarantee of timely identification of a spoofing attack on all types of spoofs. Rather, we expect that the robust identification of spofed signals requires careful verification of historical correlation values. Bonneville Power Administration's current installed PMU base contains over 40 devices generating roughly 1.2 TB of data per month. To address these challenges, we expect the challenges associated with storing, accessing and processing this information will only increase as the installation base expands. Therefore, manual analyses of PMU correlations are not feasible.To address these challenges, we will use a Vector-Class M to solve the problem."}, {"heading": "A. Performance Measures", "text": "The performance of this test set is evaluated by four measures: \u2022 Sensitivity: measures the ability to correctly detect counterfeit signals and is calculated as the number of true positives (counterfeit examples identified as such) divided by the number of total positives (the total number of counterfeit examples, which is the sum of true positives and false negatives). Sensitivity ranges from 0% to 100% with an ideal classifier measuring 100% sensitivity. \u2022 Incorrect detection rate: measures the tendency to incorrectly identify a counterfeit. This value is calculated as the number of false positives (normal examples identifies 5 as spofs) divided by the number of detected spofs (false positives plus true positives). Incorrect detection rate is equivalent to (1 precision). FDR ranges from 0% to 100%; an ideal classifier has 0% FDR better values than spofs (false plus true positives)."}, {"heading": "B. Training and Testing Data", "text": "Using the correlation characteristics described above, we have constructed a series of examples for each parody described in Section III-C. This approach generates 14 different minutes of data from the 14 minutes of data and 45 pairs of PMU i < j. Examples become \"spoofed\" in the last half of every minute of a selected PMU signal, if i is the fake PMU, and are otherwise \"normal.\" This approach yields about five times as many \"normal\" examples as \"spoofed\" examples. Considering the 14 minutes of data, we use 11 minutes (about 1.6 \u00b7 106 examples) for training the SVM and 3 minutes (about 4.5 \u00b7 105 examples) for testing. During training, all correlation characteristics are standardized (normalized to 0 mean and standard deviation of 1). Normalization transforms from the training characteristics so that they can be used later to transform test data prior to their classification.6"}, {"heading": "C. Parameter Selection and Training", "text": "During the training, we used the RBF kernel, which was parameterized by the scalar value \u03b3: K (xi, xj) = exp (\u2212 \u03b3 | | xi \u2212 xj | | 2) (5) We then divided the 11 training minutes into two sets (8 or 3 minutes) and performed a grid search over the C parameter space by training the previous set and testing it later. We performed this search for both the three characteristic data and the five characteristic data using the mirror spoof (S1). In both cases, we observed a high performance (F1 >.95) in a wide range of parameter settings. However, we observed faster training times and slightly improved F1 values using five characteristic data instead of three. Thus, in the following sections, our results are constructed by using five characteristic training / test data and one RBF-SVM data, whereby the parameters C = 1.0, and the conversion cycle, we present the time point data containing a time correlation between the SVM, a time correlation to the SVM, a time correlation between the two."}, {"heading": "D. Spoof-Specific Classification Results", "text": "The first three columns show that the total number of people captured is able to hide; the first three columns show that the captured data is also able to identify the captured people; the second column shows that they are able to identify themselves; the third column shows that they are able to identify themselves; and the third column shows that they are able to identify themselves."}, {"heading": "E. Spoof Detection Ensemble", "text": "The results presented in Section V-D illustrate that in general, our spoof-specific support for Vector Machines can accurately detect which PMU signals are being trained on a particular type of parody target. However, given that the type of parody attacks are not always a priori available, a generalized approach is essential. In Machine Learning, ensemble methods point to a general approach of combining multiple imperfect classifiers to produce a single, more robust, discriminatory figure [29]. Here, we are developing an ensemble that combines spoof spoof-specific support for Vector Machines and collectively makes decisions on unknown signals aimed at achieving better predictive performance than those of individual classifiers. In Section V-D, we developed nine SVM classifiers, each aimed at a specific type of play. To assess the generalization capability of these classifications, we combine eight of the nine SVMs described above, and test this ensemble."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "Our approach uses machine learning techniques and correlation coefficients between the measurement parameters of electrically near PMUs, and is capable of supporting streaming data and real-time detection in a live environment due to the short latency of 8 times. Two-tier support vector machines (SVMs) are trained with both normal and fake PMU data. Nine fake data models are derived using three different playback schemes. SVMs are evaluated using PMU data collected from the extensive PMU network of the Bonneville Power Administration. Experimental results show that the SVMs can effectively detect fake signals; against the nine fake data sets, the results show high sensitivities and F1 values, while at the same time exhibiting low false detection rates and reasonable latency times. Detection is improved when using a majority rule ensemble discriminator consisting of SVMs trained on the fake data sets."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This research is supported by grants from Oregon BEST and the Bonneville Power Administration.

Given the amount of solutions offered and the maturity rate of application development it is not a matter of \u201cif\u201d but a matter of \u201cwhen\u201d in regards to these technologies becoming ubiquitous in control centers around the world. While the benefits are numerous, the functionality of operator-level applications can easily be nullified by injection of deceptive data signals disguised as genuine measurements. Such deceptive action is a common precursor to nefarious, often malicious activity. A correlation coefficient characterization and machine learning methodology are proposed to detect and identify injection of spoofed data signals. The proposed method utilizes statistical relationships intrinsic to power system parameters, which are quantified and presented. Several spoofing schemes have been developed to qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate detection capabilities.
