Since the types of agents are observed privately by the agents, the mechanism can only maximize social welfare if it can obtain their true types. In the following, we formally define these concepts. We say that an allocation choice is \"efficient\" if it always chooses an allocation that maximizes the expected social welfare, for all types of reports. Definition 1. Allocation choice is efficient if and only if there is a rational benefit for all of these mechanisms. We say that an allocation choice is \"efficient\" if it maximizes the expected social welfare."}, {"heading": "Failure of the Groves Mechanism", "text": "The Groves mechanism is a well-known class of mechanisms that are efficient and truthful in many areas (Groves 1973).

Groves mechanisms calculate an efficient allocation method."}, {"heading": "Applicability of PEV-Based Mechanisms", "text": "As shown in the last section, the Groves mechanisms are not directly applicable due to the interdependence of the agents \"assessments based on their probability of success (PoS); the other reason is that the Groves payment is calculated by agents if they do not perform their realized / true tasks. In fact, we can partially verify their reported welfare mechanism by postponing their payments until they have completed their tasks (post-execution verification). To take advantage of this fact, we have proposed a variant of the Groves mechanism that pays an agent according to their actual task instead of what they have reported. More specifically, we define two payments for each agent: a reward for successfully completing and a penalty for not completing. Let's call this mechanism PEV-based mechanisms. (2008) we have considered a simple setting in which there are one or more tasks each assigned to several workers."}, {"heading": "Multilinearity in PoS is Sufficient for Truthfulness", "text": "Theorem 1.

We should also note that there is a research corpus for general interdependent assessments such as (Milgrom and Weber 1982; Jehiel and Moldovanu 2001). Therefore, we draw the parallels between the two areas below and compare and compare their main findings and assumptions. The work of (Jehiel and Moldovanu 2001) is particularly interesting for this study because they have identified a necessary condition for the implementation of an efficient and Bayes-Nash truth mechanism (see Theorem 4.3 in Bayes-Nash True is weaker than subsequently true, and it assumes that all agents know the correct true distribution of individual types of agents (Jehiel and Moldovanu 2001)."}, {"heading": "When Agents are Not Risk-Neutral", "text": "We have shown that once agents are risk-neutral in their execution uncertainty, PEV-based mechanisms are sufficient to incentivise agents to reveal their true types. However, in many real-world applications, participants are often not risk-neutral. For example, when we book a ride from a taxi / car-sharing company to catch a flight, we certainly do not want to take any risks to get an unreliable booking. On the other hand, we often face difficult tasks that are very unlikely to be completed successfully (e.g. open research questions and financial investment), but we are very willing to take risks to try it. Our results suggest that we need better solutions to deal with these non-risk-neutral environments. In addition, if agents are not risk-neutral, individual rationality needs to be redefined (definition 2), as the current definition assumes that agents are risk-neutral in their execution uncertainty."}, {"heading": "Challenge of the Efficient Allocation Design", "text": "In our model, we assumed that the possible results of the task assignment are given and that the efficient task assignment is selected from this set. It is worth noting that when a specific task assignment is assigned, it cannot be so easy to find an efficient assignment (Ramchurn et al. 2009; Stein et al. 2011; Feige and Tennenholtz 2011; Conitzer and Vidali 2014). If it is mathematically difficult to achieve an efficient result, there are techniques to solve this problem without violating the truth properties (Nisan and Ronen 2007). Conclusions We examined a general task assignment problem where multiple agents perform a number of tasks together, but they cannot successfully complete the tasks assigned to them. In order to design an efficient task assignment mechanism for this problem, we demonstrated that a verification mechanism based on execution is truthfully implementable, and only if all risks are unrelated to their performance."}], "references": [{"title": "and Despotovic", "author": ["K.
