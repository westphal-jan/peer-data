INTRODUCTION", "text": "In computer science and information science, an ontology is defined as a structured set of terms and concepts that represent the meaning of information domains, whether through the metadata of a namespace or the elements of a knowledge domain. Ontologies are used in artificial intelligence, the semantic web, software engineering, biomedical computing, and information architecture as a form of knowledge representation over a world or a certain part of that world. How should the original definition of ontology by Gruber (1993) be given as an explicit specification of conceptualization [1], providing a common vocabulary of a real domain and defining the meaning of terms and the relationships between them with a different degree of formality. Ontologies are usually organized in taxonomies and include the primitives of modeling such as classes, relationships, functions, axioms, and instances [1]."}, {"heading": "2. ONTOLOGY: THEORETICAL BASIS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. Definitions", "text": "In the context of Artistic Intelligence, an ontology is identified with a set of formal concepts that represent knowledge. Knowledge transmission is based on objects, concepts, and the relationships that exist between them. Sowa [2] is defined as a specification of entities that exist in any way. Ontology can be represented by a collection of names that are conducted in a partial order."}, {"heading": "2.2. Ontology components", "text": "The formalization of knowledge in ontologies is based on five components: classes, instances, relationships, functions, axioms, and instances [1]. The following paragraphs enumerate these ontological components: \u2022 Classes or concepts: also called types or universals, are a group of individuals who share common characteristics that are used in a broader sense. A concept can be anything that is said about. It can be a description of a task, action, function, strategy, thought process, etc. The majority of ontology languages (for example, OWL, DAML, etc.) allow the definition of concepts based on these characteristics. For example, all mammals have the same characteristics except the ability to speak. \u2022 Relationships: In ontologies, relationships describe the means in which individuals (instances or details) relate to each other."}, {"heading": "2.3. Ontology reuse", "text": "Ontology reuse is an important research problem in the semantic web and ontology field. It can be defined as the process in which available (ontological) knowledge is used as input to generate new ontologies. In the following paragraphs, some definitions of ontology reuse categories are given (based on the work described in [9]): \u2022 Ontology fusion: It is an approach that aims to integrate two ontologies or more in order to create a unique ontology that would / would have contained all the knowledge that the merged ontologies had. Then, a process of ontology fusion forms a unique ontology; ontology represents a merged version of the original ontologies."}, {"heading": "2.4. Ontology typologies", "text": "In this book, ontological engagement is used to classify ontologies. If it is possible to distinguish between types of ontological engagement, then it is possible to identify different types of ontologies, and therefore it is possible to classify ontologies. In this book, a distinction is made between tasks, methods and domains. [5] Consequently, three different types of ontological obligations are identified: obligations from work, obligations from the domain and obligations from the domain."}, {"heading": "2.5. Ontology complexity", "text": "Two types of ontology complexity can be distinguished depending on the broad range of tasks to which the ontologies belong. \u2022 Lightweight ontologies: Lightweight ontologies are usually defined as more hierarchical or classificatory characteristics, usually designed to represent a submission relationship (i.e. a hierarchy between concepts) or other types of relationship between concepts. A lightweight ontology does not include too many or too complicated relationships. As an example, these ontologies can be applied in web search engines such as Yahoo Ontology, which consists of a hierarchy of topics in which a strict definition of the concept, the distinction between word and concept, etc. A formal definition of lightweight ontology is given in [21] Ontology: Second Key Concepts: The Different Concepts of Ontology."}, {"heading": "3. ONTOLOGY DESIGN", "text": "Ontologies can be defined as artefacts that have a structure (logical, linguistic, \"taxonomic\"), their purpose being to encode a description of the world (actually, counterfactually, possible, impossible, desirable, etc.) for some tasks or problems (e.g. the world of medicine, the world of semantic web conference, etc.) However, ontologies must correspond to both the domain and the task described as follows: \u2022 Domain: Allows the description of the entities whose attributes and relationships are affected by any property (students as entities enrolled in the university, supervised by scientists, and have names, addresses, etc.). \u2022 Task: To fulfil a purpose (finding people working on a topic, matching project topics to employee competencies, etc.) Ontology design is quite a challenge for complex applications and essential technology in the creation of knowledge-based applications."}, {"heading": "4. ONTOLOGY DEVELOPMENT", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to be in a position to be in what they are in."}, {"heading": "5. ONTOLOGY EVALUATION", "text": "The evaluation process of ontology could be based on several aspects: for example, the quality of the designed ontology (technical point of view) and its usability in the real world (practical point of view); in addition, it is possible to evaluate an ontology on the basis of a mathematical model (mathematical point of view); several papers have been proposed for the purpose of evaluating the quality of the designed ontology: For example, five criteria proposed by Gruber [26] are needed for the evaluation of ontology: clarity, coherence, extensibility, minimal encryption distortion and minimal ontological engagement. Ontologies include sets of related concepts ontology. Generally, set theory is used to construct mathematical models for defining and arguing ontological models [32]. Furthermore, Tartir et al. (2005) [33], OntoQA, presented as an approach for the qualitative evaluation of ontologies and their potential to represent metrics is well defined by metrics."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "Ontologies have been used in several real-world applications to improve communication between agents (people or software agents), but the literature has explored and progressively developed different types of ontologies. In this paper, the concept of ontologies and their components, reuse, typology and complexity was presented, as well as the principle of ontology design and development guidelines, and this paper provided the process of ontology evaluation to improve the understanding of ontology developers and naive users."}], "references": [{"title": "A translation approach to portable ontology specifications.

"abstractText": "In semantic technologies, the shared common understanding of the structure of information among artifacts (people or software agents) can be realized by building an ontology. To do this, it is imperative for an ontology builder to answer several questions: a) what are the main components of an ontology? b) How an ontology look likes and how it works? c) Verify if it is required to consider reusing existing ontologies or no? c) What is the complexity of the ontology to be developed? d) What are the principles of ontology design and development? and e) How to evaluate an ontology? This paper answers all the key questions above. The aim of this paper is to present a set of guiding principles to help ontology developers and also inexperienced users to answer such questions.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
