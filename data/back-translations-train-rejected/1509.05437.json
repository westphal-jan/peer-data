By using this theory it is possible to extract rules that are similar to normal associations. However, we examine the rough approach to discover the rules of class association and we show that this approach is simpler than the classical association method. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the ARM background, which explains the data preparation for further processes with rough defined approaches. Furthermore, it discusses the importance of item set, support and trust of the rule, how to transform relational schema into bitmap table and the meaning of class association rules. Section 4 discusses how to apply RST to class association rules, how to represent data with RST and the C _ Apriori algorithm for CAR mining."}, {"heading": "A. Relation Table Types", "text": "Generally speaking, the process of discovering association rules uses a single table (relation) as a data source representing relations between items. Formally, a relation is a relation table R containing a series of tuples (t1, t2,... ti,... tn), where ti represents the i-th tupel. A relation R can be accompanied by either binary or non-binary attributes. As an example of a relation RL1 with binary attributes: The presence of a computer element in a transaction or its absence represents its domain {sells, not sells}. An attribute Aj is a non-binary domain represented by j items and binary vectors, so that n is the number of attributes of the non-binary domain. For example, for better representation of customer assets, we associate the attribute \"income\" with the domain that consists of 3 (j = 3) items and binary vectors, so that n is the number of attributes of the non-binary domain. \"For example, we associate the attribute\" income \"with the domain that consists of 3 (j = 3) items and binary vectors,\" which follows {= high income, \"as follows {1:"}, {"heading": "B. Bitmap Representation", "text": "A relation or table is used as the data source for the ARM approach, some attributes are measurable with discrete variables, such as some numerical or textual values in the name of a range. However, the shape of the original data representation could be changed exactly so that each attribute in the new bitmap table is an exact value of an element in the original table, and each attribute value should be 1 or 0, which indicates whether there is a \"1,\" otherwise a \"0\" in the bitmap table [7]. Let's take the example of Table 3, where attributes representing data are {X}, {Y} and {Z}. The attribute X has two values {A and B} = {account charged, account credited}, the attribute Y has three values {C, D and E} = {low income, high income, middle income} and the attribute Z has two values {F, G} = {after loans, not loans}, the attribute Y has three values {C, D and E} = {low income, high income, middle income} and the attribute Z has two values {F, G} = {after loans, not credits}, account credited}, the attribute Y has three values {C, and E = {low income, high income, middle income, middle income} and {Z}."}, {"heading": "C. Class Association Rules (CARs)", "text": "Let us make a series of n transactions marked by a class y. The set of all elements in T is marked from A to B, and the set of class labels is marked from Y to B, where I go from Y to A to B. (The following table provides a comparison between the normal association rules (NAR), and the class labels are marked from A to B. (The table shows that the inconsistency of the CARs is a goal to generate a complete set of CARs that has minimal support and a minimum of consistency.) The theory of A to B is a useful mathematical method that deals with inconsistency problems developed from A to B."}, {"heading": "A. Approximations", "text": "As defined above, as the starting point of RST, the indiscretion relationship is intended to express the fact that due to the lack of knowledge, but not being able to distinguish some objects using the available information, RST encompasses another important concept, namely approximations. Approximation is also associated with the meaning of the approximations of topological operations [11]. The types of approximations used in the Rough Sets Theory are described below: 1. Lower Approximation (B *): The description of the domain object that is certainly part of the subset of interest defines the lower approximation (LA). Additionally, the LA set (B *) of a set X relative to R is the set that can be safely classified with X relative to R. 2. Upper Approximation (B *): The objects that may belong to the subset of interest may possibly define the upper approximation (UA) of a set of X (UB) in addition to a set of A *."}, {"heading": "B.
