Methods", "text": "The main difference between the LSW and HMM PoS taggers is that the LSW PoS tagger makes local decisions about the PoS tag of each word based on the ambiguity class (set of PoS tags) of words in a context of fixed length around the problem word, while HMM makes this decision by efficiently taking into account all possible ambiguities of all words in the sentence by using a probabilistic model based on a multiplicative chain of transition and emission probabilities. In terms of the complexity of the model, LSW is simpler than HMM, while on the other hand the number of parameters of the LSW could be greater than that of the HMM, which could have a decisive impact on the tagging performance as training material in order to properly estimate it. LSW tagger is an improved version of the sliding window (SW) PoS tagger (Sa d\u00e9nchez-Villamil et al., 2004), and the main target for SW-sewing pairs is the W."}, {"heading": "2.1.

SW tag could not prohibit and enforce rules, because it works with ambiguity classes, while the LSW tag can easily integrate them, since it works directly with PoS tags. Rules can be introduced immediately after the initialization step."}, {"heading": "3. Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. Training data and test set", "text": "The experiments are conducted in three languages: Spanish (apertium-en-es-0.8.0), Catalan (apertium-es-ca-1.1.0) and English (apertium-en-es-0.8.0). Training data for Spanish and English are obtained by sampling text from the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) and for Catalan by sampling text from the Catalan Wikipedia. Statistics on training data and test data are in Table 1. Test data for Catalan and Spanish come from apertium-es-ca-1.1.0. Remarkably, the English test set was built by mapping the results from the TnT (Brants, 2000) tagger as an approximate value."}, {"heading": "3.2. The LSW tagger vs. the SW tagger", "text": "First, we examine whether there is a difference between the LSW tagger and the SW tagger, with all other settings remaining the same. Then, we examine whether rules can help improve the accuracy of the LSW tagger. \"Precision\" in the graph refers to the tagging precision of a tagger on the handtagged test set. Figure 1 shows that rules contribute significantly to improving accuracy and that the SW tagger behaves similarly to the LSW tagger without rules, which is in line with the conclusion in (Sa'nchez-Villamil et al., 2005)."}, {"heading": "3.3. Different window settings for the LSW tagger", "text": "We examine the performance of the LSW tagger with different window settings and the HMM tagger in the three languages, as shown in Figure 2. We can see that the HMM tagger performs best among all taggers, especially if sufficient training data is available. However, if the training data is limited, the LSW taggers learn faster (need fewer words to learn) and are more stable than the HMM tagger. Of all LSW taggers, the LSW (-1, + 1), i.e. the left context 1 and the right context 1, are best. If enough training data is available, the performance of the HMM tagger and the LSW (-1, + 1) tagger are quite close to each other. Note that the performance of the LSW taggers even decreases under some window settings, as additional training lines have been added, e.g. LSW (-1) and LSW (-2, -1) for Spanish and Catalan. This is an unexpected reason for further investigation."}, {"heading": "3.4. Using Constraint Grammar rules to support the HMM and LSW", "text": "We also tested whether the use of Constraint Grammar (CG) rules contributes to improving the accuracy achieved by both HMM and LSW markers, in line with the lines proposed in (Hulden and Francom, 2012). To this end, we used the CG rules already included in the apertium packages apertium-eo-es-0.8.2 for Spanish and apertium-eo-ca-0.8.2 for Catalan (one CG module is integrated into many apertium language pairs). Figure 3 shows that CG rules are helpful in almost all environments. It also shows that CG rules help the two markers in different situations: for the HMM label, the positive contribution of the CG rules is greater when the training data is limited than when they are relative; while for the LSW label, the trend is almost the opposite, that CG rules contribute more if the training data is relative enough."}, {"heading": "4. Discussion and future work", "text": "We reviewed the mechanism and unattended parameter estimation methods for both the SW and LSW taggers. Compared to previous efforts (Sa'nchez-Villamil et al., 2004; Sa'nchez-Villamil et al., 2005), we first proposed a method to include and enforce the rules already used for HMM taggers in Apertium in the LSW tagger. Second, the implementation is the first time that the LSW tagger is integrated into a real machine translation system (apertium), and at the same time its code is free / open source. We also conducted experiments to compare the performance of the LSW tagger with different settings, and with respect to the original HMM tagger. First, the HMM tagger performs slightly better than the LSW tagger (-1, + 1) tagger when there is sufficient training data."}, {"heading": "5. References", "text": "T. Brants. 2000.
