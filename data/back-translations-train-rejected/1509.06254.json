The proposed approach has four main steps: 1) generation of the composition graph for a request; 2) computation of the optimal composition that minimizes a single objective QoS function; 3) multi-step optimizations to reduce the search space by identifying equivalent and dominated services; and 4) hybrid local-global search to extract the optimal QoS with the minimum number of services. An extensive validation with the datasets of the Web Service Challenge 2009-2010 and randomly generated datasets shows that: 1) the combination of local and global optimization is a general and powerful technique to extract optimal compositions in diverse scenarios; and 2) the hybrid strategy performs better than the state-of-the-art, obtaining solutions with less services and optimal QoS.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Sep 2015 14:56:28 GMT  (243kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06254v1", "Preprint accepted to appear in IEEE Transactions on Services Computing 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Preprint accepted to appear in IEEE Transactions on Services Computing 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NI", "authors": ["pablo rodriguez-mier", "manuel mucientes", "manuel lama"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.06254"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.06254.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Hybrid Optimization Algorithm for Large-Scale QoS-Aware Service Composition", "authors": ["Pablo Rodriguez-Mier", "Manuel Mucientes", "Manuel Lama"], "emails": ["pablo.rodriguez.mier@usc.es", "manuel.mucientes@usc.es", "manuel.lama@usc.es"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords - Service Composition; Service Optimization; Hybrid Algorithm; QoS-aware; Semantic Web Services.F"}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "The functionality of a web service is mainly determined by the functional characteristics that govern its behavior with respect to its inputs, outputs, and possibly additional descriptions that the services may have, such as preconditions and effects. These four characteristics, which often go beyond the achievement of a specific functionality, allow the composition and aggregation of web services into composite web services that achieve more complex functionalities and therefore solve complex user needs that cannot be satisfied with atomic web services. However, compositions should go beyond achieving a specific functionality and take other requirements such as Quality of Service (QoS) into account in order to generate compositions that meet the needs of different contexts. QoS determines the value of different qualitative characteristics of services such as response time (total time of a service to respond to a request) or throughput (number of supported supported in a time interval interval of supported individual characteristics) among others."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before there is an agreement, until there is an agreement."}, {"heading": "3 MOTIVATION", "text": "The goal of the automatic service composition problem, as considered in this paper, is to automatically select the best combination of the available QoS-aware services in a way that can fulfill a user request that otherwise could not be solved by calling a single, existing service. However, this request will be considered as less of a service than possible in terms of the information the user provides (inputs) and the information he expects to receive (outputs).The resulting composition should meet this requirement with an optimal, single criterion of end-to-end QoS and as less of a service.A motivating example of the problem is presented in the illustration. The illustration represents an illustration with all relevant services for a Request R, where the inputs are {ont3: IPAddress, ont2: MerchantCode} and the output is {xsd: boolean. The goal of this example is to obtain a composition to predict whether a business transaction is fraudulent or not."}, {"heading": "4 PROBLEM FORMULATION", "text": "We hereby formalize the most important concepts and assumptions regarding the composition model used in our approach, which consists of a semantic, graph-centric representation of the composition of services, which are summarized in three main models: 1) a service model used to represent services and define how services can be linked or mapped to generate compound services; 2) a graph-based composition model used to represent both service interactions and compositions; and 3) a QoS calculation model that provides operators with a graph-based composition for calculating global QoS."}, {"heading": "4.1 Semantic Service Model", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one is able to go in search of a suitable candidate."}, {"heading": "4.2 Graph-Based Composition Model", "text": "This year, it will be able to turn to the countries of origin to repatriate them."}, {"heading": "4.3 QoS Computation Model", "text": "Before looking for optimal QoS values, we use a QoS compilation model based on workflows that are based on the structure of QoS.

[QoS] The total time of the response time is calculated as the sum of the response time of each individual service in the composition. [QoS] However, the composition of the total time of the composition is given by the slowest services. [QoS] a composition depends on the type of QoS and the structure of the QoS values.

The approach works as follows: When a request is made, a directed graph is generated with the relevant services for the request. Once the graph is created, an optimal forward search for label correction is performed in polynomial time to calculate the global optimal QoS. This information is later used in a multi-stage trimming phase to remove sub-optimal services. Finally, a hybrid local / global search is performed within a specified timeframe to extract the optimal solution from the graph. The local search quickly delivers a near-optimal solution, while the global search performs an incremental search to explain the composition with the minimum number of services of the optimum step of the computation in this paragraph 1)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Generation of the Service Match Graph", "text": "Faced with a composition request that includes the inputs provided by the user as well as the outputs he expects to receive, and a number of services available, the first step is to locate all relevant services that may be part of the final composition, as well as calculate any possible matches between their inputs and outputs, according to the semantic model in Sec. 4.1. The output of this step is a service match graph that contains many possible valid compositions for the request, as shown in Fig. 3. In short, the generation of the chart is calculated by selecting all callable services layer by layer, starting with Sun in the first layer (the source service whose outputs are the inputs of the request) and ending with Si in the last layer (the sink service whose inputs are the outputs of the relevant services)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Optimal end-to-end QoS", "text": "Once the Service Match Graph has been calculated for a composition request, the next step is the calculation of the best end-to-end QoS that can be achieved in the Service Match Graph. The optimal end-to-end QoS can be calculated in polynomial time using an algorithm with the shortest path to calculate the best aggregated QoS values for each input and output of the graph, i.e. the best QoS values to which the outputs can be generated and the inputs can be matched. To calculate the optimal QoS, we use a generalized Dijkstrabased label-setting algorithm that aggregates from So to Si [36] based on the algebraic model of QoS presented in Sec. 4. The optimum of the algorithm is guaranteed as long as the function that is defined to aggregate the QoS values."}, {"heading": "5.3 Graph optimizations", "text": "The question of whether it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way and a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is about a way in which it is"}, {"heading": "5.4 Hybrid algorithm", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "6 EVALUATION", "text": "In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we conducted two different experiments: In the first experiment, we tested the approach on the basis of the data sets of the Web Service Challenge 2009-2010 [39].

All tests were conducted with a time limit of 5 minutes. Solutions created by our algorithm are presented as a service composition graph (no BPEL was generated)."}, {"heading": "6.1 Web Service Challenge 2009-2010 datasets", "text": "In fact, most of us will be able to find ourselves in the position in which we find ourselves."}, {"heading": "6.2 Randomly generated datasets", "text": "Although the global search is able to obtain solutions with a lower number of services, a first look at the results obtained with the WSC dataset might indicate that the difference between the two strategies is not very significant, since most of the solutions obtained have the same number of services. However, this could be due to a bias in the repository, since all WSC datasets are generated using the same random model. In order to better evaluate and characterize the performance of the hybrid algorithm, we have generated a new set of five random datasets ranging from 1,000 to 9,000 services. These datasets are available at https: / / wiki.citius.usc.es / inv: downloadable results: ws-random-qos. Table 5 shows the solutions obtained. We found that in these datasets the solutions obtained with the global search strategy are on average 16% smaller than those obtained with the local search, compared to the differences during the previous search time."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The proposed approach combines a series of graph optimizations and a local-global search to extract the optimal composition from the graph. Results obtained with the datasets of the Web Service Challenge 2009-2010 show that combining graph optimizations with a local-global search strategy works better than the current state of the art, as solutions with less services and optimal QoS have been achieved. Furthermore, evaluation with a series of randomly generated datasets shows that the hybrid strategy is well suited to perform compositions in different scenarios as it can achieve a good compromise between quality and execution time."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX A COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY", "text": "The calculation of the optimal QoS problem (SMP) is NP problem (SMP).

of Web services that generates semantic inputoutput based compositions with optimal end-to-end QoS, minimizing the number of services of the resulting composition. The proposed approach has four main steps: 1) generation of the composition graph for a request; 2) computation of the optimal composition that minimizes a single objective QoS function; 3) multi-step optimizations to reduce the search space by identifying equivalent and dominated services; and 4) hybrid local-global search to extract the optimal QoS with the minimum number of services. An extensive validation with the datasets of the Web Service Challenge 2009-2010 and randomly generated datasets shows that: 1) the combination of local and global optimization is a general and powerful technique to extract optimal compositions in diverse scenarios; and 2) the hybrid strategy performs better than the state-of-the-art, obtaining solutions with less services and optimal QoS.
