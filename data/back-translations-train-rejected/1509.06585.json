However, for a given user classification problem, it is very difficult to select a set of appropriate features, because the many features described in the literature are very heterogeneous, with name overlaps and collisions, and numerous very close variants. In this article, we review a wide range of such features. In order to present a clear state-of-the-art description, we unify their names, definitions and relationships, and we propose a new, neutral, typology. We then illustrate the interest of our review by applying a selection of these features to the offline influence detection problem. This task consists in identifying users which are influential in real-life, based on their Twitter account and related data. We show that most features deemed efficient to predict online influence, such as the numbers of retweets and followers, are not relevant to this problem. However, We propose several content-based approaches to label Twitter users as Influencers or not. We also rank them according to a predicted influence level. Our proposals are evaluated over the CLEF RepLab 2014 dataset, and outmatch state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 13:12:34 GMT  (1326kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06585v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 27 Jul 2016 13:19:33 GMT  (1281kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06585v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 29 Jul 2016 08:02:34 GMT  (1413kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06585v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["jean-val\\`ere cossu", "vincent labatut", "nicolas dugu\\'e"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.06585"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.06585.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Review of Features for the Discrimination of Twitter Users: Application to the Prediction of Offline Influence", "authors": ["Jean-Val\u00e8re Cossu", "Nicolas Dugu\u00e9"], "emails": ["vincent.labatut}@univ-avignon.fr", "nicolas.dugue@univ-orleans.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords Twitter \u00b7 Influence \u00b7 Natural Language Processing \u00b7 Social Network AnalysisJean-Val\u00e8re Cossu, Vincent Labatut Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon, LIA EA 4128, France Email: {jean-valere.cossu, vincent.labatut} @ univ-avignon.frNicolas Dugu\u00e9 Universit\u00e9 d'Orl\u00e9ans, INSA Centre Val de Loire, LIFO EA 4022, France Email: nicolas.dugue @ univ-orleans.fr"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to identify themselves need to focus on themselves. [...] However, attempts are made to report live events by covering a wide range of issues that affect public opinion. [...] Due to the popularity and widespread use of Twitter, there are numerous reasons to attract the attention of politicians, companies, celebrities and marketers. [...] Attempts are made to be as visible and influential as possible. [...] Due to the popularity and widespread use of Twitter, there are numerous reasons why people want to categorize their users."}, {"heading": "2 Review of Twitter-Related Features", "text": "We present an overview of the most interesting features that can be used to characterize Twitter users. Due to the generally large number of features used in a particular study, the authors often group them by topic. However, there is no standard in terms of the resulting feature categories, which can vary greatly from author to author. In particular, people tend to categorize features based on certain criteria related to their field of study (i.e. mainly SNA and NLP). Here, we try to ignore this somewhat artificial distinction and propose a neutral typology. We do not want to be exhaustive, but rather include widely used features and highlight their diversity. Before we begin to describe the features in detail, we need to introduce some concepts related to Twitter. This online microblogging service allows us to discuss widely published as well as everyday events [38] by using tweets, short messages of no more than 140 characters. To see the tweets posted by other users, we need to expose them."}, {"heading": "2.1.1 User Profile", "text": "Our first category collects features related to user profiles. The first 4 are Boolean values that indicate whether the user creates a profile picture (Feature 1), his account has been officially verified by Twitter (Feature 2), he allows other users to contribute to his account (Feature 3), he sets up his personal website (Feature 4), the profile picture itself is analyzed by certain authors, extracting information such as age, gender and race. Feature 5 is an integer that corresponds to the length of text the user describes in order to describe himself. These properties are good indicators of how committed the user is to gaining his online presence. Professional bloggers and corporate accounts, in particular, fill in these profile fields while spambots, or passive users write themselves to describe themselves."}, {"heading": "2.1.2 Publishing Activity", "text": "The next category focuses on the way the user behaves in relation to the tweets he or she publishes. Feature 12 corresponds to the number of tweets he or she posted within the period under consideration, and thus represents how active the user is globally. Users posting a small number of tweets are potentially information seekers [38]. Since this number is generally high, certain authors prefer to take into account the number of tweets published per day [46,55]. The default deviation, minimum or maximum number of tweets published in a day, gives an idea of the regularity of the user in relation to twittering. Alternatively, it is also possible to specifically detect periodic accounting behavior, such as Chu et al."}, {"heading": "2.1.3 Local Connections", "text": "The features in this category describe how the user is connected to the rest of the Twitter network. Feature 17 corresponds to the network of follower-to-follower relationships that can be handled in many ways. Most authors extract two different values to represent a user: the number of followers (people who subscribed to the user's feed) and the number of followers (people who subscribed to the user's feed), in other words, the incoming and outgoing levels of the node that represents the user on the network.Some authors consider alternatively the amount achieved by the intersection of the user's followers and followers. For example, Dugu\u00e9 and Perez [23] use it to distinguish regular users from so-called social capitalists, who use specific strategies that allow them to be highly visible on Twitter while producing absolutely no content of interest. One of the consequences of this behavior is a strong overlap between their followers and those who can be identified."}, {"heading": "2.1.4 User Interaction", "text": "This category includes features describing how the user and the other people interact. Feature 21 is the percentage of retweets among the tweets posted by the user, i.e. the percentage of messages from other people forwarded by the user [15,8,61]. It is also possible to take into account the raw number of such retweets [72], or to process a time-dependent statistic such as the average number (or percentage) of retweets per day. Symmetrically, Feature 22 is the number of tweets that the user has been retweeted by others. Alternatively, it is possible to use the percentage of the user's tweets that have been retweeted at least once [4]. These features represent how strongly the user reacts to external tweets and how much response he receives from his own tweets. Alternatively, certain authors working with the retweet network, i.e. a graph in which the nodes represent and are connected to users when a user retweets another."}, {"heading": "2.1.5 Lexical Aspects", "text": "This category deals with the content produced by the user. A number of characteristics can be used to describe the lexical aspects of the text that compiles his tweets. They are relevant if you want to distinguish users according to the ideas they express on Twitter or how they express them. It is possible, for example, to count all events or focus only on unique words. Alternatively, you can calculate a statistic that is expressed by tweets (e.g. average number of unique words per tweet), or over a period of time. Certain authors prefer to compare the size of the user's lexicon with that of the English word, in the form of a ratio [78]. Feature 28 is very similar, but for hapaxes, i.e. words that are unique to the user."}, {"heading": "2.1.6 Stylistic Traits", "text": "The Tweet content can also be described with non-lexical characteristics that are collected in this category. Features 32 and 33 are the number of characters in words or tweets. Sometimes, the length of a tweet is expressed in words rather than in characters. These characteristics can help to characterize certain types of users. For example, the content tweeted by certain spambots is just a bag of keywords with no correct grammatical structure (e.g. [42]), leading to a higher average word length. In the same note, Feature 34 is based on a measurement of the legibility of the tweet. This can correspond to the difficulty one would have to understand its meaning [78], or at the level of the correctness of the text (lexical and / or grammatical)."}, {"heading": "2.1.7 External Data", "text": "The next two years will probably not come to the point where we will be able to adapt in a different way than to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another, to another."}, {"heading": "3 Application to Offline Influence", "text": "In this section, we first define the concept of influence, and we discuss the difference between online and offline influence. We then describe RepLab 2014, a CLEF challenge aimed at identifying Twitter users who are particularly influential in the real world. Finally, we select a subset of features presented in Section 2 to address this issue. 3.1 Notion of InfluenceThe Oxford Dictionary defines influence as \"the ability to have an effect on the character, development, or behavior of someone or something.\" Various factors can be taken into account to measure the online influence of Twitter users. Intuitively, the more users are tracked and retweeted the more they appear to be influential [13]. Nevertheless, there is no consensus about which features are most relevant, or even if other features would be more discriminatory."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Data and task", "text": "The main objective of the RepLab challenge is to capture offline influence using online Twitter data. RepLab data set contains users who have been manually labeled by specialists from Llorente & Cuenca2, a leading Spanish eReputation company, who have been commented on according to their perceived impact on the real world, not by specifically considering their Twitter account, although commenters only looked at users with at least 1,000 followers. The comment is binary: a user is either an influencer or a non-influencer. The data set contains a training set of 2500 users, including 796 influencers, and a test set of 5900 users, including 1563 influencers. It also includes the 600 last tweet IDs of each user at the creep and comment time, representing a total of 4, 379, 621 tweets, or about 750 megabytes of data that can be written in either English or Spanish."}, {"heading": "3.2.2 Evaluation", "text": "The RepLab framework [3] uses the traditional Mean Average Precision (MAP) to evaluate the estimated rankings; the MAP allows the comparison of an ordered vector (output of a submitted method) with a binary reference (manually annotated data); in the case of RepLab, it is calculated independently of the language and separately for each domain. For a given domain, the Mean Average Precision MAP is calculated as follows [12]: MAP = 1n N \u2211 i = 1 P (i) q (i) (1), where N is the total number of users, n the number of correctly detected influencing factors (i.e., true positives), P (i) the precision to rank i (i.e., taking into account the first i-users detected) and q (i) 1 if the influential user is, and 0 otherwise."}, {"heading": "3.2.3 Results", "text": "The UTDBRG group used Trending Topics information, assuming that influencers were mainly tweeting about so-called hot topics [2]. According to official ratings, their proposal achieved the highest MAP for the automotive domain (0.721) and the best average MAP among all participants (0.565). UAMCLYR combined the functions of the user profile and what they call writing behavior (lexical wealth, words and frequency of special characters) using Markov Random Fields [74]. Still from an NLP perspective, ORM _ UNED [51] and LyS [73] examined POS tags as additional features for those extracted from tweet content. LyS also fed a classifier with dictionaries based on specific profiles. Their proposal reached the highest MAP for the banking domain (0.524) and the second average MAP domain for all participants (0.63) based on the assumption that"}, {"heading": "3.2.4 Classification Variant", "text": "Since the reference itself is binary only, the RepLab ordering task can alternatively be considered as a binary classification problem, consisting of deciding whether a user is an influencer or not. However, this was not part of the original challenge. Ramirez et al. [62] has recently proposed a method to address this problem. We will also consider this variant of the problem in this article. To evaluate the classification performance, Ramirez et al. use the F score averaged across both classes, based on the precision and recall processed for each class, which is typical of categorization tasks. This macro averaged F score is calculated as follows: F = 1k-Score et alaged 2 (Pc \u00d7 Rc) Pc + Rc (2), where Pc and Rc are the precision and recall for class c, respectively, and k is the number of classes (for us: 2)."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Scalar Features", "text": "We selected scalar features from each category of Table 1: User Profile (Features 1-5), Publishing Activity (Features 12, 14 and 16), Local Connections (Features 17-19), User Interaction (Features 21-25), Stylistic Traits (Features 33, 36 and 37), and External Data (Features 39 and 40). For Lexical Aspects, as explained in Section 3.3.3, we defined additional scalar features by looking at the number of different locations from which users tweet, and the percentage of geolocalized tweets among his published tweets or bigrams. Some of these features can be edited by multiple descriptors, so we had to make some additional choices. For Feature 16 (Geolocation), we looked at both the number of different locations from which we tweeted and the percentage of geolocalized tweets among his published tweets. Our intuition to consider geolocation-related features was that some users were relative to their activity (some of their sites)."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Term Occurrences", "text": "As mentioned in Section 2, Feature 30 focuses on the lexical aspect of Tweets content. We will now describe the various methods we have used to take advantage of this feature. We will focus on term events composed of only one or two letters, URLs, and average occurrences, i.e. bigrams, in the next step. We defined our term weighting using the classic term frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) approach, combined with the Gini Purity Criterion [71]. We will first present these measures in a generic manner before applying them to our data.The term frequency TFd (i) corresponds to the number of occurrences in the document d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d, d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d, d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d, d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d, d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d"}, {"heading": "3.3.3 Term Cooccurrences", "text": "The tweets were pre-processed in the following ways: the text was reduced to one or two letters, URLs, punctuation marks and stop words (we used simple stop lists to capture all of his tweets); then we processed a matrix in which each pair of words (bigram) appeared one after the other, across all of the tweets he posted; this consisted of representing each user through a document that contained all of his tweets, as we have done in the previous subdivisions, except for the focus on the cocurrencies rather than the operations; the resulting matrix is then referred to as the adjacency matrix of the so-called coccurrence. Each node in this area represents a term, and the weight associates two nodes."}, {"heading": "4 Results and Discussions", "text": "In this section, we present the results we obtained in the RepLab datasets. We first look at the classification task, then the ranking, and finally, we use a more visual approach to illustrate our discussion of predicting offline influence on the characteristics extracted from the Twitter data. We obtained the same behavior for the aspects of the tweets extracted from feature 30 (bigrams), which means that the centralized SVMs we used to characterize the Coocurrence network were not efficient in finding a non-linear separation of our two classes. These results were confirmed by the logistical regressions: none of the trained classifiers did better than the most common class baseline (all users considered non-influential). We also used random forests that gave the same results."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we focused on the problem of user characterization on Twitter, and in particular on the characteristics used in the literature to perform such a classification. We first examined a wide range of characteristics that come from different fields of research (especially social network analaysis, natural language processing and information retrieval), before proposing a new typology of characteristics. We then tackled the problem of identifying and classifying real influencers (a.k.a. offline influencers) based on Twitter-related data, as presented by the RepLab 2014 challenge. For this experimental part, we can highlight two main results: First, we have shown that the classic SNA characteristics used to detect spammers, social capitalists or users do not provide relevant results on this problem. Our second result is the suggestion of an NLP approach, which consists of representing a user under different forms of pocket-of-words."}, {"heading": "A Centrality measures", "text": "In their description we refer to G = (V, E) the considered coexistence graph, where V and E are their nodes and nodes, where the number of nodes in our case can be interpreted as the number of words connected to the word of interest at the same time. Formally, the number of nodes in the neighborhood, i.e. the number of nodes connected to the nodes connected to G. The degree of nodes connected to the nodes in G (u) is the number of nodes, i.e. the number of nodes connected to the nodes, is in G (u).It is a measure of accessibility of other nodes. It is a measure of accessibility (28): Cb (u) The number of nodes connecting to the nodes."}], "references": [{"title": "Homophily and latent attribute inference: Inferring latent attributes of Twitter users from neighbors", "author": ["F.

"abstractText": "Many works related to Twitter aim at characterizing its users in some way: role on the service (spammers, bots, organizations, etc.), nature of the user (socio-professional category, age, etc.), topics of interest, and others. However, for a given user classification problem, it is very difficult to select a set of appropriate features, because the many features described in the literature are very heterogeneous, with name overlaps and collisions, and numerous very close variants. In this article, we review a wide range of such features. In order to present a clear state-of-the-art description, we unify their names, definitions and relationships, and we propose a new, neutral, typology. We then illustrate the interest of our review by applying a selection of these features to the offline influence detection problem. This task consists in identifying users which are influential in real-life, based on their Twitter account and related data. We show that most features deemed efficient to predict online influence, such as the numbers of retweets and followers, are not relevant to this problem. However, we propose several content-based approaches to label Twitter users as Influencers or not. We also rank them according to a predicted influence level. Our proposals are evaluated over the CLEF RepLab 2014 dataset, and outmatch state-of-the-art methods.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
