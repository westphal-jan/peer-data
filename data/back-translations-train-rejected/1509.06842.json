We carry out feature based comparisons of different types of evolutionary algorithms such as evolution strategies, differential evolution and particle swarm optimisation for constrained continuous optimisation. In our study, we examine how sets of constraints influence the difficulty of obtaining close to optimal solutions. Using a multi-objective approach, we evolve constrained continuous problems having a set of linear and/or quadratic constraints where the different evolutionary approaches show a significant difference in performance. Afterwards, we discuss the features of the constraints that exhibit a difference in performance of the different evolutionary approaches under consideration.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Sep 2015 04:30:05 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06842v1", "16 Pagesm 2 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "16 Pagesm 2 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["shayan poursoltan", "frank neumann"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.06842"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.06842.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Feature-Based Comparison of Evolutionary Computing Techniques for Constrained Continuous Optimisation", "authors": ["Shayan Poursoltan"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to go in search of a solution that has its origins in the past."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Constrained continuous optimisation problems", "text": "This study examines limited continuous optimization problems with inequality and equality problems, which are optimization problems where a function f (x) should be optimized with respect to a given set of constraints.Single objective functions f: S \u2192 R with S Rn are considered in this research, the constraints impose a practicable subset F S of search space S, and the goal is to search for x-squared n-quadritic functions that f-square.

One of the most prominent evolutionary algorithms for COPs is conditional differentiated evolution with an archive and a grade-based mutation (\u03b5DEag). The algorithm is the winner of the contest for continuous COPs [6]. \u03b5DEag uses the limited method to transform algorithms for unrestricted problems. It compares them with possible solutions. In other words, the lexicographic order is used to eliminate the restriction to violations (x)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Features of Constraints", "text": "In this paper we analyze the constraint characteristics of generated problem cases.

For this experiment, we perform 30 independent runs that generate simple and hard instances for PSO and ES solvers. It means that the single objective evolutionary only generates instances that are heavy / light for one type of algorithm (PSO, ES and DE). The required function evaluation numbers (FEN) for solving these instances (PSO, ES and DE) are used as fitness values for a single objective evolutionary. Solver parameters are identical to [1, 16, 17]. In addition, we perform our experiments on sphere function (bowl shaped). We have three groups of simple and hard instances generated for DE, ES and PSO algorithms."}, {"heading": "4 Multi-objective Investigations", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive by themselves if they do not play by the rules.

In other words, in Eq.4, a1 contributes more to the problem than a2, since in each constraint there is a standard deviation of 1 to 5 quadratic coefficients, which are more difficult to solve."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we compared the algorithm performance of limited problem cases against each other. We then analyzed the characteristics and characteristics of constraints that make it difficult for certain algorithms, but easy for others to solve. It is observed that some constraint features for certain algorithms contribute more to the difficulty of the problem. In linear constraints, some features such as coefficient relationship, angle, locally optimal feasibility ratio, and shortest distance play an important role in the difficulty of D and ES algorithms. When looking at square instances, the angle does not correlate to the difficulty of the problem. By analyzing how well an algorithm performs in conditions where other algorithms fail, we can derive its strengths and weaknesses from limited problems. These results can help us improve the efficiency of the algorithm prediction model."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Frank Neumann was supported by ARC grants DP130104395 and DP140103400."}], "references": [{"title": "A new optimizer using particle swarm theory", "author": ["R.
