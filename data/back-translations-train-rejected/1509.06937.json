Due to the lack of time available for manual translation, a fully automated translation system is employed, based on a catalogue of predefined phrases and predetermined rules of how these phrases can be combined to produce sentences. Because this catalogue of phrases is limited to a small sublanguage, the system is able to automatically translate such sentences from German into the target languages French, Italian and English without subsequent proofreading or correction. Having been operational for two winter seasons, we assess here the quality of the produced texts based on two different surveys where participants rated texts from real avalanche bulletins from both origins, the catalogue of phrases versus manually written and translated texts. With a mean recognition rate of 55%, users can hardly distinguish between thetwo types of texts, and give very similar ratings with respect to their language quality. Overall, the output from the catalogue system can be considered virtually equivalent to a text written by avalanche forecasters and then manually translated by professional translators. Furthermore, forecasters declared that all relevant situations were captured by the system with sufficient accuracy. Forecaster's working load did not change with the introduction of the catalogue: the extra time to find matching sentences is compensated by the fact that they no longer need to double-check manually translated texts. The reduction of daily translation costs is expected to offset the initial development costs within a few years.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Sep 2015 12:09:07 GMT  (2109kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06937v1", "Extended version of a previous workshop paper (arXiv:1405.6103), accepted for the journal Language Resources and Evaluation, Springer"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version of a previous workshop paper (arXiv:1405.6103), accepted for the journal Language Resources and Evaluation, Springer", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kurt winkler", "tobias kuhn"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.06937"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.06937.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Fully automatic multi-language translation with a catalogue of phrases \u2013 successful employment for the Swiss avalanche bulletin", "authors": ["Kurt Winkler", "Tobias Kuhn"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "KEYWORDS: machine translation, catalogue of phrases, controlled natural language, text quality, avalanche warning adfa, p. 2, 2011. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Apart from the requirements for precise and easy-to-understand language, this part is still very time-critical.

Generally, there are three types of languages that are related to their general purpose: the first are designed to improve translation, and the second are designed to achieve a natural and intuitive representation."}, {"heading": "3 Catalogue-based translation system", "text": "In this section, we present a summary of the methods we have described in a previous paper [18]. By definition, a catalog-based translation system is a collection of predefined phrases (or sentence templates) and therefore cannot be used to translate any sentence. Phrases in our system are created in the source language German, manually translated into the target languages French, Italian, and English, and stored in a database. The editing tool for creating phrases follows an approach similar to conceptual authoring [4, 13]: sentences are created by first selecting a general sentence pattern from a list, and then gradually specifying and expanding the various sentence components. Once a phrase is selected, it is immediately available in the target languages.The individual sentence templates consist of a sequence of different segments (fig. 3). For each segment, authors can select from a pull-down menu of predefined options, which can also consist of a number of subsegments."}, {"heading": "3.1 Creating the phrases in the source language", "text": "In fact, it is a way in which people are able to determine for themselves how they want to behave."}, {"heading": "3.2 Translation of the catalogue", "text": "In our system, translations take place at the segment level. Although German, French, Italian and English are all Indo-European languages, the differences in their grammatical structure, including word order, gender and declension, make segmented translation difficult. Thus, a specific editing and visualization software had to be developed by a translation agency to prepare the phrase translations, and the translations of the segments were then carried out by professional translators who are familiar with the subject and apply our text corpus. In addition to the ubiquitous problem of inflection, correct word order also proved difficult. Other problems were: clicks, apostrophe phases and omissions to avoid Hiatus, especially in French and Italian \"s\" (\"i grandi accumuli,\" but \"gli spessi accumuli\")."}, {"heading": "3.3 Testing the output of the translation catalogue", "text": "Not all possible sentences are meaningful (see, for example, Figs. 3, 5), but all those that make sense in terms of content must be correct in all languages. As proofreading is not possible in operational use, the translations in the catalog must be of high quality, even if the trillions of possibilities cannot be checked individually. Particular attention was paid to the optional segments in which [spaces] can also be selected. Three different quality checks were carried out for each phrase: a sentence generator was created to randomly generate a number of permutations from one phrase; the generated sentences were checked by the translators individually; all options of each segment, sub-segment and sub-segment were checked by the author of the phrase catalog in all four languages one after the other, checking both the correctness of the phrases and the content of the translations. In this check, the translation of the catalog proved to be even more precise in terms of content than the manual translations of the Launch Editor."}, {"heading": "3.4 Operational use", "text": "Since the start of operations, approximately 2,000 hazard descriptions per language have been prepared. As before, the hazard descriptions in German were reviewed and discussed by at least two avalanche warning systems. After the content of the German text was found to be correct, approximately 150 different products (online, app and print products including regional hazard maps - they all contain the same hazard descriptions) were created and published automatically [16] for each issue of the bulletin, including the publication of automatically translated texts without any further proofreading or correction. Fortunately, the new system shortens the time between the last possible change in the hazard description (in the original German language) and the time of its publication in all four languages from about one hour to a few minutes. The automated generation makes the avalanche bulletin highly dependent on the technical systems. Fortunately, the catalogue of phrases proved to be very stable: in the first two seasons of operational use, only 1 out of approximately 8,000 hazard descriptions were not made available to the public."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation of the accuracy with regard to content", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Method", "text": "In order to analyze the usability of the phrase catalog, we first had to measure the accuracy with which avalanche forecasters can describe the different avalanche situations under operational conditions. We considered several possible methods to assess the accuracy of our system. We realized that comparing the real avalanche situation, if it were known, with the description in the bulletin would be more a measure of the prediction quality than the possibilities offered by the phrase catalog. Also, rewriting old avalanche bulletins is not enough, because it ignores the fact that corresponding sentences not only have to be available, but also have to be found by the responsible avalanche forecasters within a reasonable time. Writing an avalanche bulletin under operational conditions always involves stress and time pressure and cannot be simulated in a scientific study. Furthermore, in old hazard descriptions, it is always somewhat unclear which part of the content has been accurately selected."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results", "text": "The differences in what the forecasters wanted to write and what they could write with the catalogue were often so small that six out of seven forecasters stated that the differences were \"almost always\" due to uncertainty about what they knew about the actual situation. Four forecasters said that users would never notice a difference in the original idea of writing and the text that was effectively written with the catalogue of phrases, while the others replied that \"almost always\" users did not notice a difference. On the other hand, two forecasters had \"minor but noticeable limitations\" from time to time, while this happened only \"very rarely\" to the other five forecasters. \"Major limitations\" or inaccurate descriptions never occurred. All forecasters of the avalanche rated their satisfaction with the best-grade catalogue (\"excellent\"). Our decision to build a system based on a multiple catalogue for a good season was \"mainly.\""}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation of the quality of the texts", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Method", "text": "How can the linguistic quality of an avalanche warning be measured? The linguistic quality, as we use it here, includes aspects of grammatical correctness, clarity of expression and intelligibility. In terms of content, we simply asked the forecasters by questionnaire. In terms of language quality, we could have asked professional linguists, but the question remains whether it really is a language that is spoken and understood by customers of avalanche warnings, that is, backcountry tourers and freeriders. For this reason, we have decided to consult the users of the avalanche bulletin directly and analyze their ratings statistically. Since language quality is a fairly subjective issue, we have taken a comparative approach in which users can evaluate manually written texts and texts from our catalog in two different surveys."}, {"heading": "5.2 Setup of survey 1", "text": "The main objectives of the first survey were to monitor users \"opinions on the Avalanche Bulletin in general and to evaluate the changes made by the new Avalanche Bulletin [20]. In this survey, we also asked two questions on language quality (Tab. 3). The survey was published from 18 February to 5 March 2014 on www.slf.ch, the website of the Swiss Avalanche Warning Service. Questions on language quality were not mandatory, and after filtering out respondents who did not seem to take the survey seriously (e.g. mountain guides under 20 years of age or without experience or participants who always received the top grade), we found 2313 respondents who answered both questions. 83% of them were men and the average age was 42 years. The number of responses per language well reflects the proportion of visits to our website (Tab. 4), with the exception of English respondents who were underrepresented in the survey (p < 0.001)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Setup of survey 2", "text": "In the second survey, we compared texts from old, manually written and translated hazard descriptions with new hazard descriptions from the catalogue. This survey was a blind study and contained only questions relating to language quality. In order to obtain a comparable sentence, we chose a hazard description from the evening edition of the avalanche bulletin from early December to the end of March. The descriptions from the catalogue were taken from the 2012 / 13 winter season, the freely written descriptions from the winter 2011 / 12 editions back to 2007 / 08. To avoid evaluating texts that were too short, we used only hazard descriptions with more than 100 characters in German. On days with more than one hazard description, we randomly chose one of them. Since 120 descriptions per language are too many for a survey, we divided them into 6 different sentences, each containing 10 descriptions from the old and new bulletin."}, {"heading": "5.4 Analysis", "text": "To analyze the rate of recognition of the origin (i.e. manual or automatic creation) of a description within a language, the data was summarized in cross tables and the chi-square statistics were calculated. All differences between categorical variables were tested for statistical significance using the Mann-Whitney U test (with p = 0.05). Comparing the language quality of freely written texts with those from the phrase catalog, we could only detect differences in individual cases by using common parameters for ordinary data as median or mode. Since we did not want to conclude that there was no difference at all, we assumed that the predefined answers were the same in distance, and assigned numerical values to the different categories, starting with 5 for the best rating and 1 for the worst. We used these numerical values only to calculate averages to show differences between different languages and between the origins of the descriptions."}, {"heading": "5.5 Results", "text": "Table 7 shows the answers of the survey 1. The linguistic quality of the hazard descriptions (taken from the catalogue) is rated better than the conventionally written and manually translated section \"Snowpack and Weather.\" This effect can be found in all languages, but is significant only in German due to the larger number of participants. In survey 2, evaluators determined the origin of a given text in 59% of the German descriptions (Tab. 8). In the target languages, the recognition rate was lower: 55% in French and 52% in Italian and English. Significantly better than randomly, the recognition rate was only for German and French.Table 9 shows the answers to the questions about the actual origin of the hazard descriptions. The differences between old and new descriptions are small and vary from language to language. Table 10 shows the text length of the hazard descriptions used in the survey. German as the source language shows the shortest lengths for both types of texts."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to move to a different world in which they are able than to another world in which they are able to escape, in which they are able to escape."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "The catalogue system proved to be well suited for generating the Swiss avalanche bulletin. After two years of operational use, all forecasters declared that it was possible to describe the various avalanche situations with high precision and efficiency within the limited time available. It also proved to be well suited for translating the old avalanche signs into the target languages French, Italian and English."}, {"heading": "8 Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank Martin B\u00e4chtold from www.ttn.ch and his translators for the courage to translate the catalogue of phrases and for maintaining such a high standard of quality.
