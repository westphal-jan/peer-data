While most current ANN models are based on simplified brain dynamics, spiking neurons are able to simulate a broad (and more realistic) range of learning and spiking dynamics observed in biological neurons, such as: spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) [16], long-term potency, tonic and phasic spike, interspike delay (latency), frequency adjustment, resonance, input adjustment [10]."}, {"heading": "2 Methodology", "text": "This serves as a platform for the construction and testing of neural circuit typologies; the machine is constructed within the framework of integrate-and-fire models [6, 10] that to some extent mimic the phenomenological dynamics of neurons while abstracting the underlying biophysical processes; the model implemented does not aim to include all the dynamics found in biological models; it is not suitable for precise biological simulations; and since there are already robust and scalable tools to simulate large populations of spiking neurons with complex dynamics, the model presented here is an SNN motor for the rapid prototyping of simple neural circuits and for experiments with small populations of SNDP."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "At the beginning of the training phase (Figure 5 on the left), the insect moves along the virtual world, colliding indiscriminately with all types of spots, repositioning the insect to its initial coordinates each time it reaches the boundaries of the virtual world. As the training phase progresses, it can be seen that the trajectories lengthen as the insect learns to associate the red and white spots with harmful stimuli and thus avoid them (see Figure 8 on the right). After about 15,000 iterations, the insect moves without collisions and avoids completely red and black spots when foraging (green spots). The artificial insect is able to move without collisions after about 15,000 iterations of the simulation, a number that depends on the parameters of neural dynamics set for the circuit and the STDP learning rule. Table 1 shows the learning behavior related to iterations required for collision-free movement, using different values for the learning units to activate the constant A and 3 (to potentiate the learning dynamics)."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "SNNs mimic their biological counterparts in several ways, but perhaps their most relevant feature is their ability to use spatio-temporal information for communication and computing purposes in a similar way to biological neurons. Although some traditional ANNs can incorporate temporal dynamics through the explicit use of recurring connections, the inherent notion of time in the nature of SNNs naturally makes them closer to the biologically observed units. This makes the dynamics of SNNs more plausible than those of traditional ANNs. SNNs become very efficient because they are able to replace large ensembles of traditional ANNs, making them very suitable for use in situations where high performance and low power consumption are important. In robotics, this is of particular interest as reducing power consumption and increasing computing power means greater autonomy and performance in situations where robots operate in real or near-real time."}], "references": [{"title": "Simulator for neural networks and action potentials", "author": ["D.A.
