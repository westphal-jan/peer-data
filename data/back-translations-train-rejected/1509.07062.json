A coalition is simply a subset of players N. One can imagine the players useful to form teams that will work together.

Thus, ij and ji refer to the same symbol of coalition structures on N and the informal meaning of ij is \"i and j are in the same coalition.\" Formally, the formulas of the language LN, with typical element given by the following grammars."}, {"heading": "4 Boolean Hedonic Games", "text": "The conceptualization of a formula for our propositional game is a series of coalition structures, and we can of course interpret these as the desirable or satisfactory coalition structures for a particular player. (...) Instead of presenting a hedonic game with dichotomous preferences as a structure (N, R1,.., Rn) in which we explicitly list preference relationships between player and player, we can instead present a hedonic game with dichotomous preferences as a formula of our propositional language that functions as a specification of the preference relationship Ri. Intuitively, it represents the preference relationship between player i and player i when its goal is achieved and is dissatisfied when he is not satisfied. We refer to a structure (N, R1,.,.) as a Boolean hedonic game."}, {"heading": "5 Substitution and Deviation", "text": "We establish a formal link between substitution in formulas of our language and the possibility of players who deviate from their respective coalitions and join other coalitions.

(Let's also say that f is a characterization of each Boolean hedonic game G for N and each partition G, then f is a polynomial characterization of the game G, if and only if there is f (G). (In addition, there is a polynomial p that there is such a characterization that f (G) is a polynomial characterization of the game G.) Once we have a characterization of the game, we know that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the partitions of N and the models of f (G)."}, {"heading": "7 Related Work and Conclusions", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it will only be once before there is such a process, in which there is such a process."}], "references": [{"title": "Pareto optimality in coalition formation", "author": ["H.

However, the logic used to specific player\u2019s goals in the work of Dunne et al. was not intended for specifying desirable coalition structures, as we have done in the present paper. Our work also shares some common ground with the work of Bonzon et al. (2012), who study the formation of efficient coalitions in Boolean games, that is, coalitions whose joint abilities allow their members to jointly achieve their goals. Our work also bears some resemblance to the work of Elkind and Wooldridge (2009), who were interested in using logic as a foundation upon which to build a compact representation scheme for hedonic games; more precisely, their work made use of weighted Boolean formulas, and was inspired by themarginal contribution nets representation for cooperative games in characteristic function form proposed byIeong and Shoham (2005). The focus of Elkind and Wooldridge (2009), however, was more on complexity issues than in finding exact characterisations for solution concepts.", "startOffset": 202, "endOffset": 1242}], "year": 2015, "abstractText": "We study hedonic games with dichotomous preferences. Hedonic games are cooperative games in which players desire to form coalitions, but only care about the makeup of the coalitions of which they are members; they are indifferent about the makeup of other coalitions. The assumption of dichotomous preferences means that, additionally, each player\u2019s preference relation partitions the set of coalitions of which that player is a member into just two equivalence classes: satisfactory and unsatisfactory. A player is indifferent between satisfactory coalitions, and is indifferent between unsatisfactory coalitions, but strictly prefers any satisfactory coalition over any unsatisfactory coalition. We develop a succinct representation for such games, in which each player\u2019s preference relation is represented by a propositional formula. We show how solution concepts for hedonic games with dichotomous preferences are characterised by propositional formulas.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
