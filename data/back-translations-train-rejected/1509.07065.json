The available well logs along with the 3-D seismic data have been used to benchmark the proposed pre-processing stage using a methodology which primarily consists of three steps: pre-processing, training and post-processing. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with conjugate-gradient learning algorithm has been used to model the sand fraction. The available sand fraction data from the high resolution well logs has far more information content than the low resolution seismic attributes. Therefore, regularization schemes based on Fourier Transform (FT), Wavelet Decomposition (WD) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) have been proposed to shape the high resolution sand fraction data for effective machine learning. The input data sets have been segregated into training, testing and validation sets. The test results are primarily used to check different network structures and activation function performances. Once the network passes the testing phase with an acceptable performance in terms of the selected evaluators, the validation phase follows. In the validation stage, the prediction model is tested against unseen data. The network yielding satisfactory performance in the validation stage is used to predict lithological properties from seismic attributes throughout a given volume. Finally, a post-processing scheme using 3-D spatial filtering is implemented for smoothing the sand fraction in the volume. Prediction of lithological properties using this framework is helpful for Reservoir Characterization.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Sep 2015 17:15:21 GMT  (2498kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07065v1", "13 pages, volume 8, no 4, pp. 1808-1820, April 2015 in IEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, volume 8, no 4, pp. 1808-1820, April 2015 in IEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.LG", "authors": ["soumi chaki", "aurobinda routray", "william k mohanty"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.07065"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.07065.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "enriched\u2013formations by characterization of each layer in the borehole is of enormous importance to the explorers", "authors": ["Soumi Chaki"], "emails": ["soumibesu2008@gmail.com,", "aroutray@ee.iitkgp.ernet.in)."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "II.

to improve the prediction of sand fraction from multiple seismic attributes such as seismic impedance, amplitude and frequency using machine learning and information filtering. The available well logs along with the 3-D seismic data have been used to benchmark the proposed pre-processing stage using a methodology which primarily consists of three steps: preprocessing, training and post-processing. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with conjugate-gradient learning algorithm has been used to model the sand fraction. The available sand fraction data from the high resolution well logs has far more information content than the low resolution seismic attributes. Therefore, regularization schemes based on Fourier Transform (FT), Wavelet Decomposition (WD) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) have been proposed to shape the high resolution sand fraction data for effective machine learning. The input data sets have been segregated into training, testing and validation sets. The test results are primarily used to check different network structures and activation function performances. Once the network passes the testing phase with an acceptable performance in terms of the selected evaluators, the validation phase follows. In the validation stage, the prediction model is tested against unseen data. The network yielding satisfactory performance in the validation stage is used to predict lithological properties from seismic attributes throughout a given volume. Finally, a post-processing scheme using 3-D spatial filtering is implemented for smoothing the sand fraction in the volume. Prediction of lithological properties using this framework is helpful for Reservoir Characterization.", "creator": null}}}
