Input dataset includes 3D post-stacked seismic attributes and six well logs acquired from a hydrocarbon field located in the western coast of India. Presence of thin sand and shale layers in the basin area makes the modeling of reservoir characteristic a challenging task. Though seismic data is helpful in extrapolation of reservoir properties away from boreholes; yet, it could be challenging to delineate thin sand and shale reservoirs using seismic data due to its limited resolvability. Therefore, it is important to develop state-of-art intelligent methods for calibrating a nonlinear mapping between seismic data and target reservoir variables. Neural networks have shown its potential to model such nonlinear mappings; however, uncertainties associated with the model and datasets are still a concern. Hence, introduction of Fuzzy Logic (FL) is beneficial for handling these uncertainties. More specifically, hybrid variants of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and fuzzy logic, i.e., NF methods, are capable for the modeling reservoir characteristics by integrating the explicit knowledge representation power of FL with the learning ability of neural networks. The documented results in this study demonstrate acceptable resemblance between target and predicted variables, and hence, encourage the application of integrated machine learning approaches such as Neuro-Fuzzy in reservoir characterization domain. Furthermore, visualization of the variation of sand probability in the study area would assist in identifying placement of potential wells for future drilling operations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Sep 2015 17:48:24 GMT  (530kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07074v1", "Journal of Applied Geophysics, volume 111, page 141-155"]], "COMMENTS": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, volume 111, page 141-155", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.AI", "authors": ["akhilesh k verma", "soumi chaki", "aurobinda routray", "william k mohanty", "mamata jenamani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.07074"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.07074.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Quantification of sand fraction from seismic attributes using Neuro-Fuzzy approach", "authors": ["Akhilesh K.

Modeling of sand fraction from seismic attributes", "text": "In this paper, the modelling of the sand fraction is performed using three seismic attributes (seismic impedance, seismic amplitude, and instantaneous frequency) using the Neuro-Fuzzy approach with three different inference systems. These fuzzy inference system structures are based on grid, subtractive clustering, or FCM clustering of the dataset by extracting a set of rules from the available data patterns. Applying these nonlinear mapping techniques to the real data requires several pre-, modeling, and post-processing steps, including data integration, resampling, normalization, learning, and validation, followed by post-processing."}, {"heading": "4.1 Integration of seismic and well log data (re-sampling)", "text": "Integrating data from various sources with heuristic knowledge from human experts is the critical step in the reservoir characterization (Nikravesh, 2004).The task is to combine seismic attributes at each available borehole site with the lithological characteristics.Therefore, we first extract seismic values at six borehole sites from the seismic data cube. Seismic attributes are presented in the time domain, whereas log data along the depth is well encoded into time.The sampling rates of these two types of signals are different.The sampling rate interval of the band-delimited seismic signals X is performed using appropriate velocity profiles resulting from well-to-seismic connections.After converting the borehole protocols from the depth to the time domain, we will find that the sampling rates of these two types of signals are different."}, {"heading": "4.3 Data division", "text": "In most non-linear statistical modelling approaches, it is customary to divide data sets into training and test patterns for learning and validation. In the present study, data sets from six boreholes are used to model the property of the reservoir, i.e. seismic attributes and target data from sand fractions. Combined data sets from six boreholes are divided into two parts, i.e. training and testing; 70% of the data has been used for training and 30% is used for testing. Data is divided by random sample selection (S\u00e4rndal, et al., 2003). Scatter plots representing a low correlation between predictors (seismic attributes) and target protocols (sandstone) are presented in the previous section. Learning from the available training samples is governed by training algorithms, with interference between inputs and targets heuristically determined."}, {"heading": "4.5 Post processing and visualization", "text": "Predicted sand fraction values throughout the study area show scattered deviations. It may be due to much variation or discontinuity in the distribution of the sand reservoirs. Therefore, a smoothing of the blindly predicted sand fractus is required. In reality, the petrophysical properties at depth cannot change abruptly from a very high value to a lower one and vice versa. The transition must be as smooth as possible. To take this reasoning into account, we filter the predicted values through a 2-D mean filter (Huang et al., 1979). We treat each of the inline as an image and maintain a 2-D mean filter algorithm over it. A 3x5 window is selected that slides over the image from left to right. The window corresponding to each sample point looks at the other points that take the intersection of two closest cross lines and four deep sections. Visualization of the post-processed data is assessed in the form of Slices.The performance of the pre-sampling method can be assessed based on many saysms."}, {"heading": "5.

Input dataset includes 3D post-stacked seismic attributes and six well logs acquired from a hydrocarbon field located in the western coast of India. Presence of thin sand and shale layers in the basin area makes the modeling of reservoir characteristic a challenging task. Though seismic data is helpful in extrapolation of reservoir properties away from boreholes; yet, it could be challenging to delineate thin sand and shale reservoirs using seismic data due to its limited resolvability. Therefore, it is important to develop state-of-art intelligent methods for calibrating a nonlinear mapping between seismic data and target reservoir variables. Neural networks have shown its potential to model such nonlinear mappings; however, uncertainties associated with the model and datasets are still a concern. Hence, introduction of Fuzzy Logic (FL) is beneficial for handling these uncertainties. More specifically, hybrid variants of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and fuzzy logic, i.e., NF methods, are capable for the modeling reservoir characteristics by integrating the explicit knowledge representation power of FL with the learning ability of neural networks. In this paper, we opt for ANN and three different categories of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based on clustering of the available datasets. A comparative analysis of these three different NF models (i.e., Sugenotype fuzzy inference systems using a grid partition on the data (Model 1), using subtractive clustering (Model 2), and using Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering (Model 3)) and ANN suggests that Model 3 has outperformed its counterparts in terms of performance evaluators on the present dataset. Performances of the selected algorithms are evaluated in terms of correlation coefficients (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), absolute error mean (AEM) and scatter index (SI) between target and predicted sand fraction values. The achieved estimation accuracy may diverge minutely depending on geological characteristics of a particular study area. The 2 documented results in this study demonstrate acceptable resemblance between target and predicted variables, and hence, encourage the application of integrated machine learning approaches such as Neuro-Fuzzy in reservoir characterization domain. Furthermore, visualization of the variation of sand probability in the study area would assist in identifying placement of potential wells for future drilling operations.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
