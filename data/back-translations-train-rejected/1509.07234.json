In a recent study [25], typical artifacts in in vivo neural records are divided into four types (type 0 to 3, see section 2.2 and figure 3 in [25]).This classification includes many artifacts in the scope of human brain activity records, e.g. the type of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG).In this paper, we look at the suppression of type 0 and type 1 artifacts. For the purpose of flexibility and generality, we redefine them in terms of morphological characteristics: \u2022 Type 0: a smooth protuberance that can be modelled as x (t) when t > t0 and type 1 artifacts (type 1: an abrupt jump followed by an exponential decay) that follows as x."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related works", "text": "Some recent work uses transients to recover from different algorithms. In [19], a slowly varying signal is modeled as a local polynomial and an optimization problem with Tikhonov regularization to capture it.

Instead of estimating the slowly varying component using regularization, the LPF / TVD method estimates a low-pass component through LTI filtering and a piecewise constant component through optimization. In this case, an optimization problem is formulated to estimate the piecewise constant component through regulation."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Notation", "text": "We use bold uppercase letters for matrices, e.g. A and B, and bold lowercase letters for vectors, e.g. x and y.

It is formulated as an optimization problem regulated by a differentiated and smooth tightening function. The second algorithm is an extension of ETEA, using a higher order recursive filter applicable to the correction of continuous protuberance transients (type 0) and irregular artifacts. As applications, we have shown that ETEA with different regulators (R and R2) are suitable for the suppression of type 1 artifacts in ECoG data and ocular artifacts (OA) (as sequential type 0 artifacts) in conventional EEG data.

In biomedical time series analysis, e.g., in vivo neural recording and electrocorticography (ECoG), some measurement artifacts take the form of piecewise exponential transients. The proposed method is formulated as an unconstrained convex optimization problem, regularized by smoothed l1-norm penalty function, which can be solved by majorization-minimization (MM) method. With a slight modification of the regularizer, ETEA can also suppress more irregular piecewise smooth artifacts, especially, ocular artifacts (OA) in electroencephalography (EEG) data. Examples of synthetic signal, EEG data, and ECoG data are presented to illustrate the proposed algorithms.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
