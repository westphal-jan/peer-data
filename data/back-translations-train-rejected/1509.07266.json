RELATED WORK", "text": "We will next discuss some of the relevant papers that demonstrate this fact. Polat et al. [12] proposed a hybrid model for the classification of multi-class data sets. Separate models based on the C4.5 Decision Tree algorithm were constructed for each class and the class for which the model is built was given positive class labelling and the rest of the classes were assigned negative class labelling. The proposed model showed a significant improvement in performance compared to the traditional C4.5 Decision Tree based Model. To optimize the data sets, classification accuracy can be improved, some other methods such as homogeneity-based algorithm (HBA) etc. were proposed by Pham et al. This algorithm was used in conjunction with standard classification algorithms as SVM, DT and ANN to improve their performance. The four parameters of HBA were then optimized by genetic algorithms."}, {"heading": "III. PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "In this section, we outline the details of our proposed approach to creating decision trees based on the correlation."}, {"heading": "A. Overview of Correlation Ratio", "text": "Sometimes the expected result of our learning algorithm is some categorical values such as \"yes / no.\" The correlation coefficient method is suitable for applications where the result is quantitative, so it cannot be applied in cases where a categorical result is desired. To solve this problem, the CR [11] method can be used. The CR method can be used to divide the sample data set into different categories depending on the result observed. A significant attribute is one that can identify at least one result class in which the average value of the attribute and the average of all classes are remarkably different, otherwise this attribute would not be useful to identify any result. Table I provides a summary of the various notations used in our proposed approach and the corresponding meanings. Suppose that there are a number of \"tuples\" in a dataset in which the average of all classes is remarkably different."}, {"heading": "B. Example for Computation of Correlation Ratio", "text": "The calculation of CR can be illustrated by the following example, in which we considered a data set (shown in Table II) of 15 patients of different ages - teenager, middle-aged, old and the class attribute (Y) for the data set as age group. Values of the attribute age group (Y) for these different patient sets are referred to as y if y is teenager, middle-aged, old. Leave the i attribute (where i = 1) in the data set is BP. Values of the attribute blood pressure (BP) for these different patient sets are referred to as: For y = teenager, steenager = (x (i) jy); j = 1, \u00b7 \u2212 \u2212 \u00b7, 5 = 60, 75 \u2212 70, 80, 65 (BP values of 5 teenagers) For y = (x (i) jy = (x), for middle-aged patients = (x), for middle-aged patients (x), 4 = 100, \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 for 5 teens = (\u2212 765) For middle-age = (x) 785 = (x), for middle-aged patients (x), 4 = \u2212 785 = (\u2212 7y), for middle-age = 7y (x)."}, {"heading": "C.

Result and Analysis", "text": "Next, we applied our proposed technique to the datasets discussed in subsection IV-A. Table V shows that for Pima Indian Diabetes, Mammography and Breast Cancer datasets the IG-based approach is slightly better than CR-based approach. For two of these datasets (Pima Indian Diabetes, Breast Cancer) there are more number of attributes and all the attributes have the same number of different values. One dataset (Mammography) has different numbers of different values for the attributes but fewer number of attributes. For the SPect Heart dataset both IG and CR approaches have given the same performance (74.33% accuracy). This dataset also has the same number of different values for all attributes and has many attributes compared to the number of attributes. For the post-operative patient datasets, both approaches have given 62.96% accuracy. The reason behind the not-good performance associations is the fact that there are less."}, {"heading": "V.
