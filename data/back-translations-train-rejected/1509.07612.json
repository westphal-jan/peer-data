It has been shown to generate practical value for a variety of applications such as revenue forecasting (Asur and Huberman, 2010), stock market forecasting (Bollen et al., 2011) or political debate analysis (Diakopoulos and Shamma, 2010). Twitter sentiment analysis refers to the task of assigning a sentiment label to a tweet either positive or negative and is an integral part of many practical applications. Few methods consider it neutral as a third class. However, defining a neutral class is a difficult task. Pak and Paroubek (2010), for example, call tweets from popular news sites neutral. This assumption is not always true. The headline \"Several children were killed in the attack.\" would be considered negative by most people. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach to this problem."}, {"heading": "2 The State of the Art and Its Shortcomings", "text": "SemEval-2014 Task 9 (Rosenthal et al., 2014) provides a widely used state-of-the-art benchmark for1http: / / project2.cs.uos.de / TweeDOSTwitter Sentiment Analysis and compares the performance of many current approaches. Popular topics were extracted from a data set collected from January 2012 to January 2013 by identifying frequently mentioned entities. Only tweets that exceed a certain polarity threshold determined by a mood lexicon were taken into account to ensure the inclusion of an emotion. Labels included in the data set are positive, negative and neutral, determined by a majority of five labellers who were told that they should vote for the feeling they perceive as strongest in case of doubt, thus assigning tweets to the positive and negative classes that do not bear a unique mood. Methods that perform well on this data set show that they can differentiate between positive and negative moods, that they are more likely to be positively positively positioned in this situation, and that they may be more likely to be positively positively positively positioned in the assumption that all of these moods are below."}, {"heading": "3 A General Purpose Dataset", "text": "In the analysis of the change of mind, we are interested in the \"electronic words of mouth\" (Jansen et al., 2009), i.e. the personal opinions of private Twitter users. While labeling tweets, we have noticed that a relatively high percentage of tweets are sentiment, advertising or marketing messages that do not interest us. These tweets are called spam. Furthermore, it became apparent that only a small fraction of the remaining tweets can be labeled as positive or negative. The remaining tweets can still include polarity and may contain Ofenar Xiv: 150 9.07 612v 1 [cs.C] 25 Sep 2015 not be labeled while they are not labeled positive or negative. Therefore, we propose the new category as uncertain. Tweets are labeled neutral as they do not provide additional information for sensor analysis and can be treated as tweets."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion and Outlook", "text": "When analyzing Twitter's public livestream in terms of sentiment, it must be borne in mind that more than half of the tweets cannot be attributed to a particular mood, and these tweets must be filtered or explicitly treated before any mood analysis takes place. Furthermore, one must deal with spam tweets. Spam adds unwanted noises by polluting topics with artificially injected tweets. Most of the spam detection work on Twitter focuses on catching the users who generate the spam by looking at the behavior of the accounts over time (Grier et al., 2010; Lin and Huang, 2013). In real-time analysis, a particular tweet must be detected as spam by looking at its content and metadata just because there is no time to examine the author's account in detail. New methods must be developed that are able to deal with emotional uncertainty and spam if reliable representations of public opinion are to be derived from the Twitter stream."}], "references": [{"title": "Predicting the future with social media", "author": ["Asur", "Huberman2010] Sitaram Asur", "Bernardo A Huberman"], "venue": "In 2010 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT),", "citeRegEx": "Asur et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Asur et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Twitter mood predicts the stock market", "author": ["Bollen et al.2011] Johan Bollen", "Huina Mao", "Xiaojun Zeng"], "venue": "Journal of Computational Science,", "citeRegEx": "Bollen et al\\.,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bollen et al\\.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Characterizing debate performance via aggregated twitter", "author": ["Diakopoulos", "David A Shamma"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Diakopoulos et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Diakopoulos et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Measuring nominal scale agreement among many raters", "author": ["Joseph L Fleiss"], "venue": "Psychological bulletin,", "citeRegEx": "Fleiss.,? \\Q1971\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Fleiss.", "year": 1971}, {"title": "spam: the underground on 140 characters or less", "author": ["Grier et al.2010] Chris Grier", "Kurt Thomas", "Vern Paxson", "Michael Zhang"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,", "citeRegEx": "Grier et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Grier et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Twitter power: Tweets as electronic word of mouth", "author": ["Mimi Zhang", "Kate Sobel", "Abdur Chowdury"], "venue": "Journal of the American society for information science and technology,", "citeRegEx": "Jansen et al\\.,? \\Q2009\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Jansen et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "The measurement of observer agreement for categorical data", "author": ["Landis", "Koch1977] J Richard Landis", "Gary G Koch"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Landis et al\\.,? \\Q1977\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Landis et al\\.", "year": 1977}, {"title": "A study of effective features for detecting long-surviving twitter spam accounts", "author": ["Lin", "Huang2013] Po-Ching Lin", "Po-Min Huang"], "venue": "In Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT),", "citeRegEx": "Lin et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Lin et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Twitter as a corpus for sentiment analysis and opinion mining", "author": ["Pak", "Paroubek2010] Alexander Pak", "Patrick Paroubek"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Language Resources,", "citeRegEx": "Pak et al\\.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Pak et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Semeval-2014 task 9: Sentiment analysis in twitter", "author": ["Alan Ritter", "Preslav Nakov", "Veselin Stoyanov"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval", "citeRegEx": "Rosenthal et al\\.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Rosenthal et al\\.", "year": 2014}], "referenceMentions": [{"referenceID": 1, "context": "For a multitude of applications such as sales prediction (Asur and Huberman, 2010), stock market prediction (Bollen et al., 2011) or political debate analysis (Diakopoulos and Shamma, 2010) it has been shown to generate practical value.", "startOffset": 108, "endOffset": 129}, {"referenceID": 1, "context": "For a multitude of applications such as sales prediction (Asur and Huberman, 2010), stock market prediction (Bollen et al., 2011) or political debate analysis (Diakopoulos and Shamma, 2010) it has been shown to generate practical value.
