The inter-annotator agreement on the tweets with emojis is higher. Emojis tend to occur at the end of the tweets, and their sentiment polarity increases with the distance.

It allows the author to express his feelings, feelings and emotions and expands a written message with non-verbal elements. It helps to attract the attention of the reader and improves the understanding of the message. However, an emoji is a step forward, developed with modern communication technologies that allow expressive messages in which a graphic symbol, an ideogram that represents not only facial expressions, but also concepts and ideas, such as the weather, vehicles and buildings, animals and plants, or emotions, feelings and activists that have become extremely popular on smartphones, in chats and email applications. For example, Instagram, a mobile photo sharing and a social networking platform reported in March 2015, is that almost half of texts on Instagram contain emojis [1]."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Emoji sentiment lexicon", "text": "A large pool of tweets, in 13 European languages, is therefore often referred to as emoji by 83 native speakers. Emojis can take one of three ordered values: negative, neutral, positive. An emoji label, c, is formally a discrete, 3-valid variable c emoji (emoji number) {\u2212 1, 0, + 1}. An emoji is associated with a feeling from all tweets in which it occurs. First, we form a discrete probability distribution (p \u2212, p0, p +) for each emoji. The emoji's sentiment value is then calculated as the mean of the distribution. The components of the distribution: p \u2212, p0, and p + denote the negativity, neutrality and positivity of the emoji. The probability that we estimate a PC based on the number of occurrences, N, the emoji value in tweets labeled c."}, {"heading": "Emoji sentiment map", "text": "Before analyzing the characteristics of tweets with emojis, we will first discuss two visualizations of Emoji Sentiment Ranking. Figure 2 shows the general map of 751 emojis. The position of an emoji is determined by its tweets, while the negative tweets are on the left side of the tweet (red). The sentiment score s is in the range (-1, + 1) and is calculated as p + \u2212 p. The more positive emojis are on the right side of the map (green), while the negative tweets are on the left side (red). Neutral emojis (yellow) span an entire band around s = 0. Emojis are predominantly positive, the mean sentiment score is + 0.3 (see Fig 4). The bubble is proportional to the number of tweets occurring. A more detailed view of some actual emotions on the map is in Fig 3. The most common negative emojis (Panel A) are sad faces."}, {"heading": "Sentiment distribution", "text": "In this subsection, we analyze the mood distribution of emojis in terms of the frequency of their use. The question we raise is: Are the more commonly used emojis emotionally stressed? First, in Figure 4, we show the mood distribution of the 751 emojis, regardless of their frequency. It is obvious that the mood value of the emojis is roughly normally distributed, with mean = + 0.3, predominantly positive. In Figure 5, we evaluate the emojis by the number of occurrences in tweets. The mood value of each emoji is indicated by the color. The zoomed-in section of the first 33 emojis in Figure 6. We did not carefully analyze the frequency distribution of the emojis. A quick analysis suggests that the data follow a power law with an exponential cutoff to rank about 200.

Emoticons such as: -) are used sparingly and typically at the very end of a sentence. Emojis, on the other hand, appear in groups and not just at the end of tweets. Figure 7 shows the average position of the 751 emojis in tweets. On average, an emoji is placed at 2 / 3 of the length of a tweet. Figure 7 also shows the mood of an emoji in relation to its position. In Figure 8, we break down the feeling into its three components and show regression trend lines. The linear regression functions in Figure 8 take the following forms: Negativity: p \u2212 (d) = 0.20d + 0.03 (R 2 = 0.06), Neutrality: p0 (d) = \u2212 0.41d + 0.66 (R2 = 0.14), Positivity: p + (d) = 0.21 d + 0.04), where d is the distance from the beginning of the tweet."}, {"heading": "Emojis in different languages", "text": "In the last subsection, we analyze the use of emojis in the 13 languages processed in this study. Can Emoji Sentiment Ranking be considered a universal resource, at least for the European languages? Does the sentiment ranking differ significantly between the different languages? The results in Table 5 indicate that the answer to the second question is negative. For each language, we compute a list of emojis used in the language's collected tweets, truncate emojis with less than 5 occurrences (the same threshold as for the entire Emoji Sentiment Ranking) and calculate their sentiment score. We calculate the correlation coefficients between the Emoji Sentiment Ranking and the individual languages. As shown in Table 5, the number of emojis actually used in different languages (above the threshold) decreases considerably. However, their sentiment scores and ranking remain stable. Both the correlation between the Emoji Sentiment Ranking and the ranking of the album correlation between all languages are relatively high and exceptionally high."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we describe the construction of an emoji sentiment lexicon, emoji sentiment ranking, the first such resource to be openly available. We have thoroughly formalized and analyzed the sentiment characteristics of emojis, and highlighted some interesting conclusions. Data that enabled this analysis, 1.6 million commented tweets in 13 different languages, are a valuable resource with many other useful applications. In particular, we construct sentiment classification models for different languages and apply them to different tasks. Slovenian and Bulgarian language sentiment models have already been applied to monitor sentiment on Twitter in real time during political elections [27]. The English sentiment model has been used to compare the sentiment leanings of different retweeted network communities toward various environmental issues [28]. A domain-specific English sentiment model (from another set of financial tweets) has been applied to analyze the impact of Twitter sentiment on stock prices [29]."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Data collection", "text": "The main source of data used in this study is a collection of tweets in 13 European languages collected between April 2013 and February 2015.

Tweets from selected languages were collected via the Twitter Search API by specifying the geolocations of the largest cities. For English tweets, we used the Twitter Streaming API (a random sample of 1% of all public tweets) and filtered out the English postings. We hired 83 native speakers (except English) to manually comment on the mood of over 1.6 million tweets collected. The annotation process was supported by the Stieglitz platform (provided by Sowa Labs, http: / / www.sowalabs.com), which was specifically designed for the sensation of short texts."}, {"heading": "Emoji Unicode symbols", "text": "The precise definition of what constitutes an emoji symbol is still emerging.

In the second case, we correlate emojis according to the feeling on subsets of emojis from the 13 different languages - the property of the list elements is the sentiment score. For all two lists x and y, of length n, we first compute the Pearson correlation coefficient [21]: r (x, y) = \u2211 n = 1 (xi \u2212 x) (yi \u2212 y \u0456).

In our case, we want to estimate the similarity between people when commenting on the same tweets for sentimentality. A comparison of the similarity between different sets of data gives an indication of how difficult chance is. There are different measures of similarity, and in order to obtain a robust estimate of differences, we apply three well-known metrics. (Note: Alpha reliability [25] is a generalization of several specialized parameters of similarity. It works for any number of annotators applicable to different variable types and metrics (e.g., nominal, ordered, interval,.) and can handle small sample sizes. Alpha is defined as follows: Alpha = 1 \u2212 Do, where discrepancy between annotators is observed, and De is discrepancy expected by chance."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Gama System (http: / / www.gama-system.si), which collected the most tweets (except English), and Sowa Labs (http: / / www.sowalabs.com) for providing the Goldfinch platform for commenting on the mood of tweets.

increasingly used in mobile communications and social media. In the last two years, over ten billion of emojis were used on Twitter. Emojis are Unicode graphic symbols, used as a shorthand to express concepts and ideas. In contrast to a small number of well-known emoticons which carry clear emotional contents, there are hundreds of emojis. But what is their emotional contents? We provide the first emoji sentiment lexicon, called Emoji Sentiment Ranking, and draw a sentiment map of the 751 most frequently used emojis. The sentiment of emojis is computed from the sentiment of tweets in which they occur. We have engaged 83 human annotators to label over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European languages by the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, or positive). About 4% of the annotated tweets contain emojis. The sentiment analysis of emojis yields several interesting conclusions. It turns out that most of the emojis are positive, especially the most popular ones. The sentiment distribution of the tweets with and without emojis is significantly different. The inter-annotator agreement on the tweets with emojis is higher. Emojis tend to occur at the end of the tweets, and their sentiment polarity increases with the distance. We observe no significant differences in emoji rankings between the 13 languages, and propose our Emoji Sentiment Ranking as a European language-independent resource for automated sentiment analysis. Finally, the paper provides a formalization of sentiment and novel visualization in the form of a sentiment bar.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
