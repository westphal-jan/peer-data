As shown in Figure 5 and6, we see that the topic of perplexity-based exploration (shown with blue squares) is consistently better than any other weight function when compared with the truth of the ground or the robot outcomes. For paths of length 80, which is close to the width of the maps, we see that the mutual information between thematic perplexity-based exploration and the truth of the ground is 1.51, 1.20 and 1.05 times higher than the topic of the robot, compared with the next-best execution technique. For long paths (320 steps or more), stochastic reporting (shown with orange circles) based exploration coincides with the mean performance of thematic perplexity exploration. This is expected because the maps are limited, and as the path length increases, the stochastic coverage algorithm is able to trip over different terrains without even having a guide function."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Scenario 1: Exploring a coral head", "text": "In this experiment, we started the robot near a coral head surrounded by monotonous sand.

We see the robot follow the diver and hover over the diver when it has stopped moving."}, {"heading": "5.2.3 Scenario 3: Exploring the ocean floor", "text": "In this experiment, we started the robot near the seabed, which was sparsely populated with marine plants and corals.

Using a framework for real-time, lifelong learning and thematic modeling allows us to describe the incoming streams of low-threshold observation data by using latent variables that represent the terrain type. Considering this online lifelong learning model, we calculate the benefit of the potential next steps on the path in terms of their perplexity. In our underwater video demonstration, we see that the emerging behavior of the robot bears a striking resemblance to that of biological organisms by calculating mutual information between the terrain maps generated by using the learned terrain model, and hand-signing the ground truth on three different datasets."}], "references": [{"title": "Robotics in remote and hostile environments", "author": ["James G Bellingham", "Kanna Rajan"], "venue": "Science (New York, N.Y.),", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Autonomous Exploration of Large-Scale Benthic Environments", "author": ["Asher Bender", "Stefan B Williams", "Oscar Pizarro"], "venue": "In IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 390\u2013396,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Optimizing waypoints for monitoring spatiotemporal phenomena", "author": ["Jonathan Binney", "Andreas Krause", "Gaurav S.
