However, these economically based search models assume that the costs associated with observing a given opportunity are stationary, i.e., do not change during the search process. In our settings, the agent is operated in a physical environment, that is, the distances to other locations depend on the location of the agent, and therefore, when the agent travels to explore other locations, the cost of traveling to other locations changes. In computer science, the change in search costs has traditionally been viewed in the context of the Prize-Collecting Traveling Salesman Problem [3] and its variants. These problems, while interconnected, are fundamentally different from our model in that the travel budget and prices in these models are different, with different currencies. Therefore, expanding the travel budget does not result and cannot affect the price collected at a node."}, {"heading": "Preliminaries", "text": "We get a chart G \"pV, Eq, whose vertices represent the locations where a position q is available (i.e. shops) and the edges represent the connections between the locations.

(without loss of generality) we assume that the original position of the agent is located at one of the locations indicated by v1, and the position cannot be maintained at that location. The cost of maintaining the position at each location v P V is a random variable CV with a related probability measure function pvpciq for the probability that obtaining the position ci at the location costs. To simplify the notation, we assume that all locations have k cost values (if one side v has lower cost values, then we can add any cost values, ci with pvpq\" 0)."}, {"heading": "Max-Probability", "text": "In this section, we provide an oplog nq approximation algorithm for the max probability problem if the probabilities are not too small. We will first consider a limited case of the max probability problem and then show how we can extend our analysis to the general case. Our algorithm is based on the approximation algorithm of [4] for the DeadlineTSP problem, which you have defined as follows: Definition 1 For a weighted graph G \"pV, equation to n node, with a start node r, a price function \u03c0: V \u0445 Z ', terms D: V \u0445 Z' and a length function ': E \u0445 Z', you will find a path that starts at r to maximize the total price, where a path that starts at r collects the price \u03c0pvq at node v if it collects v before the Dpvq.If P is a path that an algorithm for the Deadq V has visited, the number of the TSP is supposed to indicate."}, {"heading": "The case of single probabilities", "text": "We start by providing an approximation algorithm for the case where k \"1.

Our goal is to maximize the probability of success with a given budget. That is, the probability that the agent will be able to succeed in at least one page, and that the total cost is at most the given budget. We can also specify our objective as minimizing the probability of failure."}, {"heading": "General Case", "text": "We now show how we can expand our results from the previous section to provide an approximate problem for the general case, i.e., where the number of probabilities in each location is not limited.

In fact, converting the min-budget problem into the dual of the deadline TSP problem is hopeless; we have evidence that unlike the deadline TSP problem, the dual of the deadline TSP problem can be returned within a factor of c-log n, for any constant c is difficult to approximate. We show that the min-budget problem can be returned with a specific instance of equal vertex costs and equal individual probabilities within a ratio of 5.\" The idea is to execute the 2 \"approximation algorithm of c [14] for the rooted k-MST problem and then travel along the tree.

We then propose a 5 'approach for each \u0105 0, for a specific case of Min budget, and an approximation hardness within a ratio of 1.003553 for the general Min budget problem. We also propose several Heuristics for practical use and demonstrate experimentally that our no-backtrack branch-and-bound algorithm is capable of finding near-optimal solutions and handling even very large instances. We conclude that even the NB will have an exponential runtime if it encounters specific diagrams with many dead ends and very low probabilities, but that it is possible that there are no real problems."}], "references": [{"title": "Physical search problems applying economic search models", "author": ["Y.
