Introduction", "text": "The computer networks are expanding every day and the users of the Internet are increasing. The exchange of information is transforming the world into a small village. The technology of exchanging information over networks had improved the efficiency of data transmission, but it has also made more possibilities for cyber attacks. All these possible network attacks make users, organizations and government agencies want to protect their systems from intrusions. Intrusion can be defined as the ability to break through a system and try to compromise its integrity, availability, confidentiality or quality of service (Abraham and Patra, 2012). There are various defensive measures used by most organizations to protect computer networks and sensitive data from intrusions or attacks, such as authentication, firewalls and physical security. All these measures are good, but they do not protect against sophisticated buffer attacks that exploit the weakness in an application and cause enormous security threats."}, {"heading": "2. Related Works", "text": "The first concept of intrusion detection was introduced by a paper by (James P. Anderson, 1980) in which the authors presented a model that develops security monitoring to detect anomalies in user behavior. (Lee and Stolfo, 1998) proposed a systematic framework that uses data mining techniques to detect intrusions. (Schultz, Zadok, Stolfo, 2001) proposed a framework that uses data mining classifiers to train multiple classifiers on a range of malicious and benign permutations to detect new examples. (Nadiammai and Hemalatha, 2012) presented a study of all governmental classifiers to predict their effectiveness on the basis of accuracy, time, specificity, sensitivity, and error. (Hwang, Lee, and Lee, 2007) proposed a three-tier architecture of IDS consisting of three lists - blacklist, white list, and multi-tier classification."}, {"heading": "3.

Discussion and Limitations of our Work", "text": "The work done focuses mainly on the four types of attack - DOS, U2R, R2L and Probe in the data set used. Therefore, the attacks may go unnoticed outside of these data sets because we have not trained and tested them. Our focus was to show that a hybrid version of classification algorithms can work better on a given data set for intruder detection than on individual data sets. The use of an active or passive traffic analyzer in conjunction with our software will help monitor new attacks. Therefore, the use of network security monitors like \"bro\" can only complement our findings. Although we have used NSL KDD data sets that were carried out in 1999, the types of network attacks remain quite similar even today, although there are new types of attacks. It is true that some new attacks within and outside of these categories will always evolve. We are sure that if we train the software with newer types of attack, such attacks will be detected just as well, because the software is adaptable to real-time traffic, and where the changes in data traffic are intelligent."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have outlined the importance of intruder detection systems and analyzed the performance of some detection classifiers in terms of NSL KDD datasets. Finally, we have developed a software system in Java to detect intruders in networks using the same dataset. Bayes\u00c2 \"s network has the capabilities for automatic detection, and they learn from checking data that can be either normal or abnormal. This has been combined with random tree and random forest classifiers to achieve better detection accuracy. It showed high performance in detecting intruders with 99.67% accuracy to 20% of the NSL KDD dataset and 99.99% accuracy to the entire dataset with a modeling time of 24 seconds. The higher accuracy was because we used trees in the classifiers, and they tend to perform better when used on large datasets."}], "references": [{"title": "Online Intrusion Alert Aggregation with Generative Data Stream Modeling,", "author": ["Hofmann A", "B.
