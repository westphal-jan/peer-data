CONCLUSION", "text": "The iral ranking algorithm uses search engine optimization factors to assign heuristic page ranks to search engine results pages and display them to users. Experimental results have shown that the iral meta search engine has overtaken the search engines Google (0.44) and Bing (0.31) with an average accuracy of 0.48. Initial results were promising and the results showed that the iral meta search algorithm is useful for effectively categorizing web data and generating a ranking based on these parameters that can achieve more beneficial results for the user query, thereby increasing user satisfaction. The iral meta search algorithm has proven to be effective and efficient for keywords. The iral meta search engine is online for users and there is an interesting way to extend its lifespan. the system will improve over time and interactive feedbacks of users will help with future changes. The iral meta search engine is more useful for users if certain search results are observed to a high degree of algorithm interest."}, {"heading": "VI.
