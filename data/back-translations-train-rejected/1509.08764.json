In this novel approach, small UAVs, also known as drones, are deployed in tandem with the trucks to deliver goods to customers. Under research context, it gives rise to a new variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), of which we call TSP with drone (TSP-D). In this paper, we propose two heuristics: route first - cluster second, and cluster first - route second, to solve the problem efficiently. A new mixed integer programming formulation is also introduced to handle the cluster step in both heuristics. We conduct an experiment, adapting different profit functions of the MIP model, in both heuristics, to many instances with different sizes and characteristics. The numerical analysis shows not only a significant savings compare to truck-only delivery but also a superior performance against the previous work.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 14:19:47 GMT  (816kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08764v1", "13 pages, 9 figures, technical report"], ["v2", "Mon, 23 May 2016 06:58:52 GMT  (243kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08764v2", "25 pages, technical report, latest work"], ["v3", "Sat, 29 Jul 2017 18:08:35 GMT  (295kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08764v3", "57 pages, technical report, latest work"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 9 figures, technical report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["quang minh ha", "yves deville", "quang dung pham", "minh ho\\`ang h\\`a"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.08764"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.08764.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Heuristic methods for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone", "authors": ["Quang Minh Ha", "Yves Deville", "Quang Dung Pham", "Minh Ho\u00e0ng H\u00e0"], "emails": ["quang.ha@uclouvain.be", "yves.deville@uclouvain.be", "dungpq@soict.hust.edu.vn", "minhhoang.ha@cirrelt.net"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The fact is that we are able to assert ourselves, that we are able to change the world, and that we are able to change the world in order to change it. \""}, {"heading": "II.1 Profit functions", "text": "In the above MIP formulation, the profit pr, r, obj-omega is calculated by two different functions with different options: function 1: pr = cr (6) function 2: pr = crwr + 1 (7) Where wr is the actual waiting time between 2 vehicles at the meeting place. cr has 3 options: (1) cr = 1, which means that we only want to calculate the number of UAV routes (2) cr by taking minutes between the driving times of UAV and trucks from i to k (3) cr, the distance from j is one tuple to the center of all customers. This simulates the scenario similar to Figure 2 and 3, where UAV customers are located at the most remote locations and we expect the drone to serve them, which helps the truck to save costs.With 2 function types, 3 cr options we have 6 settings of cluster-1 - route-2 heuristic, labeled as 2-obj-obj-2, 2-obj-obj-2, 2-obj-obj-2, 2-obj-obj-obj-2, 2-obj-obj-obj-obj-2, 2-obj-obj-obj-obj-2, 2)."}, {"heading": "II.2 Time span", "text": "We define a time span - the maximum time allowed for either the truck or the drone to return to the meeting point sooner or later than each other - which means that a vehicle can wait for the other to arrive at a certain time so that the truck can make its timetable flexible (see Figure 8). For example, if the drone first arrives at a customer location, it can wait for the truck, and when the truck arrives at the location, it can proceed immediately to the next location without waiting for the drone. The value of the time span affects the quality of the solution. If the time span is too short, there is less flexibility for the truck timetable with the drone. On the other hand, the high time span makes the truck wait at some point or is waited a long time by the drone, resulting in a longer total driving time. In the next section, where we use a factor to calculate the time span equilibrium between decision time and the quality of the solution."}, {"heading": "II.3 Other parameters", "text": "This year, it will be ready to leave the country in which it is located."}], "references": [{"title": "Optimization approaches for the traveling salesman problem with drone", "author": ["N.
