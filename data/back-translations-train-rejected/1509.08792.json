This approach integrates the basic VNS with other complementary intelligence tools and has proven to be a promising strategy in [3] for the MLST problem and in [5] for the kLSF problem. It could easily be adapted to other optimization problems where the spatial solution consists of the subsets of a reference set, such as the selection of feature subsets or some location issues. First, we introduced a local search mechanism that is inserted at the top of the basic VNS to obtain the Complementary Variable Neighbourhood Search (Co-VNS). Then, we add a probability-based constructive method and a reactive adjustment to the size of the bulk process."}, {"heading": "2 The Labelled Spanning Tree and Forest problems", "text": "A labeled graph G = (V, E, L) consists of an undirected graph where V is the number of nodes and E is the set of edges marked on the L set of labels. In this essay, we consider two problems defined on a labeled graph: the MLST and the kLSF problems. The MLST problem [2] consists of a labeled input diagram G = (V, E, L) to get the spanning tree with the minimum number of labels; i.e., to find the labeled tree spanning the tree T \u0445 = (V, E, L) of the input diagram minimizing the size of the label set."}, {"heading": "3 Complementary Variable Neighbourhood Search", "text": "The first extension of the VNS metaheuristics that we have introduced for these problems is a local search mechanism q = q solution that is inserted at the top of the basic VNS. [4] The resulting local search method is called \"Complementary Variable Neighbourhood Search\" (Co-VNS) [5, 3]. Faced with a labeled diagram G = (V, E, L) with n depressions, m edges and labels, Co-VNS iteratively replaces any existing solution L with another solution defined from the complementary space of L \u0445, like the sets of labels not contained in L; L\\ L \u0432. The iterative process of extracting a complementary solution helps to escape the algorithm from possible traps of local minima, since the complementary solution lies in a very different zone of the search space relative to the existing labels. This process leads to an immediate culmination of the diversification of the entire local search process."}, {"heading": "4 Intelligent Variable Neighbourhood Search", "text": "The proposed Intelligent Metaheuristics (Int-VNS) is extended by Co-VNS by additional components, requiring the insertion of a probability-based Local Search as a constructive method to obtain the complementary spatial solutions. Specifically, this Local Search is a modification of greedy heuristic processes achieved by introducing a probabilistic choice on the next label to be included in incomplete solutions. By allowing inferior components to be added to incomplete solutions, this probabilistic constructive heuristic solution produces a further increase in the diversification of the optimization process. The process begins with an initial solution and iteratively selects a candidate at random. If this motion leads to a better objective solution than the current solution, then this motion is accepted unconditionally; otherwise, the NS motion is accepted with a probability dependent on the deterioration of the objective function."}, {"heading": "5 Summary and Outlook", "text": "The optimization strategy achieved seems promising for both problems. Ongoing studies consist in statistical comparisons of the resulting strategy with the best algorithms in the literature for these problems in order to quantify and qualify the improvements achieved. Further studies will address the application of this strategy to other problems."}], "references": [{"title": "The k-labeled spanning forest problem", "author": ["R. Cerulli", "A. Fink", "M.
