Introduction", "text": "Polish is one of the complex West Slavic languages, which poses a serious challenge to any SMT system.1,2 The grammar of the Polish language, with its complicated rules and elements, along with a large vocabulary (due to its complex declension) are the main reasons for its complexity (in Polish there are seven cases, three genders, animate and inanimate nouns, adjectives that use nouns related to gender, case and number, and a lot of words borrowed from other languages, which are often bent similar to those of Polish origin. However, this has a strong impact on the data and data structure required for statistical translation models. Lack of available and adequate resources required for entering data into SMT systems is another problem. SMT systems should work best in specified, not too wide text ranges and will not work well for general use. Good quality parallel data, especially in a required area, has limited availability."}, {"heading": "2. Preparation of the Polish data", "text": "The transcripts themselves are provided as plain text encoded with UTF-8, and the transcripts are prepared by the IWSLT team. Furthermore, they are split into sentences (one per line) and aligned into language pairings. However, it should be stressed that both automatic and manual pre-processing of this training information could not be avoided. Extracting the transcription data from the provided XML files ensured an equal number of lines in English and Polish. However, some of the discrepancies in the text parallelisms could be avoided. These discrepancies are mainly not found in the Polish texts. Another problem was that the TED 2013 data was full of errors. [5] For the IWSLT 2014, we helped recover these errors."}, {"heading": "2.1. Polish lemma extraction", "text": "In order to overcome the problem of the huge difference in vocabulary sizes, as already mentioned, the lemmas derived from Polish words were used instead of surface shapes. To extract the Polish lemmas, a toolchain was used that included tokenization and lemmatization from PSI-TOOLS. These successive tools provide a rich output that includes lemmatization of tokens, prefixes, suffixes and morphosyntatic tags. Unfortunately, unknown words such as names or abbreviations or numbers, etc. are lost. Capitalization and punctuation are not preserved either. To preserve this relevant information, we have implemented a specialized tool based on differences between PSI-TOOLS input and output. The lemmatized version of the Polish training data has been reduced to 36,065 unique words and the Polish language model has also been reduced from 156,970 to 32,873 unique words."}, {"heading": "YEAR BLEU NIST TER MET", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "YEAR BLEU NIST TER MET", "text": "Our experiments show that the lemmat translation according to EN in each test sentence reduced the evaluation results, the opposite translation from EN to lemma for each sentence increased the translation quality. Such a solution also requires the training of a system from lemma to PL in order to restore the correct surface shapes of the words. We also trained such a system and evaluated it on the basis of official test sets from 2010-2014 and adjusted the development data from 2010. The results for this system are presented in Table 4. Even if the values are relatively high, the results do not seem to be satisfactory enough to bring about an overall improvement in the EN-LEMMA-PL pipeline compared to the direct translation from EN to PL."}, {"heading": "YEAR BLEU NIST TER MET", "text": "To confirm our prediction, we conducted an additional experiment in which the English sentences were translated first into a lemmas and then into Polish interface forms. The results of such a combined translation are shown in Table 5. They reduce the translation quality compared to the direct translation from EN to PL. Furthermore, we have lost a lot of significant information due to lemmatization from PL. As part of the future work, we intend to lemmatize only not very common words, but we are still aware that most Polish words will appear less common due to many word forms. We expect most words to be replaced by lemmas. Unfortunately, the quality of the lemmas to the surface is also of low quality. Polish declension is complex, for example, sometimes even a steam is replaced by phonetic / phontactical rules."}, {"heading": "YEAR BLEU NIST TER MET", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3. English Data Preparation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4. Evaluation Methods", "text": "Common SMT metrics include: Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), the metric used by the US National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST), the metric used to evaluate explicit order translations (METEOR), and the Translation Error Rate (TER). According to Koehn, BLEU [11] uses text phrases of varying lengths to compare SMT and reference translations, and the rating of this metric is determined by the weighted averages of those matches. [13] In order to promote the rarely used word translation, the metric NIST [13] rates the translation of such words higher and uses the arithmetic mean of n-gram matches. Smaller differences in phrase length cause a lesser abbreviation penalty. This metric has shown advantages over the BLEU metric. METEOR [13] also changes the abbreviation penalty used by BLEU."}, {"heading": "5. Experimental Results", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "6. Discussion & Conclusions", "text": "In addition, the conversion of Polish interface shapes into a lemmas reduces Polish vocabulary, which should improve translation performance from English to Polish, and vice versa. Polish-English translation typically trumps English-Polish translation, even on the basis of the same data. It is also what we would expect in our experiments with the lemmas, but our initial assumptions have not been confirmed in empirical tests. Several potential opportunities for future work are of interest. Further experiments with advanced language models are warranted to determine whether this improves SMT values. We are also interested in developing some more web crawlers to obtain additional data that would most likely prove useful. In addition, the Wikipedia corpus that we have created is very noisy. We are currently working on cleaning it semi-automatically."}, {"heading": "7.
