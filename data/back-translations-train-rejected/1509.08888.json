INTRODUCTIONPredicting survival of cancer patients is a difficult task; however, it is important for determining the course of treatment. Physicians generally make subjective decisions based on past experience. These decisions can also prevent unnecessary treatments and improve patients \"quality of life. [1] In addition, predicting survival is a promising source of information for determining the correct prognosis of cancer patients, which in itself is valuable for research and timely hospital referrals. [3-6] Various strategies have been developed to use the high-throughput data to predict survival of cancer patients. However, these approaches present several challenges that should be addressed before comprehensive and accurate prediction can be achieved. Some of these challenges include: lack of biological understanding of related pathways and genes, scarcity of data, and the existence of a variety of relevant features that lead to overall difficulties in educating patients."}, {"heading": "II. MATERIAL AND METHODS", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "We evaluate the performance of the predictive model when it is trained using monitored learning and semi-monitored learning paradigms. We use Accuracy (Acc), Mean Sensitivity and Specificity (SnSp / 2), and Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC) [14] as our performance metrics. All evaluation metrics are calculated using 5x cross-validation. Figure 2 shows the predictive accuracy of the trained model for both monitored and semi-monitored learning paradigms. As shown in the figure, the semi-monitored approach is superior to the monitored approach for kidney and pancreatic cancer data sets. In the latter case, this performance is more pronounced than the smaller size of the data sets as evidenced by Table I. This corroborated assertion of our previous claim that semi-monitored training can provide significant benefits when data is scarce."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We developed a classifier that was able to predict labeling of unlabeled data with missing attribute values. We then applied a semi-monitored learning approach to train a predictive model and demonstrated that semi-supervised learning for the task of predicting survival in the presence of a significant amount of unlabeled data can improve performance. We applied the semi-supervised learning approach to kidney, ovarian and pancreatic cancer data. In addition, the weights of traits in the trained model can be interpreted by human experts. We simplified the problem of predicting survival by converting the initial regression problem into a binary classification problem using a survival threshold. However, this removes information that can be used to further improve accuracy. Future approaches could consider the use of semi-supervised learning in the context of regression to predict cancer survival."}, {"heading": "V.
