If we breathe deeply, we can taste the sweet smell of freshly cut grass. Although we have no direct access to the world except through our sensors [5], we can always rely on different kinds of apparatus to discover the world, in fact all apparatus can be considered an extension of our biological sensors. But what if something cannot be detected by all means? Is it necessary to insist on its existence? The question was perfectly answered by Carl Sagan's famous story \"The Dragon in My Garage.\" [8] And the following idea is well known and accepted for decades. There is no independent observation."}, {"heading": "2.2 Definition II", "text": "For a given mapping relationship M: D \u2192 O, a subset of the area and each element of the corresponding subset of the area are local and global representations that define the same concept or conception; a series of phenomena are recognized by an apparatus M (the area of an mapping relationship M); all of these phenomena indicate the existence of a concept, so that the local representation of this concept is defined as subset X, and the global representation of this concept is defined as each element of the subset Y. Therefore, all local information about a concept is its only local representation, and the global information of the concept is equivalent to its global representation. In summary, Definition I and Definition II indicate that: 1. These four expressions are equivalent: One concept \u2022 One set of phenomena \u2022 One set of local information (definition one) \u2022 One local representation (definition two) \u2022 These three expressions are equivalent: One concept \u2022 One piece of global information \u2022 One global representation \u2022 One global representation"}, {"heading": "2.3 Definition III", "text": "For a given mapping relationship M: D \u2192 O and subset X-O, we have Y = {y | y = M (x), x-X}, so: 1. Y is subject to a constraint c\u03b1, which is defined as a pair < Y, Ri >, Ri is the i-ary relationship; 2. Y is subject to a constraint c\u03b2, which is defined as a pair < X, Rj >, Rj is the j-ary relationship; 3. If Ri and Rj are different, then each element of Y is an invariant representation of X.Together, Definitions I and II indicate that there may be more than one global representation for a concept, so all global representations of such a concept must be subject to at least one constraint, or in other words, it is necessary to find the constraint that all global representations are subject to such a constraint, so that this global information can be recognized or reaped. If all global representations of such a concept and all are subject to this concept, then only global representation is subject to a global constraint."}, {"heading": "2.4 Definition IV", "text": "Definition IV guarantees that not only the appearance and the way these phenomena are processed determine the existence, but also the nature of the concept, since the phenomena (local information) form a subset of the domain, and the way this local information is processed (mapping relationship) yields the global representation (global information) of a system (concept).This definition is also a generalization of our everyday experiences.Visual recognition allows us to distinguish different types of trees, and it is difficult to distinguish the differences between these realities by just touching them. As the change in the domain of the appearance of these realities does not contain enough information to explain differences within each species, we can explain the differences between the animal species and the different types of information by touching the camera, it is difficult to distinguish the different types of information when the camera touches the same domain."}, {"heading": "2.5 Definition V", "text": "For two given mapping relations: Ml: S1 \u2192 S2 and Mh: S3 \u2192 S4, if S1, S2 and S3 are then homologous global information in relation to Mh."}, {"heading": "2.6 Definition VI", "text": "For two given mapping relationships: Ml: S1 \u2192 S2 and Mh: S3 \u2192 S4, if S2 and S3 then represent a mapping relationship between S2 = S3 and S4, it is obvious that all elements in S4 are outside the visual range of the mapping relationship Ml. Thus, if Mh one to one represents a mapping relationship between S2 = S3 and S4, it is also true that all elements in S2 are outside the visual range of the mapping relationship Ml. Therefore, for a particular mapping relationship M: D \u2192 O all elements in their range are first-order global information in relation to M itself. And together with Definition II, we know that these three concepts are equivalent: a global information, a global representation, a global information of the first order. Normally, a mapping relationship is the composition of several mapping relationships, it could be a combination of different approaches to processing information from the domain. Definitions V and VI describe the relationship between different process levels."}, {"heading": "2.7 Explanatory Comment", "text": "This year the time has come for you to be able to explore and explore the infinite vastness of the continent, to the infinite vastness of the continent."}, {"heading": "3 Axiom and The Laws of Learning", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Axiom", "text": "This axiom comes from the interpretation of the statement at the beginning of section two: There is no reality independent of observation. In other words, this axiom indicates that an image relationship is necessary to define concepts. And, when an image relationship is called ML: D \u2192 O as a learning model capable of learning from its domain D, it must follow these two laws."}, {"heading": "3.2 Law I", "text": "For each subset XS of domain D, and the corresponding subset of the range is YS, there is a subset XN, which is a subset of the complementary set of XS, so we have a subset YN, which is at odds with YS. This law would be best understood assuming that there is a mapping relationship Mnon that does not obey law one. Then, there are four possible scenarios as follows: In the three scenarios in Figure 8, XS and XN contain different local information, but the mapping relationship Mnon will have them on the same set of Global1Scenario two and three are equivalent. Presentations, that is, as a detector Mnon fails to recognize different concepts in the domain. In other words, the mappings that do not obey the law."}, {"heading": "3.3 Law II", "text": "The intuitive explanation of Law II is that a learning model should be able to define the existence of a new concept on its own. This explanation ends any arguments similar to \"Should a dictionary-linked NLP system be called\" intelligence \"?\" In addition, the origins of information (mapping relationships) used for a composite mapping relationship can be divided into two categories: learning model and non-learning model (storage system) so that further analysis is possible. In fact, the construction process of a mapping relationship is almost always limited by a certain knowledge of the desirable learning outcomes. Issues related to Law Two are core issues that require further investigation. 4"}, {"heading": "3.4 Corollary I", "text": "If the mapping relationship ML: D \u2192 O (O-Rn, D-Rm) is given, if ML follows law one, there is a family of functions H-Rn-R that can be used to collect information contained in the area of ML."}, {"heading": "3.4.1 Lemma One", "text": "Considering that there is a family of equality, there is an equation 5: G (t) = (t \u2212 x1) \u2022 (t \u2212 x2) \u2022 \u2022 (t \u2212 xi) (1) so that for each x \u2212 Xj) = r.Proof: For a given subset Xj \u00b2 D there is an equation 5: G (t) = (t \u2212 x2) \u2022 \u2022 (t \u2212 xi) (1) so that for each x \u2212 Xj \u00b2 number G = 0. And for a given real number r there is an equation 5: G (t \u2212 x1) + r (2), so that for each x \u2212 Xi \u00b2 number there is an equation (x) = r.Lemma shows that for a given subset Xj \u00b2 of real numerical space X \u00b2 there is an equation."}, {"heading": "3.5 Corollary II", "text": "The composition of the mapping relationships ML following the law I and its corresponding harvesting function H still follows the law I. Evidence: Designation Fl = H \u0445 ML. Since ML then follows the law one follows: \u0435XS-D, XN-D\\ XS, so that YS = ML (XS), YN = ML (XN) and YN-YS = \u03c6 Then according to the definition of (H): H (y-y-YS) 6 = H (y-y-y-YN). Therefore, we know XS-D, XN-D\\ XS: FL (XS) 6 = FL (XN) Conclusion two that it is possible to represent different concepts of the information type ML by using different real numbers."}, {"heading": "3.6 Corollary III", "text": "The composition of the mapping relationship ML and its harvesting function H therefore corresponds to a common constraint VC and a mapping relationship \"L,\" which is also Law I. Proof: Real numbers can be represented by parallel hyperplanes defined by a vector theorem VC. And, based on Conclusion II, we know that this conclusion has a double meaning: 1. Linear separability is the common condition for all mapping relationships that fulfill the law that could be transformed. 2. Without the harvesting function, the learning result of the mapping relationship ML cannot be recognized, so that the mapping relationship FL (as shown in Figure 13) should be the mapping relationship that could ultimately provide useful information."}, {"heading": "3.7 Explanatory Comment", "text": "It is not as if it were a matter of a way in which the people on one side are on the other side of the world on the other side of the Atlantic, on the other side of the Atlantic, on the other side of the Atlantic and on the other side of the Atlantic, on the other side of the Atlantic.
