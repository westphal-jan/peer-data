It is very important to obtain a computational understanding of how humans can form a symbol system and obtain semiotic skills through their autonomous mental development. Recently, many studies have been conducted on the construction of robotic systems and machine-learning methods that can learn the use of language through embodied multimodal interaction with their environment and other systems. Understanding human social interactions and developing a robot that can smoothly communicate with human users in the long term, requires an understanding of the dynamics of symbol systems and is crucially important. The embodied cognition and social interaction of participants gradually change a symbol system in a constructive manner. In this paper, we introduce a field of research called symbol emergence in robotics (SER). SER is a constructive approach towards an emergent symbol system. The emergent symbol system is socially self-organized through both semiotic communications and physical interactions with autonomous cognitive developmental agents, i.e., humans and developmental robots. Specifically, we describe some state-of-art research topics concerning SER, e.g., multimodal categorization, word discovery, and a double articulation analysis, that enable a robot to obtain words and their embodied meanings from raw sensory--motor information, including visual information, haptic information, auditory information, and acoustic speech signals, in a totally unsupervised manner. Finally, we suggest future directions of research in SER.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 23:16:48 GMT  (2646kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08973v1", "submitted to Advanced Robotics"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to Advanced Robotics", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.RO", "authors": ["tadahiro taniguchi", "takayuki nagai", "tomoaki nakamura", "naoto iwahashi", "tetsuya ogata", "hideki asoh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.08973"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.08973.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Tadahiro Taniguchi", "Takayuki Nagai", "Tomoaki Nakamura", "Naoto Iwahashi", "Tetsuya Ogata", "Hideki Asoh"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 150 9.08 973v 1 [cs.A I] 2 9Se p20 15Appeared in Advanced Robotics Vol. 00, No. 00, January 2015, 1-27"}, {"heading": "SURVEY PAPER", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Symbol Emergence in Robotics: A Survey", "text": "Tadahiro Taniguchia, Takayuki Nagaib, Tomoaki Nakamurab, Naoto Iwahashic, Tetsuya Ogatad and Hideki Asohea College of Information Science and Engineering,"}, {"heading": "Ritsumeikan University,", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "1-1-1 Noji Higashi, Kusatsu, Shiga 525-8577, Japan", "text": "bDepartment of Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Systems,"}, {"heading": "The University of Electro-Communications,", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "1-5-1 Chofugaoka, Chofu-shi, Tokyo 182-8585, Japan", "text": "cFaculty of Computer Science and Systems Engineering,"}, {"heading": "Okayama Prefectural University,", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "111 Kubogi, Soja-shi, Okayama 719-1197, Japan", "text": "Department of Intermedia Art and Science,"}, {"heading": "School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University,", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3-4-1 Ohkubo, Shinjuku, Tokyo 169-8555, Japan", "text": "eArtificial Intelligence Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), AIST Tsukuba Central 1, 1-1-1 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8560, Japan (v1.0 released * * * *) Humans can learn to use language through physical interaction with their environment and semiotic communication with other humans.

Semiotics deals with everything that can be interpreted as a sign, that is, the physical symbols described by Saussure.

Initially, the semiology of Saussure was introduced, while Peirce introduced semiotics independently; the two fields have overlapped and are integrated into the academic field called semiotics. Semiotics is a representation of general systems of symbols, language. Peirce's semiotics defines a symbol as a process that has three elements."}, {"heading": "4.
