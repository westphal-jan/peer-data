Sentences in the raw corpus are usually misaligned, with translation lines whose placement does not correspond to the lines of text in the source language. In addition, some sentences do not need to be translated at all. The corpus may also contain bad or indirect translations, making alignment difficult. Thus, alignment with many systems is crucial for accuracy. It is a very complicated West Slavic language with complex elements and grammatical rules to use in different applications."}, {"heading": "2 Literature Overview", "text": "Early attempts to automatically align sentences for parallel corpora were based on sentence lengths, along with vocabulary adjustments [19]. Brown's method [20] was based on measuring sentence length based on the number of words. Gale and Church [21] measured the number of characters in sentences. Other researchers continued to research various methods of combining sentence length statistics with vocabulary adjustments [22, 23]. Several text aligners are currently available to implement these methods, including Bleualign, an open source project developed by the University of Zurich. In addition to parallel texts, Bleualign requires the translation of a text. It uses the length-based bilingual comparison metric (BLEU) to align the texts [11]. The Hunalign tool is another open source tool developed by the Media Research Center. Based on Gale and Church's method, it uses sentence lengths and optional alignment of texts into two languages."}, {"heading": "3 Proposed Sentence Aligner", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of us are able to abide by the rules which they have imposed on themselves, and that they are able to abide by the rules which they have imposed on themselves.

Aligner performance was evaluated using the sentence alignment metric described in Section 3. Table 2. The first three aligners performed well. The proposed method is fully automatic. It is important to note that Bleualign text is not translated and requires it to be executed manually. As discussed above, it is important not to lose lines of text in the alignment process."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In general, sentence alignment algorithms are very important for the creation of parallel text corpora. Most aligners are not fully automated, but the one proposed here is what gives it a distinct advantage. It also enables the creation of a corpus when sentences exist only in a single language. The proposed approach is also language independent for those with a structure similar to PL or EN.The results show that the proposed method performed very well in terms of metrics. Unlike the other aligners, it also did not lose any lines of text, which is crucial to the end goal of getting a translated text. Our alignment method has also proven to be better in comparison with typical machine translation metrics and would most likely improve the output quality of MT systems."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgements", "text": "This work is supported by the European Community from the European Social Fund within the framework of the Interkadra project UDA-POKL-04.01.01-00-014 / 10-00 and the EU project Eu-Bridge 7th FR (Funding Agreement No. 287658)."}, {"heading": "25. http://korpusy.s16874487.onlinehome-server.info/", "text": "26.
