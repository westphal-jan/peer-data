Asymmetry is also seen in undeciphered inscriptions, and we use it to deduce the direction of writing that corresponds to archaeological evidence.

Thus, if the probability of any character (e.g. the letters \"a-z\" in the case of the English alphabet) is at the beginning (or end of a word), we will be above the corresponding probability of the index."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "It is one of the basic prerequisites for the interpretation of any linguistic sequence. A variety of possible approaches can be seen in different writing systems, both in history and in the present. However, the most common, left-to-right, horizontal lines of writing are the directions in which all fonts are derived from Greek and Greek, including the fonts of English, French, German, Hindi and Tamil. Scripts written in the other direction, i.e., right-to-left in horizontal lines, are also used in ancient and modern Semitic writing systems, including Arabic and Hebrew. Another common orientation is from top to bottom in vertical columns, which is the direction in which Chinese writings are traditionally written (like Japanese). Other, less frequent, directions of the writing are also known, including the top (the Celtic Ogham script) and boustrophedon, which follows one another in the direction."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "We have data from written corpora of twenty-four languages (twenty-two units = 1 x) for nine linguistic families, as well as two linguistic isolates), along with a corpus of undeciphered descriptions from the Indus Valley Civilization (ca. 2600-1900 BCE). The writing systems, which are covered by a variety of sources, range from alphabetical (which use only a few dozen different letters) to syllabic to logographic characters (with thousands of characters).The average corpus size is about ten thousand unique words collected from a variety of sources. Each word considered for our analysis consists of several graphics that correspond to letters, logograms, hieroglyphics or syllables used depending on the writing system used. Detailed description of each corpus is provided in the supplementary information."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Fr. Divakaran, Deepak Dhar, Iravatham Mahadevan, Shakti N.

In several scripts, these could be considered as separate characters or broken down into the constituent characters, which will result in very different signatures. Semitic scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew, which are essentially consonant alphabets, are either considered as such."}, {"heading": "Left terminal", "text": "The probability of occurrence of the 26 letters of the English alphabet in the Google Books Ngram data comprising approximately 97,000 unique words of the English language occurring with a frequency of more than 100,000 euros in the corpus (see methods for details), at (a) any position (i.e., in the beginning) and (c) at the right end position (i.e., at the end) of a word.
