The study is a part of a model driven engineering approach of the CIS in a specific enterprise interoperability framework that will be summarised.

The first part starts from a high abstraction level where knowledge from business partners is captured. A collaboration ontology is defined in order to provide a structure to store and use the knowledge captured. In parallel, we try to reuse generic existing knowledge about business processes from the MIT Process Handbook repository. This results in a collaboration process ontology that is also described. A set of rules is defined in order to extract knowledge about fragments of the CBP model from the two previous ontologies. These fragments are finally assembled in the third part of the KbS. A prototype of the KbS has been developed in order to implement and support this approach. The prototype is a computer-aided design tool of the CBP.

Functionality and tool", "text": "We developed the Network Editor (NE) to support knowledge capture. The goal of the NE is to be used as a supported design tool in the collaborative networking area. NE users are responsible for gathering the relevant knowledge by asking partners about their view of the collaborative space. Afterwards, they use the NE to design the relevant collaborative network models and to capture and store the corresponding knowledge in a predefined pattern. NE should provide a design room with some tools that allow users to graphically create and characterize their collaborative networks. This editor requires some expertise as well as effective and efficient communication between the user of the NE and network partners. To develop the NE, we chose the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF), which allows us to develop a complex control logic that assigns a model to the different elements of a view. It tends to become a key framework for standardized development of a view."}, {"heading": "Insert Figure 4 here", "text": "In fact, you will be able to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "Insert Figure 5 here", "text": "It is a group of at least two participants who work together in response to an oral multiple common goals and a series of relationships between the participants.

An adaptation of the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is used to represent the CBP model. We develop a knowledge-based system (KbS) which is composed of three main parts: knowledge gathering, knowledge representation and reasoning, and collaborative business process modelling. The first part starts from a high abstraction level where knowledge from business partners is captured. A collaboration ontology is defined in order to provide a structure to store and use the knowledge captured. In parallel, we try to reuse generic existing knowledge about business processes from the MIT Process Handbook repository. This results in a collaboration process ontology that is also described. A set of rules is defined in order to extract knowledge about fragments of the CBP model from the two previous ontologies. These fragments are finally assembled in the third part of the KbS. A prototype of the KbS has been developed in order to implement and support this approach. The prototype is a computer-aided design tool of the CBP. In this paper, we will present the theoretical aspects of each part of this KbS as well as the tools that we developed and used in order to support its functionalities.", "creator": "Word"}}}
