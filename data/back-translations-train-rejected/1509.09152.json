The main objective of this scientific project is to provide any emerging collaborative situation with methods and tools to deploy a Mediation Information System (MIS). MISE 2.0 aims at defining and designing a service-based platform, dedicated to initiating and supporting the interoperability of collaborative situations among potential partners. This MISE 2.0 platform implements a model-driven engineering approach to the design of a service-oriented MIS dedicated to supporting the collaborative situation. This approach is structured in three layers, each providing their own key innovative points: (i) the gathering of individual and collaborative knowledge to provide appropriate collaborative business behaviour (key point: knowledge management, including semantics, exploitation and capitalization), (ii) deployment of a mediation information system able to computerize the previously deduced collaborative processes (key point: the automatic generation of collaborative workflows, including connection with existing devices or services) (iii) the management of the agility of the obtained collaborative network of organizations (key point: supervision of collaborative situations and relevant exploitation of the gathered data). MISE covers business issues (through BPM), technical issues (through an SOA) and agility issues of collaborative situations (through EDA).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Sep 2015 12:35:39 GMT  (2642kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09152v1", "\\&amp;lt;10.1080/17517575.2014.928949\\&amp;gt"]], "COMMENTS": "\\&amp;lt;10.1080/17517575.2014.928949\\&amp;gt", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI", "authors": ["frederick benaben", "wenxin mu", "nicolas boissel-dallier", "anne-marie barthe-delano\\\"e", "sarah zribi", "herve pingaud"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.09152"}, "pdf": {"name": "1509.09152.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Supporting interoperability of collaborative networks through engineering of a service-based Mediation Information System (MISE 2.0)", "authors": ["Frederick Benaben", "Wenxin Mu", "Nicolas Boissel-Dallier", "Anne-Marie Barthe-Delano\u00eb", "Sarah Zribi", "Herve Pingaud"], "emails": ["first.last@mines-albi.fr;", "szribi@linagora.com", "herve.pingaud@univ-jfc.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it is so far that it will only be a matter of time before it is so far, until it is so far, until an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "1.1 Preliminary point: collaboration architectures", "text": "The European Interoperability Framework (EIF), which is presented in [11] and discussed in [12], has been defined by the European Commission and the Member States of the European Union.

It is mainly dedicated to building a common knowledge base. \u2022 Technical Interoperability: This level deals with connectivity and ensures that organisations are physically connected to each other.

As a result, some research decisions have been made, which in turn have their own stakes.Firstly, at the corporate level, the most important scientific interventions concern the acquisition and transformation of informal knowledge into a usable model. In order to advance this BPM approach, the decision has been made to use meta-models, ontologies and derivative rules (i.e. some trusted tools for knowledge management).Covering the area of collaborative situations (especially through meta-models and ontologies) is the first major problem arising from this choice. The relevance of the derivative behavior of patterns (collar), based on the situation and capabilities of the partners, is certainly the second major problem based on the decisions."}, {"heading": "2 Overview of MISE 2.0", "text": "MISE 2.0 is the second iteration of the MISE project.

This common semantic profile aims to facilitate service matching and is the appropriate hub between business activities and technical services. It allows the user to express the functional aspects of models describing activity requirements and service capabilities. It also includes a semantic description of inputs and outputs at the highest level.
