Information is transmitted from one end of the planet to another, in a fraction of a second. Many new terms and phenomena are connected to the Internet. Many of these phenomena deserve to be thoroughly explored. Anonymity should, however, be mentioned among these phenomena. It is quite possible that anonymity can influence the speech of communicators on the Internet. They may behave as lightly and risk-taking as they would never have done in their usual verbal communication environment.The solution of this problem is directly related to the development of the Internet in mass media texts and the perception criticality threshold is decreasing. \"[9] Questions therefore arise as to whether anonymity has any influence on the behavior of users and how strongly communication standards are influenced by the anonymous environment. The solution of this problem is directly linked to the development of the Internet in Russia. [ar Xiv: 151 0.00 cv 0241 [s.O] These are commonly referred to as\" societal issues."}, {"heading": "2 Methods and material of the research", "text": "In the course of this study, texts from the Russian anonymous forums 2ch.hk and iichan.hk and the public MDK of the social network UK were analysed, and the most popular English-language Imageboard 4chan.org was analysed. This research step aimed to determine the impact of anonymity on the use of obscene lexicographs and invectives. These websites were selected for their popularity and different approaches to anonymity (image boards are anonymous while MDK is not, iichan is also moderate.) 114,275 messages from 2ch.hk were analysed, as well as 29134 posts from the website iichan.hk and 3556 messages from the MDK community. This research was based on the method of content analysis. \"The technique of content analysis makes it possible to obtain an objective and systematic assessment of the content of communication units.\" [The obscene lexis became the marker of the concept of aggression. \""}, {"heading": "2.1 Determination of the effects of anonymity on the usage of the obscene lexis", "text": "\"The number of words per message is much smaller for the MDK community, but it is dictated by the communication that takes place in the form of comments on each article. However, messages from the moderated forum iichan.hk are almost twice as long as those from 2ch.hk on average. For this reason, it is possible to suggest a hypothesis that efficient moderation can increase the quality of communication; however, the length of a message does not correspond to the amount of information transmitted. It is impossible to compare 4chan.org with Russian-speaking forums on the basis of this criterion, as the concept of words differs in different languages. All semantic elements (words) in the forums were counted by their absolute frequency (Table 2)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Determination of the relation between the usage of obscene words and the aggression level in messages from Russian anonymous forum 2ch.hk", "text": "The majority (n = 2105) of the messages analysed during the experiment contained neither signs of aggression nor profanity. 20.7% (n = 551) of the messages contained obscene words and / or were addressed to other users or social groups that could influence communication in the forum. 218 messages contained profanity but were used to express positive emotions or for other non-aggressive purposes. 333 messages contained signs of aggression. Messages containing aggression were divided into 10 groups according to the target of aggression (Table 6). In most cases (49%), aggression towards other communication partners whose imaginary or real deficiencies such as age, sexual orientation or state of mind were highlighted. In 21% of the cases (70%) the aggression was expressed in the direction of a particular nationality, and in 18% of the cases their target group was a particular political group."}, {"heading": "3 Conclusion", "text": "Anonymous image boards are notorious for their aggressiveness and profanity use. This research has confirmed it. According to data analysis, anonymity does not affect the percentages of obscene words. Furthermore, the percentages of obscene words for non-anonymous social networks vk.com are even higher than for anonymous image boards (although this value may vary). Thus, the percentages of obscene words do not depend on the anonymity of users, as much as it seemed. However, these percentages depend on the specificity of the community and the results obtained should be investigated in further research. According to iichan.hk experience, moderation and word filtering can significantly reduce the percentage of obscene words and thus increase the communication culture. Pages that have no moderation (2ch.hk, vk.com / mdk, 4chan.org) have a high level of aggression."}], "references": [{"title": "Izbrannye trudy", "author": ["Y.I. Levin"], "venue": "Poetika.
