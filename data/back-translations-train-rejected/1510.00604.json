INTRODUCTION", "text": "At the beginning of the 21st century, robots are beginning to be part of society, for example in homes, but if robots are to help people physically in their everyday lives, this problem needs to be addressed. In order to interact with their environment, robots often need a visual identification database containing models of all the objects they can encounter. However, for such unspecified environments as human households, a database of models of all kinds of objects is not feasible. However, if a robot is to learn patterns of interaction with its environment, object identification is essential. To overcome this problem, a system is proposed that is capable of learning objects online based on abstract characteristics. Furthermore, it is possible to group these objects into categories in order to predict suitable patterns of interaction for new objects by comparing them with their learned knowledge base."}, {"heading": "2. KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION AND SYMBOL GROUNDING", "text": "The decision on a specific representation of knowledge is always influenced by the task to be solved. In the use of a symbolic representation of knowledge, knowledge is explicitly encoded. Examples of such representations are graphs. Symbolic representations are well suited to depicting relationships between objects (cf. French [2002]), for example for modelling natural language (cf. Harnad [1990]). Subsymbolic representations, on the other hand, implicitly encode knowledge, as it happens in neural networks (cf. Luger [2001]). Such representations can be good for learning motor tasks or analysing sensory data (cf. Harnad [1990]). Both symbolic and subsymbolic representations appear to be used by the human brain. Artificial intelligence should therefore incorporate both representations and combine them into a hybrid form of information (cf. Kokinov [1994]). This view has begun to present this problem in newer artificial intelligence systems (cf. Harnad 1990 [Mitchell]."}, {"heading": "3. EXAMPLE SCENARIO", "text": "Before the actual frame is presented, an example scenario is given, which is used on the entire paper. The robot is presented one after the other with apples of green, red or brown color, as well as rectangular wooden toy blocks, which are either green, red or yellow. It is then asked to sort the objects orally into a toy box, a fruit basket and a garbage can. After each action, the robot is rewarded either positively or negatively. For each encounter with an object, only one action can be selected. If the robot sorts green or red apples into the fruit basket, it receives a positive reward. The expectation is that the robot creates three object categories - one for green and red apples, one for brown apples, and one for brown apples, and one for all of the other actions. At the beginning of the scenario, the robot has no knowledge of any of any of the targets. The expectation is that the robot creates three object categories - one for green and red apples, one for brown apples and one for brown apples - and one for the net apples - and one for the network itself, while this scenario appears to be changed frequently by a wooden toy block."}, {"heading": "4. FRAMEWORK", "text": "In this section, the framework is introduced: first, a brief overview of the system is given and the basic underlying algorithm is explained; then, in another subsection, the feature extraction, which is one of the two main components of the system, is described; followed by a subsection on the Knowledge Management Unit, the second major component of the system."}, {"heading": "4.1 Overview", "text": "The presented system uses a hybrid knowledge representation as explained above. As such, it can be divided into two sections: one that uses a symbolic representation and one that uses a sub-symbolic representation of knowledge. Figure 2 shows an overview of the system.Whenever an object is presented to the robot, an image of the object is taken. On the basis of this image, features are extracted - in the case of the example scenario, color and basic shape (rectangular or circular).The feature extraction components - one for each feature - can be multithreaded and independent of each other. In these components, a sub-symbolic representation is used. In addition, the use of other sensors to extract the feature set is also possible.Figure 1 shows the robot during the execution of the example scenario. At the time indicated, a red wooden game block is shown to it. In the foreground of the image, other objects used in the scenario.After the feature set has been calculated, it is passed on to the knowledge management, which is used for a symbolic representation of knowledge."}, {"heading": "4.2 Feature extraction", "text": "In the case of the example scenario, the color and basic shape characteristics have been extracted from the images using neural networks. (This set of characteristics alone is, of course, not enough for a robot to interact in a human household. However, it is sufficient to evaluate this effect roughly in brown. (For each of the two characteristics that are extracted, a separate multi-layer perception with a hidden layer is used. (Since the example scenario is performed under natural lighting conditions, color variations resulting from changing light conditions are expected.) To minimize this effect, the L * a * b color space is used and the L channel - which contains the luminosity data - is emitted. However, before the color is analyzed, a preliminary process identifies the contour of the object in the image. Afterwards, a border box is formed around the object. Figure 3 shows an image of an object, the silhouette of the detected object and a fourth-layer field."}, {"heading": "4.3 Knowledge Management", "text": "The unit of knowledge management is one of two main components of the system. All knowledge learned is administered here, including the analogy of knowledge production and generalization, so the actual action selection in response to an presented object is also carried out in this component (see Figure 2). The first subsection briefly describes how knowledge is presented, followed by an overview of the algorithm that selects actions and develops the basis for action. Knowledge RepresentationAs has already mentioned that knowledge is symbolically represented by a graph. This graph contains the data of all known object categories, including the characteristics associated with each object, and the experiences the agent has had with it, as well as its similarity to other object categories. An example graph that contains only one object category can be symbolically represented by a graph. The object category in this example is referred to as s3 and has the color characteristics that the agent is associated with it."}, {"heading": "5. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK", "text": "The system presented was evaluated using two different scenarios: the first was the example scenario mentioned in Section 3, which was also used to analyze the impact of the parameters on system performance; and the second scenario tested was the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), which will be explained later."}, {"heading": "5.1 Example Scenario", "text": "For the example scenario, the desired result consists of three object categories: one for green and red apples, one for toy blocks, and one for brown apples. However, the system was tested using real-world objects. However, in order to prevent feature extraction problems to modify the test, the scenario was additionally tested using simulated feature vectors in two variants: In one variant, the simulated features were 100 percent correct; in another, the features were correctly classified but contained uncertainties. An example of a simulated, 100 percent correct color feature vector is given as follows: [re: 1; gr: 0; br: 0] An example of a simulated color feature vector containing uncertainties on the other side is presented as: [re: 0.8; gr: 0; per: 0.15]."}, {"heading": "5.2 Wisconsin Card Sorting Test", "text": "s Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [1948]. However, in this test, subjects are shown four cards: one card shows a red triangle, another two green stars; a third card shows three yellow crosses and a fourth four blue circles; the subject is then asked to assign each card to one of the four other cards; this setting is shown in Figure 7. After each assignment, the subject is told whether the action was correct. Unknown is that the subject must sort the cards by either color, shape or number of show objects. However, if he assigns five cards correctly in a row, the rule determining whether an assignment is correct is applied; the test ends when the subject assigns nine times five cards in a row."}, {"heading": "6.
