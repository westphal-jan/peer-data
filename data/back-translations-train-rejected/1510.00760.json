It has been proven that the Ptrac method is very effective in dividing contrasts in lexicon, especially when it comes to comparing the dispersion of contrasts in different contexts. It has been argued that phonological constraints are used for phonological patterns. Recent studies on the role of articulation / perception of phonological factors in phonological phenomena have provided consistent explanations (e.g. Flemming, 1995, 1995, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997)."}, {"heading": "3.1.

Using P-trac procedure to compare the dispersion of contrasting features in consonantal positions", "text": "CVCC syllables in Persian. In this experiment, the P-trac method was used to find the dispersion of type, place and expressive characteristics in and positions of syllables in FLexicon. The aim of this experiment is to find out how the distribution of high-contrast characteristics is related to the amount of perceptibility of the clues argued by the Licensing Cue hypothesis (Steriade, 1997) and the dispersion theory of contrast (Flemming 1995, 2004, 2006). Phonemic transcriptions of lexemes were again used as input into the P-trac method."}, {"heading": "4.1. Applying P-trac procedure", "text": "All the different CVCC syllables with their type frequency, the frequency of the syllable in the lexicon, were extracted and, using the P-trac method, all the minimum sequence pairs were found and for each context (consonants in and position of) the contrasting characteristics were counted. As in the previous experiment for each minimum sequence pair, the frequencies [context, feature] were added by the minimum type frequency of the members of the minimum sequence pair. Thus, for example, for / band / and / pand / minimum sequence pairs, if the type frequency is of / band / 200 and that of / pand / 300, the frequencies [_ and voice] were added by 200."}, {"heading": "4.2. Results", "text": "Diagram-3: Frequency distribution of contrasting characteristics in C1, C2 and C3 positions in C1VC2C3 syllables of the Persian lexicon. As can be seen, the frequency of contrasts is highest in the prevocal context (3404 contrasts), in the medial context (1015 contrasts) and minimally in the preconsonant context (791 contrasts), whatever the contrasting characteristic is. Gradually, the frequency of contrasting characteristics decreases from characteristic to characteristic and from characteristic to characteristic."}, {"heading": "5. Discussion", "text": "The results of the P-trac method, applied to the case of contrasting characteristics in preconsonant contexts of clusters in CVCC syllables, show that the dispersion of contrasting characteristics is exactly in line with the predictions made by the cue hypothesis and the dispersion theory of contrast. According to Wright, 2004, the frequency of contrasting characteristics in preconsonant contexts is gradually decreasing from the manner in which contrasts and from place to place of contrasting contexts. According to Wright, the extent of the perceptibility of acoustic characteristics is in precontrasting contexts, places and intonations of characteristics that exhibit exactly the same pattern. The more clearly the perception of a characteristic in a precontrasting characteristic in a precontrasting context, the more frequently it was used as a contrasting characteristic."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "The results of applying the P-trac method to the case of contrast scattering in preconsonant contexts and in consonant positions of CVCC sequences in Persian provide evidence for a phonetic basis for contrast scattering, which is argued by the Licensing by Cue hypothesis and the dispersion theory of contrast. P-trac has proven to be very effective in detecting contrast scattering in the lexicon, especially when it provides a means of comparing contrast scattering in different contexts."}, {"heading": "7.
