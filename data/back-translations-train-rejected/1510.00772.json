Introduction", "text": "The data we processed and analyzed in this study comes from NORC's computerized telephone interview system (CATI system), which allows CATI networks to automatically retrieve and select a number of data from a random sample evaluated by a comprehensive list of providers, so that NORC can conduct survey results and collect data on topics of public interest that are representative of a particular population group. Survey results, which traditionally consist of relatively small samples, are often analyzed by statistical techniques (Wolter 2007). More recently, as the size, diversity, and complexity of survey data grow, which are particularly applicable, the results will be applied to knowledge research and predispositive analysis of knowledge. In 2014, as an example, we will use topic models (Blei et al. 2003) to find answers to cluster surveys answered by Wang and Mulrow (2014)."}, {"heading": "20140604 103903.913 Error: ProntoEventServer.

To illustrate such difficulties, we give a few examples below. Example 2.2 Each message field sometimes has missing or additional components. In this example, the timestamp does not contain any annual information and there is an additional slash between the month and the day, followed by a five-digit sequence (02488 below), which is unclear to us what it means:.06 / 04 142452.865 | 02488 | Error | Name | General | onXmlRead > xml element \"Alarms\" is ignored Example 2.3 In this example, the optional fields appear after - rather than before - the message content.
