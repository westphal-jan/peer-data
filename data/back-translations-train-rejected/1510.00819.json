These are powerful tools that help users find information in a large pool of data on the World Wide Web (Dreilinger and Howe, 1997). According to Beigi et al. 1998, the explosive growth of the World Wide Web led to the development of search engines to help users find desired information from a pool of unmanageable data. Search engines present information in real time using numerous algorithms and are therefore better than web directories, storing information in databases and matching queries to retrieve results. Some popular search engines are Google, Yahoo, Bing, MSN and Alta Vista.Intelligent search optimization using artificial fuzzy logic 2012Jai Manral (10037359) Page 6"}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Evolution", "text": "In the early years, when the World Wide Web was relatively small, information was found on the Internet through the use of web directories.

As in (Bowmen, 1994) Archie; the first search engine ever created by Alan Emtage, 1990; index files and menu names of FTP using script-based information collectors. This system only supports name-based searches by matching user queries to its database. Other developed models were Veronica, which suffers from the same problem of indexing.

Robot-based search engines use software robots to collect and index web pages, download documents from their large index databases, and, after receiving a query, search their database to generate query-relevant results. Examples include Infoseek (1994), Alta Vista, and WebCrawler. Directory-based search engines organize resources into tree-structured directories sorted by subject. They collect information artificially or by the authors of the websites. Meta-search engines rely on several individual search engines to extract the data."}, {"heading": "2.2.4 Limitations", "text": "The size of the Internet and its exponential growth (Gebert et al., 2012) have made it impossible for a single search engine to index more than 1 / 3 of the \"index-capable\" Web (Information Retrieval on Internet).

The concept of the meta-search engine came from the all-in-one search site (Cross, 1996), in which users must select search engines from a pool of search engines. The use of intelligent agents to retrieve search results was discussed in (Balabanovic et al., 1995; Knoblock et al., 1994; Chen and Liu, 2005).

It essentially involves providing a higher ranking in search results when a user submits related queries to search engines. This ranking is crucial for generating higher traffic on the websites. Since online search engines are popular tools for discovering information on the web, this has created a new form of advertising, i.e. online ads. Search engines generate their revenue from advertising and sponsored links. To be able to accommodate advertisers, search engines usually divide their result pages into organic and a sponsored part. These sponsored links are costly and not every website owner can provide for it. In order to achieve a higher ranking among millions of websites, owners / developers of websites need to invest time in organic listing (Rutz and Bucklin, 2007).

The benefit of SEO techniques for intelligent search engine optimization using artificial fuzzy logic 2012Jai Manral (10037359) Page 11, which generates the volume of traffic to corporate locations and thus increases revenue, was suggested by (Kisiel, 2010).

A thorough keyword search should be done before selecting a domain name, as it accounts for 20% of SEO efforts (Viney, 2008). According to Jones, 2010 p. 14), it is the first and probably most important step in optimizing. An effective keyword is one that has less competition (number of websites that have the same keyword) and much volume (number of searches for a particular keyword over a certain period of time). Keywords can be either header terms (one or two words with high search volume) or end terms (three or more words with lower search volume) (Jones, 2010 p. 16). As an example, \"computer\" is a header term; keyword \"cheap computer for students\" is considered the end term.

In the current system, user interface allows the user to submit their queries. The user interface used here is a search field that supports text-based searches.

There is no database for this system and no functionality of the user's logging or IDs, so the Data Protection Act 1998 will not apply to this system. As services are additionally sold over the Internet, it is necessary to comply with the provisions of the Distance Selling Regulations Act 2000.

Online search is ubiquitous and with the rise of e-commerce competition in the ranking, in search engines the number of search engines has increased rapidly (Fuxue et al., 2011). With almost 146 billion online search results per month, there is a large increase in competition for sites that rank higher in search engines. There are unlimited possibilities in this area, but to take advantage of this, it is important for websites to rank higher in search engines, which they must rank higher in search results, than the search engines known as search engine optimization."}], "references": [{"title": "The Role of Search Engine Optimization in Search Marketing", "author": ["R.
