In this paper, the proposed third stage of ICDM 2015 Drawbridge Cross-Device Connections is proving to be very powerful. INTRODUCTIONWith the rapid adoption of multiple devices (such as desktop computers, laptops, smartphones and tablets), consumption habits have changed [1]. People have access to different devices almost everywhere, and they employ multiple devices to complete their online goals. For these reasons, the data is used to understand their behavior, and user identification becomes a challenge."}, {"heading": "A. The competition", "text": "Organised by Drawbridge [12] and hosted by Kaggle [13], this challenge took place from 1 June 2015 to 24 August 2015 and brought together 340 teams."}, {"heading": "B. The goal", "text": "Users are likely to have multiple identifiers in different domains, including mobile phones, tablets and computer devices. These identifiers can illustrate common behaviors to a greater or lesser extent, as they often belong to the same user. Typically, deterministic identifiers such as names, phone numbers or email addresses are used to group these identifiers. The aim of this challenge was to identify the identifiers of the same user by learning which cookies belong to a person using a device. Relational information about users, devices and cookies was provided, as well as other information about IP addresses and behavior. See the Attachment to the Record and the Official Website of the Challenge [14] for more information on the data set provided in this challenge."}, {"heading": "C. Evaluation metric", "text": "The aim of the challenge was to obtain the classifier with the highest F0.5 score. This value, commonly used in infor-ar Xiv: 151 0.01 175v 1 [cs.L G] 5O ct2 015mation retrieval, measures the accuracy based on the accuracy p and callback r.Precision is the ratio of true positives (tp) to all predicted positives, true positives and false positives (tp + fp).Recall is the ratio of true positives to all actual positives, true positives and false negatives (tp + fn).F\u03b2 = (1 + \u03b22) pr\u03b22p + r, p = tptp + fp, r = tpttp + fn (1) By using \u03b2 = 0.5, the score weighs the precision higher than the memory. The score is generated by placing the individual F0.5 values for each device in the testset.III. THE GALITY"}, {"heading": "A. Preprocessing", "text": "In the initial phase, we repeat the list of cookies in search of other cookies with the same handling. Then, for each pair of cookies with the same handling, we insert into the cookie all the information about this IP address. B. Initial selection of candidates It is not possible to create a training set that, due to the large number of devices and cookies, contains any combination of devices and cookies.In order to reduce the initial complexity of the problem and to create a more manageable record, some basic rules have been created to obtain an initially reduced number of cookies for each device.The rules are based on the IP addresses that both device and cookie have in common and how often they occur in other devices and cookies.Table I summarizes the list of rules created to select the first candidates. This selection of candidates is very effective in the initial phase, as it reduces the size of the training set to a number of 3664022 devices / cookies and the number of cookies selected from the 15553 pairs of cookies."}, {"heading": "C. The features", "text": "Each sample in the training and test set represents a device / authorised cookie pair obtained from the previous step and consists of a total of 67 characteristics containing information about the device (operating system (OS), country,...), the cookie (cookie browser version, cookie computer OS,...) and the relationship between them (number of IP addresses shared by the device and cookie, number of other cookies with the same handle as this cookie,...).The attachment to the data set shows a detailed description of all characteristics contained in a training sample."}, {"heading": "D.

Bagging", "text": "Bootstrap Aggregating [19], also referred to as Bagging, is a technique that allows us to improve the stability of machine learning algorithms. It reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting, which leads to an improvement in accuracy. By using a training set X with n samples it is possible to generate different training sets from X, then a model can be created for each data set and all can be combined by average result. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that this technique can push unstable procedures towards optimality. We have used eight excavators in the training process for this problem."}, {"heading": "F. Semi-Supervised Learning", "text": "In our case, we use the data contained in the test set. If the highest value is close to 1 and the second highest value is close to 0, it is very likely that the first cookie belongs to the device. Figure 1 shows the F0.5 value and the percentage of devices we use in the evaluation, if we only take into account devices whose second candidate reaches less than a certain threshold. In devices where the second candidate reaches less than 0.1, the average F0.5 value is higher than 0.99 and 62% of devices meet this condition. In our case, we have taken the devices in the test set where the first candidate scores more than 0.4 and the second candidate less than 0.05, and we have considered recalculating some features of the training set and retraining the algorithm (see sentences O, IO and PO in the Appendix Features)."}, {"heading": "G. Post-processing", "text": "Once we have received the predictions of the regulated drilled trees, we select the cookies of the device according to the procedure described in Table II.IV. ERGEBNISSE. The result of this competition was evaluated based on a test set of 61156 devices. During the challenge, the ranking was calculated on 30% of the test devices (public ranking).
