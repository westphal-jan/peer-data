DKP-AOM is an ontology merging tool designed to merge heterogeneous ontologies. In OAEI, we have participated with its ontology mapping component which serves as a basic module capable of matching large scale ontologies before their merging. This is our first successful participation in the Conference, OA4QA and Anatomy track of OAEI. DKP-AOM is participating with two versions (DKP-AOM and DKP-AOM_lite), DKP-AOM performs coherence analysis. In OA4QA track, DKPAOM out-performed in the evaluation and generated accurate alignments allowed to answer all the queries of the evaluation. We can also see its competitive results for the conference track in the evaluation initiative among other reputed systems. In the anatomy track, it has produced alignments within an allocated time and appeared in the list of systems which produce coherent results. Finally, we discuss some future work towards the development of DKP-AOM.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Oct 2015 16:48:24 GMT  (569kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01659v1", "8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, initial results of OM workshop, Ontology Matching Workshop 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, initial results of OM workshop, Ontology Matching Workshop 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["muhammad fahad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.01659"}, "pdf": {"name": "1510.01659.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Initial results for Ontology Matching workshop 2015 DKP-AOM: results for OAEI 2015", "authors": ["Muhammad Fahad"], "emails": ["firstname.lastname@univ-lyon2.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of us are in a position to put ourselves in another world, in which we put ourselves in another world, in which we can put ourselves in another world, in which we can put ourselves in another world, in which we put ourselves in another world, in which we find ourselves in another world, in which we find ourselves in another world, in which we find ourselves in another world, in which we find ourselves in another world, in which we find ourselves in another world, in which we find ourselves in another world, in which we find ourselves in another world, in which we find ourselves in which we cannot find ourselves, in which we find ourselves in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live ourselves, in which we live, in which we live ourselves, in which we live, in which we live ourselves, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live ourselves, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in which we live, in"}, {"heading": "Global Evaluation Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Advanced Queries Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Basic Queries Results", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to go in search of a suitable place, to go in search of a suitable place where they can stay."}], "references": [{"title": "Ontology mediation, merging and aligning", "author": ["Bruijn", "J.d", "M.
