METHOD JUDGE", "text": "This section provides a comprehensive overview of the development of this novel method, which aims to assist automatic translators in selecting a translation that is more suitable for homographic terms in dialog systems. Figure 1 provides a visual overview of the JUDGE methodology. The first step, semantic verification of homographic words, is responsible for selecting the meaning of ambiguous words. This step is divided into two activities: morphological analysis and; semantic analysis. The second step, translation, is responsible for the realization of the translation of the message to be sent through the dialog system. This step is also divided into two activities: automatic replacement and; automatic translation.Figure 2 presents the method step by step when the method receives the message from the user."}, {"heading": "3.1. Morphological Analysis", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most homographs are nouns or verbs. Thus, it was defined that any word that possessed this part of the speech such as noun or verb must be considered in ontology. Dictionary is used in morphological analysis as a term for the part of the speech contained in a sentence sent by the user. Morphological analysis is considered a rule in all work on disambiguation words. With it, it is possible to identify not only parts of the speech, but also words whose origin among other possibilities of sub-analysis. The use of data words is indispensable for the method being developed in the Portuguese language."}, {"heading": "3.2.

Translation", "text": "In statistical machine translation, it is possible to ensure that when a word is sent in the source language alongside other words in the target language, there is the same influence on the translation of adjacent terms [29]. Automatic machine translation is responsible for carrying out the pre-translation of the word. After substitution, the sentence is concatenated again and subjected to statistical machine translation. This activity eliminates the need to develop statistical machine translation, since there are many more robust machine translations that already implement this approach and have a large corpus with annotations. Therefore, an independent component has been used to implement this approach. As the method was developed, it became independent of the translation tools. Thus, it is possible to change the tool without affecting the functionality of the method, since it implements the statistical approach. In this activity, the sentence of machine translation is subjected to the meaning of the translation, thus ending the translation by a complete sentence."}, {"heading": "3.4. Other Languages", "text": "The Portuguese language is the sixth most spoken idiom in the world and also has a large population of native speakers. [30] Specific problems have been solved, such as verbal localization, words identified with more than one syntax function as a word \"da\" can be a verb or preposition. For this purpose, the method is suitable for other languages and universally applied, there is a need for grammatical development for each of them. Each language has its own grammatical order, there are similar cases to Spanish, but it can cause many problems in translation with the application of the method without prior syntax treatment. This approach cannot be applied to idioms that have a declension in their words such as German and Russian."}, {"heading": "4.

Tool", "text": "The system consists of two administrative areas and one for the dialog. Administrative areas require authentication. With this authentication, the management of the user is realized, making it possible to use two or more users in each administrative area.

In the dialog, the exchange of messages of the subscriber takes place. Messages use the culture form for implementation examples.

When the message is sent, the analysis morphological activity begins to realize the fragmentation of the terms contained in the sentence. These terms are queried in OpenNLP [31], which returns part of the speech of each word. Word \"minha\" was classified as pronoun, \"bateria\" as noun, \"est\u00e1\" as verb and \"ruim\" as adjective. The words \"bateria\" and \"est\u00e1\" are subjected to a setic analysis. The word \"bateria\" was classified as pronoun, \"bateria\" as noun, \"est\u00e1\" as verb and \"ruim\" as adjective."}, {"heading": "4.3. Example \u2013 Locution", "text": "In this example, the ontology Music Ontology was chosen, which simulates a helpdesk on musical instruments. In Figure 6, the sender replied to the message \"a guitarra estava ligada na bateria do carro.\" Therefore, the message goes through a morphological analysis step. In the process, it is identified that there is a possible homographic word. This term is \"bateria,\" but it is accompanied by an addition. Then, the addition is called \"do carro.\" Therefore, the term \"bateria\" is not subjected to semantic analysis. Word is sent directly to the translation step, which leads to the message that \"the guitar has been put into the car battery.\" In the translation, it is possible to note that the locution \"do carro\" is influenced by the word \"do carro.\" This word is translated directly into the translation of the word into the world of music, if it is a translation. \""}, {"heading": "4.4. Dialogue Theory", "text": "Figure 7 shows an example that uses the method to address subcontexts in dialogues. This example is based on the dialog theory, and the theory is implemented by a temporary protocol. To provide the context, the vehicle ontology [32] has been added. A sentence can serve as an example of this technique: \"I put the drums and spark plugs in the trunk\" as explained above. By this sentence, the sender informs the recipient in the target language that he is putting the drums and spark plugs to the car. Thus, the sentence is morphologically analyzed and the method is informed of the momentary meaning of an ambiguous term. These meanings are stored in temporary protocol. In the sentence, the values \"drums\" to \"bateria\" and \"spark plugs\" are stored to \"vela.\" When the message \"Ok e a bateria estava completa?\" is sent, the translation of the term \"bateria\" from the temporary protocol is retrieved? \"by the drum would be ok.\""}, {"heading": "4.5. Evaluation", "text": "The check was carried out as follows: First, only machine translation was added to the dialog and the translation in the dialog was checked separately; then, the method for assessing clarification was inserted in the dialog; the method was checked along with various machine translations; and in order to create the experiments, semantic correctness was used as a specific criterion, taking into account the other criteria; and the standard of assessment was used in a manner similar to Nyberg [33]. In the test case, 100% matches were used in each context, because your translations such as \"bank\" and \"warehouse\" are widely used in statistical machine translation [34]. Nevertheless, the homographic word \"vela\" was only effective in the sports context if it supported machine translation, because your translation \"the word\" sail \"is used very little before the translation appears in the context.\""}, {"heading": "5.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS", "text": "The exchange of messages in a dialog, in both forms such as writing or speaking, is realized with the basis on a topic. This topic is responsible for generating the meaning of words where some terms have more than one meaning. Proposed approach focuses an ambiguity partial problems, which with it is only goal to reduce the significant ambiguity in textual dialogues. A tool has been developed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Tool was coupled as a superior layer in the translation component. In the development of tools, the independence of the idea of components was taken into account. Components that are responsible for each step can influence the structure of the method without the new components implementing the same functions."}], "references": [{"title": "Phi DM-Dialog: an experimental speech-to-speech dialog translation", "author": ["H.
