We want it to be possible to construct these systems using a formalism that allows for much of the work and produces the result instantly. To this end, we describe a new platform, \"Regulus Lite,\" that can be used to develop multiple types of spoken language applications. One question immediately turns out to be relevant, since the existence of Google Translate (GT) and similar engines is the answer, yes, with the clear language that comes out. Recent studies show that GT is beginning to be used in hospitals for which it is obvious, for the obvious reason that it is cheaper than the existence of platforms."}, {"heading": "2 The platform", "text": "The Regulus Lite platform supports the rapid development and deployment of three types of small to medium vocabulary translation applications. \"The Regulus Lite platform supports the regular use of content for three types of small to medium vocabulary translation applications:\" The result is a pure translation, sign language and language questionnaire. \"We briefly describe each of these sources: The translation in the target language is produced in the simplest case: the user speaks in the source language and the system shows his understanding of what the user said (a paraphrase of what was detected). If the user in the source language approves the paraphrase in the target language, a translation in the target language is produced, but the output is rendered in some form of the sign language, with a signed avatar. The content is organized as a form-filling questionnaire where the interviewer asks the questions in spoken form for them to be translated into the target language and typically presents many possible questions to the field."}, {"heading": "3 Types of application", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Medical translation", "text": "As already mentioned, medical language translation is one of the areas that most motivates our architecture. Several studies, including previous projects of our own [23,30], suggest that physicians are doubtful about the unpredictability of diversified SMT systems and place a high value on translations previously validated by professional translators. Other relevant factors are that medical diagnostic dialogues are sterotypical and highly structured, and that the languages that pose practical difficulties are poorly served by established translation systems.The practical problems arise from the fact that Lite formalism only supports regular expression translations, so the question is which constituents we can find, which it is always safe to translate compositively. It is clear that many constituents cannot be treated in this way. Nevertheless, it turns out that enough of them can be translated compositively, that grammatical description is vastly more efficient than a completely transformative framework, and most of them can be treated as medical adjectives, especially PPs, and adjectives."}, {"heading": "3.2 Sign language translation", "text": "This year it is so far that it will only be a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "3.3 Voice questionnaires", "text": "The general purpose of the questionnaire is to add voice input and output capacities to the questionnaire frame. [26] The questionnaire definition encodes a branched sequence of questions, with the identity of the following question determined by the answer to the previous one. The display shows the person administering the questionnaire the field that is being filled in; they formulate a question and speak it in their own language. Generally, there are many questions that can be used to fill in a specific field, and the interviewer will select an appropriate one depending on the situation. A basic choice that affects most fields is between a GH and a Y / N question. For example, if the interviewer can see recently used cooking utensils in front of him, it is strange to ask the open GH question that requires cooking."}, {"heading": "4 Initial evaluation", "text": "The initial AidSLT questionnaire was tested between March and July 2015 by seven humanitarian workers with practical experience and knowledge of household surveys, focusing on the recognition of voice input by English-speaking interviewers. Subjects were presented with a simulation exercise consisting of submitting a household survey on malaria prevention to an imaginary French-speaking respondent. Instructions were sent by e-mail in the form of a PDF file. Subjects logged in via the Internet at various locations with password-protected accounts. Each subject completed the questionnaire once; comments were inserted into the script, resulting in a popup asking the subjects to reformulate their initial questionnaire. We received a total of 137 correctly logged interactions7, which were independently commented by two judges. Annotators were asked to transcribe the recorded comments and answer two questions: whether the 86 percent of the questionnaire appeared to be correctly answered or whether the 79 percent was correctly answered."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and further directions", "text": "We have described a platform that supports the rapid development of a variety of language translation applications in limited areas. Applications can be used on 7. A subject has misunderstood the instructions, there have been serious audio problems with their connection, and some utterances have been spoiled by the incorrect use of the push totalk interface.The web and operation on both desktop and mobile devices. The minimal formalism is designed to be used by domain experts, who are generally not computer scientists. Although the translation platform is still in the early stages of development, the experience so far is positive; comparisons with our spoken CALL platform [25], which uses the same recognition architecture and has already been successfully tested on a large scale, make us optimistic that we will achieve similar results here."}], "references": [{"title": "A tool for building multilingual voice questionnaires", "author": ["A.
