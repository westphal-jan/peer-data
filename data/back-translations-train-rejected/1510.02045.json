In other words, the payout of a security is a random variable of the probability range. We consider trading n securities that correspond to the n-coordinates of the results. A securities trader can be traded prior to realization with the intention that the price of a security will serve as a forecast of the expected payout, i.e., the expected value of the corresponding securities corresponds to the n-coordinates of the results. An automated market maker always offers securities at the right price. In fact, the price vector is the current prediction of the market maker for the expected benefit. A cost function is based on a differentiated convex cost function, C: Rn \u2192 R.

trades under budget constraints in a prediction market with a cost-function-based automated market maker. We study how the budget constraints of individual traders affect their ability to impact the market price. As a concrete application of our characterization, we give sufficient conditions for a property we call budget additivity: two traders with budgets B and B\u2032 and the same beliefs would have a combined impact equal to a single trader with budget B +B\u2032. That way, even if a single trader cannot move the market much, a crowd of like-minded traders can have the same desired effect. When the set of payoff vectors associated with outcomes, with coordinates corresponding to securities, is affinely independent, we obtain that a generalization of the heavily-used logarithmic market scoring rule is budget additive, but the quadratic market scoring rule is not. Our results may be used both descriptively, to understand if a particular market maker is affected by budget constraints or not, and prescriptively, as a recipe to construct markets.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
