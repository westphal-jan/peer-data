In view of the mathematical framework of this paper, the problem is raised (at worst) in the number of simulation steps necessary to stop the dynamics, which means that after a finite number of time steps the population reaches an agreed linguistic convention. Despite other work, similar tasks are solved (see [2]), a strengthening of this paper is to give simple proof of convergence between different updating schemes. First, a sequential updating scheme is considered as a minimum. Since this scheme is defined by a permutation of the population of individuals, each vertex is updated after all other vertex have been updated. In the worst case, each individual step assumes that a single word adds a word. This process ends when any individual has all possible words, that is, after steps \u2212 1 (there are)."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "This paper introduces a new theoretical framework for studying the development of linguistic conventions and, more generally, the formation and development of language. In this sense, it defines a new theoretical framework for testing hypotheses on the formation of language. Secondly, it presents simple mathematical evidence of convergence among various updating programs. Future work could include the role of topology in the dynamics of name automation and the influence of storage capacity in the negotiation of agreements on linguistic conventions.
