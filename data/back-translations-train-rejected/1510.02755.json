INTRODUCTION", "text": "It is a problem that is relevant to many areas of the physical and social sciences. On a fundamental level, it is a challenge to identify characteristics that are useful for classification in qualitative data. However, on a more applied level, it can be used to classify sources (human, machine or nature) of such data. Among the more important recent uses is that classification is essentially blind. Current algorithms for document classification are mostly based on cluster analysis based on the bag-of-words approach. The basic classifiers that use a bag-of-words approach are not the correlated, or more complex Bayesian classification algorithms that use all word frequency in one form or word. The word sense is almost always ignored."}, {"heading": "1.1 Abstraction of Document in Classification Problem:", "text": "There are several ways to visualize a document, the most common of which is the sack-of-words approach. Let's call our corpus c, which contains n-documents, namely {d1, d2,..., dn}. Each di contains a finite collection of words, let's call it {wi1, wi2,..., win}. In the sack-of-words approach, we can look at the words in connection with their frequencies in the document, which are used for classification after containment, but this destroys the sequence of words, which can lead to a higher probability of misclassification. It makes more sense to consider the document as a finite sequence of words in which repetitions are possible."}, {"heading": "2. Structure of WordNet", "text": "WordNet is a lexical dictionary that is available online for free. WordNet is something of an extended version of a thesaurus. The main relationship between words in WordNet is synonymous, as between the words closed and close or car and automobile. Synonyms - words that denote the same concept and are interchangeable in many contexts - are grouped into disordered sentences (synsets). Each of WordNet's 117,000 synsets is linked to other synsets by a small number of \"conceptual relationships.\" In addition, one synset contains a short definition and in most cases one or more short sentences that illustrate the use of the synset members. Word forms with several different meanings are represented in as many different synsets. Thus, each form-meaning pair in WordNet is unique, symmetrical and symmetrical. \"Both nouns and verbs are organized into hierarchies that are defined by hypernym or A-relationships."}, {"heading": "2.1 Notion of Semantic Similarity", "text": "It is easy to define a measure of similarity between pairs of words via WordNet. WordNet already has a few existing Perl modules. WordNet: Similarities uses an \"as-is\" relationship between nouns to classify them in the same synthesis. For example, \"dog\" and \"animal\" are closer than \"dog\" and \"closet.\" Another point to note is that this \"as-is\" relationship does not overlap parts of the language boundary. However, this captures only a small notion of similarity between words, as there can be many other relationships besides \"as-is.\" WordNet also contains other non-hierarchical relationships between words that are augmented by a \"glosse\" or an added definition."}, {"heading": "2.1.1 Path Similarity", "text": "This year, we will be able to look for a solution that will enable us to find a solution, that will enable us to find a solution that will enable us to find a solution, that will enable us to find a solution, that will enable us to find a solution, that will enable us to find a solution, that will enable us to find a solution, that will enable us to find a solution, that will enable us to find a solution, that will enable us to find a solution, that will enable us to find a solution, that will enable us to find a solution, that will enable us to find a solution. \""}, {"heading": "2.4 Example of WordNet Search - 3.1", "text": "In fact, you have to be able to play by the rules without being in a position to break the rules."}, {"heading": "3.1 Method:", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.2 Detailed steps: Algorithm Part 1", "text": "Given: Two categories of records - A (good) and B (bad).Category A (good): {good, dazzling, brilliant, phenomenal, excellent, fantastic, captivating, captivating, captivating, spectacular, cool, awesome, exciting, love, wonderful, great, still, beautiful} slow, worst, wasteful} Step 1 all: = List of all synthesizers maxp: = Step All Step Step: Step All Step: Step All Step: Step All Step: Step All Step: Synthesizer maxp: = List of all synthesizers maxp: = List of all synthesizers maxp: = List of all synthesizers maxp: = Step All Step: Step All Step: Step Step: Step Synthesizer maxc: Synthesizer maxc: Synthesizer maxc: Synthesip: Synthesizer maxc: Synthesip: Synthesip: Synthesip: Synthesip: Synthesip: Synthesip: Synthesip: Synsizer: Synsip: Synsip: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsip: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsip: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsip: Synsip: Synsizer:: Synsip: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsip: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsizer: Synsip: Synsip:: Synsizer:: Synsip::: Synsip: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsip:: Synsip:: Synsizer: Synsip:: Synsizer::: Synsip:: Synsizer::::: Synsip: Synsizer: Synsip::"}, {"heading": "3.2.1 OUTPUT with the Final Choice of Parameter Values", "text": "\"It's not the first time we get involved in a conflict,\" he said. \"It's the first time we get involved in a conflict.\" \"It's the second time we get involved in a conflict.\" \"It's the first time we get involved in a conflict.\" \"It's the second time we get involved in a conflict.\" \"It's the first time we get involved in a conflict.\" \"It's the second time we get involved in a conflict.\" \"It's the second time we get involved in a conflict.\""}, {"heading": "3.3 ALGORITH Part 2", "text": "In this part, we calculate the frequency of the word list we obtained from the expansion in the previous section.

DISCUSSION", "text": "We used the wn.path _ similarity (synset1, synset2) function, which returns a score indicating how similar two sense of words are, based on the shortest path linking the senses in the is-a (hypernym / hypnoym) taxonomy, ranging from 0 to 1. A score of 1 represents identity, i.e. comparing a sense with itself, yields 1.Example, wn.path _ similarity (hit, slap) yields 0.142Here we have taken a total of 25,000 words from the WordNet. Various choices for the tau value in the Condition Check statement have been tried for the equilibrium and usability of the output classifier. Finally, after several attempts with value pairs (0.5.0.5), (0.7.0.5), (0.8.0.1), (0.8.0.3), (0.8.0.3), (0.8.0.5), it was empirically adjusted to 0.8 and 0.2 word pairs containing the same number of two incorrect, fixing the same number of words."}, {"heading": "4.1 Further Guard against Misclassification:", "text": "We have neglected the order of words in this problem, but this can lead to misconceptions about the mood conveyed in a sentence. For example, the presence of a conjunction such as \"but\" or \"but\" can indicate a reversal of the mood from the first to the second part of a sentence, while \"and\" and \"and\" and \"also\" can lend more credibility to the mood. Therefore, each composite sentence can be divided by these words into a sequence of {+ 1, -1} in which + 1 indicates the mood versus a good sentence and -1 versus a bad one."}, {"heading": "5.
