If a human agent intends to manipulate a decision in his favor, the human agent can signal incorrect or correct information. Alternatively, a human agent can search for information to reduce the impact of asymmetric information on decisions. With the advent of artificial intelligence, signaling and screening have been simplified. This chapter examines the effects of artificial intelligence on the theory of asymmetric information. It is thought that artificial intelligent agents reduce the degree of information asymmetry, making the market in which these agents are used more efficient. It is also postulated that the more artificially intelligent agents are used in the market, the less trade volume is in the market."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The theory of information asymmetry and its effects on markets is comprehensive (Aboody and Lev, 2000). Some of the undesirable consequences of information asymmetry are moral hazards, information monopoly and unfavorable selection (Aboody and Lev, 2000). The difference in the perception of value of goods and services is the basis of trade. People are agents of trade for much of history. People often have a distorted perception of information for all sorts of reasons and often change their minds about one thing or another. There is a thought experiment in which a person is given 20 paintings in order of value. Ten days later, the same people are given the same paintings and it is often found that the rankings differ markedly from the first instance. The same phenomenon dominates people when they participate in the market. Consequently, the character of the market is deformed solely due to the inconsistency of people participating in the market."}, {"heading": "Introduction to Asymmetric Information", "text": "There are cases where information asymmetry is not desirable, for example in an interview where a human agent (the potential employer) needs to know as much about the potential employee as possible and this issue has been extensively investigated by Nobel Prize winner Michael Spence (Spence, 1973). In this case, the potential employer who is interested in knowing as much information about the employee as possible signals the employee to reveal as much information as possible. Likewise, the potential employee signals information such as qualifications to the potential employer, thereby sending a message that he / she is competent in the job. How does artificial intelligence help solve such an asymmetry of information by signalling? How does big data and deep learning solve this asymmetric dilemma? Of course, social networks, which are often activated by artificial intelligence, are able to signal information much more accurately than a human agent."}, {"heading": "Efficient Market Hypothesis", "text": "In this scenario, Nobel laureate Eugene Fama's theory is that the market contains all the information so that it is impossible to beat the market (Fama, 1965). It follows that the only way to beat the market is to engage in high-risk transactions. Implicit in the efficient market hypothesis is the fact that the agents participating in the market are rational. Of course, we now know that human agents cannot be rational. Theories such as prospectus theory and limited rationality have proven that human agents are not perfectly rational at best, but almost always not rational (Simon, 1974; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Marwala (2015) made artificial intelligent agents more rational than human agents."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This paper proposes that the lower the level of information asymmetry between two artificial intelligent actors than between two human actors, it also postulates that the more artificial intelligence there is in the market, the lower the volume of trade in the market. This is because for trade there should be the asymmetry of information about goods and services to be traded."}], "references": [{"title": "Information Asymmetry, R&D, and Insider Gains", "author": ["D Aboody", "B.
