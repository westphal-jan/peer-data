RELATED WORK", "text": "In recent years, many MIML algorithms have been introduced. To name just a few of the most advanced MIML methods, Zhou and Zhang [4] proposed MIMLSVM by dismantling MIML into one-time multi-label learning, and MIMLBOOST by dismantling MIML into multi-instance single-label learning. Zhang et.al. [6] suggested M3MIML, (i.e. the maximum margin method), which learns from multi-instance multi-label examples with maximum margin strategy, and an adjustment of the radial base function (RBF) [7] MIMLRBF, which is a neural network-style algorithm, is proposed by Zhang et.al. [8]. A MIML method closest to its closest neighbor, MIML-kNN, is proposed by Zhang and Min-Ling [9], the most popular neighboring technologies."}, {"heading": "III. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In this study, we compare the effectiveness of state-of-the-art algorithms that combine multi-level and multi-level learning on a subset of the aforementioned digiPATH project dataset. First, we extract LBP characteristics from regions that consist of expert behavior to provide dense information about the existence and nature of a cancer. Subsequently, the methods mentioned in Section II are trained and tested with these characteristics. Finally, the performance of these methods is evaluated."}, {"heading": "A. Feature Extraction", "text": "We will shortly be using only 120 images from the set and associated diagnoses labeled by three world-class experts. Note that each expert could identify a specific case with more than one diagnosis. Viewing logs from these experts will be used to identify areas of interest (ROI) of the images through the proposed method in the study [3], where these ROIs are detected by taking into account zoom peaks, slow pans and fixation time of more than 2 seconds. Most of the time, information about the mutual spatial arrangement of the nuclei in a tissue is sufficient to detect a breast cancer and its classification as a type of cancer. Therefore, we will first apply a transformation based on the method in [11] to extract truncated ROI images (i.e. Fig. 3 (a) originally located in the RGB color space where the transformation generates a map (i.e. Fig. 3 (b)), which reveals its ductive nuclei (i.e., we extract BP features)."}, {"heading": "B. Methods", "text": "We experimented with six algorithms on our dataset and evaluated the results according to some popular evaluation criteria. All algorithms provide a predicted label set after the test phase. We used this predicted label set and the actual Xi labelset while performing evaluations. Brief description of the algorithms are as follows: MIML-kNN: This algorithm solves a MIML problem by using the popular k-next neighbor techniques. In the light of a set of MIML training examples, it considers its neighbors and citers that consider it as their own neighbors. The MIMLkNN algorithm comprises two different parameters, i.e. r (considering the number of closest neighbors) and c (the number of citers considered). We chose these parameters as r = 10, c = 20.MIMLRBF: This algorithm uses two layers of neural network structure."}, {"heading": "C. Evaluation Metrics", "text": "In traditional supervised learning, accuracy is often used as a criterion for performance evaluation. However, while we learn with multiple instance images associated with multiple labels, accuracy loses importance. Therefore, we have used some other popular metrics that are better suited for MIML, such as hamming loss, single error, coverage, ranking loss, and average precision [12]. \u2022 Hamming loss: It evaluates how often an example label pair is incorrectly classified, i.e. false alarm or misclassification. As it is a loss function, the optimal value for hamming loss is zero. \u2022 One error: It evaluates how often the best-placed label is not in the list of correct labels in the example. Performance is perfect if an error = 0; the lower the value of a single error, the better the performance. \u2022 Ranking loss: It evaluates the average fraction of labels that are incorrectly sorted."}, {"heading": "IV. DISCUSSION", "text": "MIML-kNN achieved the best performance compared to other methods in terms of all evaluation criteria, although MIMLRBF and MIMLBOOST also achieved close performance only due to hammer losses. Furthermore, KISAR performs worst compared to other methods. Although the performance achieved in the experiments is not bad, there is still room for improvement. For example, we used shrunken versions of whole diabetics at a rate of one over sixteen, when using the original images, performance is expected to improve. As the runtime of such a calculation would be very long, we have kept it that way. We used LBP characteristics due to their simplicity, robustness and efficiency. We did not consider histopathological structure that would have to keep a particular cancer type short. A new research topic could be the study of such significant structures. In addition, we extracted the LBP characteristics only from the nucleus channels. This could be improved by using characteristics from H & E staining, LAB channels, etc."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "Finally, we compared six different multi-level, multi-label monitored learning algorithms on a subset of the digiPATH dataset. We then used some popular MIML evaluation criteria to measure their performance. Considering that the dataset has a limited number of samples and MIML learning is a highly complicated learning problem compared to traditional machine learning, we achieved significant performance on almost all approaches, particularly MIML-kNN, which delivered the best performance, with average accuracy of 65.3%."}], "references": [{"title": "P", "author": ["M.
