Tables 1 and 2 show the frequency of key words that clashed with the word \"equality\" in different periods of time. We can see that in different eras, different groups of words were colored with \"equality\" more often than others, and these different collocation sets and their original contexts implied altogether different concepts of \"equality.\" At one stage, people were striving for equality of the nation, when the Qing dynasty was really weak and invaded by the Western powers. At another phase, inequality between the public and private sectors was disrupted after the ordinary nation had turned into an equality."}, {"heading": "2.2.

Building software that helps researchers gather relevant information for further investigation is a necessary part of making the digitized data alive and instrumental. In this paper, we present ourselves with the integrated applications of available data and software for the various types of research problems in history and literature. Our examples show how software tools could help and also shed light on their current limitations. A key prerequisite for the success of historical studies is the reliable and complete capture of documents.
