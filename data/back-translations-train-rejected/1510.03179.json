Ontologies can overcome the disadvantages of partially available, loud, contradictory and heterogeneous data sources [15]. Domain-specific ontologies have already been developed for the renewable energy sector [14, 10, 13]. In this line, we aim to develop an ontology for the field of wind energy. Ontology was developed in the RacerPro (Renamed ABox and Concept Expression Reasoner Professional) knowledge presentation and argumentation system [9]. In our opinion, RacerPro and the associated Knowledge Representation System Specification (KRSS) syntax for Description Logic Axioms are powerful technical tools that support ontology engineering behind the basic capabilities provided by GUI-based ontology editors."}, {"heading": "2 Technical instrumentation", "text": "The wind data is modeled in an ontology that is a semantic framework for the organization of information. We formalize wind data in Description Logic (DL). In Description Logic ALC, concepts are constructed using a series of constructors formed by negation, conjunction, disjunction, value constraint and existential constraints, as in Table 2. Here, C and D represent concept descriptions, while r is a role name. Semantics are defined on the basis of an interpretation I = (I, \u00b7 I), where domain I of1I contains a not empty set of individuals, and the interpretation function \u00b7 I maps each concept name C to a set of individuals, CI, and each role r to a binary relationship rI x \u00b2 I x \u00b2 I. The last column of Table 2 indicates the extent of \u00b7 I for non-atomic concepts."}, {"heading": "3 Reusing related ontologies", "text": "The process of ontology engineering began with: 1) the use cases of ontology, 2) the definition of a set of competence questions, and 3) the analysis of existing ontologies for possible repetition.First, the use cases of ontology include i) \"assessing the feasibility of installing a specific small wind turbine in a specific location\" or ii) verifying whether a small wind project is compatible with current regulations. Second, a solution to narrow the scope of an ontology is to define a list of competence questions (CQs) [16]. CQs are questions an ontology can answer to satisfy use cases, making CQs initial requirements and they can be used to validate ontology."}, {"heading": "4 Engineering the wind potential assessment ontology", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that there will only be one such process in which there will be such a process."}, {"heading": "5 Retrieving information from Aboxes", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to feel as if they are able to play by the rules.
