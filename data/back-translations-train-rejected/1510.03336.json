Yet detecting anomalies in streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to process data in real-time, not batches, and learn while simultaneously making predictions. There are no benchmarks to adequately test and score the efficacy of real-time anomaly detectors. Here we propose the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), which attempts to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of open-source tools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. The perfect detector would detect all anomalies as soon as possible, trigger no false alarms, work with real-world time-series data across a variety of domains, and automatically adapt to changing statistics. Rewarding these characteristics is formalized in NAB, using a scoring algorithm designed for streaming data. NAB evaluates detectors on a benchmark dataset with labeled, real-world time-series data. We present these components, and give results and analyses for several open source, commercially-used algorithms. The goal for NAB is to provide a standard, open source framework with which the research community can compare and evaluate different algorithms for detecting anomalies in streaming data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Oct 2015 15:30:34 GMT  (2335kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03336v1", "14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (IEEE ICMLA), 2015"], ["v2", "Tue, 13 Oct 2015 23:09:58 GMT  (2328kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03336v2", "14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (IEEE ICMLA), 2015.

Benchmark Dataset", "text": "In the current version of NAB, we focus on time series data, in which each line contains a timestamp plus a single scalar value. The requirements are then to (i) include all types of streaming data anomalies, (ii) include a variety of data metrics, and (iii) present common challenges such as noise and the creation of new normal patterns. Anomalous patterns vary significantly from application to application. One-second latency in periodic ECG data could be a significant fluctuation, but the same pattern in stock trading volume can be meaningless. It is therefore important that the NAB dataset includes metrics in a variety of domains and applications. Data currently in the NAB corpus represent a variety of metrics that range from IT metrics such as network usage on industrial machinery to social media chatter. We also refer to some artificially generated data that is not yet represented in the corpus, as well as the one that is not yet in the corpus."}, {"heading": "B.
