It refers to the degree of uncertainty one might have when entering N via logical propositions whose truth values have not been calculated. Much work has been done on a related problem where M is defined as an infinite sequence of numbers when entering N and M (N) as the limit of the sequence output by M when entering N. In this case, M (N) is not compatible and can easily be 1 for all verifiable abilities and 0 for all refutable abilities."}, {"heading": "2 The Benford Test", "text": "Benford's law states that in naturally occurring numbers the leading number d = 1 >. 9} of this number occurs in the base 10 with probability of log10 (1 + 1 d).
