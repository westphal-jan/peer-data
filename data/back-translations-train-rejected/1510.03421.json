We start by comparing two methods of generating such visualizations. First is based on linear principal component analysis (PCA). Second makes use of the modern nonlinear t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding method (t-SNE). We apply both PCA and t-SNE to a corpus of judgments from different courts in Poland. It emerges that t-SNE provides better, more interpretable results than PCA. As a next test, we apply t-SNE to randomly selected sample of common court judgments corresponding to different keywords. We show that t-SNE, in this case, reveals hidden topical structure of the documents related to keyword,,pension\". In conclusion, we find that the t-SNE method could be a promising tool to facilitate the exploitative analysis of legal texts, e.g., by complementing search or browse functionality in legal databases.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Oct 2015 13:52:40 GMT  (1061kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03421v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 09:05:49 GMT  (1405kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03421v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["michal jungiewicz", "micha{\\l} {\\l}opuszy\\'nski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.03421"}, "pdf": {"name": "1510.03421.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Towards Meaningful Maps of Polish Case Law", "authors": ["Micha l JUNGIEWICZ", "Micha l LOPUSZY\u0143SKI"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "Towards Meaningful Maps of Polish", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Case Law", "text": "In fact, most of us have no idea how they are going to behave.

Such maps reflect the structure of analyzed collection by grouping similar documents in a neighbouring regions of 2D space. This visual aid could be useful for browsing and searching, finding anomalous documents or quickly gaining synthetic knowledge about large corpora. We started our study by selecting two automatic methods of generating document maps. First one is a standard method using linear principal component analysis (PCA) and visualizing two most important components on a scatterplot. Second one is a modern nonlinear method of embedding multidimensional data in 2D, namely, the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding method (t-SNE) [1]. t-SNE is optimized to preserve local structure (i.e., very similar documents should end up close together) and to reduce the so called ,,crowding problem\u201d. The ,,crowding problem\u201d is undesired feature of many dimensionality reduction techniques, which essentially place many data points in a very small area of low-dimensional space (hence creating a crowd). These two features make t-SNE unique and frequently used in recent analyses of high-dimensional data. The results of the PCA and t-SNE analysis of 2000 judgments from Polish courts are presented in Figure 1. t-SNE approach forms three well separated clusters which occupy large fraction of available space. For PCA, there is no obvious structure visible, as well as most of the available space remains unused.
