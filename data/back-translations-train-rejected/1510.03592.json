To locate the device, the drone flies over region X in the hope of getting a measurement from the device. Measurements are received at random times. Let's assume that at the time t did not receive measurements with the timestamps t1, t2,... Note that the measurement t1 < t2 <. < tnt < t.

Fig.2 shows the measurements collected from a laptop (Sony Vaio Pro-13 ultrabook) during an exhaustive scan of the region, which took more than 60 minutes. The device is located in the center of the image, and the size and color of the dots correspond to the signal strength. Unfortunately, locating the peak is a challenge due to the fact that the relationship between signal strength and distance is stochastical. This is because the measured signal strength is influenced by the noise, by the transmitter's performance, by the conversion of the receiver, and by the channel characteristics, which include reflection, multi-path scattering and shading. Therefore, at different distances, the distribution of the RSSI is different (whereby the measurements are heteroscedastic)."}, {"heading": "4 Our Approach", "text": "In our scenario, this initial phase takes about 3 minutes. Once the initial phase is complete, it begins the process of localization, in which it repeatedly performs the following tasks when a new measurement is received. 1. Using the data Dt at time t, the drone calculates the (predictive) distribution p (y | x, Dt) for this purpose. This is the probability density function of the measurements y at the candidate sites x \u0445 X in light of past measurements Dt. Gaussian process regression. 2. Based on the distribution, it decides whether to utilize or investigate the expected improvement function. This step is based on the Bayesian optimization framework Brochu et al. [2010].3. The UAV then moves to the new site and waits for a new measurement."}, {"heading": "4.1 Distribution computation using Gaussian Process Regression", "text": "Gaussian process (GP) regression is one of the most popular choices within the Bayesian optimization framework =. It is also particularly suitable for our application for many reasons. First, GP regression is well in small-sample setting which is desirable in our setting since in the beginning of the search we don't have a lot of data. Second, GP regression is not only given predictions but also uncertainty associated with them, which helps us choose between exploration and exploitation (see below). Finally, hyperparameters of GP regression can be easily using maximum likelihood ation, so that easy implementation is possible (see end of this section).In this paper we use a regression model that gives us a Gaussian distribution at each candidate location x. In this paper we assume that the measurements are from a jointly Gaussian distribution."}, {"heading": "4.2 Deciding UAV\u2019s Next Location using Bayesian Optimization", "text": "We use the Bayesian optimization framework to determine the next location to visit. Decisions made on the basis of the distribution N (\u00b5 \u043c | t, \u03c32 \u043c | t) are intuitively based on the two competing objectives: 1. The drone should visit regions that resemble regions where high RSSI measurements have been observed. This is the exploitation step. 2. The drone should also visit unexplored regions that could potentially lead to high RSSI measurements. This is the exploration step. Bayesian optimization takes these two objectives into account by using a detection function Brochu et al. [2010]. In this paper, we use the detection function that measures the expected improvement compared to the location where the last highest RSSI measurement was observed. Let's leave \u00b5 + the greatest mean among the calculated x Dt and the EI function is defined as follows: EI (x): EI (assuming that Dy measurement is D.x) high."}, {"heading": "4.3 Practical Issues", "text": "Initialization by Quick Scan: During the initialization phase, the drone flies with a predetermined trajectory. Starting from the upper left corner of the search area, it reaches the opposite corner and bounces nine times from one edge to the other. The goal of this phase is to collect an initial number of measurements to start the Bayesian optimization algorithm. Stop Rule: The algorithm will stop if we do not improve our estimate. Specifically, we will stop if a few consecutive predictions lie within the same neighborhood of a predefined radius. Minor details on navigation: There are two small details about task 2 that are specifically tailored to our facility. First, the drone we used in our experiment does not travel exactly to the new predetermined location, but flies in a circle around that location with a predefined radius. However, the location where the measurements are received is xt, the actual position of the drone at the time. Second, after we have made a decision to fly to a new location during the V, decisions will not be made about the location of the flight."}, {"heading": "5 Details of UAV", "text": "We can distinguish between two main types of small drones: rotary blades (i.e. multi-copters) and fixed wing sites. Multi-copters fly with the lift force generated by one or more blades (small drones typically have four blades, hence they are called quadricopters), they can take off and land vertically and hover in the air, but they are slow, particularly sensitive to the wind and therefore unsuitable to travel long distances. To cover a large search area, we chose fixed wing UAVs because they fly at higher speeds and higher energy efficiency than quadricopters. For the experiments, we used a rigid wing drone called eBee, developed by SenseFly SenseFly. The vehicle body is made of expanded polypropylene (EPP), and it has a single rear propeller disc driven by an electric motor."}, {"heading": "6 Results", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Hyperparameter Estimation for GP", "text": "As discussed earlier, the selected hyperparameters are those that maximize the log probability protocol p (y | X, \u03b8). They are l = 0.2, \u03c3 = 4.47 and \u03c3f = 3.32. To ensure that we do not match the data, we have tested the selected values against new measurements. Figure 6 (right) shows the MSE between new samples and the mean resulting from the selected hyperparameters. The left side of Figure 6 shows the log probability. We can clearly see that the hyperparameters that maximize the log probability also result in a very low value of MSE, which justifies the choice."}, {"heading": "6.2 Real-Data Based Simulations", "text": "This section reports on simulation results based on real-world measurements. Our results indicate that the proposed method is capable of locating the device with an average error of 50 meters within 5 minutes. Specifically, we simulate the following: 1. The trajectory that the drone follows during the localization process; 2. The RSSI measurements show the random times at which the signals are sent; the details of the last two are explained in the next two paragraphs; the RSSI measurements are scanned from an empirical distribution obtained from the real data in Figure 3. Specifically, the range between [0, 600] meters is divided into 20 containers; for each container, we have derived the corresponding empirical distribution; this distribution is used to draw an RSSI sample for each distance that falls into the bond; the times at which PRFs are transmitted are determined independently."}, {"heading": "6.3 Real-World Experiments", "text": "In this section we present the results of a field experiment. The WiFi device was a Samsung Galaxy Nexus i9250 smartphone, positioned in a square of 1000 x 1000 m2.The drone followed the trajectory shown in Figure 9. Figure 10 shows the localization error over time. We see that within 6 minutes the error is reduced to 50 meters, which confirms the simulation results. The entire flight lasted about 15 minutes, after that the localization error was 18 meters.Figure 11 shows the evolution of the averages and deviations of y, due to the measurements. From the same fiurements, we can also see whether the drone is in exploration or exploitation phases.After 5 minutes, the drone had collected only 7 measurements. The predicted mean value at that time was almost flat with a high deviation almost everywhere (see Figure 11 (a)).The star shows the estimated device position, while the other mariner predicts where we will determine the measurement direction of the next AV and the next 11."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "In summary, both the field trials and the simulation results confirmed the effectiveness of the Bayesian optimization approach combined with GP regression to locate a non-collaborative WiFi device that emits very little PRF. Especially in the field trial, the estimate was within 18 meters of the actual device after 15 minutes."}, {"heading": "A Appendix", "text": "A.1 Expansion to Multiple Devices The sequential extension of the algorithm described in the previous section is simple. After locating the first device, the algorithm repeats the Bayesian search for each other target, while the initialization phase is performed only once at the beginning. To improve the localization of the first target, the UAV can potentially collect packets coming from any other target. Therefore, the algorithm has an advantage when estimating the position of the second target begins, as the dataset is already plentiful. To improve localization efficiency, we have designed a special variant of the algorithm to localize multiple devices. The idea is to fly the UAV in specific locations to collect measurements that may be useful for localizing all M devices. Let's define F as a set that contains the indices of the devices that have not yet been localized. After the initialization phase, F = {1, 2, M}."}, {"heading": "M. Saxena, P. Gupta, and B.N. Jain.
