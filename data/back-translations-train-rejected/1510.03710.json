Here, we simplify the original rules for slot tracking (as opposed to [10] where we tracked the slots jointly) and we add the machine learning component that provides parameters for these rules. We call the resulting architecture a hybrid tracker. The tracker operates on a probability distribution across the values for each slot separately. For each slot, the tracker generates these distributions that reflect the user's goals based on the last machine action, the probability distributions in the previous round and the hidden state lt \u2212 1 of a recursive network L from the previous round."}, {"heading": "2.1 Rule-based part", "text": "The rules-based part of the tracker, represented by the R function, consists of several simple update rules parameterized by the parameters cnew and coverride1. Each of the parameters controls the transition probability in a different way: \u2022 cnew - controls how easy it would be to change the faith from hypothesis None to an instantiated slot value, \u2022 coverride - models a change in goal, that is, how easy it would be to override the current faith with a new observation. In this work, we calculate these parameters using a neural network. The rules-based part of our tracker is specified by the following equations: The first equation sets the faith-based update rule for the probability that the slot value v1: hst [v1] s \u2212 1 [v1] \u2212 h \u2212 st \u2212 st \u2212 st st st \u2212 st st st st st st st st st [v1] + is [vst [v1] - vst = 1 (vst)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Machine learned part", "text": "The machine learning part of our tracker is realized by an LSTM [13] network. We use a recursive network for L, because it can learn to output different values of c parameters for different parts of the dialog (e.g. it is more likely that new hypotheses will arise at the beginning of a dialog).In this way, the recursive network influences the rules-based component of the tracker. As there are only two parameters used by the rules-based part, the decisions of the tracker can easily be introspected.The L function uses the fs feature, which is the recursive representation of the tracked slot, and the fm feature, which is a bag of words representing machine actions. The last feature of the L function is the pre-processed user action, which represents marginal probabilities of informed values for slots. In our tracker, we use a machine-learned model, which is shared for all slots. However, the model may differentiate between one slot after another, each slot is used by the other."}, {"heading": "3 Evaluation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Method", "text": "The parameters of the hybrid tracker were trained by SGD with AdaGrad [15] and Adam [16] weight update rules. This is possible because all parts of the model are differentiable (including the R function).1These parameters were modeled by a so-called durability function in our previous tracker [10].We trained two groups of trackers with different settings, the first group was characterized by the AdaGrad algorithm with the learning rate 0.5 and the gradient clipping with the threshold 10. With this setting, the tracker produced strongly by random initialization, which is good for the subsequent location of the trackers. For the second group, we used the learning rate 0.01, \u03b21 and \u03b22 0.999. These settings are much more invariant than random initialization."}, {"heading": "3.2 Results", "text": "Table 1 shows the results of our hybrid tracker and other high-performance trackers known from the literature. In the category of trackers that only use the Live SLU features, our systems use state-of-the-art technology with an accuracy of 0.745 on the dstc2 test. The accuracy of the tracker on dstc2-Dev is 0.657 and 0.767 on the dstc2 train."}, {"heading": "3.3 Discussion", "text": "The evaluation of the DSTC2 dataset shows that our hybrid system, which extends the rule-based tracking core with the machine learning component, surpasses the previous best tracker [20], which used the same SLU input. This result is also interesting because our ML component is relatively light (it has only about 10k parameters, the hidden state consists of only 5 neurons) and affects the calculation of the rule part only by 2 parameters."}, {"heading": "4 Future Work and Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced a credibility tracker that combines our previous tracker with machine learning techniques. It performs better than our previous tracker and is still highly interpretable compared to pure neural networking approaches. However, trackers that use ASR as input achieve even higher accuracy, so the next step is to add ASR functionality to our machine learning component, which will hopefully allow us to further improve the accuracy of our system."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was partly financed by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic under the funding agreement LK11221 and the nuclear research funding of Charles University in Prague."}], "references": [{"title": "The Dialog State Tracking Challenge", "author": ["J.
