This research proposes a language independent bi-sentence filtering approach based on Polish (not a position-sensitive language) to English experiments. This cleaning approach was developed on the TED Talks corpus and also initially tested on the Wikipedia comparable corpus, but it can be used for any text domain or language pair. The proposed approach implements various heuristics for sentence comparison. Some of them leverage synonyms and semantic and structural analysis of text as additional information.

In addition, some sentences do not have to contain any corresponding translation at all in the corpus. Also, the corpus may contain bad or indirect translations, making alignment difficult and the quality of the data poor. Thus, it is a complicated West Slavic language with complex elements and grammatical rules. Moreover, the Polish language has a large vocabulary due to many endings and prefixes changed by word declension."}, {"heading": "2 Problem Analysis", "text": "However, most rare parallel translation methods can be defined as containing translations of the same document into two or more languages, and such data should be matched at least at the sentence level. A noisy parallel corpus contains bilingual sentences that are not perfectly aligned or of poor translation quality. Nevertheless, most bilingual translations of a particular document should be available in two or more languages. A comparable corpus is composed of non-sentence documents and not translated, but the documents should be thematically oriented."}, {"heading": "2.2 Wikipedia \u2013 Comparable Corpora", "text": "This year it has come to the point where it will be able to put itself at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said.\" We have to put ourselves at the top, \"he said."}, {"heading": "3 Proposed Corpora Filter", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to play by the rules that they have set themselves, and they are able to play by the rules that they have set by the rules."}, {"heading": "4 Existing Evaluation Techniques", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "5 Comparison Experiments", "text": "(...).

In addition, the proposed approach is language-independent for languages with a structure similar to PL or EN. Results show that the proposed method performs well in terms of statistical evaluation of machine translations. In summary, the method can also be used to improve noisy data as well as comparable data. The filter method yielded a better score than the basic system and would most likely improve the output quality of other MT systems.In unattended learning for many tasks, the two-sentence extraction task is becoming increasingly popular. This method overcomes the differences between English and Polish or any other West Slavic language. It is a language-independent method that is easily adaptable to a new environment, and it requires only a small adjustment of the initial text results, which are comparable in practice."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgements", "text": "This work is supported by the European Community from the European Social Fund within the framework of the Interkadra project UDA-POKL-04.01.01-00-014 / 10-00 and EuBridge 7th FR EU project (Funding Agreement No. 287658)."}], "references": [{"title": "Segmentation and alignment of parallel text for statistical machine translation,", "author": ["Y.
