Nowadays, we have several machine translation systems available in the web, which provide reasonable translations. However, these systems are not perfect, and their quality may decrease in some specific domains. This paper examines the effects of different training methods when it comes to Polish - English Statistical Machine Translation system used for the medical data. Numerous elements of the EMEA parallel text corpora and not related OPUS Open Subtitles project were used as the ground for creation of phrase tables and different language models including the development, tuning and testing of these translation systems. The BLEU, NIST, METEOR, and TER metrics have been used in order to evaluate the results of various systems. Our experiments deal with the systems that include POS tagging, factored phrase models, hierarchical models, syntactic taggers, and other alignment methods. We also executed a deep analysis of Polish data as preparatory work before automatized data processing such as true casing or punctuation normalization phase. Normalized metrics was used to compare results. Scores lower than 15% mean that Machine Translation engine is unable to provide satisfying quality, scores greater than 30% mean that translations should be understandable without problems and scores over 50 reflect adequate translations. The average results of Polish to English translations scores for BLEU, NIST, METEOR, and TER were relatively high and ranged from 70,58 to 82,72. The lowest score was 64,38. The average results ranges for English to Polish translations were little lower (67,58 - 78,97). The real-life implementations of presented high quality Machine Translation Systems are anticipated in general medical practice and telemedicine.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Oct 2015 16:02:50 GMT  (398kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04600v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["krzysztof wo{\\l}k", "krzysztof marasek", "wojciech glinkowski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.04600"}, "pdf": {"name": "1510.04600.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Telemedicine as a Special Case of Machine Translation", "authors": ["Krzysztof Wo\u0142k", "Krzysztof Marasek", "Wojciech Glinkowski"], "emails": ["w.glinkowski@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "Telemedicine as a Special Case of Machine Translation", "text": "Krzysztof Wo\u0142k 1, Krzysztof Marasek 1 and Wojciech Glinkowski 2, 31 Department of MultimediaPolish - Japanese Academy of Information Technology2 Chair and Department of Musculoskeletal Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Competence Centre \"TeleOrto\" for telediagnostics and treatment of diseases and injuries of the musculoskeletal system, Warsaw Medical University 3 Polish Society of Telemedicine, Warsaw, Poland"}, {"heading": "Corresponding Author:", "text": "Dr. Wojciech Glinkowski, Ph.D. Chair of Orthopaedics and Traumatology of the Musculoskeletal System, Competence Center \"TeleOrto\" for telediagnostics and treatment of diseases and injuries of the musculoskeletal system, Warsaw Medical University Lindleya str.402-005 Warsaw"}, {"heading": "POLAND", "text": "Tel: + 48225021197Fax: + 48225022100E-mail: w.glinkowski @ gmail.com"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "It is not only a question of time until the world is in order, but also of time until the world is in order.

This corpus was compiled from the agency's biomedical PDF documents and includes documents relating to medical devices and their translations into 22 official languages of the European Union. It contains about 1,500 documents for most languages, but not all are available in every language [14]. It comprises about 80 MB of data and 1,044,764 sentences composed of 11.67 million words that were not sufficiently collected; the data is pure text encoded in UTF-8; in addition, the texts were divided into sentences (one per line) and structured into language pairs. We chose this corpus as being the most similar to drug texts (to which we did not have access in sufficient quantity) in terms of complexity and vocabulary; the vocabulary consisted of 148,170 unique Polish and 109,326 unique English toxins [15]."}, {"heading": "English Data Preparation", "text": "The preparation of the English data was much less complicated than that of the Polish data. We developed a tool to clean the English data by eliminating foreign words, strange symbols, etc. Compared to the Polish data, the English data contained drastically fewer errors. However, some problems had to be fixed. The most problematic were translations into languages other than English itself, including strange UTF-8 symbols, repetitions and unfinished sentences. Such errors are typical when corpora are created using automatic tools."}, {"heading": "Methods of Evaluation", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them are able to hold their own, and that they are able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to reform itself."}, {"heading": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "It was a little surprising that the actual situation in the EU was reduced by a significant factor. We believe that the texts have already been adequately packaged and punctuated. In Experiment 02, we noticed that OSM has lowered some metrics. It increases the quality of translations. Nevertheless, in the PL- > EN debate, the situation in the EU has only slightly improved, but on the other hand, other metrics have decreased. Similar results can be seen in the EN- > PL translation attempts. In this case, the BLEU rating has improved, but most other metrics have not."}, {"heading": "Tab.3 SMT Output", "text": "In fact, it is in such a way that most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move,"}, {"heading": "Future Work", "text": "Improved access to diverse medical information can be very profitable for patients, healthcare professionals, and ultimately medical researchers. Human interpreters with appropriate medical training are extremely rare and costly. Machine translation could also be helpful in evaluating medical history, diagnoses, appropriate medical treatments, health information, and the insights of medical researchers around the world. Mobile devices, the Internet, and web applications can be used to promote the provision of machine translation services for medical purposes, even as real-time language services. Several potential opportunities for future work are of interest and help us expand our research in this critical area. Additional experiments with advanced language models are warranted to improve SMT scores. Much of the literature [27] confirms that interpolating foreign language models and adapting additional bilingual corpora would improve translation quality."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This work was supported by the European Community from the European Social Fund within the framework of the Interkadra project UDA-POKL-04.01.01-00-014 / 10-00 and EuBridge 7th FR EU project (Funding Agreement No. 287658)."}, {"heading": "Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL): 2007; Prague, Czech", "text": "Republic; 2007: 177-180.17.
