One of the main characteristics is the vehicle speed profile across the route. The profile will translate directly into energy requirements for a given vehicle. However, the vehicle speed that a given driver chooses will vary from driver to driver and from time to time, and may be slower, equal to, or faster than the average traffic flow. If the specific driver speed profile can be predicted, the energy usage can be optimized across the route chosen. The purpose of this paper is to research the application of Deep Learning techniques to this problem to identify at the beginning of a drive cycle the driver specific vehicle speed profile for an individual driver repeated drive cycle, which can be used in an optimization algorithm to minimize the amount of fossil fuel energy used during the trip.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Oct 2015 05:52:59 GMT  (506kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07208v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["joe lemieux", "yuan ma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07208"}, "pdf": {"name": "1510.07208.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Vehicle Speed Prediction using Deep Learning", "authors": ["Joe Lemieux", "Yuan Ma"], "emails": ["jjlemieu@umich.edu", "myuan@umich.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far as it has this year."}, {"heading": "A.

The following experiments are being conducted and standard points have been extracted. The teachings of the stacked auto encoder are now being performed.
