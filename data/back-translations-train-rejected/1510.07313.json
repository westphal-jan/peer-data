However, making the assumption that such temporal properties are deterministic is far from the reality. For example, many of the properties the controller has to satisfy are learned through machine learning techniques based on sensor input data. In this paper, we propose a new logic, Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic (PrSTL), as an expressive language to define the stochastic properties, and enforce probabilistic guarantees on them. We further show how to synthesize safe controllers using this logic for cyber-physical systems under the assumption that the stochastic properties are based on a set of Gaussian random variables. One of the key distinguishing features of PrSTL is that the encoded logic is adaptive and changes as the system encounters additional data and updates its beliefs about the latent random variables that define the safety properties. We demonstrate our approach by synthesizing safe controllers under the PrSTL specifications for multiple case studies including control of quadrotors and autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Oct 2015 22:02:48 GMT  (330kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07313v1", "10 pages, 6 figures, Submitted to HSCC 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 6 figures, Submitted to HSCC 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.AI cs.LO cs.RO", "authors": ["dorsa sadigh", "ashish kapoor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07313"}, "pdf": {"name": "1510.07313.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Safe Control under Uncertainty", "authors": ["Dorsa Sadigh", "Ashish Kapoor"], "emails": ["dsadigh@berkeley.edu", "akapoor@microsoft.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1.

PRELIMINARIES", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Hybrid Dynamical System", "text": "We consider a continuous dynamic time hybrid system as: x-t = f (xt, ut) yt = g (xt, ut). (1) Here xt-X (Rnc \u00b7 {0, 1} nd) is a signal representing the continuous and discrete mode of the system at present t, ut-U (Rmc \u00b7 {0, 1} md) is the control input and yt-Y (Rpc \u00b7 {0, 1} pd) is the output of the system at present. This continuous system can be discredited with time intervals dt > 0, and each discrete time step is k = bt / dtc. The discrete time hybrid dynamic system is formalized as: xk + 1 = fd (xk, uk) yk = gd (xk, uk) yk = positive (2)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Controller Synthesis for Signal Temporal Logic", "text": "Signal-temporal logic (STL) is an expressive framework that makes it possible to think about real-time density-time functions evaluated, and that is widely used to define robustness and monitor the properties of real-time signals of hybrid systems. More recently, there has been interest in synthesizing controllers that meet STL properties [34, 35]. Formally, this means that a signal meets the STL formula \"in due time.\" An atomic predicate of an STL formula is represented by inequalities of form \"(t) > 0, where \u00b5 is a function of the signal system\" in due time. \"The truth value of the predicate\" \u00b5 \"(t) > 0. Each STL formula consists of Boolean and temporal operations based on these predicates and the syntax of STL formulas."}, {"heading": "3.3 Bayesian Methods to Model Uncertainty", "text": "Probability theory provides a natural way to represent environmental uncertainty and recent advances in machine learning and perceptual practice; the two main components comprise (a) Bayean networks (equivalent graphical models), which enable the expression of complex interactions between sets of latent variables, and (b) the Bayean inference procedure, which computes numerically probability distributions across variables of interest. One of the key aspects of Bayean methodology is that, unlike other optimization methods, the entire distributions are available across the variables of interest. Such distributions characterize the uncertainty in the system and are critical to our goal of synthesizing secure controllers. While a thorough discussion of Bayesian networks and associated methods of modelling uncertainty goes beyond the scope of this paper, we emphasize these methods on the task of classification."}, {"heading": "4. PROBLEM STATEMENT", "text": "The key idea of our work is to first integrate random variables into predicates and then express temporal and Boolean operations on such predicates. The proposed logic provides a meaningful framework for defining security conditions under a variety of uncertainties, including the uncertainty created by the use of classifiers for machine learning. At the core of this work is the recognition that when uncertainty about the random variable is established in a Bayesian framework, we can use the probability distributions derived from it to efficiently derive constraints from the PrSTL specifications. We offer a novel solution for synthesizing controllers for dynamic systems with different PrSTL characteristics. An interesting aspect of this framework is that the PrSTL formulas can evolve at each step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic", "text": "PrSTL supports probabilistic temporal properties based on real-time dense time signals. Specifically, this means that the signal meets the PrSTL formula at each time step. We introduce the concept of a probabilistic atomic predicate based on a PrSTL formula parameterized with a time-varying random variable. (7) Here, P () represents the probability of the event and 1 \u2212 t defines the tolerance level of the probabilistic properties. The parameter t [0, 1] is a small time-varying positive number and represents the threshold based on the satisfaction probability of (t) < (4) < (4) the threshold based on the satisfaction probability. (5) The number t is a small time-varying positive number and represents the threshold based on the satisfaction probability of (t)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Controller Synthesis for Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic", "text": "In this section we will show how to solve the optimization for the general case of PrSTL by applying the formula to a mixed problem."}, {"heading": "5.

For all the examples we tested, the optimization was calculated in less than 2 seconds at each step on a 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 processor with 16 GB of memory. We show some of our results on controlling quadrotors and autonomous driving in unsafe environments."}, {"heading": "5.1 Quadrotor Control", "text": "In this case study, we will show how the properties of different models of uncertainty can be expressed over time, and we will find an optimal strategy under such uncertain environments. We will follow the derivation of the dynamic model of a quadrotor in [19]. We will consider a 12-dimensional system in which the state consists of the position and velocity of the quadrotor x, y, z and x, both in the derivation of the dynamic model of a quadrotor and in the sequence of the position and velocity of the quadrotor x, y, z and x."}, {"heading": "5.2 Autonomous Driving", "text": "In our second case study, we look at an autonomous driving scenario, so that a yellow car is safe when it turns the traffic. We use a simple point-mass model to define the dynamics of the vehicles on the road. (We let the state of the system be defined so that there is a crash where U1 is the driving input, and U2 is the acceleration. We also write the dynamics of the vehicle as: X-V-Kos (V-KO) y y-KO-KO = V-KO-KO-KO-KO = V-KO-KO (KO-KO) y-KO (KO-KO) y-KO (KO-KO) y-KO (KO-KO) y-KO (KO-KO). We refer to the vehicle we control autonomously and the yellow car as the surrounding vehicle. We want to find a strategy for the ego-KO (KO-KO) y-KO (KO) y-KO (KO)."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "Key contributions include the definition of PrSTL, a logic for expressing probabilistic properties that enables the embedding of Bayesian graphical models. We also show how the control can be synthesized in a retreating horizontal frame under PrSTL specifications that express Bayesian linear classifiers. Another characteristic aspect of this work is that the resulting logic adapts as more data is observed with the evolution of the system. We show the effectiveness of the approach by synthesizing secure strategies for a quadrotor and an autonomous vehicle that moves in uncertain environments. The approach presented easily extends to distributions other than Gauss on Bayesian approximation techniques [28, 4] that can project distributions onto Gaussian densities."}, {"heading": "7.

that satisfy temporal specifications expressing various system properties is a challenging problem that has drawn the attention of many researchers. However, making the assumption that such temporal properties are deterministic is far from the reality. For example, many of the properties the controller has to satisfy are learned through machine learning techniques based on sensor input data. In this paper, we propose a new logic, Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic (PrSTL), as an expressive language to define the stochastic properties, and enforce probabilistic guarantees on them. We further show how to synthesize safe controllers using this logic for cyber-physical systems under the assumption that the stochastic properties are based on a set of Gaussian random variables. One of the key distinguishing features of PrSTL is that the encoded logic is adaptive and changes as the system encounters additional data and updates its beliefs about the latent random variables that define the safety properties. We demonstrate our approach by synthesizing safe controllers under the PrSTL specifications for multiple case studies including control of quadrotors and autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
