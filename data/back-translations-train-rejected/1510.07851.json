There is no purchase on Amazon or search on Google that does not result from suggestions or variants that the service spontaneously generated after linguistically processing the approximate query. Nevertheless, these software components for language technology practitioners are part of a continuous stream of research and development that began immediately after World War II with the first attempts at machine translation. Whether spell checker, information retrieval or machine translation, all of these software components rely on so-called linguistic resources, ranging from different types of lexical data to complex enterprises consisting of annotated texts or spoken dialogues. The development of trustworthy language resources has also been driven by the emergence of machine learning techniques and their systematic applications for almost all of the above-mentioned NP [1]."}, {"heading": "Standards and formats", "text": "Standards not only reflect practices as they were at the time they were drawn up - they should also be designed to anticipate future applications, especially IT standards, where the large turnover of computer languages, formats and technologies is a critical factor. In the field of data representation, standards should therefore serve as modelling platforms that allow the user to find the best match between standards and requirements. To meet this challenge, we are desperate to optimize the application context so that it conforms to the ISO 16642 standard for terminology databases, rather than optimizing its applications, in order to completely drop the idea of conformity in some cases. To meet this challenge, we have adopted the data modeling strategy initiated in ISO TC 37 / SC 3 with the ISO 16642 standard for terminology databases. In short, the modeling principle is based on the idea that data structures can be structured into a metamoid XO that can be structured organically."}, {"heading": "XML world", "text": "Choosing a good format illustrates the difficulty of standardizing a technical solution within a digital landscape where new practices or trendy solutions are regularly emerging. However, the development of data exchange formats has benefited greatly from the stable background provided by SGML (ISO 8879) and its successor XML (W3C recommendation). Indeed, the requirement for XML to provide data representation that is both expressive and human-readable has broadened the scope, as IT specialists and data practitioners need to efficiently reconcile their viewpoints. So it was natural for ISO TC 37 / SC 4 to adopt XML from the outset as the systematic language for which we would provide support in standardizing concrete data representations. We have managed to avoid the temptation to design ad hoc XML formats within our standards, relying as much as possible on existing best practices in the community."}, {"heading": "Overview of the TC 37/SC 4 portfolio", "text": "There are two reasons why it is the way it is: there are two reasons why it must be the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is, that it is the way it is the way it is. \""}, {"heading": "The central role of the TEI guidelines", "text": "The evolution of the ISO TC 37 / SC 4 portfolio is understandable when we look back to the fact that the committee was created in the wake of the TEI Guidelines in the 1990s. Building on the strong vision of predecessors such as Antonio Zampolli, ISO TC 37 / SC 4 was designed to complement the strong infrastructural foundations of document presentation offered by the TEI Guidelines. Meanwhile, the TEI Guidelines have become one of the most effective XML applications in the document world, covering most, if not all, digital humanities, but also large documentation applications such as the two hundred million documents of the European Patent Office. Collectively, the TEI Guidelines have two key players in the document world.
