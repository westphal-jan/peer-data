Motivated by the recent learning-based PCG framework and other existing PCG works, we propose an alternative approach to online content generation and adaptation in Super Mario Bros (SMB). Unlike most of existing works in SMB, our approach exploits the synergy between rule-based and learning-based methods to produce constructive primitives, quality yet controllable game segments in SMB. As a result, a complete quality game level can be generated online by integrating relevant constructive primitives via controllable parameters regarding geometrical features and procedure-level properties. Also the adaptive content can be generated in real time by dynamically selecting proper constructive primitives via an adaptation criterion, e.g., dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA). Our approach is of several favorable properties in terms of content quality assurance, generation efficiency and controllability. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate controllable yet quality game levels online and adaptable content for DDA in real time.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 12:42:54 GMT  (804kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07889v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 20:09:42 GMT  (803kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07889v2", "12 pages, 13 figures, journal paper submission"], ["v3", "Mon, 2 Nov 2015 11:47:32 GMT  (804kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07889v3", "v1 is invalid because a wrong license was chosen"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peizhi shi", "ke chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07889"}, "pdf": {"name": "1510.07889.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning Constructive Primitives for Online Level Generation and Real-time Content Adaptation in Super Mario Bros", "authors": ["Peizhi Shi"], "emails": ["shipa@cs.manchester.ac.uk;", "chen@cs.manchester.ac.uk)."], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Proper use of PCG techniques is expected to drastically reduce the cost of game design and development.

A typical example of customization to the geometry is the personalized level generator in SMB [17], [18]. This level generator is controllable so that different levels of play can be created with a number of controllable characteristics. To customize content, an affective model was created to map a player's behavior and controllable content characteristics to each of the affective states of the gamer.With such a model, the level generator can create personalized levels of play for an individual. For effective mapping, controllable content characteristics were selected based on their effects on affective states."}, {"heading": "III.

Content Space", "text": "Based on our observation from empirical studies, it is sufficient to cover rich but diverse types of games by using a4 game segments of 20 cm in length and 15 cm in height. Some typical game segments are specified in Fig. 2.The content of the SMB is, of course, specified by a 2D grid similar to an image. However, in our case this results in a 300-dimensional content space in which there is a lot of redundancy, e.g. the uniform background. Motivated by the previous work [6] we use a list of design elements as representation of the content space, in which a design element refers to an atomic unit used in procedural content generation [1], [6] e.g. enemies, boxes, coins, cannons, gaps, etc. Through this representation we can not only concisely specify the content space, but also gain the direct controllability of content attributes at a lower level, e.g. coordinates of coins, cannons, gaps, etc."}, {"heading": "C. Conflict Resolution", "text": "For example... \"Tube (7,2,3,4,4, flower)... Cannon (7,3,1,3,2)... represents a game segment consisting of at least one tube and one cannon, but their x-coordinates are the same. Cannon and tube thus overlap and this contradictory situation makes the game segment aesthetically unattractive. Motivated by the previous work [6], [7] we adapt a rule class set out in [6] to our requirements. As a result, the conflict resolution rules effectively discard those game segments of geometrically overlapped design elements such as gap, enemy, tube, cannon, boxes and coins."}, {"heading": "D.

Real-time Content Adaptation", "text": "For content customization, we limit our work on CPs to Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) only, where the difficulty of the game is automatically adjusted to a player's performance (DDA, it is essential to define a player's difficulty and measure a player's performance).In our work, a difficulty parameter of five difficulty levels is defined for each survival, based on its relevant design elements that affect a player's performance, such as the number and type of enemies, the number of gaps, the number of cannons and tubular flowers. For example, a CP of highest difficulty contains at least two enemies, one cannon and one gap, while there is at most one goomba and one blossom tube in a CP of lowest difficulty level. Measuring a player's performance can be complicated when all aspects need to be taken into account. In our work, we simplify this by including only the survival rate of CPs in our accountability-based CP methodology with the help of segmenting DDA."}, {"heading": "V.

Results on Constructive Primitive Learning", "text": "Based on the learning algorithm described in paragraph III, Fig. 4 illustrates the evolutionary performance of our active learning on the validation set, including the error rates of types I and II and their average, half the total error rate (HTER). Fig. 4 shows that active learning converges according to 1100 data points. While the final HTER error rate is about 11.67%, the corresponding Type I error rate is about 19.66%, and some misclassified segment instances are shown in Fig. 5 (A). Analyzing the cluster results, we find that these segments are concentrated in a fairly small region in the content space. Therefore, it is unlikely that they will be evaluated in such a way that they are overlooked in determining the validation rate. Fig. 4 shows that our cost-sensitive classifier performs well in minimizing the Type II error; the Type II error rate is classified as high-quality, with approximately 3.69% of these elements below."}, {"heading": "B.

of great interest to game design and development as it generates game content automatically. Motivated by the recent learning-based PCG framework and other existing PCG works, we propose an alternative approach to online content generation and adaptation in Super Mario Bros (SMB). Unlike most of existing works in SMB, our approach exploits the synergy between rule-based and learning-based methods to produce constructive primitives, quality yet controllable game segments in SMB. As a result, a complete quality game level can be generated online by integrating relevant constructive primitives via controllable parameters regarding geometrical features and procedure-level properties. Also the adaptive content can be generated in real time by dynamically selecting proper constructive primitives via an adaptation criterion, e.g., dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA). Our approach is of several favorable properties in terms of content quality assurance, generation efficiency and controllability. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate controllable yet quality game levels online and adaptable content for DDA in real time.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
