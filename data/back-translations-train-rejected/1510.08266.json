These are notoriously hard graph staining problems that involve matching colors to the margins of a complete diagram. One (r1,.., rk; n) Ramsey staining is a graph staining in k colors of the complete diagram Kn, which is not a monochromatic complete sub-graph crystal in color i for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. The set of all such staining is referred to as R (r1,.,.,., rk). The Ramsey number R (r1,.,., rk) is the least n > 0 such that no (r1,., rk; n) staining exists. Specifically, the number R (4, 3, 3) is often presented as the unknown Ramsey number with the best chance to be found for 50 years, yet unknown. \""}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries and Notation", "text": "In this paper, graphs are always simple, i.e. unaligned and without self-loops.
