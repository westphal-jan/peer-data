GeoTutor has the ability to synthesize personalized tasks for students, create analog but distinct exercises to reduce fraud, and give the teacher the ability to automatically generate interesting tasks, exam questions and their solutions. Generating problems for tasks or exams is a difficult and lengthy process for a teacher, and the gift of time for a teacher is the most valuable asset for the education of all children. Time means more individual attention for each student so that teachers can do what they do best: teach students. In the future, we plan to deploy GeoTutor in secondary schools and conduct user studies to understand its effectiveness in an educational environment."}], "references": [{"title": "U", "author": ["Ahmed"], "venue": "Z.; Gulwani, S.; and Karkare, A.", "citeRegEx": "Ahmed.
