Re-evaluating the bar for energy disaggregation", "abstract": "Since the early 1980s, the research community has developed ever more sophisticated algorithms for the problem of energy disaggregation, but despite decades of research, there is still a dearth of applications with demonstrated value. In this work, we explore a question that is highly pertinent to this research community: how good does energy disaggregation need to be in order to infer characteristics of a household? We present novel techniques that use unsupervised energy disaggregation to predict both household occupancy and static properties of the household such as size of the home and number of occupants. Results show that basic disaggregation approaches performs up to 30% better at occupancy estimation than using aggregate power data alone, and are up to 10% better at estimating static household characteristics. These results show that even rudimentary energy disaggregation techniques are sufficient for improved inference of household characteristics. To conclude, we re-evaluate the bar set by the community for energy disaggregation accuracy and try to answer the question \"how good is good enough?\"", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 08:34:07 GMT  (1986kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08713v1", "Under submission to Percom 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Under submission to Percom 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nipun batra", "rishi baijal", "amarjeet singh", "kamin whitehouse"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.08713"}, "pdf": {"name": "1510.08713.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "How good is good enough?

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "text": "In the early 1980s, George Hart presented the groundbreaking work on Energy Breakdown, or Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) [15], which was motivated to provide utilities with a platform for large-scale residential load research; for end users, energy breakdown would: 1) enable demand response by shifting loads; 2) provide detailed energyar Xiv: 151 0.08 713v 1 [cs.L G] 26 Oct 201 5break to end users; and 3) identify faulty equipment and other power-related anomalies. There are three major directions of work in the community - methods of energy breakdown and traditional metrics; data fusion to improve NILM accuracy; and applications of energy breakdown, which we are now all discussing."}, {"heading": "A. Energy disaggregation techniques and traditional metrics", "text": "The introduction of intelligent measuring devices and the availability of public data sets such as REDD [20] have led to renewed interest in this field in recent years. In the literature, a number of disaggregation algorithms have been proposed over the last three decades, especially in recent years. These approaches can be broadly categorized into monitored and unsupervised. 1. Parson et al. [23] suggest uncontrolled techniques for iterative disaggregation of loads based on previous models of general device types. Kolter et al. [19] suggest methods for approximate inference in additive factorial hidden Markov methods (AFHMM). In addition to the low frequency approaches mentioned above, such as the above, the research [14] has examined high frequency characteristics (several kHz or more) to detect devices that use little electricity, such as electronic devices. Traditionally, NILM metrics based on the problem of measurement accuracy of the metric events, NILM metrics are used to evaluate the measurement accuracy of the measurements based on the accuracy of the metric events."}, {"heading": "B. Data fusion to improve NILM accuracy", "text": "De-aggregation in real homes poses several challenges, such as the presence of similar devices, multiple cases of the same devices, and the presence of energy-saving electronics. Recent work has focused on merging data from multiple ubiquitous sensors to improve the accuracy of NILM in such cases. Pathak et al. [25] and Saha et al. [27] discuss the potential of using acoustic and user WiFi data to localize device usage. Similarly, Akshay et al. [1] improve the accuracy of existing NILM approaches by exploiting the relationship between a user's location achieved through the localization of WiFi and the use of devices."}, {"heading": "C. Applications of energy disaggregation", "text": "Previous literature has argued that providing information at the device level can help end users reduce their energy consumption by up to 15% [12], but recently the applicability and usefulness of the energy breakdown has been called into question.

Recent work has attempted to answer this question. Parson et al. [24] use uncontrolled energy breakdown algorithms to derive refrigerator consumption for 117 households in the UK. Their goal is to provide feedback on the energy money divergences arising from the switch to new energy efficient refrigerators."}, {"heading": "III. PREDICTING HOUSEHOLD OCCUPANCY", "text": "Various smart home applications use the home for optimized air conditioning and lighting controls [2], [4], [13]. Occupancy information is also used to track occupants and to track other activities of daily life in the direction of health applications. Occupancy in homes is traditionally monitored with sensors such as passive infrared (PIR), CO2, etc., but these sensors are intrusive in nature. Previous work also shows that the provision of homes is poorly scaled in terms of cost and effort [6], [16]. As a viable alternative, previous research suggests deriving occupancy from the household electricity meter. As smart meters are introduced by utilities and installed outside the home, they scale both in terms of cost and use and are not intrusive in nature. Figure 1 shows the relationship between electricity and occupancy of a house that consumes more electricity when occupied. We will now discuss two short-term approaches to predicting the energy characteristics of the household, the one of which is the other."}, {"heading": "A. Existing approaches", "text": "Previous approaches by Kleiminger et al. [18] and Chen et al. [11] use a similar idea of determining characteristics in the overall performance of the household that indicate occupancy, and both algorithms discuss predicting occupancy outside of the night hours. We will discuss these two algorithms in more detail 1) Kleiminger et al. [18]: Calculation of characteristics such as average and standard deviation of occupancy over a window of time to predict occupancy. High averages typically indicate consumption of devices with different capacity (such as TVs or laptops) or frequent device changes, both of which indicate occupancy. Kleiminger et al use standard machine learning classifiers in the monitored settings to predict occupancy. [11] Kleiminger et al."}, {"heading": "B. Our approach", "text": "Our most important intuition is that residents interact with devices that cause events in the current flow, while background loads such as refrigerators function independently of residents. Therefore, we separate the periodic background loads and forecast occupancy based on the remaining total tracks, with no further differentiation. Our approach is as follows: We only need to find events that correspond to the background load that turns on and off, and we do not really need to find the energy consumption of these loads, as is normally the practice in energy aggregation research. Our approach is as follows: 1) Event detection: We first find events in the current that use the uncontrolled event detection method in Hart's ground-breaking NILM algorithm [15], as implemented in NILMTK [7], [17]. An event should occur when the total performance changes beyond a threshold. 2) The burden of removing the background load: Thus, some of these events are like HVAC and the refrigerator."}, {"heading": "C. Datasets", "text": "We now describe the two datasets we use to evaluate the performance of our approach 1) Our dataset:: We collected aggregated electricity data at 1 Hz from a single resident of an apartment in Delhi for 12 days using the EM6400 smart meters.The resident tagged each time she left or entered the apartment to record the actual occupancy, and the occupancy logs were independently validated by two researchers and proved to be accurate.2) ECO dataset:: The ECO dataset was collected over an 8-month period in the summer and winter season from 5 households in Switzerland. The dataset also captured device level performance data at 1 Hz, household aggregate power data at 1 Hz, and occupancy data manually entered by residents on tablets. Passive infrared (PIR) sensors were also collected at the entrances to ensure that the anchor is manually installed."}, {"heading": "D. Evaluation", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "IV. PREDICTING STATIC HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS", "text": "By identifying groups of houses with similar characteristics, utilities can provide them with targeted feedback to optimize their energy consumption or quality energy consulting services [10]. These characteristics include the area of the house or the number of occupants [9]. In this paper, we focus on predicting the following six characteristics of a household: age, area, income, floor number, number of rooms and number of occupants. We will now discuss the previous work that enables automated classification of household properties based on household energy data."}, {"heading": "A. Prior work", "text": "The main intuition behind using energy data to predict household characteristics is that households have different energy consumption patterns depending on their characteristics. Thus, a household with five inhabitants is likely to have higher energy consumption than a single home. In previous work Beckel et al. [9], [10] extracted from electricity data the following types of characteristics: 1) mean consumption power, mean weekday power, average weekend power, etc.; 2) ratio of morning to noon power, etc.; 3) share of time power is greater than average, etc.; and 4) statistical property variance, etc. The full list of characteristics used can be found in Table I. You train these characteristics using standard classifiers for machine learning, e.g. k-nearest neighbors, to predict household characteristics using the CER dataset containing total household power consumption, which is included in the 30-minute interval for more than 4000 households, as we could not measure our performance from this data for Ireland."}, {"heading": "B. Our approach", "text": "Our approach builds on the work of Beckel et al. [10] Our intuition is that there are several additional features at the appliance level that can help predict the characteristics of the household more accurately. We believe that the HVAC performance data probably points to the characteristics of the household, as HVAC typically represents the largest load in the house and is present in most households. It should be noted that several other devices, such as refrigerators, also point to the characteristics of the household. However, the data sets we have used do not indicate refrigerator data for all houses. All characteristics in Table I have been calculated in addition to the aggregate volumes of electricity. In addition, we calculate the following features: 1) Maximum HVAC power consumption: Higher heating coils may indicate a higher need for air conditioners, possibly as a result of large household area or higher numbers of residents."}, {"heading": "C. Data set", "text": "We use Dataport's publicly available dataset [22] for our evaluation. Dataport contains data on the total energy of appliances and households logged once per minute for more than 700 households over a three-year period. It also includes metadata on household characteristics for a small subset of households. In total, there are 50 households for which data on total household energy, appliance-level performance data, and household characteristics are available. Table II shows the distribution of different household characteristics in the Dataport dataset. We have divided the data into different classes, bearing in mind the following: 1) Definition of classes used in previous literature [9]; 2) Approximately equal number of households across different classes."}, {"heading": "D.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we explored the question of how accurate NILM must be for it to be applicable in the real world. Our findings suggest that the breakdown of energy-consuming periodic background stresses such as HVAC and refrigerators unattended has a significant impact on applications such as predicting household characteristics. Our findings show that basic breakdown approaches are up to 30% better at estimating occupancy data than using aggregate current data alone and up to 10% better at estimating static household characteristics. Our findings show that even rudimentary energy breakdown techniques are sufficient to draw improved conclusions about household characteristics. Finally, we conclude that \"how good is enough\" can be answered through the lens of applications."}, {"heading": "VI. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "Some of the household characteristics can be considered as continuous variables, and instead of treating the problem as a classification problem, we plan to view the problem as a regression problem. Current work only looked at one month of data to predict static household characteristics. In the future, we would like to analyze long-term trends to 1) improve the accuracy of households \"response to the weather to improve classification accuracy; 2) point out variations in these static characteristics and warn houses when they deviate from their baseline."}], "references": [{"title": "Occupancy-driven energy management for smart building automation", "author": ["Y.

"Since the early 1980s, the research community has developed ever more sophisticated algorithms for the problem of energy disaggregation, but despite decades of research, there is still a dearth of applications with demonstrated value. In this work, we explore a question that is highly pertinent to this research community: how good does energy disaggregation need to be in order to infer characteristics of a household? We present novel techniques that use unsupervised energy disaggregation to predict both household occupancy and static properties of the household such as size of the home and number of occupants. Results show that basic disaggregation approaches performs up to 30% better at occupancy estimation than using aggregate power data alone, and are up to 10% better at estimating static household characteristics. These results show that even rudimentary energy disaggregation techniques are sufficient for improved inference of household characteristics. To conclude, we re-evaluate the bar set by the community for energy disaggregation accuracy and try to answer the question \u201chow good is good enough?\u201d.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
