Crossing a free space leads to an increase in the cost of the cell, and the obstacles are represented by infinite costs, as reflected in the front illustration of the figure. 4. Going across a cell, the cost of crossing a cell in a diagonal (an angle of 45 \u00b0) is calculated at a cost of 2. However, this cost map only reflects the distance of taking a given path through the configuration space. 4. For a MOO problem, the other cost criteria for which we use additional layers must be taken into account. Each additional cost layer adds a dimension to the Pareto space from which the Pareto front is calculated."}, {"heading": "B.

Stentz's original D * paper [12] explains D * comprehensively, including the pseudo-code of the algorithm, and is not repeated here. D * \"s inherent dynamic properties are retained in D * -PO. However, the only deviation from D * is the use of the Pareto before the priority list to determine the next successor node, as shown in the second to fourth flowchart blocks in Fig. 1. The D * search algorithm is guaranteed to be complete but not optimal. However, the D * -PO algorithm guarantees a complete and Pareto optimal solution path.
