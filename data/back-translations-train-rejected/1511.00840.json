The algorithm decomposes given path finding task into the series of subtasks each of which can be easily (in computational sense) solved by well-known methods (such as A*). Parameterized random choice is used to perform the decomposition and as a result R* performance largely depends on the choice of its input parameters. In our work we formulate a range of assumptions concerning possible upper and lower bounds of R* parameters, their interdependency and their influence on R* performance. Then we evaluate these assumptions by running a large number of experiments. As a result we formulate a set of heuristic rules which can be used to initialize the values of R* parameters in a way that leads to algorithm's best performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 09:56:01 GMT  (473kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00840v1", "8 pages, 2 figures, 18 references.
