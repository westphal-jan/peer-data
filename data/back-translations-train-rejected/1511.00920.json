The goal is to divide classical programs into two parts: a declarative part (domain knowledge) and a mandatory part (the tasks that are done with this knowledge). Hence the name IDP: Imperative Declarative Programming. The language has proven to be promising in practical situations, but to better support new and existing users, an IDE is an indispensable tool for each new language. To facilitate this need, we have developed a web-based IDE for FO (\u00b7). The tool is available online at http: / / dtai.cs.kuleuven.be / krr / idp-ide /. This new IDE supports the basic functions that one would expect from an IDE, such as syntax highlighting, error / warning visualization and automatic embedding. In addition, there are some features that are specific to IDP."}, {"heading": "1.1 IDP", "text": "The theory is the representation of knowledge of a vocabulary expressed in FO (\u00b7).

Our approach was different from most others in the sense that we have tried to develop a lighter system. Many IDEs try to develop many tools from the ground up. However, good frameworks are already available for developing IDE tools. We have opted for a web-based approach, based on existing frameworks. This approach gave us some advantages. A web-based tool is agnostic about the operating system on which it runs, which means that no special code is required that distinguishes the different operating systems, but still provides a modern layout. Another advantage is that we can provide the IDE both as a local application and as a website. The local application is based on a locally executed web server. The workspace folder and the IDP execution command can be set from a configuration file."}, {"heading": "2 Overview of the IDE", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Features", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have set themselves."}, {"heading": "2.2 Implementation", "text": "The client side of the IDE consists entirely of JavaScript, CSS and HTML code and the server is written in Haskell. Libraries have been used for the generic components of the user interface. The general structure of the IDE can be seen in Figure 6.CodeMirror CodeMirror [7] is a JavaScript-based text editor with an API that has good support for extensions and new languages. All text editing features are implemented on the top of this editor. Features such as syntax highlighting are supported natively and only require simple, language-specific code to be added. Bootstrap This state-of-the-art CSS / JavaScript framework developed by Twitter [3] enables the quick creation of a simple and effective user interface. It is well supported by all browsers so we can ensure that the IDE works equally well on all operating systems.Snap To communicate between the code mirror instance in the web browser and the IDP technology is fairly open to the IDP."}, {"heading": "3 Other IDEs", "text": "Existing editors for truly declarative languages such as FO (\u00b7) and ASP can be roughly divided into two groups: custom IDEs that are built from the ground up, and Eclipse plugins. This IDE falls into a third category, web-based IDEs. As far as the authors know, such editors only exist for mandatory languages."}, {"heading": "3.1 Custom IDEs", "text": "An example of such an editor is OntoDLV [21], which does not support Undo. ASPIDE [12] seems to be the most comprehensive custom IDE that includes basic functions such as find andundo. It has an impressive list of features, including quick fixes for code. However, the use of Java GUI tools results in the GUI being platform independent, which is simple from the programmer's point of view, but OS-specific things that users expect in all applications, such as shortcuts, are missing."}, {"heading": "3.2 Eclipse Plugins", "text": "Eclipse plugins benefit from the good integration that Eclipse provides for new languages. However, there are some drawbacks to this approach. Eclipse requires a completely new parser for the language, which means that the IDE needs to be updated every time the language changes syntax. It is sometimes difficult to ensure that the real language and the Eclipse language consist of the same grammar, so it often happens that either the parser is not strict enough and some syntax errors go unnoticed until the file is executed, or some errors are displayed that are actually acceptable constructions. Examples of ASP editors in this category are Videas [19] and SeaLion [20] with the visualization tool Kara [17]. SeaLion seems to be the most advanced ASP IDE. It has tight integration with Eclipse and provides features such as a debugger and visualizations."}, {"heading": "3.3 Web-based IDEs", "text": "Cloud9 [6] is one of the more popular IDEs. It provides the user with all the tools he needs to develop an application, including full access to a virtual machine. The IDP Web IDE belongs to this category. Our IDE has an advantage that most others do not have. It is one of the few tools that supports both offline and online use. Two other (universal) IDEs that support this are Codiad [8] and ICEcoder [14]. Both tools use PHP for their backend and Ass Editor for front-end editing. Their editing capabilities are more extensive than our IDE, especially support for folders and projects. However, there is no integration for executing the files that are edited. Some ASP systems have an online tool available."}, {"heading": "4 Integration in other web applications", "text": "Inserting an IDE into an application is as simple as loading the CodeMirror library with the right options. Running a file can be done via the REST interface shared by an IDE server. We currently have two demos online that use this approach, the first demonstrating the choice of courses in a degree course, and the second demonstrating a problem where PCs should be configured to have the right software, these demos are available at http: / / krr.bitbucket.org / desired /."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we introduced the IDP Web IDE. This new IDE for the IDP system was developed using web technology and enabled us to provide both an online and an offline version of the editor. The IDE supports most of the basic features you would expect from an IDE. We believe that the web-based approach represents a new setting for IDEs and that this setting is inspiring, for example, to add new features.The recent extension to the tutorial mode is one such example. However, some features from other IDEs, such as managing multiple files as a project, are not currently supported. We intend to extend the IDE so that it can continue to serve as an educational and development tool. We also want to make the tools in the IDE available to other users so that it will be easier for other developers to make tools such as Section 4.The IDE available at http: / / dtai.cs.Offkuleu.krr / Server / idline and to try out the IDE link there."}], "references": [{"title": "Simulating dynamic systems using linear time calculus theories", "author": ["Bart Bogaerts", "Joachim Jansen", "Maurice Bruynooghe", "Broes De Cat", "Joost Vennekens", "Marc Denecker"], "venue": "TPLP, 14:477\u2013492,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Predicate logic as a modeling language: Modeling and solving some machine learning and data mining problems with IDP3", "author": ["Maurice Bruynooghe", "Hendrik Blockeel", "Bart Bogaerts", "Broes De Cat", "Stef De Pooter", "Joachim Jansen", "Anthony Labarre", "Jan Ramon", "Marc Denecker", "Sicco Verwer"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2015}, {"title": "ASPVIZ: declarative visualisation and animation using answer set programming", "author": ["Owen Cliffe", "Marina De Vos", "Martin Brain", "Julian A.
