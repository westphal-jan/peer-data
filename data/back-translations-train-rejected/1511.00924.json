Recent developments have led to powerful systems such as dlv [17] and gringo / clasp [6], to name a few, capable of solving a wide variety of problems [7]. In particular, ASP has shown that it is well suited for large combinatorial search problems, as dedicated solvers have been specifically designed to render all solutions [2]. However, it has often been pointed out that while it is a powerful and versatile form of formalism, popularity and widespread adoption of logical programming in general and answer-set programming in particular is hampered by the unavailability of user-friendly and scalable editing environments. On the other hand, formalisms that come with a more elaborate modeling of tools - especially language - are hampered."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section we provide the necessary background for description logic and response set programming."}, {"heading": "2.1 Description Logics", "text": "OWL 2 DL, the version of the Web Ontology Language on which we focus, is finally defined on the basis of the Description Logic (DLs, [3,25]).We briefly summarize the Description Logic SROIQ (see [13] for details).Let NI, NC, and NR be finite, with A being a SROIQ ABox, T a SROIQTBox, and R a SROIQ RBox. Table 2 shows the respective axiom types available in the three parts, and we refer to each TBox axiom as a General Concept Integration (GCI).The original definition of SROIQ contained more RBox axioms (expressing transitivity, (a) symmetry, (ir).We will refer to each TBox axiom as a General Concept Integration (GCI), with the SROIQ inclusion (not the GCI and GIQ inclusion) being decisive."}, {"heading": "2.2 Answer-Set Programming", "text": "We give a brief overview of the syntax and semantics of disjunctive logic programs under the Answer Sets semantics [9].

However, in many fields of application, the sphere of interest is limited to models of finite domain size (referred to as finite model thinking, a natural assumption in database theory), but has recently come under intense study (18,5,24). Contrary to the assumption that the domain is limited (but of arbitrary, unknown size), we consider the case where the domain has a priority known cardinality, more precisely when the domain coincides with the individuals mentioned in the knowledge base. We refer to such models as limited models and argue that this modification of standard DL semantics represents a more intuitive definition of what is considered and expected to be a model of some knowledge bases. 1Definition 1 (Bounded-Model Semantics).

However, as mentioned above, our approach aims at scenarios in which a knowledge base is a formal description of a problem for which each model is a solution. Then, retrieving one, several, or all models is a natural task, as opposed to merely verifying their existence. By model extraction, we designate the task of materializing an identified model in order to work with it, i.e. to fully inspect it and reuse it in downstream processes. The natural continuation of model extraction is to make all models explicit by performing model transformations."}, {"heading": "3.2 Complexity of Bounded Model Reasoning", "text": "The combined complexity of decision-making in SROIQ about extending all elements of the C system and extending the C element is only part of the problem we are able to prove in practice when we engage in a drastic reduction in complexity in the world.

Furthermore, we leave R all role expressions and role chains (including subchains) in K. Obviously, C and R are of polynomial size."}, {"heading": "4.1 Candidate Generation", "text": "As shown, any potentially limited interpretation of IB is prompted by a series of individual assertions B, so that for each concept name A, role name r and individuals a, b occurring in K, either A (a), B or A (a), B and either r (a, b) or r (a, b), B or B. This construction is easily encoded by the following rules: B (K): = {A (X): \u2212 not A (X), (X) | A (K), B (1) {\u00ac A (X): \u2212 not A (X), (X) | A (K)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Axiom Encoding", "text": "In the next step, we will turn each axiom-A-R-T into a constraint that will ultimately exclude all possible interpretations that are not satisfactory.

(K) We will successively introduce all bound models of K.Box axioms, since each GCI has a specific form that simplifies coding.

We present preliminary evaluation results based on simple ontologies encoding constraint-satisfaction-like combinatorial problems. Existing OWL ontologies typically used for benchmarking, such as SNOMED or GALEN [29.23], do not fit our purpose, as they are modelled on classical semantics and often contain little or no ABox information.Our tests provide runtimes for Wolpertinger and the popular HermiT rationist [10].

When calling a satisfaction check of this knowledge base with HermiT, no answer was given within 15 minutes. On average, Wolpertinger delivers a solution for a particular Sudoku instance in about 6 seconds, of which more than 5 seconds is needed for grounding, while the actual solution takes less than 0.1 seconds. We used the knowledge base for the model enumeration, but removed information about pre-filled cells, generating new Sudoku instances from the task. The size of the generated program is 13 MB, the grounding process takes about 6 seconds, which is reflected in Table 6."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "With this paper we have the starting point for further developments on the theoretical and practical side, as well as we can identify the benefits for both the description logic and logic programming community. For the latter, our approach allows to use OWL as an ASP modeling language and therefore make use of the available tool support. Although the modeling capabilities are limited, we argue that quite large and involved problem scenarios can be modeled in OWL ontologies. Obviously, evaluations of our system remain mandatory in relation to such ontologies. Complementary, modeling extraction and enumeration complement DL reasoning tasks for which our ASP translation not only represents a feasible approach, but also appears to be an application of ASP in another field of research. In addition, the framework can be expanded to realize non-standard reasoning tasks that are useful for debugging purposes such as axiom determination, explanation, justification and induction, the use of the model as well as prominence capabilities."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We are grateful for the valuable feedback from our colleagues and anonymous workshop experts, who have helped to improve this work significantly."}, {"heading": "A Proofs", "text": "It remains to be shown that this model (K) obeys the limited semantics (K) and consequently excludes any B-question (K.
