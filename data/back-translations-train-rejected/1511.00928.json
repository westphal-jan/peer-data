It is the successor of IDPDraw [6]. The aim of this library is to present structures simply as a drawing. An example can be found in Figure 2. IDPD3 consists of two parts. The first part creates a description of a drawing from a structure as a JSON string, it is an encoding of the relevant predicates and functions. This transformation takes place in the Lua environment of IDP (cf. the left part of Figure 1). The second part is integrated into the IDP Web IDE [7] and written in Javascript. It interprets the description for visualization with the d3 visualization library [2]. The d3 library can visualize any svg primitive supported by HTML. This part corresponds to the right part of Figure 1.

This program combines the original logic program with a logic visualization program before it is extended with an ASP solver. As it is one of the early visualization tools, it only supports basic primitives and the visualization of multiple frames. ASPV IZ supports saving images as svg, such as IDPD3 and Kara.IDPDraw is another visualization tool. It is the predecessor of IDPD3. The main improvement over IDPDraw is that the program builds on the core of IDP itself. We use an IDP vocabulary that helps to build visualization theories with grammar checking and debugging."}, {"heading": "6 Future work", "text": "In the future, we would like to expand the framework of interactive animations to more practical applications by adding some basic features: keyboard interaction and text fields are a standard way of entering information; another change we want to implement is generalizing the vocabulary of input and output; currently, it takes minimal but not zero time to implement a new attribute; when this happens, new attributes can be added without changing the library; this would reduce the time invested in maintaining the library in the same way as for the d3 visualization library [2]; however, in order to truly support practical applications, we should move away from visualizations and support forms, creating a new library that uses many of the ideas currently implemented in IDPD3."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this article we introduced IDPD3 as the successor of IDPDraw. The main feature of IDPD3 is the ability to display an interactive simulation of a linear calendar. Among the smaller features are the animation of basic primitives and the tutorial application. By integrating with IDP as library and the IDP Web IDE, the development of visualizations for IDP is easier and platform-independent. Maintenance of the library should be easier than before. In the future, we would like to implement the library for more practical applications for data entry and perhaps forms."}], "references": [{"title": "Simulating Dynamic Systems Using Linear Time Calculus Theories", "author": ["Bart Bogaerts", "Joachim Jansen", "Maurice Bruynooghe", "Broes De Cat", "Joost Vennekens", "Marc Denecker"], "venue": "TPLP", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2014}, {"title": "D3: Data-Driven Documents", "author": ["Michael Bostock", "Vadim Ogievetsky", "Jeffrey Heer"], "venue": "IEEE Trans.
