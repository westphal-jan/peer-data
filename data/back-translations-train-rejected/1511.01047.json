Samples may only be weakly atypical individually, whereas they may be strongly atypical when considered jointly. What makes this group anomaly detection problem quite challenging is that it is a priori unknown which subset of features jointly manifests a particular group of anomalies. Moreover, it is unknown how many anomalous groups are present in a given data batch. In this work, we develop a group anomaly detection (GAD) scheme to identify the subset of samples and subset of features that jointly specify an anomalous cluster. We apply our approach to network intrusion detection to detect BotNet and peer-to-peer flow clusters. Unlike previous studies, our approach captures and exploits statistical dependencies that may exist between the measured features. Experiments on real world network traffic data demonstrate the advantage of our proposed system, and highlight the importance of exploiting feature dependency structure, compared to the feature (or test) independence assumption made in previous studies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 15:13:59 GMT  (85kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01047v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["zhicong qiu", "david j miller", "george kesidis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.01047"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.01047.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Detecting Clusters of Anomalies on Low-Dimensional Feature Subsets with Application to Network Traffic Flow Data", "authors": ["Zhicong Qiu", "David J.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS", "text": "Our experiments focus on detecting Zeus botnet and P2P traffic within normal web traffic. Web packet flows come from the LBNL repository [6]. This dataset contains web traffic on TCP port 80 with specified daily information. Specifically, the experiments in this paper are based on three datasets named \"200412215-0510.port008,\" \"20041215-1343.port008\" and \"20041215-1443.port010.\" The protocols for obtaining normal P2P and BotNet network traffic are the same as in [5], i.e. we used the port mapper in [16] to identify P2P traffic in these files through a C4.5 decision tree preschooled in another domain (the Cambridge dataset [7]). The Zeus botnet traffic is sourced from another domain [13]."}, {"heading": "A. Feature Space Selection and Representation", "text": "First, we did not use layer 4 port number characteristics for detection purposes [16], [1] nor did we consider timing information in this because the Zeus activity was recorded on a different domain [1]. In [1], previous efforts were made to detect BotNet and P2P traffic using the well-known feature representation for detecting network intruders from [8]. The authors found that while these characteristics are able to detect some attack activities, they could not successfully distinguish BotNet or P2P traffic from normal web traffic, i.e. BotNet and P2P traffic appear as \"normal\" web activity according to the characteristics of [8], [1].To capture the intrinsic behavior of BotNet and P2P packet traffic, we point out that most Zeus BotNet or P2P authors execute command messages November 4, 2015 (control commands - TAF2P) during control commands (4)."}, {"heading": "B. Performance Metrics", "text": "Our algorithms detect clusters (groups) in a sequential manner. For each extracted group, we rank the samples in the group by their associated common p-values on the specified characteristic subset. These samples are sequentially removed from the test batch, with the system then proceeding to extract groups until the test set is exhausted. Then, we sweep out an ROC curve based on these rankings based on normal samples. A larger area under the ROC curve indicates previous detections of anomalous groups, implying the effectiveness of the intruder detection system. We compare the performance of our system to a GMM-based anomaly detector trained by normal samples on the entire feature space we evaluate the test samples on the basis of their data probability under the GMM, and we sweep out an ROC curve. We also compare with the approach presented in [5], which is based on the importance of testing. \""}, {"heading": "C. Experimental results", "text": "In Figure 2, we show the performance using the synthetic data. Note that both the proposed scheme and [5] effectively capture groups of anomalies when the maximum feature subset is two. The first cluster (sample subset) recorded consists of an average of more than 95% of anomalous samples. However, as the maximum feature subset increases, the \"independence testing\" approach significantly decreases in performance. This is because too many (assumed) pairs of tests generate many redundant features, all of which are used to evaluate the cluster anomaly; the use of these redundant features de-emphasizes within the score function the important (low-grade) feature subset. Also, we see an early advantage of using cluster-specific DTs, compared to the only Bayesian net approach. It seems that when an anomalous process is strictly generated from a lower-order subspace and exhibits normal in other feature dimensions (such as the higher one in this case)."}, {"heading": "V. EXTENSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "Alternatively, we could try to evaluate empirical p-values for these decision statistics by applying our detection strategy to (many) bootstrap test stacks drawn from the zero distribution. It would be interesting to see whether such an approach offers comparable (or even better) detection accuracy than using the Bonferroni-corrected score alone. Such an approach could also be used to determine whether all detected clusters are truly statistically significant. In this work, we showed detection accuracy as a function of the maximum feature subset of a cluster. As the maximum feature subset continues to increase, we observed that false positives also increase in the first detected cluster, and the target in (4) tends to favor the maximum feature dimension over the use of a few dimensions. In the future, we should propose and examine criteria for selecting this maximum feature subset."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we proposed a GAD scheme for identifying anomalous sample and feature subsets that takes into account dependencies between the features of a particular subset; the proposed model surpasses previous work that assumed statistical tests to be sub-zero independent; we demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed system on both synthetic and real data, the latter coming from the domain of network intrusion detection and aimed at distinguishing between normal and P2P / Zeus traffic; our future work includes empirical p-value evaluation and automatic determination of the maximum feature subset of a cluster."}], "references": [{"title": "Salting public traces with attack traffic to test flow classifiers", "author": ["Z.B.

What makes this group anomaly detection problem quite challenging is that it is a priori unknown which subset of features jointly manifests a particular group of anomalies. Moreover, it is unknown how many anomalous groups are present in a given data batch. In this work, we develop a group anomaly detection (GAD) scheme to identify the subset of samples and subset of features that jointly specify an anomalous cluster. We apply our approach to network intrusion detection to detect BotNet and peer-to-peer flow clusters.
