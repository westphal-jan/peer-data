Even when a taxonomy of subject expertise exists, and is associated with a group of experts, it can be hard to exploit by users who have not internalized the taxonomy. Here we present a method for both attaching experts to a domain ontology, and hiding this fact from the end user looking for an expert. By linking Wikipedia to this same pivot ontology, we describe how a user can browse Wikipedia, as they normally do to search for information, and use this browsing behavior to find experts. Experts are characterized by their textual productions (webpages, publications, reports), and these textual productions are attached to concepts in the pivot ontology. When the user finds the Wikipedia page characterizing their need, a list of experts is displayed. In this way we transform Wikipedia into a search engine for experts.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Nov 2015 09:41:31 GMT  (386kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01259v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 30 May 2016 14:45:27 GMT  (1250kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01259v2", "Joint Second Workshop on Language and Ontology \\&amp; Terminology and Knowledge Structures (LangOnto2 + TermiKS) LO2TKS, May 2016, Portoroz, Slovenia. 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["gregory grefenstette", "karima rafes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.01259"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.01259.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Transforming Wikipedia into a Search Engine for Local Experts", "authors": ["Gregory Grefenstette", "Karima Rafes"], "emails": ["gregory.grefenstette@inria.fr", "Karima.rafes@inria.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "In large organizations such as multinationals, universities, and even large research centers, it can be difficult to know who is an expert on a particular topic. A common answer to this problem is to create an ontology of expertise and assign experts manually or automatically to labels from that ontology. Beyond the cost or effort required to create the ontology, this solution creates an additional problem. Once such a knowledge base of experts exists, the seeker must still internalize the labels of ontology and their meaning in order to find the expert. The difficulty faced by the user explains why some expert knowledge is useful for a department in a large organization, for another department that does not share the same terminology or perspective but is useless (Hahn & Subrami, 2000). We propose a method of finding experts that hides the user's pivot ontology and allows the seeker to browse Wikipedia, a resource he or she probably knows, to find his or her local expert."}, {"heading": "2. Solution", "text": "Our solution involves mapping experts from a Givein organization to a domain ontology for their expertise, and then mapping Wikipedia articles to the same domain ontology. To find an expert in a particular field, the user searches for the topic that is of interest to Wikipedia. A tab added to the Wikipedia page can be clicked to view a list of experts on the topic mentioned on the page."}, {"heading": "2.1 Example", "text": "Before explaining the mechanisms and language resources involved, let us see an example. In this example, our local experts are one of the research teams of the National Public Research Institute of Informatics, Inria1. The Inria Institute employs 3,600 scientists, divided among 200 research teams, each specializing in a specific branch of computer science and mathematics. In our example, looking for an expert means finding a team competent to answer questions on a specific topic. In our solution, when someone is looking for an expert on a specific topic within the Inria Institute, an additional tab appears for the user on the Wikipedia interface 2. In Figure 1, 1https: / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Inria 2 This tab appears when the user is logged in, and has the resource module for expert surveys, this tab appears while the user browses the page that is found http: / en.wikipedia.org. This tab appears when the user is logged in for the Expert module, and this tab appears for the Explorer."}, {"heading": "2.2 Underlying Language Resources", "text": "Links between Wikipedia content and local experts run through a common pivot ontology. Both Wikipedia page content and expert profiles are grouped into the same ontology categories that provide a pivot or link between them. In our implemented example, we used the ACM 2012 classification schema 3 as a common ontological space. Here's an entry in this ontology: < skos: Concept rdf: about = \"# 10010296\" xml: lang = \"en\" > the user surfs http: / en.wikipedia.org. Wiki resource modules are additions that anyone can develop and activate. http: / / www.mediawiki.org / wiki / ResourceLoader / Developin g _ with _ ResourceLoader explains them further. http: / www.acm.org / about / class / class / class / class / class / / 2012 < skos: prefLaxml: & lt; < < GL: < < < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: < GL: GL: GL: < GL: GL: GL: < GL: < GL: GL; GL: < GL: GL: < GL: GL: GL: &ltL; GL: &ltL: GL: GL; GL: GL: &ltL; GL: &ltL: GL: G"}, {"heading": "2.3 Variations", "text": "Instead of using annual reports to create expert profiles, one could instead use the publications of researchers from a particular team or research center. Instead of the ACM hierarchy, one could extract a taxonomy of Wikipedia categories and subcategories. For example, one could use MeSH as anchor ontology and publications by doctors in local hospitals to turn Wikipedia into a search engine for medical problem specialists."}, {"heading": "3. Related Work", "text": "Demartini (2007) suggested using Wikipedia to find experts by extracting expertise from Wikipedia, which describes people, or from wiki editors editing pages on a particular topic. West et al. (2012) tried to describe what constitutes Wikipedia experts. Our approach allows us to connect with people who appear neither as subjects nor as editors in Wikipedia."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSION", "text": "Pivot ontology must be presented as a resource for processing natural language, that is, as a resource that a program can apply to natural language texts applied both to Wikipedia pages and to the textual representation of experts, pushing them into the same room. Once this mapping is done, a Wikimedia resource loader dynamically connects as soon as the user clicks on 4 http: / / dumps.wikimedia.org / biwiki / latest 5. For example, ACM has a concept of \"women\" under \"gender.\" Women \"have been eliminated, while\" gender \"has been retained. 6 https: / / raweb.inria.fr / rapportsactivte / RA2014 / index.html 7 Based on Wikipedia, the original expert page is no longer used as Wikipedia."}, {"heading": "5.
