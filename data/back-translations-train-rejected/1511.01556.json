Unlabeled Data", "text": "Currently, we have two sets of DFZ text files, the unlabeled part comprising more than 900,000 characters extracted from 83 volumes of local gazetteers [3], the labeled part being presented in Section II.D. These 83 volumes were compiled between the mid-Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD) and the early Republican Period (1912-1949). These books were produced by governments at various levels in 65 locations in China. Figure 1 shows an example page from this collection. It is difficult to count the number of columns on this page. Normally, we consider one row as a column, but here we see that one column is divided into two columns of smaller characters. The legal name is emphasized by taking up the full width of a column, and details about that person are recorded in the thinner subcolumns. If the leftest three columns of Figure 1 are used as continuous horizontal characters, DF2 are rarely represented in full Chinese letters, whereas they are rarely displayed in full Chinese letters."}, {"heading": "B.

Current content of the CBDB has been extracted from sources other than the DFZ. [19] Therefore, we are interested in finding all kinds of biographical information in the DFZ. In this paper, we focus on questions of searching for personal names and place names and cover some relevant topics, such as verifying whether the places were places of birth and finding paragraph boundaries. In the long term, we will also expand to social networks and personal careers."}, {"heading": "C. More on Motivation", "text": "In a text passage such as Figure 2, it is very difficult to find useful information without auxiliary information, even for modern generations of native Chinese speakers. Without the bold lettering, it would not be easy to find the one in larger characters in the original DFZ. In addition, the grammars of literary and modern Chinese, and reading literary Chinese is much more difficult than reading modern Chinese, especially when there are no boundary markers between sentences. In addition, historical knowledge is also required for correct word segmentation and lexical disambiguation, which are important for understanding and extracting the desired information from the texts. In order to achieve our goals, we need some informative sources. The importance of these informative sources for our methods of obtaining information is just like that of machine-readable dictionaries for methods of dealing with modern natural languages. Our approaches are innovative because we use the biographical information in CBDB to provide verified information about the DFZ part of the synchronization of the text."}, {"heading": "D.

Thus, for example, NB is for the first character of a person's name, and AE is the last character of a place's name.
