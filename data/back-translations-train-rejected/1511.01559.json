We look into CTP with computational tools from specific linguistic perspectives, including distributional semantics and collocational analysis.

Colors in poems function like sounds in movies, and play a crucial role in the imageries of poems. Thus, words for colors are studied, and \"white\" is the main focus because it is the most frequent color in CTP. We also explore some cases of using colored words in antithesis pairs that were central for fostering the imageries of the poems.

With the applications mentioned above, we demonstrated the potential of computer tools to study the complete Tang poems, which are a bright spot in a fast-growing field of research - the Digital Humanities. Computer tools such as information gathering, text analysis and text mining cannot yet perform in-depth research, but they can help researchers find and collect much more relevant research material with amazing efficiency. It turns out that knowledge of the collection of words used by individual poets opens a window to observe the inner worlds of poets. The concept of distributional semantics has proven effective for the study of CTP. We still need to strengthen our ability to verify the limitations of pronunciation and rhymes in poems so that we can assess antitheses more precisely. The functions of colors in poems provide a stimulating direction for humans to actually use these zooming technologies in 2012."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was partially supported by the Taiwanese Ministry of Science and Technology with grants MOST-102-2420-H-004-054-MY2 and MOST-104-2221-E-004-005-MY3."}], "references": [{"title": "A Word-Clip algorithm for Named Entity Recognition - by example of historical documents, Master\u2019s thesis, National Taiwan University, Taiwan", "author": ["Chang", "Shan-Pin"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Chang and .\u5f35\u5c1a\u658c..,?

Colors in poems function like sounds in movies, and play a crucial role in the imageries of poems. Thus, words for colors are studied, and \u201c\u767d\u201d (bai2, white) is the main focus because it is the most frequent color in CTP. We also explore some cases of using colored words in antithesis(\u5c0d\u4ed7) pairs that were central for fostering the imageries of the poems. CTP also contains useful historical information, and we extract person names in CTP to study the social networks of the Tang poets. Such information can then be integrated with the China Biographical Database of Harvard University.", "creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 11 Word \u7248"}}}
