The transformations we deal with allow us to transform a number of such dependencies into an equivalent one that is non-redundant and fulfills a strong condition of observed non-redundancy. The observed non-redundancy can be considered a desirable property because the non-redundancy of each rule in the group can be observed directly from its history. Compared to our previous results, the proposed algorithm works for arbitrary idempotent truth emphasis, which can serve as a parameter for the interpretation of the rules. As one of the consequences of the theoretical result, we have achieved that each finite object data table table table with tiered attributes (minimal context) is subject to at least one of the gradient systems that is included in this structure, and that the gradient system is also subject to at least one of the gradient contexts enclosed by this system."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "Supported by grant number P202 / 14-11585S of the Czech Science Foundation."}], "references": [{"title": "Dependency structures of data base relationships, Information Processing", "author": ["William Ward Armstrong"], "venue": "Proceedings of IFIP Congress (Amsterdam)", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1974}, {"title": "Fuzzy Relational Systems: Foundations and Principles", "author": ["Radim Belohlavek"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Implications from data with fuzzy attributes", "author": ["Radim Belohlavek", "Martina Chlupova", "Vilem Vychodil"], "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Advances in Intelligent Systems\u2014Theory and Applications, University of Canberra, Centre de Recherche Public Henri Tudor,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2004}, {"title": "An efficient reasoning method for dependencies over similarity and ordinal data, Modeling 23  Decisions for Artificial Intelligence", "author": ["Radim Belohlavek", "Pablo Cordero", "Manuel Enciso", "Angel Mora", "Vilem Vychodil"], "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Fuzzy closure operators with truth stressers", "author": ["Radim Belohlavek", "Tatana Funiokova", "Vilem Vychodil"], "venue": "Logic Journal of IGPL", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Fuzzy attribute implications: Computing nonredundant bases using maximal independent sets, AI 2005: Advances in Artificial Intelligence (Shichao Zhang and Ray Jarvis, eds.)", "author": ["Radim Belohlavek", "Vilem Vychodil"], "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science,", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Reducing the size of fuzzy concept lattices by hedges", "author": ["Radim Belohlavek", "Vilem Vychodil"], "venue": "Fuzzy Systems,", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Computing non-redundant bases of if-then rules from data tables with graded attributes", "author": ["Radim Belohlavek", "Vilem Vychodil"], "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing, GrC 2006,", "citeRegEx": "10", "shortCiteRegEx": "10", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Data tables with similarity relations: Functional dependencies, complete rules and non-redundant bases, Database Systems for Advanced Applications", "author": ["Radim Belohlavek", "Vilem Vychodil"], "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science,", "citeRegEx": "11", "shortCiteRegEx": "11", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Triangular norm based predicate fuzzy logics", "author": ["Petr Cintula", "Petr H\u00e1jek"], "venue": "Fuzzy Sets and Systems", "citeRegEx": "18", "shortCiteRegEx": "18", "year": 2010}, {"title": "On the complexity of enumerating pseudo-intents", "author": ["Felix Distel", "Bar\u0131\u015f Sertkaya"], "venue": "Discrete Appl.

In this setting, we introduce algorithm which transforms any set of graded attribute implications into an equivalent non-redundant set of graded attribute implications with saturated consequents whose non-redundancy is witnessed by antecedents of the formulas. As a consequence, we solve the open problem regarding the existence of general systems of pseudo-intents which appear in formal concept analysis of object-attribute data with graded attributes and linguistic hedges. Furthermore, we show a polynomial-time procedure for determining bases given by general systems of pseudo-intents from sets of graded attribute implications which are complete in data.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
