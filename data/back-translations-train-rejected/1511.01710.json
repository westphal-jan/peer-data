[1] There have been a number of different approaches to model-limited rationality [2], ranging from optimality principles [3] to heuristics [4]. At this point, we take an information-theoretical approach to limited rationality [5], where the costs of information processing are measured by relative entropy between a subordinate decision strategy and a predetermined preceding strategy. In the case of multiple environments, it can be shown that there is an optimal prior representation of the problem of limited rationality corresponding to the distortion problem of lossy compression in information theory. [6] Accordingly, the optimal preceding and subsequent strategies can be calculated by the well-known Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, which requires the calculation of partition sums across all possible outcomes and cannot be applied without continuous problems."}, {"heading": "2 Information-theoretic bounded rationality", "text": "In decision theory, an agent stands in front of an environment y from the environment set Y and has to decide which action x should be taken from the action set X. The usefulness of the action in this particular environment is quantified by the service function U: X \u00b7 Y 7 \u2192 R. The goal of the decision maker is to maximize the benefit depending on the environment, as the decision maker has to evaluate the benefit of each possible action and select the best one. This increases the need to expand the classical decision theory to take into account the available computational resources.Here, we look at decision makers with a prior distribution p0 (x) across the search space and with limited computational resources. We measure computational resources in relation to an \"Informa Workshop on Bounded Optimality and Rational Metareasoning Systems.\""}, {"heading": "3 Decision-maker with parametric prior", "text": "Here we propose a sample-based approach that avoids the calculation of partition sums and that can also be applied to continuous scope of action. To achieve this, we need a parameterized family of distributions to enable a gradient updating rule. If we replace p (x) in equivalent. (3) - (4) with p (x) and paste in equivalent. (2), we can rewrite the target of distortion of interest rates J (x) = 1 \u03b2 y p (y) logZ\u03b8 (y), where sample (y) = x pTB (x) exp (x, y) and pTB (x)."}, {"heading": "4 Simulations", "text": "While the proposed algorithm works for both continuous and discrete parametric distributions, here we show its performance in discrete case simulations, as this allows comparison of the solutions for the optimal Blahut-Arimoto solution. In addition, these simulations illustrate the effects of \u03b2 on learning and plateau performance and on the average number of samples required. The parametric approach to using gradient methods in the parameter space must be taken care that the parameters do not violate predetermined constraints - for example, in the case of a discrete distribution over n + 1, the parameters p = [p0, p1,., pn] must meet the constraints p0 = 1 \u2212 pi and pi \u2265 0. Frequently, of course, the constraints can be met by repairing the distribution. In the discrete case, we define measures for example as vectors of the form xi = [x0,]."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "The first process is a slow process in terms of updating the previous distribution. We have shown that such an update can be efficiently estimated from samples and converges with the optimal solution derived from the distortion theory. The second process is the sampling process, which a decision maker with a fixed lead time would use to process information specific to a particular environment. A decision maker with little rationality can imagine that he does not have time to plan to act according to the previous distribution, which may not be a very good solution for the observed environment, but is the best possible given his computational resources. Therefore, this approach could not only be a normative model for human decision-making processes taking place on different time scales, but also an efficient sample-based solution to the distortion problem."}], "references": [{"title": "A behavioral model of rational choice", "author": ["H.A.
