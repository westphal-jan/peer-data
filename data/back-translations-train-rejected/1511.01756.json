INTRODUCTION", "text": "Although this is mainly a matter of creative writing and deviation, it can be said that clich\u00e9s can be used for stylistic effects (Amossy & Herschberg-Perrot, 1997).According to Abrams, a clich\u00e9 can be defined that attracts the attention of the author and that remains as it is."}, {"heading": "2. COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES TO SIMILE IDENTIFICATION", "text": "In rhetoric, a parable such as (3) \"This girl is graceful as a lily\" is composed chiefly of the following components: - a tenor or an object of comparison; - a tertium comparationis or ground: the adjective or verb that denotes the property shared by the units compared; - a vehicle that refers to the term against which the tenor is evaluated (Fishelov, 1993). In addition to these components, Hanks (2012) also distinguishes contingency, the main verb on which equilibrium is built. As far as French is concerned, the comparison clause with a verb and an adjective ellipsis is the form \"A est B comme C,\" which is generally considered a prototypical form of equilibrium and is discussed at length in terms of rhetoric in relation to metaphors (Cohen, 1968)."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED METHOD", "text": "This study is limited to nominal comparisons of the form of adjective ground + similarity marker + nominal vehicle (e.g. cunning as a fox) and contingency + similarity marker + nominal vehicle (e.g. crying like a baby). Since similarity or dissimilarity is derived primarily from meaning, as opposed to previous work on clich\u00e9s (Bolshakov, 2003), not only traditional markers have been included, but also other markers that can be combined with these two predefined similarity patterns. Table 1 lists all selected markers and their corresponding similarity structures. The proposed approach to recognizing frozen similarities in literary texts can be divided into two main parts: - extraction and degradation of similarities, comparisons and pseudo-comparisons; - filtering of all extracted elements based on their idiomaticity and the semantic distance between vehicle and tenor."}, {"heading": "3.1. The simile extraction and mining module", "text": "The various steps performed in this section are derived from the rules-based algorithm presented in Mpouli and Ganascia (2015). The extraction and mining phase includes various pre-processing tasks, the extraction of seedlings, and finally the identification of the components of each extracted simulation candidate. Pre-processing tasks include tokenization, syntactical decoupling, and sentence segmentation. The first three tasks are performed with TreeTagger (Schmid 1994), a freely available multilingual tokenist, part of the speech tagger, and chunker1. The sentence boundaries defined by TreeTagger form the first basis for sentence segmentation, and are corrected with specific rules when a question or exclamation mark is not followed by a capital."}, {"heading": "3.2. Filtering of frozen similes", "text": "To detect frozen comparisons, all soil / contingency + vehicle pairs were first compared with a list of frozen comparisons of the corresponding language compiled from various sources such as Nicolas Cazelles \"Les Comparaisons du fran\u00e7ais (1996) or Michel Parmentier's Dictionnaire fran\u00e7ais / anglais des comparaisons (2002). However, since the reference lists of frozen comparisons were largely based on sources that were not up to date with the novels of the Corpus and were by no means comprehensive, frequency and semantic distance were used to filter out frozen comparisons between the remaining soil / contingency + vehicle pairs. All soil / contingency + vehicle pairs that appeared at least five times in novels by different authors were selected in this way. Then, the semantic distance between tenor and vehicle was evaluated in each sentence. If both the tenor and the vehicle were nouns, their semantic categories were classified from two machine-readable Le Content\u00e9 categories (French word identification), each of which are classified in three separate categories."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4. 1. Presentation of the corpus", "text": "The two corpus used in this experiment were created using digital versions of literary texts in the public domain, collected mainly from the Project Gutenberg website2 and the Biblioth\u00e8que \u00e9lectronique du Qu\u00e9bec3 for British and French novels, respectively. Most novels included in the corpus were written in the 19th century to ensure linguistic homogeneity, and because in that century the 2 www.gutenberg.org 3 beq.ebooksgratuits.com novel asserted itself as the dominant literary genre. Furthermore, a ratio of at least 3 novels per author was observed and the novels were not limited to a particular literary genre, making it possible to create a corpus of 1191 British novels written by 62 authors and a corpus of 746 French novels written by 57 writers."}, {"heading": "4.2. Description of detected frozen similes", "text": "The relatively small number of total occurrences of the above mentioned persons in each language (listed in Table 3) seems to confirm the fact that clich\u00e9s in general and frozen similarities in particular are anything but common in literary texts. Furthermore, French writers are more inclined to use frozen similarities than British ones. A noteworthy result of this study is the fact that the same parable (pale + marker + death and pale + marker + mort) is most commonly used in both languages. This parable is also interesting from a stylistic point of view, as it attributes a human characteristic to an abstract entity. In fact, \"pale\" and its synonym, \"white,\" appear; in most cases, \"death\" is used in three of the highest category of frozen English similarities."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The aim of this work was to examine frozen literary comparisons in a corpus of novels in English and French. If most of the extraction of comparisons and their components takes place automatically, the recognition of frozen comparisons is still based in part on human knowledge. In this respect, it seems to be necessary for future work to first decipher the tenor or the vehicle in order to directly find its semantic category. Since this study is mainly focused on a stylistic description of comparisons, it would be a different perspective to add information about the literary clich\u00e9 of a particular comparison to a comparison in order to shed new light on the perception and interpretation of frozen comparisons in literature as a whole."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by French sovereign wealth funds, which managed the ANR under the Investissements d'Avenir programme under reference ANR-11-IDEX-0004-02."}], "references": [{"title": "A Glossary of Literary Terms", "author": ["M.H.
