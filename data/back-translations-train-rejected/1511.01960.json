The goals of an agent in a multi-agent world may involve manipulating the knowledge and beliefs of other agents' and again, not just their knowledge/belief about the world, but also their knowledge about other agents' knowledge about the world. Our goal is to present an action language (mA+) that has the necessary features to address the above aspects in representing and RAC in MADs. mA+ allows the representation of and reasoning about different types of actions that an agent can perform in a domain where many other agents might be present---such as world-altering actions, sensing actions, and announcement/communication actions. It also allows the specification of agents' dynamic awareness of action occurrences which has future implications on what agents' know about the world and other agents' knowledge about the world. mA+ considers three different types of awareness: full,- partial- awareness, and complete oblivion of an action occurrence and its effects. This keeps the language simple, yet powerful enough to address a large variety of knowledge manipulation scenarios in MADs. The semantics of mA+ relies on the notion of state, which is described by a pointed Kripke model and is used to encode the agent's knowledge and the real state of the world. It is defined by a transition function that maps pairs of actions and states into sets of states. We illustrate properties of the action theories, including properties that guarantee finiteness of the set of initial states and their practical implementability.

An LAG substitution is a sentence (p1) that contains a set of (p1), (pk) that includes the substitution (p), (pk), with each Pi actor being a different substitution agent. We implicitly assume that for each (p1), (p1), the substitution one (pk), the substitution model contains p (p). SUBLAG substitution model refers to the set of all LAG substitution models.

On the other hand, there could theoretically be an infinite number of initial states for an arbitrary mA + theory.

Classical logic, especially propositional and primary logic, are often used to specify the physical state of the world.

(2) an action that one wants to be aware of and that can be characterized by physical or mental activity. States (often a single Kripke structure), they do not focus on limiting knowledge of the initial state in order to guarantee the finiteness of the possible initial states. This is an important concern of our work, and we propose a limited knowledge class of the initial states that guarantees finiteness and yet is able to capture most examples in the literature.

In [42] we show that several examples found in the literature to address a specific aspect in multi-agent systems (e.g. [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]) can be formalized by extending the action language C. However, most of the extensions considered in [42, 43, 44] are insufficient for formalizing multi-agent domain systems where considerations about the knowledge of other actors are critical.
