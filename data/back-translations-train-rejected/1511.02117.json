SKYSET utilizes a quintuple set of standardized categories, which differs from traditional approaches that typically use triples. The SKYSET System defines the categories required to form a standard template for representing information that is portable across different domains. It provides a standardized framework that enables sentences from written instructions to be translated into sets of category typed entities on a table or database. The SKYSET entities contain conceptual units or phrases that represent information from the original source documentation. SKYSET enables information concatenation where multiple documents from different domains can be translated and combined into a single common filterable and searchable table of entities.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Nov 2015 15:36:54 GMT  (752kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02117v1", "11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kerry fultz", "seth filip"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02117"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.02117.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Approach for Improving Instructions", "authors": ["Kerry Fultz", "Seth Filip"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Kerry Fultz and Seth Filip Page 1 of 11", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far as it has this year."}, {"heading": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Kerry Fultz and Seth Filip Page 2 of 11", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Kerry Fultz and Seth Filip Page 3 of 11", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have imposed on themselves, and they will be able to play by the rules they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Kerry Fultz and Seth Filip Page 4 of 11", "text": "Approaches to Improve the InstructionThe categories are presented in color-coded form.

This translation of text to entities can be understood as an answer to the following questions: What is the subject or role? Who performs the action? In this text is the role \"A Boy Scout Bee.\" What action (service) is performed? The service is \"Reports.\" What product is delivered or what resource is used? In this case, the product is information, specifically \"the location of food.\" How is the service provided? What process is followed or what requirement is fulfilled? What or who is the recipient of the service or product? In this example, the process is performed \"via the Waggle Dance\" and the recipient is \"to other Boy Scout Bees\" when or under what conditions can the action occur?"}, {"heading": "A scout bee reports the location of food to other scout", "text": "The individual conceptual units can be reconstructed into a row of a table. Therefore, this text translates into the resulting SKYSET format, as shown in Table 2.In addition, the SKYSET translation can optionally omit certain words such as defined and indefinite articles, plural or singular suffixes, etc., which are considered suitable for the application. A simplified version is shown in Table 3.presented: 1. The DISDR process splits text into conceptual units by mapping units in SKYSET standard categories and merging the units into a row in a table. Categories are the column headings of the table. In the course of our investigations, it was found that sentences rarely contain information that maps units to each SKYSET standard category. If an unit belonging to a category is not represented in a record, it is left blank or has a value of zero. 2. If two or more YSET units can be mapped to a specific column (which can be mapped to a particular column)."}, {"heading": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Kerry Fultz and Seth Filip Page 5 of 11", "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Kerry Fultz and Seth Filip Page 6 of 11", "text": "One example is the fact that most people are able to decide for themselves how to behave."}, {"heading": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Kerry Fultz and Seth Filip Page 7 of 11", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive on their own if they do not put themselves in the position they are in."}, {"heading": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Kerry Fultz and Seth Filip Page 8 of 11", "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Kerry Fultz and Seth Filip Page 9 of 11", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to move, to fight, to fight, to fight, to move, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to fight, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to"}, {"heading": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Kerry Fultz and Seth Filip Page 10 of 11", "text": "Approach to improve the instruction identical to the search times for individual data points when using SKYSET."}, {"heading": "Lower Confidence", "text": "In the context of the nine-person experiment, sorting by category was observed to generate faster response times for the SKYSET format (Q3) when compared to the times in the documentation format (Q4).6 Conclusions are that it is a standard category applicable in several areas. A preliminary proof-of-concept experiment involving nine participants was observed to produce an approximate speed improvement for multiple data points when comparing the SKYSET format with conventional instruments. A speed improvement could occur in the time required to understand and follow instructions indicating clearer instructions. However, the number of participants was too low to enable definitive conclusions. Furthermore, when this experiment is repeated, we must take into account the variability of the source format itself (spreadsheet versus PDFS document)."}, {"heading": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Kerry Fultz and Seth Filip Page 11 of 11", "text": "He is a researcher and engineering specialist who gained the first wireless computing experience with Microsoft Windows, the early HTML knowledge base that later evolved into Microsoft Fast.
