Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) learn and predict the tastes and preferences of users by incorporating available contextual information in the recommendation process. One of the major challenges in context-aware recommender systems research is the lack of automatic methods to obtain contextual information for these systems. Considering this scenario, in this paper, we propose to use contextual information from topic hierarchies of the items (web pages) to improve the performance of context-aware recommender systems. The topic hierarchies are constructed by an extension of the LUPI-based Incremental Hierarchical Clustering method that considers three types of information: traditional bag-of-words (technical information), and the combination of named entities (privileged information I) with domain terms (privileged information II). We evaluated the contextual information in four context-aware recommender systems. Different weights were assigned to each type of information. The empirical results demonstrated that topic hierarchies with the combination of the two kinds of privileged information can provide better recommendations.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Nov 2015 03:04:02 GMT  (180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02290v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["camila v sundermann", "marcos a domingues", "ricardo m marcacini", "solange o rezende"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02290"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.02290.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Combining Privileged Information to Improve Context-Aware Recommender Systems", "authors": ["Camila V.

RELATED WORK", "text": "There are three different ways to acquire contextual information: explicitly, implicitly and derived from the use of user information. The explicit acquisition methods collect the contextual information through direct questions to users. The implicit acquisition methods get contextual information directly from web data or environmental techniques. In this essay, we infer the context of websites using text mining techniques that are able to use different methods of word processing: the company (if the meal involves multiple people), the opportunity (for which the event is), time (in the city where the event took place), and they developed their algorithms by using natural language processing tools such as AT4."}, {"heading": "III. OUR PROPOSAL", "text": "As already mentioned, the term context can come from many definitions, depending on the area in which it is dealt with. We consider the definition given by Dey [11] to be the same: \"Context is any definition that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.\" In our work, the entities are web pages (items). In addition to the definition, the contextual information can be represented by many structures. Some researchers treat the context as a hierarchical structure and represent it by trees. Thus, Panniello and Gorgoglione [20] represent the attribute \"period of the year\" as a tree as represented in Figure 1. The idea of this research represents the contextual information that uses a hierarchical structure called topic hierarchy. Topic hierarchies organize texts into groups and subgroups, and for each group, topics are extracted to represent the main topic of the group."}, {"heading": "IV. EMPIRICAL EVALUATION", "text": "The aim of our work is to investigate the effects of the context extracted from our method in context-based recommendation systems. Thus, empirical evaluation consists in comparing the results of the algorithms C. Reduction [2], DaVI-BEST [12], Weight PoF and Filter PoF [20], which all use our context information, with the context-based algorithm Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF) [10]. In this way, we have compared the quality of the recommendations generated from our context with the quality of the recommendations generated without context-based information. In this section, we present the necessary details to understand our experiments: dataset, baseline, context-aware recommendation algorithms, experimental setup, scale and results."}, {"heading": "A. Data Set", "text": "In the experiments, we used a dataset from a Portuguese Agribusiness website, which consisted of 4,659 users, 15,037 accesses and 1,543 pages in Portuguese. In order to construct the theme hierarchies for these websites, we used the text content of the pages, eliminating header, footer and anything not related to the main content of the text. We processed the texts that performed traditional word preprocessing tasks: stop word removal and stem. The representations or \"term value matrix\" were constructed using the term weighting TF-IDF (term frequency inverse document frequency). Three representations were constructed: the traditional muzzle representation (technical information), the representation of the named entities (privileged information I) and the configuration of domain terms (privileged information II). We defined the weighting of the topics, the themes are presented by combining the two types of information we alloyed."}, {"heading": "B. Supporting Tools and Methods", "text": "In the experiments, we used JPretext6 and LIHC7 for preprocessing and hierarchical clustering of items. These two tools are part of Torch [18], a set of tools designed to support text clustering and the construction of topic hierarchies. JPretext transforms the text collection into a \"term value matrix\" and LIHC tool implements the LUPIbased Incremental Hierarchical Clustering method. Named entity recognition was performed using REMBRANDT [7], a system that recognizes classes of named entities such as things, location, organization, people and others in Portuguese texts.

An item-based Collaborative Filtering Model M is a matrix that represents the similarities between all item recommendations, corresponding to a similarity measurement. We used the cosmic angular similarity measure, defined as: sim (i1, i2) = cos (\u2212 \u2192 i1, \u2212 i2) = \u2212 \u2192 i1 \u2212 \u2192 i2, (3), where \u2212 \u2192 i1 and \u2212 i2 are evaluation vectors and the operator \"\u00b7\" is the dot product of the two vectors.

According to Adomavicius and Tuzhilin [3], contextual information can be applied at different stages of the referral process, and according to this criterion, these systems can be divided into three categories: contextual pre-filtering, contextual modeling, and contextual post-filtering.

Experimental Setup and Evaluation Measures", "text": "The protocol for measuring the predictive capability of the receiver systems considered in this paper is the All but One protocol [5] with 10-fold cross-validation, i.e., the set of documents is divided into 10 subsets. For each fold, we use n \u2212 1 of these subsets for training and the rest for testing. The training set Tr is used to create the recommendation model. For each user of the test set Te, one item is hidden as a single set H. The remaining items represent the set of observable items O used in the recommendation. We then calculate the mean mean precision (MAP @ N), with N corresponding to 5 and 10 recommendations. For each configuration and measure, the 10-fold values are summarized by using mean and standard deviations. To compare two recommendation algorithms, we have used the two-sided paired t-test with a confidence level of 95%. In our empirical evaluation, we used the 4 most similar ones to the one, and the 0.1 are the ones that best reflect these recommendations."}, {"heading": "F. Results", "text": "In Table III, we show the results of our ranking using MAP @ N. The results are obtained at four values of the combination factor (\u03b1 = 0.3, \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03b1 = 0.7 and \u03b1 = 1) and at three granularity levels, as described in Section IV-A. For each value of the combination factor, we also have the weights of each type of privileged information. To facilitate understanding of the results, we mentioned the weight of the technical information as BOW, the weight of the designated units as NE and the weight of the domain terms as DT. The results presented are for the three context-aware recommendation algorithms (C. Reduction, Weight PoF and Filter PoF) and also for the baseline IBCF. The DaVI-BEST results are not presented because they are equivalent to the IBCF results. Thus, there is no improvement extracted by using this algorithm and the contextual information. The analysis of the results can be divided into 3 questions: What is the algorithm with the results?"}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we proposed to use contextual information from topic hierarchies constructed by the LIHC method to improve the accuracy of contextual recommendation systems; empirical evaluation showed that by using topics from the topic hierarchies with combined privileged information as context information, contextual recommendation systems could make better recommendations; the contextual information derived from the three topic hierarchies improved the recommendations in 3 of 4 recommendation systems evaluated in this paper: C. Reduction, Weight PoF and Filter PoF (in most experiments); as a future work, we will conclude some experiments in which we compare the combined use of the two types of privileged information with the results of our previous studies using named units and domain terms."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The authors thank FAPESP (grant # 2010 / 20564-8, # 2012 / 13830-9 and # 2013 / 16039-3, Research Foundation Sao Paulo (FAPESP)) and CAPES / Brazil for their financial support."}], "references": [{"title": "Mining context information from consumer\u2019s reviews", "author": ["S.

"year": 2015, "abstractText": "A recommender system is an information filtering technology which can be used to predict preference ratings of items (products, services, movies, etc) and/or to output a ranking of items that are likely to be of interest to the user. Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) learn and predict the tastes and preferences of users by incorporating available contextual information in the recommendation process. One of the major challenges in context-aware recommender systems research is the lack of automatic methods to obtain contextual information for these systems. Considering this scenario, in this paper, we propose to use contextual information from topic hierarchies of the items (web pages) to improve the performance of context-aware recommender systems. The topic hierarchies are constructed by an extension of the LUPI-based Incremental Hierarchical Clustering method that considers three types of information: traditional bag-of-words (technical information), and the combination of named entities (privileged information I) with domain terms (privileged information II). We evaluated the contextual information in four context-aware recommender systems. Different weights were assigned to each type of information. The empirical results demonstrated that topic hierarchies with the combination of the two kinds of privileged information can provide better recommendations.
