Introduction In many search applications, the search engine should guess the correct results from a given query; therefore, it is important to deliver a diversified and representative set of documents to a user. Diversification can be viewed as a trade-off between having more relevant results and having more diverse results among the top results for a given query [3]. \u201cJaguar\u201d is a cliche example in the diversification literature [2, 4, 9], but it illustrates the point perfectly as it has different meanings including car, animal, and a football team. A set of good \u201cquality\u201d result should cover all these diversified items. The paper by Borodin et al [1] determines the good quality results with a monotone submodular function and defines diversity as the sum of distances between selected objects. Since they consider the distances to be metric, they ask in the conclusion section: For a relaxed version of the triangle inequality can we relate the approximation ratio to the parameter of a relaxed triangle inequality? In this study we answer to this question. We call this relaxed triangle inequality distance as semi-metric. A semi-metric distance on a set of items is just like a metric distance, but the triangle inequality is relaxed with a parameter \u03b1 \u2265 1 (i.e., d(u, v) \u2264 \u03b1(d(v, w)+d(w, u))). Answering to this question will make this method applicable to algorithms that are defined on semi-metric spaces, e.g., [5, 7, 8]. The IBM\u2019s Query by Image Content system is one of the other best-known examples of the semi-metric usage in practice; although, it does not 2 S. Abbasi Zadeh and M. Ghadiri satisfy the triangle inequality [6]. By modifying the analysis of the previous proposed algorithms in [1], we will show that these algorithms can still achieve a 2\u03b1-approximation for this question in the case that there is not any matroid constraint and a 2\u03b1-approximation for an arbitrary matroid constraint. In other words, these new modified analysis are a generalization of the previous analysis as they are consistent with the previous approximation ratios for \u03b1 = 1 (i.e., the metric distance). Problem 1. Max-Sum Diversification Let U be the underlying ground set, and let d(., .) be a semi-metric distance function on U . The goal of the problem is to find a subset S \u2286 U that: maximizes f(S) + \u03bb \u2211 {u,v}:u,v\u2208S d(u, v) subject to |S| = p, where p is a given constant number and \u03bb is a parameter specifying a trade-off between the distance and submodular function. We give a 2\u03b1\u2212approximation for this problem. Firstly we introduce our notations following [1]. For any S \u2286 U , we let d(S) = \u2211 {u,v}:u,v\u2208S d(u, v). We can also define d(S, T ), for any two disjoint sets S and T as: d(S \u222a T )\u2212 d(S)\u2212 d(T ). Let \u03c6(S) and u be the value of the objective function and an element in U \u2212 S respectively. We can define the marginal gain of the distance function as du(S) = \u2211 v\u2208S d(u, v) and similarly marginal gain of the wight function as: fu(S) = f(S + u)\u2212 f(S). The total marginal gain can also be defined using du(S) and fu(S) as \u03c6u(S) = fu(S) + \u03bbdu(S). Let f \u2032 u(S) = 1 2 fu(S), \u03c6u(S) = f \u2032 u(S) + \u03bbdu(S). Starting with an empty set S, the greedy algorithm (Algorithm 1) adds an element u from U \u2212 S in each iteration, in such a way that maximize \u03c6u(S). Lemma 1. Given an \u03b1-relaxed triangle inequality semi-metric distance function d(., .), and two disjoint sets X and Y , we have the following inequality: \u03b1(|X | \u2212 1)d(X,Y ) \u2265 |Y |d(X) Max-Sum Diversification and Semi-metric Spaces 3 Algorithm 1 Greedy algorithm 1: Input 2: U : set of ground elements 3: p: size of final set 4: Output 5: S: set of selected elements with size p 6: S = \u2205 7: while |S| < p do 8: find u \u2208 U \\ S maximizing \u03c6\u2032 u (S) 9: S = S \u222a {u} 10: end while 11: return S Proof. Consider u, v \u2208 X and an arbitrary w \u2208 Y . We know that: \u03b1(d(v, w) + d(w, u)) \u2265 d(u, v) By changing w we get: \u03b1(d({v}, Y ) + d({u}, Y )) \u2265 |Y |d(u, v) and then all combinations of u and v: \u03b1(|X | \u2212 1)d(X,Y ) \u2265 |Y |d(X) Theorem 1. Algorithm 1 achieves a 2\u03b1-approximation for solving Problem 1 with \u03b1-relaxed distance d(., .) and monotone submodular function f . Proof. Let Gi be the greedy solution at the end of step i, i < p and G be the greedy solution at the end of the algorithm. Suppose that O is the optimal solution and let A = O \u2229 Gi, B = Gi \\ A and C = O \\ A. Obviously the algorithm achieves the optimal solution when p = 1; thus we assume p > 1. Now we consider two different cases: |C| = 1 and |C| > 1. If |C| = 1 then i = p\u2212 1. Let C = {v} and u be the element that algorithm will take for the next (last) step. Then for all v \u2208 U \\ S we have: \u03c6u(Gi) \u2265 \u03c6 \u2032 v(Gi) f \u2032 u(Gi) + \u03bbdu(Gi) \u2265 f \u2032 v(Gi) + \u03bbdv(Gi) thus: \u03c6u(Gi) = fu(Gi) + \u03bbdu(Gi) \u2265 f \u2032 u(Gi) + \u03bbdu(Gi) \u2265 f \u2032 v(Gi) + \u03bbdv(Gi) \u2265 1 2 \u03c6v(Gi) 4 S. Abbasi Zadeh and M. Ghadiri as a result \u03c6(G) \u2265 12\u03c6(O) \u2265 1 2\u03b1\u03c6(O). Now consider |C| > 1. By using Lemma 1 we have the following inequalities: \u03b1(|C| \u2212 1)d(B,C) \u2265 |B|d(C) (1) \u03b1(|C| \u2212 1)d(A,C) \u2265 |A|d(C) (2) \u03b1(|A| \u2212 1)d(A,C) \u2265 |C|d(A) (3) A and C are two disjoint sets and we know that A \u222a C = O; thus: d(A,C) + d(A) + d(C) = d(O) (4) We can assume that p > 1 and |C| > 1 (The greedy algorithm obviously finds the optimal solution when p = 1). Then following multipliers are applied to equations 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively: 1 (|C|\u22121) , |C|\u2212|B| p(|C|\u22121) , i p(p\u22121) , i|C| \u03b1p(p\u22121) . If we add them, we have: d(B,C) + d(A,C)\u2212 d(A,C) i|C|(1 \u2212 1 \u03b1 ) p(p\u2212 1) \u2212 d(C) i|C|(p\u2212 |C|) \u03b1p(p\u2212 1)(|C| \u2212 1) \u2265 d(O) i|C| \u03b1p(p \u2212 1) Since p > |C| and \u03b1 \u2265 1, d(A,C) + d(B,C) \u2265 d(O) i|C| \u03b1p(p \u2212 1) . thus (we substituted 1 \u03b1 with x, thus 0 < x \u2264 1), d(C,Gi) \u2265 d(O) xi|C| p(p \u2212 1) From the submodularity of f (.) we can get \u2211 v\u2208C f \u2032 v(Gi) \u2265 f (C \u222aGi)\u2212 f (Gi) also the monotonity of f (.) suggests that f (C \u222aGi)\u2212 f (Gi) \u2265 f (O) \u2212 f (G). Subsequently we have: \u2211 v\u2208C f \u2032 v(Gi) \u2265 f (O)\u2212 f (G). Max-Sum Diversification and Semi-metric Spaces 5", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
