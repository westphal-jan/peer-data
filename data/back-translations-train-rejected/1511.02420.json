In this paper, we design an ozone level alarm system (OLP) for Isfahan city and test it through the real word data from 1-1-2000 to 7-6-2011. We propose a computer based system with three inputs and single output. The inputs include three sensors of solar ultraviolet (UV), total solar radiation (TSR) and total ozone (O3). And the output of the system is the predicted O3 of the next day and the alarm massages. A developed artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm is applied to determine the output, based on the inputs variables. For this issue, AI models, including supervised brain emotional learning (BEL), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), are compared in order to find the best model.

Introduction", "text": "The ozone level can be considered a chaotic time series. In the literature, there are two approaches to predicting the ozone level, including 1) non-linear differential equation methods and 2) neural methods. Mathematical models include Kalman Filter, ARMA, ARCH and GARCH, etc., and artificial intelligence methods consist of learning-based methods such as multi-layer neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and the brain of emotional learning (BEL). AI methods can learn the behavior of the data by observing the previous values and can predict future values. First, this approach aims to design an ozone-level alarm system."}, {"heading": "2.1. BEL", "text": "The BEL algorithm comes from a neurophysiological aspect of the brain, shows that it is an analog, correct learning algorithm and is a suitable online predictor for complex systems. The supervised BEL approach (Lotfi and Akbarzadeh 2013; 2014a; 2014b; 2014c) [10] can learn pattern target examples and apply well to prediction problems. In addition, BEL benefits from a decay mechanism for amygdala and a monotonic learning rule. It is a novel recognition artifact with a very simple structure, motivated by neurophysiological knowledge of the limbic system of the brain [13-20]. SupervisedBEL can be used in pattern recognition, classification of ions, prediction problems and adaptation problems. The supervised BEL is used here to predict the ozone level of the Isfahan city, where the low ozone threshold is very dangerous."}, {"heading": "2.2 ANFIS", "text": "ANFIS [45] combines the fuzzy approaches with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to take advantage of their advantages. In the ANFIS model, the fuzzy rules and membership functions are automatically generated by a learning algorithm for neural networks. Fig. 3 shows the architecture of the Sugeno type ANFIS. This architecture comprises the following five layers: fuzzier, production, normalized, defuzzy and output layer. In this example, the learning parameters including w1, w2, z1, z2 and A1, A2, B1, B2 are adjusted using input target examples (Jang 1997)."}, {"heading": "2.3 ANN", "text": "ANN is similar to the actual networks of neuronal cells (neurons) in the brain. ANN have special properties such as the ability to learn and generalize. ANN learns through the error-back propagation algorithm. According to this algorithm, the error of the output units is propagated back to adjust the connection weights within the network. ANN's 2-2-1 architecture is illustrated in Fig. 4. It is a two-input output architecture with two neurons in a hidden layer. This architecture has a single hidden layer with two hidden neurons. After learning, the inputs and outputs of this model include the following equation:), (ttnett yxfz (3) Where tz is predicted at the time t."}, {"heading": "3. Simulation results", "text": "The data set shows the daily ozone content of Isfahan between January 1, 2000 and June 6, 2011. Figure 4 shows the first 500 values of the ozone values in the Isfahan timeframe. The data set is divided into three parts; the first is the training set, which contains 70% of the randomly selected data; and the second is the validation set, which consists of 15% data; and the third test set, which evaluates the forecast results and accounts for 15% of the data. Figure 6 illustrates the comparative forecast results obtained from BEL, ANN, and ANFIS.According to the results, ANFIS shows a higher correlation that BEL and ANN. Figures 7 and 8 show the target and forecast value of the forecast wave obtained from BEL and ANN."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusions", "text": "In this thesis, we first propose a novel alarm system for the ozone level. Secondly, we develop the BEL algorithm for the ozone value prediction and compare the results of BEL, ANFIS and ANN to find the best AI model in the system. In the numerical studies, BEL, ANFIS and ANN are used to predict the ozone value of Isfahan. According to the simulations, ANFIS shows a higher correlation in the prediction task. ANFIS is associated with three input sensors of O3, UV and TSR and can be used with a certain threshold value as an alarm module for large cities."}], "references": [{"title": "Emotional Brain-Inspired Adaptive Fuzzy Decayed Learning for online prediction problems", "author": ["E.

important task of air quality agencies of modern cities. In this paper, we design an ozone level alarm system (OLP) for Isfahan city and test it through the real word data from 1/1/2000 to 7/6/2011. We propose a computer based system with three inputs and single output. The inputs include three sensors of solar ultraviolet (UV), total solar radiation (TSR) and total ozone (O3). And the output of the system is the predicted O3 of the next day and the alarm massages. A developed artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm is applied to determine the output, based on the inputs variables. For this issue, AI models, including supervised brain emotional learning (BEL), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), are compared in order to find the best model. The simulation of the proposed system shows that it can be used successfully in prediction of major cities\u2019 ozone level.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
