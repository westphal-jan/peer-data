Korean is good at tagging than Chinese, so we can use this property in Chinese POS tagging. Keyword : machine translation, part of speech tagging, corpus Introduction Previous POS(Part Of Speech) tagging methods of Chinese can be largely classified into 2. One is a method using POS tagging rules that is extracted by Chinese experts, and the other is to u se a statistical model, it usually needs huge Chinese corpus. In case of use the first method, it is very difficult to extract rules and these rules can\u2019t represent va rious language examples. So this method was used in the early years of POS tagging and has been used together with other methods. Other method, corpus-based statistical methods have many advantages, but it needs large amount of POS corpus. To solve these problems, some researchers are studying about a method that uses raw text data ext racted from internet[2, 5, 6]. In this paper we propose a POS decision method imitate Chinese translator whose native language is Korean and POS decision rule extracting method using Chinese \u2013Korean bilingual corpus. 1. Availability of Korean translation information in Chinese POS decision Machine translation system is a typical expert system, so the closer translation method to translati on expert, the higher accuracy of the translation system. Translation expert whose mother tongue is Korean generate Korean words from Chinese words w hen he translates Chinese, and verifies their translation and finally complete the translation. For example, consider following sentence. \u7cbe\u5bc6\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u57fa\u7840(\uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc774\ub2e4.) When the expert translates this sentence, expert generate Chinese words \u2018\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u2019 from \u300a\uacfc\ud559 \uc5f0\uad6c\u300b, and he knows these words are right words and \u300a\uacfc\ud559\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4\u300bare not right through his experience. Classical method is to divide the sentence as \u7cbe\u5bc6/\u7684/\u89c2\u5bdf/\u662f/\u79d1\u5b66/\u7814\u7a76/\u7684/\u57fa\u7840, and decide the POS of multi-POS word\u2018\u7814\u7a76\u2019using statistical information. This method largely depends on the amount of corpus and their fields. We can use Korean POS tagging system for this problem. Using the POS tagged words of \u300a\uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc774\ub2e4.\u300b, we can realize the n oun combination of \u300a\uacfc\ud559\uc5f0\uad6c\u300band it tells us the POS of Chinese word \u2018\u7814\u7a76\u2019is noun. In conclusion using large amount of Korean POS tagged corpus, we can improve the performance of Chinese POS tagging system. 2. Acquisition method of POS decision rule from Chinese-Korean bilingual corpus. Above-mentioned method can be applied into noun noun conjunction, but it can not be applied in to verb decision and so on. Generally we use following rules for the POS decision of Chinese multi POS words. <ruleset name=\"posdecpos\" kind=\"vn\"> <rule cond=\"any+word(\u4e86)\"> setpos(0,v) </rule> Acquisition of these rules generally needs many efforts and it is difficult to decide the confidence of rule. We can use Chinese-Korean bilingual corpus to extract statistical rule. Consider the acquisition method through a example. Chinese sentence: \u6211\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56fd\u8bed Translation: \ub098\uc758 \ub3d9\ubb34\ub294 \uc911\uad6d\uc5b4\ub97c \ubc30\uc6b4\ub2e4 For above example, do the word dividing for Chinese and do the POS tagging for Korean. \u6211/\u7684/\u670b\u53cb/\u5b66\u4e60/\u4e2d\u56fd\u8bed \ub098/N \uc758/T \ub3d9\ubb34/N \ub294/T \uc911\uad6d\uc5b4/N \ub97c/T \ubc30\uc6b0\ub2e4/V \u1102\ub2e4/T In this sentence, morpheme analysis of \u300a\ubc30\uc6b4\ub2e4\u300bis \u300a\ubc30\uc6b0\ub2e4/\ub3d9\uc0ac + \u1102\ub2e4/\ub9fa\uc74c\ud1a0\u300band verb t ranslation of \u5b66\u4e60 is \u300a\ubc30\uc6b0\ub2e4\u300b, so \u5b66\u4e60 is used in verb. Chinese sentence Cs and Korean sentence Ks can be represented as follows.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
