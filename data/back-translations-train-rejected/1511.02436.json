Since MCI leads to deterioration in the cognitive abilities of nerve cells that control cognitive, linguistic and linguistic processes [4, 5], language impairments caused by verbal expressions may indicate signs of MCI [6, 7, 8]. In [9], on the other hand, complex syntactical characteristics were used to distinguish between 37 patients with MCI and 37 healthy control groups. Seven statistically significant linguistic features of \"immediate logic memory\" were combined with multiple test values to achieve 86.1% AUC. In contrast, we distinguished MCI patients using multiple skip diagrams alone [10]. The skip diagrams are able to represent the language space of MCI patients due to the lexical and synchronous errors that we frequently observe in their language."}, {"heading": "2 Learning linguistic skip-gram biomarkers", "text": "In contrast to ordinary n-grams, word marks are skipped intermittently while n-grams are created. In the sentence \"Take the Cookie Jar,\" for example, there are three conventional bigrams: \"Take the Cookie Jar,\" \"Take the Cookie Jar,\" and \"Cookie Jar.\" We believe that such \"Skip-grams\" could capture unique linguistic biomarkers in verbal expressions. \u2212 For example, we used a combination of \"Skip-grams\" to effectively distinguish MCI patients from their healthy controls. For each sentence \"S = {w1... wm} in a verbal dialogue, we define\" k-skip-n-grams \"from\" Jookie-n-grams, \"with\" Jookie-n-grams \"and...\""}, {"heading": "3 Experiments and Results", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that the two cases are very complex."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was carried out in part by the multidisciplinary research platform Tropical Medicine and Biology at Monash University Malaysia and the Malaysian Ministry of Education and Basic Research (FRGS) - FRGS / 2 / 2014 / ICT07 / MUSM / 03 / 1.
