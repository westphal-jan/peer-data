In this paper, we argue that while emoticons are strong and common signals of sentiment expression on social media the relationship between emoticons and sentiment polarity are not always clear. Thus, any algorithm that deals with sentiment polarity should take emoticons into account but extreme cau- tion should be exercised in which emoticons to depend on. First, to demonstrate the prevalence of emoticons on social media, we analyzed the frequency of emoticons in a large re- cent Twitter data set. Then we carried out four analyses to examine the relationship between emoticons and sentiment polarity as well as the contexts in which emoticons are used. The first analysis surveyed a group of participants for their perceived sentiment polarity of the most frequent emoticons. The second analysis examined clustering of words and emoti- cons to better understand the meaning conveyed by the emoti- cons. The third analysis compared the sentiment polarity of microblog posts before and after emoticons were removed from the text. The last analysis tested the hypothesis that removing emoticons from text hurts sentiment classification by training two machine learning models with and without emoticons in the text respectively. The results confirms the arguments that: 1) a few emoticons are strong and reliable signals of sentiment polarity and one should take advantage of them in any senti- ment analysis; 2) a large group of the emoticons conveys com- plicated sentiment hence they should be treated with extreme caution.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Nov 2015 02:31:31 GMT  (507kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02556v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["hao wang", "jorge a castanon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02556"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.02556.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Sentiment Expression via Emoticons on Social Media", "authors": ["Hao Wang", "Jorge A.

Clustering emoticons and words", "text": "Interesting questions about the use of emoticons are what context they are normally used in and what meaning emoticons convey. In this analysis, we used two machine learning algorithms to answer these questions. Second, we use the k-mean algorithm to group the words so that we understand the exact meaning of the emoticons by the words that appear in the same cluster. Both machine learning algorithms help us to define and interpret the emoticons in the context of the Twitter data."}, {"heading": "B ;) :-) ;-) :-D =D ;P =]", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "C :( :/ XD :') :'( :-( D: ;( :-/ :| :\\", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "D :P ;D :-P :] :p", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "B. Sentiment expression with vs. without emoticons", "text": "To understand the degree to which emoticons were used to express feelings, we performed this analysis to compare the feelings of a tweet before and after the removal of emoticons from the text. Such a comparison would show how many emoticons were used to express feelings in a tweet. 500 tweets were randomly selected from the tweets with emoticons dated March 4, 2015. They were commented manually on with one of the three labels: positive feelings, negative feelings or other. The same set of tweets were manually re-tagged with the three labels after the emoticons were removed from the text (including emoticons). By comparing the changes in the labels, we can understand how exactly emoticons express feelings in tweets. Table 4 shows the confusion matrix of emoticons after the emoticons were removed from the text."}, {"heading": "C.
