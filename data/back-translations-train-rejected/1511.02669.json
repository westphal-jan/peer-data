INTRODUCTIONAssessment is an essential part of the learning process, especially in formative learning environments. In the current context of massive open online courses (MOOCs), assessment is a challenge because it aims to ensure consistency, reliability, and no favoritism of one person against another. In formative assessments, the problem of workload and timely results is even greater, as the task is performed more frequently, while the interpretation of a human marker differs from others. While essay questions are beneficial for learning and evaluating students, there are obvious disadvantages for the teacher. Assessing essay and discussion questions is time-consuming, even with the help of teachers. Automated essay grading [21] aims to automatically assign a student a grade to an essay, because assessing the quality of the essay is critical to assessing the reasoning structure."}, {"heading": "II.

CONCLUSION", "text": "We developed an NLP tool for the automatic assessment of essays in different areas. In order to be able to compare the text written by a student with the requirements of a human evaluator, we created assignments in natural language from a particular domain ontology. The main advantage is that the user can select different ontologies for processing text in different areas. However, confidence in the assessment depends on the precision of the text tracing method, which relies on domain records for training. In line with [15], we are currently trying to assess confidence in the system by making more comparisons with people who rate essays."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We thank the reviewers for their valuable comments.
