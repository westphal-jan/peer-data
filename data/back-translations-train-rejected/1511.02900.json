Existing techniques for disaggregation rely on energy metering at a resolution of 1 minute or higher, but most power meters today only provide a reading once per month, and at most once every 15 minutes. In this paper, we propose a new technique called Neighbourhood NILM that leverages data from 'neighbouring' homes to disaggregate energy given only a single energy reading per month. The key intuition behind our approach is that 'similar' homes have 'similar' energy consumption on a per-appliance basis. Neighbourhood NILM matches every home with a set of 'neighbours' that have direct submetering infrastructure, i.e. power meters on individual circuits or loads. Many such homes already exist. Then, it estimates the appliance-level energy consumption of the target home to be the average of its K neighbours. We evaluate this approach using 25 homes and results show that our approach gives comparable or better disaggregation in comparison to state-of-the-art accuracy reported in the literature that depend on manual model training, high frequency power metering, or both. Results show that Neighbourhood NILM can achieve 83% and 79% accuracy disaggregating fridge and heating/cooling loads, compared to 74% and 73% for a technique called FHMM. Furthermore, it achieves up to 64% accuracy on washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, and lighting loads, which is higher than previously reported results.

RELATED WORK", "text": "There are three broad categories of related work in the literature: 1) traditional NILM approaches; 2) NILM approaches that harness large amounts of data; and 3) studies of the correlation between household characteristics and energy consumption."}, {"heading": "A. Traditional NILM approaches", "text": "Since its inception in the early 1980s by George Hart [14], the field of NILM has seen various approaches based on different machine learning techniques that use different characteristics of the current track. However, many of these approaches require submetered data to learn a model of each device, and these models have not shown that they generalize well in all households. Even if the models generalize, these approaches would require high-frequency power measurement with resolutions of one minute or higher. High-frequency approaches (> 10 kHz) [10] use features such as voltage-current trajectories to detect events in aggregated current time series, all of which are growing linearly with the introduction of submetering and smart metering infrastructure. Current smart meters do not collect data at such high rates because they are designed and used for time-of-use purposes, and there is currently no effort to deploy devices for energy distribution on a large scale."}, {"heading": "B. NILM approaches leveraging large quantities of data", "text": "Large amounts of data have recently been made available, both in terms of the number of households and the duration of household work. Lately, the availability of large data in related machine learning fields such as image classification using deep neural networks has shown a lot of success. Kelly et al. [17] are inspired by the success of deep neural networks and apply it to the problem of energy breakdown, where they show that their technique exceeds various benchmarks for all devices, including devices that exhibit poor accuracy when modeled as FSMs. Their hypothesis is that deep neural networks, given \"sufficient\" data, can learn characteristics of any complex device and find its activations efficiently as they fall apart. Unlike their approach, which treats each house independently, our approach uses the relationship of \"higher order\" that exists between households to refute the total energy of a house."}, {"heading": "III.

EVALUATION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Data set", "text": "We use the publicly available dataset from Dataport [22] to evaluate our approach. Dataport's dataset contains aggregate and appliance data for more than 700 households in Texas, USA for a period of up to three years. Total energy data for submeter and household appliances were collected with a resolution of 1 minute. 70 households contain data for one year (2013) on 6 interesting appliances (refrigerator, air conditioning, lighting, dryer, washing machine and dishwasher) and household metadata such as number of residents, area of the house and number of rooms. While the dataset contains submeter data from a large number of household appliances, only the selected 6 appliances contained data on a significant number of households."}, {"heading": "B. Baseline approaches and upper bound", "text": "We compare the accuracy of our approach against the following: 1) National Average: The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides a breakdown of household electricity consumption in the US by final consumption [12] as shown in Table II. This provides an estimate of the average contribution of different appliances to total household energy consumption. The \"national average\" energy consumption for a appliance is calculated to be the share of total household energy, as indicated by national estimates in Table II. It should be noted that the US national average is below estimates of HVAC energy consumption for the Texas region, especially in the summer months. Texas exhibits a higher temperature than most US states and therefore has a higher contribution of 18% for HVAC loads, compared to national averages. [11] We use the Texas average, and for all other appliances 5http: / / blog.oliverparson.co.uk / 2014 / 06 / wikienergy-data-set-statistics.html (for which we do not have data) we use the average energy consumption values."}, {"heading": "C. Evaluation metric", "text": "Based on the indicators used in previous literature [6], [19] we define energy accuracy (%) as: 100 - | Predicted device energy - Actual device energy | \u00d7 100% Actual device energyGiven that the ratio | Predicted device energy - Actual device energy | Actual device energy may be more than 1 if the prediction is far from actual use, the accuracy is considered to be 0 in such cases. Higher \"energy accuracy (%)\" indicates better breakdown performance."}, {"heading": "D. Experimental setup", "text": "Our experimental setup attempts to replicate the following real-world scenarios - we have a small subset of submeter households and a large number of households without smart meters. However, our dataset has the limitation that only a small number of households (25), the aggregate and appliance energy is available for a long time (1 year) and household features. Therefore, we use leave-one-out cross-validation technology to evaluate our approach, assuming that the entirety of submeter households are all households except the test house. We use data from 2013 for our evaluation. For all households, we had an aggregate and appliance monthly energy consumption calculation for the 12 months. Our task was to predict the monthly energy consumption for each appliance in these 25 households. For the HVAC, the evaluation was performed only in the months (May-October) in which it is typically used in Texas. For our approach, we make a weep (the number of neighbors)."}, {"heading": "E. Results", "text": "Our main finding in Figure 3 shows that Neighbourhood NILM provides comparable or better fragmentation performance across all loads compared to FHMM, estimates from the national average and the best-reported NILM accuracy. The optimal combination of K neighbors and feature subsets is shown in Table III. The fact that the \"oracle\" achieves a sufficiently higher accuracy than our approach suggests that there is scope to further improve our results by using better features. Furthermore, the \"oracle\" shows our approach to be promising as it exceeds the best-reported accuracy in the NILM literature. FHMM's fragmentation performance in washing machines, dishwashers, dryers and lighting is poor and its accuracy is 0%. This is consistent with previous literature showing that these loads are particularly difficult to fragment [4]. In contrast, our approach gives such fragmentation performance of HMM and HMM as well as their accuracy in washing machines and dryers."}, {"heading": "F. Sensitivity analysis", "text": "Having described the \"highest\" accuracy that can be achieved by our approach for all appliances, we now perform a sensitivity analysis for the number of neighbors (K) and subsets of feature vectors. While calculating the sensitivity of our approach to K, we select the optimal characteristic (from Table III) for each appliance and vary K. Figure 5 shows the differences in accuracy between different K. Heavily used appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners show little difference in accuracy for different K. Other appliances exhibit a large variation between households and therefore their accuracy differs significantly from K. In particular, the dishwasher has a low accuracy for a small number of neighbors. Since the prediction would be based on a larger number of neighbors, a weighted factor of prediction based on smaller neighbors would be the dishwasher showing a low accuracy. This indicates that the dishwasher characteristic requires further work steps. While we choose the sensitivity based on our optimal characteristics (based on our optimal approach to the table III)."}, {"heading": "V. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "Our work has five major limitations that are described below: 1: Our work has only been tested on a single dataset that contains houses from a single geographical location (Texas) that are related to the dataset. While many NILM datasets have been published in the past, none of the other datasets meet the requirements for a large number of homes. Given the high variability present in the accommodations, we cannot assume that the aggregates will be the sum of the submetric loads."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The results show that our approach outperforms modern NILM technology, which relies on smart meters. Neighbourhood NILM can achieve 83% and 79% accuracy in separating refrigerator and heating / cooling loads, compared to 74% and 73% for a technique called FHMM. In addition, it can achieve up to 64% accuracy for washing machine, dryer, dishwasher and lighting, which is higher than the previously reported results. Many existing techniques are not able to separate these loads at all."}], "references": [{"title": "Detecting anomalies in activities of daily living of elderly residents via energy disaggregation and cox processes", "author": ["J.
