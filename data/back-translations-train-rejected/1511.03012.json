In order to derive the character type from literary texts, even the human reader could be confronted with problems [4]. Interactions between literary characters contain rich social networks. The extraction of these social networks from narrative texts has in various areas such as literary fiction [6], screenplays [1] or novels [9]. Our goal is to accurately determine the relationships of a character in a story and to find his role in the development of the story."}, {"heading": "II.

DISCUSSION", "text": "We can implement our solution in other areas instead of folk tales. We illustrate this by three areas: a) software requirements, b) marketing, and c) medical. Consider the area of software requirements, where these requirements are written in natural language. Our system supports the identification of various actors that appear in the requirement document. First, it is necessary to replace popular ontology with a requirement ontology that provides knowledge of use cases, actors, their roles, etc. The same pipeline is used to: 1) identify key actors (administrators, various users, etc.) and 2) extract knowledge of various actions that these actors are to take. Another area that could benefit from the same pipeline of execution would be the marketing area. Consider a data set of product ratings or accommodation locations in the tourism sector [20]. The system would only extract the sentences that relate to the mentioned element of execution, with no further access to the entire set of sentences."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Our current accuracy for information extraction in the folktal area is 74%. Experimental results were obtained for seven stories in the folktal area. Accuracy is above 90%, with a total retrieval rate of only 60%, there is a high probability that not all information about a product has been extracted. The developed algorithms aggregate three different services: first, the designated entity detection was implemented using an ontology based on the formal model of Propps. Based on this ontology and some implemented Jape rules, the characters are extracted from a given story; second, a tool for dissolving references was implemented by introducing an anaphorical resolution to eliminate correferenced words and replace them with their representative ones; third, finding relationships between the characters was integrated to associate two nouns with a verbal phrase."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We thank the reviewers for their valuable comments.
