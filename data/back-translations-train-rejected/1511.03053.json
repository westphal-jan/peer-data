This unit, also called a marker, can be either a morpheme, a word or a phrase. As comparisons are based on comparisons, they occur in several languages of the world. Bouverot (1969) distinguishes between type I and type II comparisons depending on the marker used and the semantic or structural nuances it introduces. While type I comparisons are characterized by a limited number of comparisons, prepositions or conjunctions that traditionally mediate a comparison, type II comparisons are observed after a verb or an adjective that semantically contains the idea of simitude or difference."}, {"heading": "2 Adjective and verb simile markers", "text": "Since the comparison is a semantic construction, there are no comprehensive and finite lists of verb and adjective simile markers. The choice of markers for adjectives and verb similies used in this experiment was based on their ability to introduce phrasal comparisons, i.e. comparisons in which the compared term is a common noun. As far as verb simile markers are concerned, impersonal constructions that only accept indeterminate pronouns as subjects were ignored, such as in the French phrase \"J're aime sa voix, on e\u00fbt dit une pluie de grelots.\" Under the category of verb simile markers, modified forms not found in literature, such as \"be / become.... kind / sort / type of\" and \"verb + less / more than\" and their respective French equivalents \"\u00eatre / devenir....\" esp\u00e8ce / type / genre / sorte / conjective \"were included,\" such as \"may mark apical expressions more like in 1997 literature, although they may be more specific to specific markers than in specific terms.\""}, {"heading": "3 Corpus building and extraction method", "text": "To identify equality candidates, digital versions of various literary texts were collected mainly from the Project Gutenberg website 1 and the Biblioth\u00e8que \u00e9lectronique du Qu\u00e9bec 2 for British and French novels respectively. Most novels included in the corpus were written in the 19th century to ensure linguistic homogeneity, and because in that century the novel asserted itself as the dominant literary genre. By observing a ratio of at least 3 novels per author, we were able to compile a corpus of 1191 British novels written by 62 writers and a corpus of 746 French novels written by 57 writers."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "Since similarities are realized primarily within a sentence, the similarity frequency appears to have been calculated first by dividing the number of occurrences of each similarity frequency in a particular novel by the total number of sentences in that novel. However, this measurement does not exactly reflect the distribution of the verb and adjective similarity frequency in a particular novel, as its use does not appear to be influenced by the length of the novel. Therefore, the frequency of any similarity frequency affected in this experiment is measured only by counting its occurrence in a particular novel. Due to their ambiguous use and the noise they introduce into the generated data, markers such as \"remember\" and \"rappeler\" do not appear to be taken into account in the final analysis, and the discrepancy between the frequency of counting of each grammatical category in English and French indicates that the two languages are far apart from each other in terms of similarity."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This work was supported by French sovereign wealth funds, which managed ANR under the Investissements d'Avenir programme under reference ANR-11IDEX-0004-02."}], "references": [{"title": "Comparaison et m\u00e9taphore", "author": ["D.

This unit, also called marker, can either be a morpheme, a word or a phrase. Since similes rely on comparison, they occur in several languages of the world. Depending on the marker used and of the semantic or structural nuances it introduces, two main simile classifications have been proposed. From her study of images built on figures of resemblance in Baudelaire's poetry, Bouverot (1969) distinguishes between type I and type II similes. Whereas type I similes are denoted by a finite number of comparatives, prepositions or conjunctions which traditionally convey a comparison, type II similes are observed after a verb or an adjective which semantically contains the idea of similitude or difference. Leech and Short (2007) propose a stricter distinction and separate conventional similes of the form \u201cX is like Y\u201d from quasi-similes which revolve around all other linguistic constructions. This partition seems to take into account the fact that some simile markers are often preferred in a particular language. For example, \u201elike\u201f in English or \u201ecomme\u201f in French are often presented as the prototypical simile markers and are more frequently used than the other markers. Similes play an important role in literary texts not only as rhetorical devices and as figures of speech but also because of their evocative power, their aptness for description and the relative ease with which they can be combined with other figures of speech (Israel et al. 2004).
