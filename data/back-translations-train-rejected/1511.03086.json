The statistical and algorithmic challenges arising from multirelational data have been addressed in a number of research communities, such as Statistical-Relational Learning, Multi-Relational Data Mining and Inductive Logic Programming. Experience with the UCI Machine Learning Repository1 has shown that a common repository of benchmark data sets facilitates research advancements [1]. The UCI Machine Learning Repository mainly contains data sets 1http: / / archive.ics.uci.edu / ml / in a single data table. Our goal is to provide a similar service to the relational learning community, which contains several contiguous tables."}, {"heading": "2 Design", "text": "The repository is maintained in a public MySQL server hosted by the Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague. Benefits of using the SQL format (SQL stands for \"Structured Query Language\") include the following. \u2022 The SQL format is based on a standard widely used in the industry. The use of SQL databases in machine learning facilitates cross-community knowledge transfer and collaboration between machine learning and database researchers. \u2022 As SQL is a common standard, many programming environments support the access and processing of SQL data. These include machine learning and statistical platforms such as R, Clowdflows [4], RapidMiner and Weka. All common application languages provide SQL database connectivity, including Python, Java and C + +. \u2022 The data description capabilities of SQL provide a foreign programming system."}, {"heading": "3 Content", "text": "The repository currently contains 50 databases, including common benchmark data sets used in relational learning, such as the data set for East and West bound trains [5] or the data set for biodegradability [2]. We have also set ourselves the goal of providing a variety of databases, for example in terms of the number of data sets and in terms of the 2http: / / www.cs.ox.ac.uk / activities / machlearn / Aleph / aleph.htmlComplexity of the relaxation scheme. Therefore, synthetic data sets from different database vendors are included to demonstrate the capabilities of their database software. An example of such a synthetic data set is Adventure Works, which is interesting not only because of its complexity, but also because it uses both simple and compound keys; \u2022 it contains a variety of data types, including file time, blob (images) and geometry; it contains missing values."}, {"heading": "4 Access and Contributions", "text": "Read access can be obtained via a database connection with the following parameters: Hostname relational.fit.cvut.czPort 3306Username guestPassword relationalTo contribute a database, please contact the administrators of the repository; a web contact form is available: https: / / relational.fit.cvut.cz / contact. One option is to provide us with a MySQL dump of your database. Another option is to give us read access to your database on your server so that we can migrate the database to the public server.

The meaning of the columns is as follows. # Relations The number of tables in the database. # Instances Number of rows in the target table. Size in MB including index.Type The record is either a measurement or synthetically generated. Domain The original domain. Task classification or regression. The name of the metadata scheme is Meta. This scheme contains a number of tables with information about the databases as well as the performance of various learning algorithms in the databases. The name of the table that contains information about the databases is Metainformation. Some of this metadata is automatically exported in HTML format to obtain on the website.fit.cvut.cz. Below we list the names of the main column and their meaning. When we refer to \"all columns\" or \"all rows,\" we mean all columns / rows of a table in the structure of the metadata, the most important information of the database."}, {"heading": "5.1 Basic Database Statistics", "text": "Various basic properties such as number of records and missing values.Number of Rows The total number of rows or records max The maximum number of rows or records in a single table.Number of columns The total number of columns or fields.download url A URL that contains more information about the record, such as origin.

The list is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, as it contains: Number of columns = geo-count + date count + praise count + string count The number of columns representing spatial attributes. (These are referred to in MySQL as \"geographic\" attributes.) Number of dates The number of columns representing temporal attributes (date, time, or year).Praise count The number of columns storing large objects (such as images).String count The number of columns in which string values are stored."}, {"heading": "5.3 Foreign Key Structure", "text": "A foreign key points from one table to another. Chen et al. suggest visualizing the foreign key relationships in a semantic kinship graph [3]: The graph contains a directed edge from Table T to Table T when Table T points to T. These columns represent information about the structure of the semantic kinship graph. Primary Key Number The number of primary keys that comprise more than one column.Number of foreign keys Number of foreign keys Number of tables so that the table contains a foreign key reference to one of its own column.This happens, for example, when a relation scheme represents a class hierarchy or taxonomy. has loop Whether there is a loop of foreign key references across multiple tables. An example of a loop is when there are two foreign keys between a person table and a university table - the first foreign key means that a person is studying at a university, while the second foreign key means that the person is teaching at a university."}, {"heading": "5.4 Classification", "text": "Many of the databases in the repository have been used to study classification in relational data. There is often a default class name for such studies; we call this a target attribute. These columns contain information relevant to the target attribute where it exists. Target column The target attribute most commonly used in relational classification studies. Target table The table that contains the target column. Target id The primary key field of the target table. Number of Instance Names The number of class names. Majority class ratio The percentage of the majority class name in the number of instance."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this article we introduced the CTU Prague Relational Learning Repository (PRLR), an easily accessible collection of data sets for relational learning. PRLR was designed with supervised learning in mind. To this end, PRLR contains 49 data sets available for download. One of the most important features of PRLR is that it provides metadata about the data sets. PRLR metadata can be accessed at https: / / beziehal.fit.cvut.cz /."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "We would like to thank all donors who contributed data to the repository and the author of the website, Va'clav Ostroz \u0435l \"\u0131k.
