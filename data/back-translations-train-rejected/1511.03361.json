With respect to high-throughput extraction and analysis of large quantitative imaginary features from standardized medical imaging data, radiomics enables quantitative characterization of tumor phenotypes and the detection and prognosis of cancers over a high-dimensional degradable trait space [1]. Radiomics has already been applied to cases of lung, breast, prostate, and head and neck cancer patients [2] [3] [4] [5], demonstrating the predictive power of radiomics and the potential of radiomic features for personalized medicine, risk stratification, and prediction of patient outcomes. However, these radiomically driven methods are based on pre-defined, hand-made quantitative characteristics that may not be specific to the shape, intensity, and location of cancer."}, {"heading": "2 Methods", "text": "The proposed radiographic discovery framework can be described as follows (see Figure 1): Based on past radiological data and corresponding pathologically verified radiological tissue comments from a medical imaging data repository, the radiographic sequencer discovery process learns a radiographic sequencer that can extract highly adapted radiographic features tailored to characterize unique tis-ar Xiv: 151 1.03 361v 1 [cs.C V] 11 Nsue phenotype that distinguishes cancerous tissue from healthy tissue The radiographic sequencer discovered in this study is based on a deeply conventional StochasticNet [6] architecture in which a deep revolutionary neural network (CNN) neural network is represented as a random neural network (CNN) within a conventional network (CNN)."}, {"heading": "3 Results and Discussion", "text": "In this study, we used a subset of the LIDC-IDRI [8, 9] dataset and obtained a total of 84% of the results tested in Canada. CT images were acquired using a wide range of CT scanner models from various manufacturers, using the following tube peak energies to acquire the scans: 120kV (n = 818), 130kV (n = 31), 135kV (n = 69) and 140kV (n = 100). A subset of 93 patients with definitive diagnostic results was selected and, using data augmentation, an enriched dataset of 42,340 lung lesions was increased by 45% and 10% by rotation of each malignant and benign lesion, respectively. The proposed framework was evaluated on the basis of the enriched dataset and compared quantitatively with two state-of-the-art radiography methods."}], "references": [{"title": "Radiomics: extracting more information from medical images using advanced feature analysis", "author": ["P.
