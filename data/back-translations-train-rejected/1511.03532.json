INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "2. BANK MARKETING DATA", "text": "The UCI Machine Learning Repository supplied the banking marketing data set for this study, which came from a Portuguese bank using its own contact centre to conduct direct marketing campaigns. Although the internet banking channel (e.g. by providing information to specific target customers) served as a secondary channel at times, the communication of human agents via telephones was predominant. Furthermore, each campaign was managed uniformly and the results for all channels combined. The data set was taken from 17 campaigns launched between May 2008 and November 2010. In the course of these telephone campaigns, an attractive, long-term deposit application with good interest rates was proposed. The data relate to the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese credit institution. These campaigns were conducted by telephone calls. In order to determine whether the product (bank deposit) was subscribed, there was often a need to contact the same customer more than once. The aim of the classification was to estimate whether the customer consisted of a variable data set (table 411) and a variable data deposit (table 411)."}, {"heading": "3. DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN MARKETING", "text": "It is clear that the primary objective of MDSS is to support decision-making in a strategic planning context that includes research and development, product design and planning, customer profile analysis, large-scale forecasting, etc. [15] The \"what-if\" capability common to the majority of DSSs allows managers to discover the consequences of a particular strategy or set of options before allocating time and money to the strategy [16]. These simulation models support what-if scenario analysis that highlights important business factors and variables that influence different marketing strategies [17]. The role of DS methods and models in marketing decisions is significant because DSSs were developed first [18]. Over the past five decades, various methods such as optimization, knowledge-based systems and simulations have been developed."}, {"heading": "4. DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENT BANK MARKET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "4.3. Knowledge Base component", "text": "A Knowledge Base is an information repository that allows the user to collect, organize, share, search and use information. A Knowledge Base can be machine-readable or for human use. Knowledge Base allows the user to retrieve and use the knowledge contained in it. Common uses of these Knowledge Base include the addition of a helpdesk or the exchange of information between employees within an organization.Within the Knowledge Base, a considerable amount of information, such as campaign plans, strategies and documents related to the campaign, is shared and stored. Reports and customer lists of the BMMS can be maintained during and at the end of the campaign. Thanks to the Knowledge Base, managers can have control over the process during each step of the campaign and thus make correct decisions."}, {"heading": "4.4. Inference Engine Component", "text": "IBMMS contains an intelligent component with an inference engine. This engine contains rules (if.. then..) derived from the schemes of the Decision Tree algorithm in the analysis component, which help the system provide information about customer preferences, strategies, etc., during a campaign. Although decision trees perform better than many DM algorithms, the decision schemes cannot be used directly in the inference engine. To create the best decision rules, an expert must interpret the decision trees. It may even be necessary to combine a few decision tree models for the inference engine to maximize classification performance. Example codes of the inference engine are given below. Otherwise (dur < 605.5) / / 1 - 3 {if (mon = = 5 | mon = 8 | | | mon = 10) {satir = Yring [18] = Tovert.ToString (Nsatir) String (Nsatir). \""}, {"heading": "4.5 Advisor Component", "text": "This component provides guidance on how the campaign is conducted, taking into account the situations of the customers. In addition, it is possible to intervene in certain aspects, whereas this is not possible for others. To illustrate, the age of the customer is a demographic characteristic that cannot be changed, but the implementation of the campaign in the 6th month is a positive strategy in terms of the success of the campaign for the group of customers under 60 years of age according to the advice. Thanks to the consultant, the manager can see proposed strategic paths at each node of the decision tree and can specify the strategic decisions necessary for the successful execution of the campaign. Thus, each node is a decision threshold that the manager will specify at this point (Fig. 3) will change whether the customers are addressed by the campaign \"YES\" or \"NO.\""}, {"heading": "4.6. User Interface", "text": "IBMMS has a user-friendly interface. Via this interface, the results and situations obtained from the communication and interaction of all components are presented to the customer. Via this interface, the interaction between the components of the system takes place. The entire system is based on Windows and was developed with Visual Studio, NET, ASP and C #. Database operations were carried out with SQL Server 2012."}, {"heading": "4.7. Comparison of IBMMS and Other DM Models", "text": "Reliability is very important in decision support. Two measures are used to separately evaluate the performance of a classifier in different classes: sensitivity and specificity (Table 3). In the following section, we calculate the IBMMS inference motor performance with 45,211 customers.This sensitivity rate shows the impact of previously identified customers who respond positively to the campaign.Specificity = 95.0 21873537735) () (= + + FPPositivFalseTNNegativeTrueIn contrast to sensitivity, the specificity rate shows the impact of previously identified customers who react negatively to the campaign. However, these rates are the results calculated using the IBMMS inference machine using the current IBMMS data. However, market managers can change the customer response with IBMMS and consider their proposed strategies."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "Data mining studies that attempt to solve many banking problems can be found in the literature. However, these studies could not go beyond conducting analyses. Only experts in this field can develop AI data mining techniques and determine how to put them into practice, how to interpret them and how to use them for decision-making. In this study, the expert must have both analytical techniques and how to implement them in this area; however, possessing both characteristics is extremely difficult. A marketing manager of a bank cannot be expected to have knowledge of these issues. Moreover, most analytical techniques do not provide the best results in terms of initial classification or forecasting operations. The parameters of the analysis method evolve until the best model is achieved. These operations are largely carried out through the training and testing processes. At the end of the analysis, the best model that provides the best solution to the problem cannot be presented to managers or decision makers in the form it is found in."}], "references": [{"title": "Data Mining: a competitive tool in the banking and retail industries central council library", "author": ["M.L.
