We say that X is a proposition and an answer to a binary relationship to X. We say that m-Y is a minimal element of Y if there is no Y relationship that is so y-based. 2 We say that it is well-founded (on X) if for all Y-6 = there is such a relationship that Y has a minimal element of Y. Note that in the general definition above the relationship there is no transitive.Lemma 2 The order is well-founded on X iff, there is no infinite -decreasing sequences, i.e. there is no < xi > i-N such a relationship that is xi-1 and xi-xi-based."}, {"heading": "7.1 Soundness", "text": "To prove this, the following problem is of crucial importance: 21Lemma 6 (Preservation of Satisfaction) is (B) (A = \"A\" = \"A\" = \"B\" = \"B\" = \"B\" = \"B\" (A = \"B\" = \"B\" = \"B\" = \"B\" (A = \"B\" = \"B.\") Note: The statement is trivial to the lowest rules because their premises are not satisfactory.

A saturated R structure can be regarded as an abstraction of a model. The weaker idea of a consistent model, that of Nguyen and Szalas [15] includes clauses 1-5 of definition 24, but not the last. Hence, it only ensures the satisfaction of a set of concepts in relation to an empty box."}, {"heading": "9 Related Work", "text": "We have made several changes to the ExpTime tableau algorithm for ALC by Nguyen and Szalas to accommodate metamodeling [15]. First, we have added some rules for dealing with the equations and inequalities that need to be transferred from the tbox to the abox and vice versa. There is also a new rule that returns the inconsistency if a circularity is found. This new rule is crucial to our approach to metamodeling and results in the domain of interpretation being well founded. As our tableau algorithm has the peculiarity of modifying the tbox, the tboxes (and also the mbox) need to be stored in the labels of the and or graphs, a fact that is not necessary in the simpler tableau calculation for the ALC of Nguyen and Szalas."}, {"heading": "10 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "The ExpTime algorithm for ALCM presented in this paper can be optimized in several ways. Instead of first constructing the and-or graph and then checking whether the graph contains a consistent marker, we can do these two tasks simultaneously [20]. Adding (At-B) u (Bt-A) to the Tbox is not efficient because it generates too many extensions with or-branching. We can instead add A-B and apply lazy unfolding optimization techniques [23]. We plan to extend this algorithm to other logical constructors such as cardinality constraints, role hierarchies, and nominals [27,28]. It is also possible to show the completeness of the space for ALCM under certain conditions of unfoldable boxes. Details of this evidence will appear in a separate report."}], "references": [{"title": "The description logic SHIQ with a flexible meta-modelling hierarchy", "author": ["R. Motz", "E.
