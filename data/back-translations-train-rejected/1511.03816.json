However, the key issue of characterizing the different types of drift that can occur has not previously been subjected to rigorous definition and analysis. In particular, while some qualitative drift categorizations have been proposed, few have been formally defined, and the quantitative descriptions required for detailed understanding of learner performance have not existed. We present the first comprehensive framework for quantitative analysis of drift. This supports the development of the first comprehensive set of formal definitions of types of concept drift. The formal definitions clarify ambiguities and identify gaps in previous definitions, giving rise to a new comprehensive taxonomy of concept drift types and a solid foundation for research into mechanisms to detect and address concept drift.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 08:47:38 GMT  (1458kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03816v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 01:04:26 GMT  (634kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03816v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 00:57:13 GMT  (462kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03816v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 8 Dec 2015 21:13:00 GMT  (389kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03816v4", "Accepted for publication in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery"], ["v5", "Thu, 10 Dec 2015 22:10:00 GMT  (389kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03816v5", "Accepted for publication in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery"], ["v6", "Fri, 8 Apr 2016 04:15:33 GMT  (389kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03816v6", "Accepted for publication in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["geoffrey i webb", "roy hyde", "hong cao", "hai long nguyen", "francois petitjean"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.03816"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.03816.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Characterizing Concept Drift", "authors": ["Geoffrey I.

To this end, we have generated synthetic data containing an abrupt drift of a given magnitude. We conducted the experiments at the MOA.

In some cases, these types have received implicit assumptions underlying previous work that flows are subject to drift cycles interrupted by periods of stability. We have also created a new drift type taxonomy covering all the different types of drift that have been identified. In some cases, these types have been given new names that we believe are more significant and less ambiguous than previous terminology."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We are grateful to David Albrecht, Mark Carman and the anonymous reviewers for valuable comments and suggestions.
