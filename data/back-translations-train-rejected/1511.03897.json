We have rigorously analyzed the modeling options as they are applied in the current state of IfcOWL ontology. Based on the identified drawbacks, we propose a novel modeling that facilitates the application of the principles of Linked (Open) Data. Our IfcWoD ontology is not another version of IfcOWL ontology, but a new ontology that uses terms from IfcOWL. Furthermore, part of IfcOWL ontology can be considered a meta model for IfcWoD."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was financed by the French company ACTIVe3D (see http: / / www.active3d.net / fr /) and supported by the Burgundy Regional Council (see http: / / www.region-bourgogne.fr /)."}], "references": [{"title": "Semantic web for the working ontologist: effective modeling in RDF, RDFS and OWL. 1st ed", "author": ["D.
