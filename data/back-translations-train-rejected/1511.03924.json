Corpus examples are judged by the sentence patterns they represent, without taking into account the non-core FEs, the concrete prepositions and the word order, but including the syntactic roles and the grammatical voice. This means that the original sentences are generally covered by paraphrases. We have 57,615 examples from BFN and 3,348 examples from SweFN that belong to the common set of 483 frames. For both BFN and SweFN, the precise sentences are covered by 869 patterns."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion", "text": "This year, it will only take one year for an agreement to be reached."}, {"heading": "8 Related Work", "text": "The main difference between this work and previous approaches to CNL grammar is that we strive to use a robust and well-established semantic model in grammar development. Our approach can be compared to the work on multilingual verbalization of modular ontologies using GF and lemon (Davis et al, 2012), the Lexicon Model for Ontologies. We use additional lexical information about syntactical arguments for building the concrete syntax. Grounding NLG using the frame semantics theory has been addressed in the work on generating text in scene (Coyne et al, 2011) and in the work on text generation for navigation tasks (Roth and Frank, 2010). In this research, the content of frames is supported by aligning between the frame semantics structure and the domain semantics representation. Discourse is supported by the use of aggregation and pronominalization techniques for navigation tasks (Roth and Frank, 2010). In this research, the content of frames is used by aligning between the frame semantics structure and the domain semantics representation. Discourse is supported by the use of the aggregation and pronominalization techniques for navigation tasks (LG, 2010). In this research, we will use frames based on the alignment between the frame semantics structure and the domain semantics representation structure and the domain semantics representation."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we presented a computational approach to multilingual grammar and lexicon extraction and generation from FN-annotated corpora. Methodology for constructing grammars and lexicographies was evaluated in a series of experiments. Results show that we are able to generalize across a number of valence patterns to capture the semantics and syntax of two languages with a common FN-based abstract syntax. We discussed a number of potential improvements to achieve better results that would lead to greater coverage, but the current coverage is already of practical use. We tested the feasibility of the generated grammar library as a semantic API for developing CNL applications in GF."}], "references": [{"title": "FrameNet CNL: A knowledge representation and information extraction language.
