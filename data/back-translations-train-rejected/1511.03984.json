General regression neural network (GRNN), multilayer feed-forward neural network (MLFN) and the SVM models were trained based on experimental data. Four indicators were set as independent variables, including time (h), temperature (C), amount of enzyme (mg) and molar ratio, while the yield of the 3\\b{eta}-O-phthalic ester of betulinic acid was set as the dependent variable. Results show that the GRNN and SVM models have the best prediction results during the testing process, with comparatively low RMS errors (4.01 and 4.23respectively) and short training times (both 1s). The prediction accuracy of the GRNN and SVM are both 100% in testing process, under the tolerance of 30%.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 17:40:42 GMT  (911kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03984v1", "32 pages, 11 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "32 pages, 11 figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["run wang", "qiaoli mo", "qian zhang", "fudi chen", "dazuo yang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.03984"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.03984.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Prediction of the Yield of Enzymatic Synthesis of Betulinic Acid Ester Using Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine", "authors": ["Run Wang", "Qiaoli Mo", "Qian Zhang", "Fudi Chen", "Dazuo Yang"], "emails": ["dzyang1979@hotmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "3\u03b2-O phthalic ester of betulinic acid is of great importance in cancer studies.
