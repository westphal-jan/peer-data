The attractiveness of a post to a user depends on many complex contextual and temporal features of the post. For instance, the contents of the post, the responsiveness of a third user, and the age of the post may all have impact. So far, these static and dynamic features has not been incorporated in a unified framework to tackle the post prioritization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for prioritizing posts based on a feature modulated multi-dimensional point process. Our model is able to simultaneously capture textual and sentiment features, and temporal features such as self-excitation, mutual-excitation and bursty nature of social interaction. As an evaluation, we also curated a real-world conversational benchmark dataset crawled from Facebook. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm is able to achieve the-state-of-the-art performance in terms of analyzing, predicting, and prioritizing events. In terms of interpretability of our method, we observe that features indicating individual user profile and linguistic characteristics of the events work best for prediction and prioritization of new events.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 02:56:32 GMT  (848kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04145v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG", "authors": ["mehrdad farajtabar", "safoora yousefi", "long q tran", "le song", "hongyuan zha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.04145"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.04145.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Continuous-time Mutually-Exciting Point Process Framework for Prioritizing Events in Social Media", "authors": ["Mehrdad Farajtabar", "Safoora Yousefi", "Long Q.

As a result, three threads at the start of the conversation can cause Jacob to comment on these threads with varying probabilities, but these probabilities evolve over time due to a quality that is called the subordination of events. Initial probability may depend on the social influence of each of the three friends on Jacob. Sophia, for example, is Jacob's best friend and they have recently become involved in a relationship. Therefore, the probability of Jacob commenting on her post is usually high, as shown in part of Figure 1. We call this characteristic the influence of the Post Publisher. Jacob is a fan of football, hence Emma's post is a popular topic - so it excites Jacob and increases its probability."}, {"heading": "III. BACKGROUNDS ON TEMPORAL POINT PROCESSES", "text": "Time is an important factor in the study of events in social networks. It could be argued that any well-developed statistical method such as linear or ridge-based regression, probabilistic models, etc. with waiting times of events can be used to perform an analysis of event dynamics on a sample of users. The reason why these standard statistical methods do not correspond to time-dependent events is a fundamental problem that is almost always encountered in dealing with such problems: when the investigation of users ends and the analysis begins, one is left with a series of both complete and incomplete observations. The event in question happened for a subset of users and not for the rest, but one has no knowledge of whether the event will happen to the rest in the future. [1] Temporary point patterns of processes with stochastic processes are suitable for dealing with incomplete observations [1], [6] [The notion of an event as agonistic and antagonistic refers to the concept of an event."}, {"heading": "IV. PROPOSED METHOD", "text": "In this section, we will formally define the prioritization problem of the news feed and present our point process model together with the function that defines the parameters of our model. Here, post and comment can be considered as an abstraction of any activity in social networks such as likes, comments, photo or status updates, etc. They are intended to show the interaction between activities, and the model can be easily expanded to capture different types of actions in social networks."}, {"heading": "A. Problem Definition", "text": "In the prioritization problem of the newsfeed, we obtain C cascades and intend to sort them in order to present them in the user's newsfeed in such a way that more attractive cascades for the user end at the top of his newsfeed. Each cascade c is presented as an event set c = {e0, e1,.., enc}, where e0 indicates the post that triggers the cascade, and e1, e2,.. enc are the nc comments that this post has received so far. Each event (either post or comment) ei is presented as a triple ei = (ti, pi, di), where ti, pi and di respectfully represent the time of the event, its publisher and its contents. As explained in Section III, the conditional intensity function 5 can be interpreted as the expected event rate. A process with higher intensity at the time t is more likely than a process with lower intensity. As no two events occur at the same time, we explain the likelihood of the user influencing the intensity accordingly."}, {"heading": "B. Point Process Model", "text": "In this section, we propose a point process model designed to capture the characteristics we listed in Section II >. Our goal is to find the parameters of influence for mail and comment and use them to determine the likelihood of the target user's post u to each of the C posts and finally sort the newsfeed. The likelihood that the user u comments on cascade c is given by the following characteristics: 0 (t) = \u00b5ue0 exp (t \u2212 t0)) 0 exp (and auei is the initial influence of the comment ei on the user u for i < tauei exp (\u2212 ti)) 0 exp (t \u2212 ti) is the initial influence of post e0 on user u, and auei is the initial influence of the comment ei on user u for i < 1. Over time, these influences decrease exponentially with rates and controls."}, {"heading": "C. Efficient Parameter Estimation", "text": "Assuming that we have previously observed the C cascades, we must first learn the parameters and then use them in the prioritization task. Without losing generality, we assume that all contributions arrive at a point in time t0 = 0, at which we write a simpler form for the probability function. Given the parameters, the cascades are independent, so the protocol probability can be written as L = \u2211 C = 1 Lc, where Lc = nc \u2211 i = 1 protocol \u03bbpic (ti) \u2212 U \u2211 u = 1 \u0109uc (t) dt = nc \u2211 i = 1 protocol ((\u03b1 > Fpip0 + \u03b2 > Fd0) e \u2212 \u03c9\u00b5 (ti \u2212 t0) + \u2211 j < i (\u03b3 > Fpipj + \u03c3 > Fdj) e \u2212 \u03c9a (ti \u2212 tj) dt = nc \u2211 i = 1 protocol (ti \u2212 tj))), u = 1 protocol (\u03b1 > Fpip0 + \u03b2 > Fti (\u2212 t0) (\u2212 tj))."}, {"heading": "D. Prioritization", "text": "Once we have learned the model parameters, we can now sort the events in a target user's message feed u using \u03bbuc (t) for all cascades c at any time. According to Equation 11, intensity is the average rate of the comment or proportional to the probability of the comment in view of historical conditions. i.e., \u03bb (t) VP {event in [t, t + dt) | Ht} (11) and therefore it is very suitable to serve as a prioritizing criterion. It is noteworthy that we do not have to recalculate everything from scratch when a new event occurs. The summation of previous events can be updated in advance of the quantity based on ideas borrowed from dynamic programming. Suppose that at some point we have calculated the results of the operations t1 t1 t1 as the sum of two terms (i.e., the results (t) + \u2212 deaf (t), whereby A (t) = \u00b5up (t = 1 = 2.5) (2.5) and 1 (2.5) 2.5 (2.5) 2.5) 2.5 (2.5) 2.5 2.5 (2.5) 2.5) 2.5 (2.5) 2.5) 2.5 (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) 2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (2.5) (0.2) (0.2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2)"}, {"heading": "E. Features", "text": "The proposed framework is general enough to work with any feature taken from users (or even without any feature in its simplest form), such as their profile information and their interaction history. In this subsection, we briefly introduce the features we use to parameterise the influence. Remember, we have different influence parameters for posts and comments, namely the editor's influence and the content's influence. We believe that the editor's social influence on the user is a function of the social status of both, as well as their history of interactions. Therefore, character-based influence has to do with characteristics of the publisher and the user, such as their popularity, knowledge or level of activity; on the other hand, relationship-based influence is a measure of the interactions between the publisher and the user, such as common interests and activities. Table II shows the features we have extracted for each of these two elements of influence."}, {"heading": "V.

EXPERIMENTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Dataset", "text": "We examine our model based on discussion cascades crawled out of Facebook groups. Facebook groups are online communities of people who share interests or concerns, such as colleagues, classmates, celebrity fans, parents, etc. People join Facebook groups to share updates, photos, and documents, and receive feedback about them. With hundreds of millions of online groups, each with tens to thousands of members, discussing topics ranging from animal care to philosophy, Facebook provides us with abundant ongoing conversations between a well-known group of people to facilitate the study of conversation dynamics in online social media. We have collected a corpus of about 50,000 conversations recently drawn by Facebook, with over 1 million comments, involving about 25,000 people. Ours is the only corpus of Facebook conversation data available so far for a study. The groups selected for this study were 16 open groups (groups whose contributions can be viewed by non-members) selected to cover a range of topics and populations presented in Table III."}, {"heading": "B. Prioritization", "text": "In this section, we will test the proposed method and compare its effectiveness with a number of baselines, each with a specific characteristic that makes them interesting for discussion. (1) Experimental Setup: Pre-processing and Initialization Cascades are sorted by their initiation times for each group. However, depending on the size of group C, a fraction of the cascades are used as training data. Test items are then selected by the remaining posts whose participants are among the participants in the training data. Table IV provides an overview of the data available after this pre-processing step. Time is measured in minutes. We use a fraction of the cascades as 0.001 to reflect post expiration rates and comment rates. This choice of decay rates means that a post / comment loses 65% of its impact after 1000 / 100 minutes and is estimated according to the call progression rate of the group in the study. Regulatory parameters are determined by cross-validation of performance."}, {"heading": "C.

DISCUSSION", "text": "Our model can be easily expanded to capture different decay rates for users or groups. In addition, we can use any technical feature set or even no feature to learn the Hawkes model. It is noteworthy that the post and comment in this essay can be considered an abstraction of any activity on social networks such as likes, comments, photos, status distribution, etc. It is easy to generalize the model to capture different types of actions on social networks and model their interaction by coupling their intensities. In our experiments, we only used the usual notion of posts and comments to establish the framework and show its effectiveness in conversation dynamic analysis. As a future work, we would like to explore other methods to tackle limited data, such as prior knowledge and hierarchical parameter learning."}], "references": [{"title": "Survival and event history analysis: a process point of view", "author": ["O.

topics of interest, thus there is a strong need for prioritizing news feeds. The attractiveness of a post to a user depends on many complex contextual and temporal features of the post. For instance, the contents of the post, the responsiveness of a third user, and the age of the post may all have impact. So far, these static and dynamic features has not been incorporated in a unified framework to tackle the post prioritization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for prioritizing posts based on a feature modulated multi-dimensional point process. Our model is able to simultaneously capture textual and sentiment features, and temporal features such as self-excitation, mutual-excitation and bursty nature of social interaction. As an evaluation, we also curated a real-world conversational benchmark dataset crawled from Facebook. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm is able to achieve the-stateof-the-art performance in terms of analyzing, predicting, and prioritizing events. In terms of interpretability of our method, we observe that features indicating individual user profile and linguistic characteristics of the events work best for prediction and prioritization of new events.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
