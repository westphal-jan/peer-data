Therefore, the results themselves are not diminishing functions of n, and as such, the outlier issue is not interesting if we use the results directly (in particular, it is impossible to improve these results by removing votes). Therefore, we consider the dual scoring system that complements the original - namely, that we evaluate a committee based on the amount of rejection it receives from all votes, and try to minimize total rejection of the candidates. Typically, for each notion of approval, there are either one or two natural complementary notions of rejection that present themselves (discussed in more detail). This formulation is consistent with the idea that we want to capture our results \"distance\" rather than proximity."}, {"heading": "1.2 Related Work", "text": "The notion of outliers is quite prominent in the literature relating to the next strings, where the usual setting is that we obtain n strings via any alphabet \u03a3, and the task is to find a stringx that minimizes either the maximum hamming distance from each string or the sum of hamming distances from all strings. In the context of the theory of social choice, the concept of outliers is closely related to manipulation and control of the election by removing voters and candidates [Bartholdi et al., 1992, Bartholdi III et al., 1989b, Conitzer et al., 2007, Chevaleyre et al., 2007, Hemaspaandra et al., 2007, Brandt et al., Faliszewski et al., 2009, Meir et al., 2008, Procaccia et al., al., 2007, Elkind et al., 2009, Betzler et Uhlmann, 2008].In the minimax notion of removal, the problem became the Boulier al."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we will briefly recall some of the vocabulary and notations we will use."}, {"heading": "4 Parameterized Complexity Results", "text": "In this case, there is a vote on whether there can be an agreement.

We start by showing that our choice of the term disapproval is an arbitrary one by pointing out the following problem. We use the notation disapproval to denote the voting rule given by the corresponding bottom row in Table 1.Lemma 9. There is a polynomial time approximation that results in a reduction of disapproval-outlier problem and vice-outlier problem. Furthermore, the votes are such that m in the reduced instance m becomes m in the reduced instance m, and each other parameter remains exactly same.Proof. We offer the reduction of disapproval-outlier to disapproval-outlier. The other cases are exactly the same.
