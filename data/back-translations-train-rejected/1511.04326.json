All submissions were submitted for evaluation for all ASlib scenarios. Most systems used a pre-selection and specified a subset of features for each scenario."}, {"heading": "2 Evaluation", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it will only be a matter of time before it will happen, until it does."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "For comparison, we show three other systems. Autofolio-48 is identical to Autofolio, but 48 hours of training time has been given to assess the impact of additional research into hyperparameter space. Lama-regrPairs and Lama-regr are simple Lama models (see Appendix A. To assess how significant the difference is and how stable the ranking is, we have taken 1000 Bootstrap samples from the scenario split combinations and calculated the values and ranks on each of them. The mean of the total score averages over the Bootstrap samples and the confidence intervals are in Table 3.The ranking corresponds to the final ranking in Table 2. Confidence intervals show that the rankings are relatively stable."}, {"heading": "3.1 Winner \u2013 zilla", "text": "The winner of the ICON Challenge on Algorithm Selection is Zilla by Chris Cameron, Alex Fre \ufffd chette, Holger Hoos, Frank Hutter and Kevin Leyton-Brown."}, {"heading": "3.2 Honourable mention \u2013 ASAP RF", "text": "ASAP RF by Fran cois Gonard, Marc Schoenauer and Miche le Sebag receives an honourable mention as a submission that has not yet been described in the literature and showed a respectable performance that in some cases surpassed all other approaches."}, {"heading": "3.3 Alternative rank aggregations", "text": "An alternative (and probably fairer) method of determining the winner is to consider the ranking of the systems generated by each measurement in each division of each scenario as a ballot (for a total of 260 ballots) and to aggregate the ranking in these ballots. At this point, we optimize the aggregated Spearman coefficient between candidate leaderboards and ballots. That is, the final ranking indicates the optimal Spearman coefficient in terms of ballots. However, there are significant changes when performance across all metrics, divisions and scenarios is averaged by the median, not by the mean. Table 5 shows this ranking. Zilla is now in second place, beaten by ASAP RF."}, {"heading": "3.4 Detailed results", "text": "Tables 6 to 8 show the ranking order by mean for all splits and scenarios, but separately for each measurement. Table 9 shows the ranking order for the different scenarios for all systems by mean for all measurements and splits. Figures 1 to 3 give a more detailed overview of the performance of the systems for the different scenarios. The color of each box plot indicates the system whose mean performance is shown in the legend (this corresponds to the number in the respective table above). The box plots show the performance differences in the 10 different splits for each scenario. The solid black line indicates the performance of the individual best solver; everything about it is worrying.Two of the SAT scenarios are difficult for all systems in that the performance they deliver on at least one of the splits is worse than the performance of the individual best solver. In most other scenarios, the use of any algorithm selection system results in a significant improvement in performance compared to the individual best solver."}, {"heading": "3.5 Time required to run", "text": "The time taken to train the models and make the predictions varied considerably between systems and scenarios, with some having to be completed within minutes and others within hours.
