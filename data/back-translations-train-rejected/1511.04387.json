An important variant of the problem requires scheduling of activities for multiple projects considering availability of local and global resources while respecting a range of constraints. This problem has been addressed by a competition, and associated set of benchmark instances, as a part of the MISTA 2013 conference. A critical aspect of the benchmarks is that the primary objective is to minimise the sum of the project completion times, with the usual makespan minimisation as a secondary objective. We observe that this leads to an expected different overall structure of good solutions and discuss the effects this has on the algorithm design. This paper presents the resulting competition winning approach; it is a carefully designed hybrid of Monte-Carlo tree search, novel neighbourhood moves, memetic algorithms, and hyper-heuristic methods. The implementation is also engineered to increase the speed with which iterations are performed, and to exploit the computing power of multicore machines. The resulting information-sharing multi-component algorithm significantly outperformed the other approaches during the competition, producing the best solution for 17 out of the 20 test instances and performing the best in around 90% of all the trials.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 18:17:32 GMT  (192kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04387v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 8 Sep 2016 16:43:16 GMT  (130kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04387v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["shahriar asta", "daniel karapetyan", "ahmed kheiri", "ender \\\"ozcan", "rew j parkes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.04387"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.04387.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Combining Monte-Carlo and Hyper-heuristic methods for the Multi-mode Resource-constrained Multi-project Scheduling Problem", "authors": ["Shahriar Asta", "Daniel Karapetyan", "Ahmed Kheiri", "Ender \u00d6zcan", "Andrew J.

Introduction", "text": "This year, it is more than ever before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "2. Problem Description", "text": "The problem consists of a series of projects in which each project p \u00b2 P consists of a series of activities, each not referred to as Ap. (Each project p \u00b2 P has a release time, which is the earliest start time for the activities.) The activities are linked by two different types of constraints: the priority constraints, which force each activity j \u00b2 A not to be completed earlier than all immediate precursor activities in defined red (j); and the resource constraints, in which the processing of the activities is subject to the availability of resources with limited capacity. There are three different types of resources: local renewable, local non-renewable and global renewable resources (using the superscript) have a fixed capacity per unit of time. Non-renewable resources (using the superscript) have a fixed capacity for the entire project."}, {"heading": "3. Schedule Generator", "text": "There are two \"natural\" approaches in the scientific literature: a direct representation using the temporal sequence and also the nature of the activities, i.e., the earliest available time frames T and M. This is based on selecting a complete sequence of all activities. (In the face of such a sequence, a schedule is constructed by defining the activities in the order of the remaining activities and the placement of each of the earliest available time frames.) This approach is called a serial timeframe generation scheme (e.g. see [4]). The timetable-based representation is perhaps the most natural one for a mathematical programming approach, but we believe that it could make the search process for a metaheuristic method difficult, especially the creation of a feasible solution at each step could become more difficult."}, {"heading": "3.1.

Solution Structures", "text": "This section explains first and foremost why a \"total project delay\" (TPD) as the main objective can cause the overall structure of the solutions to differ greatly from the structure achieved with the more standard Makespan target (TMS). Our observations of the TPD-driven structure have had an important impact on our overall algorithm design, and the structure motivates many of the \"project level\" steps taken into account in Section 5. In this section, we also propose a heuristic method to construct the initial solutions that later enter the improvement phase. as the standard for such optimization, there was concern that the desirable structures might be difficult to achieve through improvement, unless the original designer heuristically tries to approach them through an appropriate \"heuristic-led global sample\" of the space of approximate structures. Accordingly, with the intention of increasing the robustness of the solver to have such structures developed on a manageable basis by specialized engineers in invisible cases, this section explains why a \"total project delay\" (TPD) as the main objective can cause the general structure of the solutions to differ greatly from the structure achieved with the more standard Makespan objective (TMS)."}, {"heading": "4.1.

Neighbourhood Operators", "text": "In this section, we describe our neighborhood operators, which are used by several components during the improvement phase. Operators (also referred to as low-level heuristics or simple movements, depending on the algorithm used) are divided into three groups, based mainly on the common nature of the strategy that the operators use in manipulating the solution. Some of the moves are similar to those used by other submissions; see [62], and [16] and [57] for some examples. To keep the paper self-contained, we provide brief descriptions of all the moves used in our algorithm below. We guarantee that all of our operators maintain the feasibility of the solution. Furthermore, all moves are randomized so that they can be used repeatedly for \"simulated annealing\" such as improvement or applied as mutation operators."}, {"heading": "5.1. Activity-level Operators", "text": "Operators in this category include basic operations that are widely used in the literature, such as changing the mode of a single activity or swapping the positions of two activities. In addition, we have implemented a limited initial improvement of the local search procedure for each of the basic movements. To describe the movements in this category, we need additional notations. Let pos (j) be the position of the activity j (a) within a given solution. If the activity j is moved to another position, we say that the feasible range of its new position [(j), u (j)]], where (j) and u (j) can be calculated as follows: (j1) = maxj (j1) pos (j1) pos (j) pos (j1) pos (j1) pos (j1) pos (j1), 1 (j1) otherwise Pred (j1) = 1 otherwise (7) and (j1) and (j1) and (j1) that the activity (j1) = {j1 (j1) jpos (1)."}, {"heading": "5.2. Ruin & Recreate Operators", "text": "Ruin & R operators are widely used in metaheuristics as mutations or strong local search movements, but to the best of our knowledge they are relatively new to the serial generation in planning. As the name suggests, such operators have two phases: the \"Ruin\" phase removes some elements of the solution and the \"Create Phase\" reshuffles these elements (for example, randomly) and then inserts them back again. The number of elements that are removed and reinserted is a parameter of an R & R operator that controls its strength (i.e. the average distance between the original and the resulting solution). We implement three different types of R & R operators and several strategies involved in the move. You can combine any type of R & R operator with any activity selection strategy."}, {"heading": "5.3. Project-level Operators", "text": "The danger, however, is that the order in which the solution converges may be suboptimal. Consider two well-polished solutions S1 and S2 with different project orders; the distance between S1 and S2 is likely to be significant in terms of activity level and R & R operators, since many activities will have to be postponed in order to convert S1 to S2. Furthermore, the transitional solutions in such a conversion will be of significantly inferior quality compared to those of S1 and S2, indicating that once the algorithm is switched to a specific project order level, a lot of effort will have to be made to leave the appropriate local minimum and the project order. Project level operators are designed to overcome such barriers, allowing for a faster exploration of the rough landscape of the MRCMPSP. They are passing through at project level and thus a step by all operators from this category into a change in project order. The project we are dealing with at the level is efficient."}, {"heading": "6. Improvement Phase", "text": "Most of the time our algorithm spends improving the initial solutions. We use a multi-thread implementation of a simple memetic algorithm with a powerful local search engine based on a hyper heuristics that controls moves described in the previous section."}, {"heading": "6.1. Memetic Algorithm", "text": "A genetic algorithm is a combination of principles of natural evolution and problem-solving genetics based on metaheuristics [54]. A pool of candidate solutions (individuals) to a particular problem is developed to obtain a high-quality solution in the end. [56] A recent study shows that recombination can be useful at a certain stage during the search process if the mutations do not alter the quality of the resulting individuals, leading to a population with the same fitness. [56] The choice of recombination surgeon can influence the rate of mutation depending on the problem. Although the study is rigorous, it will use some benchmark functions, such as OneMax, for the subjects."}, {"heading": "6.2. A Dominance based Hyper-heuristic Using an Adaptive Threshold Move Acceptance", "text": "There is a growing interest in self-configuring, self-coordinated, adaptive, and automated search methods. Hyper-heuristics are such high-level approaches that explore the space of heuristics (i.e. move operators) rather than problem-solving solutions. [5] In the scientific literature, there are two common types of hyper-heuristics (7]: selection methods that select / mix heuristics from a set of preset low-level heuristics (which can both improve and aggravate the solution) and attempts to control these heuristics during the search process; and generation methods that aim to build new heuristics from a set of preset components. The main components of an iterative selection of hyper-heuristic methods are heuristic selection and relocation acceptance methods. At each step, an input solution is modified using a selected heuristic method."}, {"heading": "6.2.1. First stage hyper-heuristic", "text": "The first stage of hyper-heuristics maintains an active pool of low heuristics LLH LH all and a score value associated with each heuristic h LLH (line 5); in each iteration, it randomly selects a low heuristic from the active pool, with the probability of selecting a heurist being proportional to the score (line 5); then the selected heuristic is applied to the current solution (lines 9-11); first, each heurist has a score of 1, so the probability of selecting a heuristic is the same; the first stage of hyper-heuristics always retains the best solution previously known as best (lines 9-11) and tracks the time since the last improvisation; the acceptance component of this hyper-heuristic (lines 7-17) is an adaptive threshold acceptance method controlled by a parameter that accepts all improving moves (lines 7-12 and sometimes not improving)."}, {"heading": "6.2.2.

The third set (set X) was kept hidden from the participants of the competition until the results were announced; it was used to evaluate the performance of the submitted algorithms. During the design and tuning of our algorithm, we had no information about what properties the hidden instances would have, which drove our decisions towards self-matching methods and rich motion sequences.

project scheduling is a well-known challenging real-world optimisation problem. An important variant of the problem requires scheduling of activities for multiple projects considering availability of local and global resources while respecting a range of constraints. A critical aspect of the benchmarks addressed in this paper is that the primary objective is to minimise the sum of the project completion times, with the usual makespan minimisation as a secondary objective. We observe that this leads to an expected different overall structure of good solutions and discuss the effects this has on the algorithm design. This paper presents a carefully designed hybrid of Monte-Carlo tree search, novel neighbourhood moves, memetic algorithms, and hyper-heuristic methods. The implementation is also engineered to increase the speed with which iterations are performed, and to exploit the computing power of multicore machines.
