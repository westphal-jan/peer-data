It is a consensus that valuable information lies in social media data. Mining this data and making the process easier are gaining momentum in the industries. This paper describes an enterprise system we developed for extracting sentiment from large volumes of social data in Arabic dialects. First, we give an overview of the Big Data system for information extraction from multilingual social data from a variety of sources. Then, we focus on the Arabic sentiment analysis capability that was built on top of the system including normalizing written Arabic dialects, building sentiment lexicons, sentiment classification, and performance evaluation. Lastly, we demonstrate the value of enriching sentiment results with user profiles in understanding sentiments of a specific user group.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Nov 2015 05:53:13 GMT  (550kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04661v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hao wang", "vijay r bommireddipalli", "ayman hanafy", "mohamed bahgat", "sara noeman", "ossama s emam"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.04661"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.04661.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A System for Extracting Sentiment from Large-Scale Arabic Social Data", "authors": ["Hao Wang", "Vijay R.

Data set", "text": "In this paper, we focus on Twitter data as the source of social media content, although the system can take as input multiple social sources such as Twitter, blogs and discussion forums. To measure the accuracy and performance of the system, Twitter data that is commented on with sentiment polarity is required. Some commented Twitter data sets from past studies have been made publicly available [15, 16]. However, we need to create a new set of commented data because the system is initially applied to three use cases: Telecommunications in Egyptian Arabic (Egyptian telecommunications), Government in Egyptian Arabic (Egyptian government) and Employment in Saudi Arabic (Saudi employment). To build the data set, Gnip Twitter API was used to collect Arabic tweets with keywords for products and companies in teleco, political events, jobs and employment. Table II shows some examples of the keywords we used for the teleco application case. The data set was collected on a multi-dimensional basis."}, {"heading": "B. Analysis Sequence", "text": "Our Sentiment Analytic Pipeline starts by normalizing the text (see Section 4) in each tweet to minimize data economy and prepare data for the next step. It then identifies relevant tweets using a keyword matching algorithm. All relevant tweets are then assigned a sentiment label using a complex set of rules, as well as polarity and blocker lexicon. Blocking rules implemented in our system are described below in three processing phases. 1. Extract polarity terms (words / phrases) from a tweet using polarity lexions. 2. Extract blocker terms from a tweet using the lexicon. 3. Extract question marks and question words from a tweet are assumed to have no sentiment. 4. Extract terms that indicate a contrast in context (e.g., but in English) and extract blocker terms from a tweet using a lexicon."}, {"heading": "C. User Profile Extraction", "text": "As already mentioned, the analysis results are generated based on multiple user segments, which are usually based on gender, marital status, residence, etc. Twitter metadata provides some of this information in a straightforward way. However, in other cases, users may choose not to add this information to their profile or they may not update it in time. For example, a newly married person may not update their profile until after a while. Such implicit information can be detected by tweet text content or by changing the description text of the profile. Returning to the newly married example, the user may mention that he is going to get married. Another information that is not provided by Twitter metadata is parental status. In some cases, it is of interest to know such information in order to understand the market segment. A user who changes his profile, for example, with \"Got a new beautiful child,\" would imply that that this person becomes a parent. Or a user who \"encounters motherhood challenges with this new person,\" that my baby is tweeting."}, {"heading": "D. Results", "text": "1) Results from the annotated dataset. The metrics we used to measure the sentiment classification of false, significant ratings are precision, recall and the standard F measurement. For each use case and sentiment polarity, 400 commented tweets were randomly selected as the gold standard and then compared with the classification by the system. Classification results for positive tweets from Egyptian Teleco, Egyptian Government and Saudi Employment Use Cases are evaluated in Table III, IV and V, respectively, in the positive category for positive tweets. The neutral category has a moderate precision (77.34%), but very high recall (91.43%). F scores range from 81.7% to 84.74%. The system was deliberately set to high precision for the positive and negative categories."}], "references": [{"title": "Subjectivity and sentiment analysis of arabic: A survey", "author": ["M.
