We consider the problem of human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers and deep learning paradigms. This paper shows that deep activity recognition models (a) provide better recognition accuracy of human activities, (b) avoid the expensive design of handcrafted features in existing systems, and (c) utilize the massive unlabeled acceleration samples for unsupervised feature extraction. Moreover, a hybrid approach of deep learning and hidden Markov models (DL-HMM) is presented for sequential activity recognition. This hybrid approach integrates the hierarchical representations of deep activity recognition models with the stochastic modeling of temporal sequences in the hidden Markov models. We show substantial recognition improvement on real world datasets over state-of-the-art methods of human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Nov 2015 06:23:40 GMT  (1222kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04664v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 07:39:29 GMT  (1232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04664v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.HC cs.NE", "authors": ["mohammad abu alsheikh", "ahmed selim", "dusit niyato", "linda doyle", "shaowei lin", "hwee-pink tan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.04664"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.04664.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Deep Activity Recognition Models with Triaxial Accelerometers", "authors": ["Mohammad Abu Alsheikh", "Ahmed Selim", "Dusit Niyato", "Linda Doyle", "Shaowei Lin", "Hwee-Pink Tan"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it has come to the point where there is only one person who is able to move around the world."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "In this section, we focus on classification and offer technical methods for activity detection using accelerometers. For a more comprehensive overview of the field, we refer interested readers to recent surveys by Lara et al. [14] and Chen et al. [3]. To illustrate the limitations of existing sensor-based methods for activity detection, Section II-A first discusses the limitations of conventional methods for shallow classification, followed by Section II-B outlining the limitations of the use of traditional craft features in activity detection systems."}, {"heading": "A. Limitations of Shallow Classifiers", "text": "The classification of acceleration samples into static and dynamic activity using MLPs is presented in [16]. Conventional neural networks, including MLPs, are often stuck in local Optima [17], often resulting in poor performance of activity detection systems. Furthermore, the formation of MLPs by means of reverse propagation [17] only prevents the addition of many hidden layers due to the disappearing gradient problem. The authors in [15] used decision trees and MLPs to classify daily human activity. In [10] a blurred inference system was developed to detect human activity. Altun et al. [9] analysed activity detection using Bayesian decision theory, the least square bases, the closest data sets (k-NNNs), dynamic time distortion, support for vector machines and MLPs. Similarly, recognition of wapter and other significant results [16] of MLPs, quadrilateral activity and activity in different MLPs [11] was made possible."}, {"heading": "B. Limitations of Handcrafted Features", "text": "The authors in the [9] - [13] used statistical characteristics such as mean, variance, kurtosis and entropy as distinguishing features. On the negative side, these characteristics are simple and cannot generalize the number of required acceleration nodes. On the other hand, the authors in the [19] used the signs of the raw signal (positive, negative or zero) as distinguishing features. Despite their simple design, these characteristics are unable to increase the number of required acceleration nodes. The authors in the [19] used the energy and frequency bands to detect the freezing events of Parkinson's patients."}, {"heading": "III. PROBLEM STATEMENT", "text": "This section gives a formal description of the problem of activity detection using accelerometers."}, {"heading": "A. Activity Recognition using Triaxial Accelerometers", "text": "Acceleration sensors are key sensors in many modern inertial systems, such as navigation, early warning, aerospace, and activity detection systems. Acceleration sensors are sensors that measure the correct acceleration of an object due to motion and gravitational force. Modern acceleration sensors are tiny devices that consist of electromechanical elements and generate electrical signals in response to any mechanical movement. Correct acceleration of an object in a free fall is zero. In this section, we present the problem of human activity detection using triaxial acceleration sensors. Triaxial acceleration sensors measure the correct acceleration in three perpendicular directions. In what follows, we address the imaging between correct acceleration measurements and associated human activities. Data acquisition is an acceleration sensor connected to a human body and samples it records the correct acceleration."}, {"heading": "B. Data Preprocessing", "text": "The problem of activity detection by sxt, s x t and s z t can be understood within the discipline of classification and prediction of time series, which generally requires a parametric representation of time domain data. Specifically, an accelerometer generates a non-stationary signal where the frequency content of the acceleration signal of each axis changes over time. These multifrequency, aperiodic and fluctuating signals complicate activity detection using time series data. Therefore, a data processing step is applied to effectively capture a parametric representation of the acceleration signal at a lower information rate. An acceleration signal spectrogram is a three-dimensional representation of the changes in the energy acceleration content of a signal as a function of frequency and time. Historically, spectrograms of speech waveforms are widely used as distinct features in acoustic modelling."}, {"heading": "IV. DEEP LEARNING FOR ACTIVITY RECOGNITION: SYSTEM AND MODEL", "text": "In this section, we present our approach to detecting human activity using triaxial acceleration data. Our deep model not only learns the weights of the classifier used to detect various activities, but also the informative features to detect these activities from raw data, providing a competitive advantage over traditional systems that are developed by hand. Model adaptation and training consist of two main steps: (i) an unattended, generative and upstream step, and (ii) a supervised, discriminatory and finely tuned step. The pre-training step generates intrinsic features based on a layered training approach that uses only blank acceleration stings. First, we use deep networks of belief [5] to find the activity probabilities described in Section IV-A. In Section IV-B, we show how to use the probabilities generated by deep models to model the correlation of temporal activities."}, {"heading": "A.

Temporal Activity Recognition Models (DL-HMM)", "text": "In some activity detection applications, there is a temporal pattern of performed human activities (e.g. auto checkpoint [18]).Hidden Markov models (HMMs) [27] are a type of graphic model that can simulate the temporal generation of a first order Markov process.The problem of detecting temporary activity involves finding the most likely sequence of (hidden) activities y1,..., yT, which is a (observed) sequence of inputs x1,.,., xT. An HMM model is presented as a triple \u03a6 = (\u03c0, \u0432), where \u03c0 = (P (y1 = ai): i = 1,.,., M) is the previous sequence of all activities in the first hidden state."}, {"heading": "C. Computational complexity", "text": "Our algorithm consists of three work phases: (a) data acquisition, (b) offline learning, and (c) online activity detection and conclusion. The computational load of offline learning is relatively difficult to execute on a mobile device because it is based on stochastic gradient descent optimization. Therefore, it is recommended to perform offline training of a depth activity detection model on a powerful server. Nevertheless, upon completion of offline training, the model parameter is only transferred to the portable device, where online activity detection with linear time complexity (O (T)) is easy, where T is the time sequence length. In this case, the time complexity of the online activity detection system represents the time required to detect activity as an accelerometer function as an input length. Finally, the time complexity of finding the short-time Fourier transformation (STFT) is O (L (L) decoding M2)."}, {"heading": "V. BASELINES AND RESULT SUMMARY", "text": "We test our activity detection approach on three sets of data. Experimental analysis shows the improvement of detection accuracy compared to modern methods."}, {"heading": "A. Datasets", "text": "For empirical comparison with existing approaches, we use three public datasets representing different application areas to verify the efficiency of our proposed solution. These three test parameters are described as follows: \u2022 WISDM Actitracker dataset [11]: This dataset contains 1, 098, 213 samples of a triaxial accelerometer programmed to a sample rate of 20 Hz. The datasets include 29 users and 6 characteristic human activities such as walking, jogging, sitting, standing and climbing stairs. Acceleration samples are collected using mobile phones with Android operating system. \u2022 Daphnet freezing of gait data [19]: We have used this dataset to demonstrate the applications of deep activity detection models. Data samples are collected from patients with Parkinson's disease. Three triaxial accelerometers are attached to the ankle, thigh, and torso."}, {"heading": "B. Performance Measures", "text": "For binary classification (experimenting with the Daphnet dataset) we use three performance indicators: sensitivity (TPR) = TPTP + FN, specificity (TNR) = TN TN + FP and accuracy (ACC) = TP + TNTP + TN + FP + FN, where TP, TN, FP and FN mean true positive, true negative, false positive or false negative values. For multiclass classification of non-overlapping activities based on the experiments of the WISDM Actitracker dataset and the Skoda checkpoint, the average detection accuracy (ACC) is ACC = 1M-M = 1 TPi + TNi TNi + TNi + FPi + FNi, where M is the number of activities supported."}, {"heading": "C. Baselines", "text": "Table I summarizes the key performance outcomes of our proposed method and some previous solutions for using the three datasets. Depth reconditioning models significantly improve accuracy over traditional methods, for example, improving accuracy by 6.53% over MLPs and 3.93% over ensemble learning in the WISDM Actitracker dataset. Significant improvements have also been reported for the daphnet freezing of gait and Skoda checkpoint datasets. This combined result shows that depth models are both (a) effective at improving detection accuracy and (b) convenient at avoiding hand engineering of features."}, {"heading": "VI. EXPERIMENTS ON REAL DATASETS", "text": "We present our experimental validation in three phases. First, Section VI-A provides spectrogram analysis of real-world data sets. Then, performance analysis of low activity detection models is presented in Section VI-B. Finally, Section VI-C presents a test case for DL-HMM temporal modeling."}, {"heading": "A. Spectrogram Analysis", "text": "Figure 3 shows triaxial time series and spectrogram signals of 6 activities of the WISDM Actitracker dataset. The high frequency signals (also called AC components) clearly belong to activities with active body movement, e.g. jogging and walking. On the other hand, the low frequency signals (also called DC components) are collected during semi-static body movements, e.g. sitting and standing. These low frequency activities are distinguishable only by measuring gravitational acceleration by the acceleration sensor. Figure 4 shows the double-sided power spectral density (PSD) of the acceleration data. The power content is concentrated on low spectral bands, e.g. below 30 Hz, and symmetrically around DC. Therefore, the negative spectral information is redundant and is not fed into the model for detecting deep activity."}, {"heading": "B. Performance Analysis", "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "C. Temporal Modeling", "text": "The detection accuracy is 89.38% for the 10 activities on the Skoda checkpoint dataset (node ID 16) and improves by 3.38% compared to the HMM method presented by Zappi et al. [18]. In addition, the results can be significantly improved by examining the temporal correlation in the dataset. Our hybrid DL-HMM achieves an almost perfect detection accuracy of 99.13%. In particular, Figure 7 shows the parameters of an HMM model used to model the temporal sequences of the Skoda checkpoint dataset."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We investigated the problem of activity detection using triaxial accelerometers and the proposed approach is superior to traditional methods of using flat networks with manual features by using low activity detection models. Furthermore, the low activity detection models lead to a significant improvement in detection accuracy by extracting hierarchical features from triaxial acceleration data. Furthermore, the detection probabilities of low activity detection models are used as the emission matrix of a hidden Markov model to model a sequence of human activities over time. Although this paper focuses on activity detection using triaxial acceleration sensors, it would be applicable to other types of sensors, such as the simultaneous use of gyroscopes and acceleration sensors. Specifically, the use of many types of sensors generates multi-model data that could be useful for precision-sensitive applications with complex activity sensors."}], "references": [{"title": "A survey on vision-based human action recognition", "author": ["R.

of accelerometers in almost all mobile phones and wearable devices, activity recognition using accelerometers is still immature due to the poor recognition accuracy of existing recognition methods and the scarcity of labeled training data. We consider the problem of human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers and deep learning paradigms. This paper shows that deep activity recognition models (a) provide better recognition accuracy of human activities, (b) avoid the expensive design of handcrafted features in existing systems, and (c) utilize the massive unlabeled acceleration samples for unsupervised feature extraction. Moreover, a hybrid approach of deep learning and hidden Markov models (DL-HMM) is presented for sequential activity recognition. This hybrid approach integrates the hierarchical representations of deep activity recognition models with the stochastic modeling of temporal sequences in the hidden Markov models. We show substantial recognition improvement on real world datasets over state-of-the-art methods of human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
