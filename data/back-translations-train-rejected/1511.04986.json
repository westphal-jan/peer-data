In this paper, we revise the notion of motif support, characterizing it as the number of patterns or repetitions that define a motif. We then propose GENMOTIF, a genetic algorithm to discover motifs with support which, at the same time, is flexible enough to accommodate other motif specifications and task characteristics. GENMOTIF is an anytime algorithm that easily adapts to many situations: searching in a range of segment lengths, applying uniform scaling, dealing with multiple dimensions, using different similarity and grouping criteria, etc. GENMOTIF is also parameter-friendly: it has only two intuitive parameters which, if set within reasonable bounds, do not substantially affect its performance. We demonstrate the value of our approach in a number of synthetic and real-world settings, including traffic volume measurements and accelerometer signals.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Nov 2015 15:14:56 GMT  (2035kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04986v1", "19 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 15:26:45 GMT  (1297kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04986v2", "9 pages, 8 figures"], ["v3", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 10:12:05 GMT  (1297kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04986v3", "9 pages, 8 figures, code available atthis https URL"], ["v4", "Mon, 5 Dec 2016 13:21:21 GMT  (1338kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04986v4", "9 pages, 8 figures, code available atthis https URL"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["joan serr\\`a", "aleksandar matic", "josep luis arcos", "alexandros karatzoglou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.04986"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.04986.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Genetic Algorithm to Discover Flexible Motifs with Support", "authors": ["Joan Serr\u00e0", "Aleksandar Matic", "Josep Lluis Arcos", "Alexandros Karatzoglou"], "emails": ["firstname.lastname@telefonica.com", "arcos@iiia.csic.es"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is as if it were a country, in which it is a country, in which it is not a country, but a country, in which it is a country; it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is not a country, but a country, in which it is not a country, but a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which it is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which it is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which it is a country, in which is a country, in which it is a country, in which is a country, in which it is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country, in which is a country,"}, {"heading": "II.

Background", "text": "Below, we present our proposed GENMOTIF approach, which is based on genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms have a long tradition of solving combinatorial2Notice, but IS still requires some central tendency to extract mi in a final phase.3As a curiosity, we note that there are about 1.33 \u00b7 1050 atoms in the world: http: / / education.jlab.org / qa / mathatom 05.html.optimization problems [18] like the one we are dealing with here. It is population-based metaheuristics [16] that iterates an initial pool of solutions, improving a user-defined fitness criterion in each iteration. Genetic algorithms are known to provide good solutions with very few iterations, although it can take much longer to arrive at the best possible global solution. [In some cases, such variants are considered to be limited to 22 global spaces, although they are not at all]."}, {"heading": "B. Solutions\u2019 mapping and fitness", "text": "Before we delve into the description of the approach, we must first adapt the formulation of genetic algorithms to the specific problem of time series motif discovery. In genetic algorithms, a solution X has a set of properties, commonly referred to as Xi or genotypes, that can be combined and mutated. We propose to define X = {x1,. xks} as a set of tuples X = {X1,. Xks} so that Xi = {f, l, c}, where f is the index of the first sample of the time series segment, l is the length of the segment, and c is a real indicator used to determine the index of the motif to which the segment. f, n \u2212 l], l [lmin, lmax], and c [0, 1). We note that Xi is a time series segment independent of its dimensionality, so we are directly applicable."}, {"heading": "C. Main algorithm", "text": "We are ready to describe the main algorithm in GENMOTIF (algorithm 2). GENMOTIF is an instance of a canonical genetic algorithm [16]. However, it includes a basic form of elitism, performs a uniform crossover, and employs a revolutionary mutation operator [18]. In addition, it includes all necessary adjustments to work with time series and time series segments. As input, it takes a time series z, together with the minimum and maximum segment lengths of interest lmin and lmax, the number of desired motifs k, and their support. Its output represents the best solution available in the execution time tmax. Note that all these variables are not parameters of the algorithm, but requirements of the task. In terms of parameters, GENMOTIF requires only the population size and the mutation deviation constant size to be determined externally."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION", "text": "In this section, we evaluate GENMOTIF experimentally, starting with a health check on a planted motif problem and then examining the influence of the two parameters of the algorithm. We perform all our experiments on a 4 GB RAM laptop with a dual-core processor at 2.5 GHz, with the only exception of the parameterization experiments conducted on a 15 GB RAM computer with 24 cores at 2 GHz. Except for the planted motif time series, which are artificially generated, all data sets used in this section are publicly available."}, {"heading": "A. Planted motifs", "text": "We first consider a planted motif task where the motifs have been evenly reduced to a maximum of 90% of their original length. We insert two different patterns corresponding to a square wave of length 58 in a random time series generated by xi = 1 + N (0, 0.1). We then perform GENMOTIF to find 4 motifs with a support of 5 and lengths between 50 and 60 samplers. the results after two minutes of calculation time4 are already satisfactory (Fig 2).The algorithm is able to find the motifs with a support of 5 and lengths."}, {"heading": "B. Parameter setting", "text": "In the following, we examine the effects that the population size \u03c1 and the mutation deviation constant \u03c3 have on the quality of the solutions obtained from GENMOTIF = 101. We start by setting \u03c1 = 51 and calculating IDB as a function of the time for \u03c3 = {10 \u2212 5, 10 \u2212 4, 10 \u2212 3, 10 \u2212 2, 10 \u2212 1} (Fig. 4). First, we look at the EEG time series of [7] and look for 10 subjects with a support of 5 with lengths between 150 and 250 samples. We see that the prediction intervals for the majority of the subjects under consideration overlap greatly, with the subjects overlapping and the subjects highly overlapping [10 \u2212 1, 10 \u2212 3] which provide only slightly better results than index values outside this range. We also see that \u03c3 = 10 \u2212 5 provides the worst performance, with a prediction interval that does not overlap with those of the other subjects."}, {"heading": "V. CASE STUDIES", "text": "In this section, we show the use of GENMOTIF in three different real-world scenarios that have already attracted the attention of the scientific community. The case studies presented here are not designed to claim results in their respective areas, but illustrate the applicability and values of GENMOTIF in these areas. We look at three types of signals: traffic volume, accelerometers, and telephone call data. The first two sets of data are publicly available, while the third is not publicly available for privacy reasons."}, {"heading": "A. Traffic volume patterns", "text": "Traffic patterns and human mobility in general are an important variable to take into account in epidemics. To illustrate the performance and versatility of GENMOTIF, we use the vehicle every 5 minutes with a ramp sensor on Highway 101 in Los Angeles, located near Dodger Stadium, where the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team plays its home games. [26] Our goal is to evaluate how well GENMOTIF is able to identify objectively relevant motifs in a real time series of 50,400 samplers. We use the data available in the UCI Archive6 [26] and run GENMOTIF for 10 minutes, searching for 10 motifs with support of 5 and lengths between 276 and 300 samplers (corresponding to 23 and 25 hours)."}, {"heading": "B. Person verification using accelerometer data", "text": "Searching for patterns in acceleration data is an important area of research with broad applicability, ranging from user interaction and activity tracking to health assessment and biometric authentication.The acceleration signal is a time series with a sampling rate that varies with the application: from 10-20 Hz for interaction applications to, for example, 500-1000 Hz for detection of engine anomalies. In our example, we apply GENMOTIF to the data collected from a single chest accelerometer with the goal of person6https: / / archive.ics.uci.edu / datasets + Loop + Sensor verification [27].Our goal is to find characteristic patterns for different people in a time series of nearly 2 million samples that have 52 Hz records of the daily activities of 15 people, including walking, speaking or working on a computer."}, {"heading": "OF [27].", "text": "From 8 to 12 of the 15 persons in the dataset (Table I, second column), the number of identified personal patterns is not, as expected, linearly dependent on the execution time: after 8 minutes, the number of different persons with assigned motifs reaches 11, which corresponds roughly to a 73% memory, and after 64 min 12, which corresponds to an 80% memory. Interestingly, as the execution time progresses, we also observe that not only do more personal motifs appear, but that the motifs are increasingly assigned to a single person (Table I, third column) and a single task (Table I, fourth column). This shows that the refinements made by GENMOTIF to the solutions found for this task are in the direction of individuals and task-assisted motifs."}, {"heading": "C. Exploring personalities with outgoing call motifs", "text": "Human communication patterns have long attracted the attention of several scientific disciplines. Nowadays, a significant portion of our communications leaves digital traces (such as phone calls, e-mails, text messages, etc.), a fact that provides a historical opportunity to quantify these interactions on a large scale and advance theoretical knowledge of the dynamics of human interaction. In particular, patterns of mobile communication (i.e. voice calls and text messages) have been used to study social behavior, to distinguish between different user profiles (such as ordinary users versus salespeople, telecom fraudsters, and robotic callers), and even to determine the personality of users [28]. In this case study, we are investigating the applicability of GENMOTIF to detect patterns in time series of mobile phone calls. In particular, we are interested in sequences of the total daily call duration of about one month."}, {"heading": "8000 A", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "8000 C", "text": "Motif A reflects a more random conversation pattern than motif C, thus reflecting less conscientious profiles. Similarly, motif B and motif D differentiated participants based on the extraversion component of the questionnaire (also with 70%), motif B corresponded with participants with above-average results, and motif D was associated with participants who scored below average. Again, it can be speculated that the volume of outgoing calls reflects the level of initiated social interactions that further reflects the extracted personality. Interestingly, motif B and motif D are similar to participants who appear once a month, but motif B mainly grouped extraverted individuals (with no significant differences in the ratio of scientific results), while motif C mainly grouped individuals whose conscientiousness was lower than average (with no significant differences in frequency of this pattern, which we rated higher in relation to the extracted version)."}, {"heading": "VI. RELATED WORK", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "We have proposed GENMOTIF, a genetic algorithm that solves the problem at any time and is flexible enough to accommodate multiple definitions of motifs. As it relies exclusively on dissimilarity measurements and cluster criteria, GENMOTIF can, for example, work with a range of lengths, uniformly scaled motifs, distorted or complexity invariant similarity measurements, and multidimensional time series. We have also shown that the two parameters of the algorithm do not significantly affect GENMOTIF's performance, and we have provided a quantitative and conceptual discussion of algorithms in this regard. In all of our experiments, we have used publicly available data, except for data where GENMOTIF was available for research purposes."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We thank all donors of the datasets used in this study.

We then propose GENMOTIF, a genetic algorithm to discover motifs with support which, at the same time, is flexible enough to accommodate other motif specifications and task characteristics. GENMOTIF is an anytime algorithm that easily adapts to many situations: searching in a range of segment lengths, applying uniform scaling, dealing with multiple dimensions, using different similarity and grouping criteria, etc. GENMOTIF is also parameter-friendly: it has only two intuitive parameters which, if set within reasonable bounds, do not substantially affect its performance.
