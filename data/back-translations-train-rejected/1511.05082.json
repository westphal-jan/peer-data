As the volume rises, traditional methods are giving way to machine learning and data science, which are playing an increasingly large part it turning this data into science-driving insights. One rich and interesting source is the bio-logger. These small electronic wearable devices are attached to animals free to roam in their natural habitats, and report back readings from multiple sensors, including GPS and accelerometer bursts. A common use of accelerometer data is for supervised learning of behavioral modes. However, we need unsupervised analysis tools as well, in order to overcome the inherent difficulties of obtaining a labeled dataset, which in some cases is either infeasible or does not successfully encompass the full repertoire of behavioral modes of interest. Here we present a matrix factorization based topic-model method for accelerometer bursts, derived using a linear mixture property of patch features. Our method is validated via comparison to a labeled dataset, and is further compared to standard clustering algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Nov 2015 18:42:04 GMT  (1162kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05082v1", "Invited Extended version of a paper \\cite{resheffmatrix} presented at the international conference \\textit{Data Science and Advanced Analytics}, Paris, France, 19-21 OCtober 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Invited Extended version of a paper \\cite{resheffmatrix} presented at the international conference \\textit{Data Science and Advanced Analytics}, Paris, France, 19-21 OCtober 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yehezkel s resheff", "shay rotics", "ran nathan", "daphna weinshall"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.05082"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.05082.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Topic modeling of behavioral modes using sensor data", "authors": ["Yehezkel S.

Next, we bundle the patches with K means to form k clusters. The resulting k centroids are called a code book. The intuition behind using patches to describe an ACC signal is that behaviors should be definable by the distribution of short-term movements that they consist of. As different behaviors occur in different characteristic timescales, we would like to repeat the process for more than one patch length in order to efficiently capture all relevant ACC patterns."}, {"heading": "3.1.3 Feature Transformation", "text": "Once we have created the code book for all scales, we are ready to transform our ACC signals into the final scale = = 1st scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale = 1 scale"}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "In this section we will be able to compare our methods, and the results will be discussed in the next section."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "As expected, both 0 \u2212 1 and log-loss error plots are decreasing monotonously in the number of clusters (we use the term cluster here for cluster / partition / topic depending on the method to be considered).The most striking result is that while the matrix factorization theme model method is indeed good compared to the other methods in terms of the log-loss metric (Figure 3), it is not quite as good in terms of the 0-1 loss (Figure 4).To better understand this phenomenon, let's take a closer look at the data. Consider an observation in which the animal takes a single step during the 4-second acceleration measurement window, and stands still for the rest of it. To not dramatically underestimate the amount of walking, an observer will consider this sample as walking (In fact, most samples are likely mixtures)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we describe a matrix factorization-based modeling approach to behavior mode analysis using acceleration data and demonstrate its qualities using a large dataset on motion ecology. While clustering and topic modeling with matrix factorization are by no means a new idea, the novelty here lies in integrating it with patch features (MS-BoP) that theoretically motivate the method to conduct mode analysis in the context of time series sensors. The main contribution of this paper is to present a framework that will enable widespread application of behavior mode analysis in motion ecology and related areas where the determination of motion patterns from remote sensor measurements is needed. We also present the MS-BoP features that can be applicable to many continuous sensor measurements, and show that a linear blending model is warranted when such features are used."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "This work was partially supported by a scholarship from the Israel Science Foundation (ISF) to Prof. Daphna Weinshall."}], "references": [{"title": "Learning topic models\u2013going beyond svd", "author": ["S.

As the volume rises, traditional methods are giving way to machine learning and data science, which are playing an increasingly large part it turning this data into science-driving insights. One rich and interesting source is the bio-logger. These small electronic wearable devices are attached to animals free to roam in their natural habitats, and report back readings from multiple sensors, including GPS and accelerometer bursts. A common use of accelerometer data is for supervised learning of behavioral modes. However, we need unsupervised analysis tools as well, in order to overcome the inherent difficulties of obtaining a labeled dataset, which in some cases is either infeasible or does not successfully encompass the full repertoire of behavioral modes of interest. Here we present a matrix factorization based topic-model method for accelerometer bursts, derived using a linear mixture property of patch features. Our method is validated via comparison to a labeled dataset, and is further compared to standard clustering algorithms.
