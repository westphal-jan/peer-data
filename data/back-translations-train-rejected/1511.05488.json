We then show how this algorithm can readily be employed to solve a large number of other related tasks like finding the optimal position to bridge two static network nodes. For this we first introduce a meta-algorithm inspired by autonomous robot learning strategies and the concept of internal models which yields a class of source seeking algorithms for mobile nodes. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated in real world experiments using a physical mobile robot and standard 802.11 wireless LAN in an office environment. We also discuss the differences to conventional algorithms and give the robotics perspective on this class of algorithms. Then we proceed to show how more complex tasks, which might be encountered by mobile nodes, can be encoded in the same framework and how the introduced algorithm can solve them. These tasks can be direct (cross layer) optimization tasks or can also encode more complex tasks like bridging two network nodes. We choose the bridging scenario as an example, implemented on a real physical robot, and show how the robot can solve it in a real world experiment.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 17:50:23 GMT  (1485kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05488v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.NI", "authors": ["christian blum", "verena v hafner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.05488"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.05488.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Active exploration of sensor networks from a robotics perspective", "authors": ["Christian Blum", "Verena V.

Robot swarms, for example, often rely on explicit communication with each other and with base stations and can even span their own network (Daniel et al., 2010; Hauert et al., 2010) or they want to use sensors of a sensor network or even everyday objects such as lighting systems or even a refrigerator, which are becoming increasingly intelligent and networked (Mattern and Floerkemeier, 2010), including semi-identical operation of robots, such as in disaster scenarios, in a supporting role for firefighters or rescue crews.

Here, we are mainly interested in forward models, which we will call internal models for reasons of simplicity. In our case, the inverse models are predefined mappings of position information, signal strength and control commands, as described in Section 2.A prominent hypothesis of cognitive robotics and neuroscience states that internal situations can only be dealt with by certain internal models beyond complexity."}, {"heading": "3.1 Comparison to Gradient Based Algorithms", "text": "Gradient-based methods are based on the implicit Taylor extension of the underlying signal strength function. Using the gradient means a local linear approximation of this function that matches each iteration to the current local data, usually directly based on noisy data, and with certain limitations, convergence for this class of algorithms can be demonstrated (Atanasov et al., 2012; Blum and Hafner, 2014). A prerequisite for convergence is that local maxims that can result from small-scale fading must be mitigated, for example, by adjusting a layer to the data, rather than calculating gradients directly based on finite differences, otherwise the algorithms can get stuck in these maxims. From the point of view of the internal model, even simple gradient-based methods use an (implicit) internal model by propagating a local linear approximation, although no information is acted from iteration to iteration."}, {"heading": "4 Implementation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Hardware and ROS", "text": "We use a TurtleBot 22 as a mobile base.

In the experiments, we easily exceed 30,000 samples. In the following two sections, Section 4.2.1 and Section 4.2.2, we give a brief overview of the two selected instances of internal models and their implementation as learning strategies."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Local Ridge Regression", "text": "Comb regression is a linear model with Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov, 1943). We use a local version of this regression by adapting it only to data within a radius in order to have a model similar to that used in gradient-based algorithms. We used the comb regression implemented by scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) with a local radius of 5 m and a regulation parameter \u03b1 = 1.0. No pre-processing of the data was used. Although the use of this model is similar to the idea of a locally linear Taylor approximation used in gradient-based methods, it is superior because it is average over an area, mitigates the effects of small-scale fading and noise, and is regulated to prevent instabilities and overadjustments."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Multilayer Perceptron", "text": "As a second example of an internal model, we chose an MLP with two input neurons, a hidden layer of 100 sigmoid neurons and a linear output neuron. All layers also have access to a bias node. For learning, classic reverse propagation with a small pulse Term7 was used for three epochs. We opted for a fixed number of epochs to limit the computational costs. We are not interested in complete convergence and cross-validation, as the algorithm constantly compares the model's predictions with real measurement data and re-learns the model when the prediction errors cross a threshold. Network and learning were implemented using PyBrain (Schaul et al., 2010). We pre-processed the data to remove the mean and scale it to unit variance, as these are assumed by our implementation of artificial neural networks."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "This year, it is closer than ever before in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "6 Extensions", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Idea und Theory", "text": "The presented algorithm can easily be expanded to solve various tasks, noting that it is essentially just maximizing an unknown function with access to point measurements. Therefore, the simplest enhancements in the network context would be to replace the signal strength with another interesting metric, such as packet delivery ratio (PDR) or bit error rate (BER). These metrics may be louder and contain a lot of local minimums, but the algorithm is capable of doing this by design. More complex tasks can easily be constructed using compound metrics. As an example, consider the task of bridging two network nodes. In practice, this means moving to both nodes with the maximum but equal signal strength."}, {"heading": "469108 samples", "text": "The target function shows a clear maximum exactly in the middle between the two starting positions, so that its maximization results in maximum and equal signal strengths for both nodes. This is just a toy example, and other task-specific metrics can be designed, which makes this algorithm very versatile in formulating and solving tasks for mobile nodes in wireless networks. Of particular interest would be a multi-layer approach. For more complicated target functions, which are probably also noisier, more complex internal models can be beneficial."}, {"heading": "6.2 Experiment", "text": "For example, we performed experiments with two nodes and the target function shown above, one of which was the one used for the previous experiments and the second was placed in another office. Both nodes were simple USB wireless adapters that sent packets. Again, the experiments were performed during regular office hours. Fig. 6 shows the histogram of measured values across all the experiments performed. As expected, the function has a maximum somewhere between the two nodes. Using the target function f means that the noise of the measurements from both sources is combined according to the law of uncertainty, which is twice as high for the case of the same but independent noise for both nodes and the use of the target function f as the noise of a single node, which is about 4 dB. We measured a standard deviation of about 9 arb unit for our experiments, which is well in line with the predicted error rate."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "Starting with the most basic task of source search, the general algorithm has proven effective in real-world scenarios through a series of experiments with a real physical robot in an office environment. Subsequently, we have shown how this algorithm can be extended to various other tasks that a mobile network node can accomplish, such as maximizing PDR to a specific target node or bridging two network nodes. An exemplary experiment has been successfully conducted for the bridging scenario. In addition, we have given insights into the robotic view of the problem and discussed the relationship with traditional algorithms. We believe that this discussion can promote the field of network robotics in an interdisciplinary way and also lead to new insights in other related areas."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank all those who contributed to the success of this project, including all members of the Adaptive Systems Group and the DFG Research Training Group METRIK (RTG 1324), which is also funding one of the authors."}], "references": [{"title": "Stochastic source seeking in complex environments", "author": ["N.

In this work we want to develop simple, adaptive and reusable algorithms for real world applications for this scenario. Starting with the most basic task for mobile wireless network nodes, finding the position of another node, we introduce an algorithm able to solve this task. We then show how this algorithm can readily be employed to solve a large number of other related tasks like finding the optimal position to bridge two static network nodes. For this we first introduce a meta-algorithm inspired by autonomous robot learning strategies and the concept of internal models which yields a class of source seeking algorithms for mobile nodes. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated in real world experiments using a physical mobile robot and standard 802.11 wireless LAN in an office environment. We also discuss the differences to conventional algorithms and give the robotics perspective on this class of algorithms. Then we proceed to show how more complex tasks, which might be encountered by mobile nodes, can be encoded in the same framework and how the introduced algorithm can solve them. These tasks can be direct (cross layer) optimization tasks or can also encode more complex tasks like bridging two network nodes. We choose the bridging scenario as an example, implemented on a real physical robot, and show how the robot can solve it in a real world experiment.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
