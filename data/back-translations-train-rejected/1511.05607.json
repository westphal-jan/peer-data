One of the most effective way to analyze the dusts is via their interaction and interference on observable background light. The observed extinction curves and spectral features carry the information of the size and composition of dusts. Among the features, the broad 2175 Angstrom absorption bump is one of the most significant spectroscopic interstellar extinction feature. Traditionally, statistical methods are applied to detect the existence of absorption bump. These methods require heavy preprocessing and the co-existence of other reference features to alleviate the influence from the noises. In this paper, we apply deep learning techniques to detect the broad absorption bump. We demonstrate the key steps for training the selected models and their results.

In particular, the proposed method has the following advantages. \u2022 Large dataset enables accurate imaging learning. When generating the samples, we repeatedly have control over the selection of emission and absorption redshifts. After creating the model, no additional information is required for new observations. \u2022 Easy to use and transfer. With a trained model, any prediction on newly added observations is only a feed process. Practical models could also be easily shared between researchers.

We refer to Berk et al. (2001) and obtain the SDSS data release 7 composite quasar spectrum as the intrinsic spectrum. Then, we modify the emission and absorption red shifts and add the absorption profile according to Equation 2. We select a typical bump profile: x0 = 4.59, \u03b3 = 1.0 and Abump = 2.0. To increase diversity and closely simulate the observations in the real world, we apply the second method. We have selected a subset of the spectra from the SDSS data release 7 according to the Mg II catalog from Zhu & Me'nard (2013). We follow the fit method described in Jiang et al. (2010a; 2011) and interweave it with the absorption bump profile indicating that we are as close to < these < to existing samples."}, {"heading": "3.2 CASE ONE: FULLY CONNECTED NEURAL NETWORK", "text": "The first easy choice for the model is the fully connected neural network. Its effectiveness in capturing the nonlinearity relationships between the input characteristics has been tested in recent decades. To feed the training data into the fully connected neural network, we extracted the flux value as a vector and use this vector to train the model. We perform this data transformation based on the observation that the absorption surge is not related to the absolute wavelength value due to redshifts, but rather to the adjacent flux value relationship. Furthermore, the wavelength interval between two consecutive wavelength flux values is relatively stable in the data (both simulated and in the real world). Due to the data acquisition mechanism, the number of pairs in a sample may be slightly different. We added the samples with zeros to a total of 4761 flux values.

The raw image can be as large as hundreds of KB, scaled down to 256 * 256 grayscale images and used for training and testing. Recently, the Convolutionary Neural Network (CNN) (LeCun & Bengio (1995)) has proven its effectiveness in image-based recognition and classification due to its ability to divide parameters and capture localized patterns. We have adapted two popular CNN-based models, AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al. (2012)) and GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al. (2014)).

However, the input image is too sparse given the large white background. In order to condense the input and strengthen the CNN model, we perform another data transformation. This transformation is also based on the assumption used for fully connected neural networks. Unlike the previous transformation, which is a 1D vector, we fill and fold the vector into a 69 * 69 matrix. This transformation allows filters in the volume layer to capture the localized information with adjacent flow values. We use different configurations of CNN and publish the best results we have in Table 2. We repair the CNN models with two fully connected layers after the volume layers and change the number of volume layers, the number of filters in each volume layer and the core size. The best model is achieved with two fully connected layers according to the volume layers and the number of each * 3."}, {"heading": "3.5 DISCUSSION", "text": "In previous sections, we present three types of models and the corresponding data transformations.

We discussed in detail how we generated and transformed the training data according to the selected models. We presented the results for different models. To get a feeling for what the models learned, we chose the CNN-based AlexNet model and provided the visualizations of filters, function cards and reconstructed maximum activation input images. The resulting images prove that the model identifies the absorption disorder and not any other background noise. With the success in applying the deep-learning-based method for the absorption disorder, we generalized the Deep-Deep-Deep-Deep-Deep-learning methodology to the broad scientific discovery problems, where deep-learning models can be effectively trained on sufficient amounts of data Deep-Deep-Deep-Deep-Deep-Deep-Deep-Deep-Learning.
