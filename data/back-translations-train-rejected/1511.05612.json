Data Cleaning", "text": "Due to errors in the log system, values or negative values are missing in the original data set. Prior to our analysis, we purify the data set by neglecting traffic data from BSs with error data points. This leaves us N = 697 BSs for analysis. For each BS, we extract its uplink traffic data in a consecutive 14-day period and store it as follows: t {i} = [t {i} 1, t {i} 2,..., t {i} L], (1) where t {i} j represents uplink traffic from ith BS in jth hour. There are 336 hours in 14 days, so the length of the traffic vector is L = 336. We store the vectors in matrix form, we can get a N \u00b7 L matrix T as follows: [P {tw1} 1, P {tw1} 1, P {tw1} 2, P {2} x 2, P {tw1} x, A {twy} {twy."}, {"heading": "C. Traffic Characteristics and Implications", "text": "Fig. 1 shows the traffic variation of a single BS within a period of 14 days. A daily repetitive pattern can be derived from the figure: Traffic always decreases at night and increases during the day. This is due to the daily dynamics of human activity. This phenomenon is widespread in all BSs and should be used in the creation of forecasting models. Furthermore, the intensity of traffic varies arbitrarily from day to day. Therefore, mobile traffic is not periodically associated with deterministic day patterns. Therefore, forecasting models should track daily random fluctuation in order to provide accurate predictions."}, {"heading": "III. PROPOSED MODEL", "text": "In this section we present our BR model and explain the process of traffic forecasting. The entire process consists of 5 steps: differentiation, window shifting, normalization, model training and traffic forecasting."}, {"heading": "A. Differentiation", "text": "In order to reflect the repetitive nature of mobile traffic, we first differentiate the original traffic with a certain seasonality. The M-level differentiation of the original traffic at the time l gives us the relative deviation from the market value at the time l \u2212 M. For example, if we want to take into account the daily repetition, we can set M = 24; and if we want to include the weekly pattern, we can set M = 24 x 7 = 168.0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 051015202530HourB ST raffi cvo lum e (T B) Fig. 1.

Illustration of the window sliding on the traffic vector of a B.Since we obtain a 1 \u00d7 (L \u2212 M) vector after M-level differentiation, the original N \u00b7 L traffic matrix T is converted into the N \u00b7 L \u2212 M) differentiated traffic matrix (1 \u2212 T)."}, {"heading": "B. Window Sliding", "text": "After the differentiation, we use the sliding window method to extract historical information and formulate the characteristic vectors for the BR model. Suppose the window length is W. For each BS, we extract the characteristics of the input and output model, as in Fig. 2. First, we point the left edge of the sliding window at the (M + 1) -th hour in the differentiated traffic matrix and then move the window one hour to the right until its edge reaches the L-th hour. For each slide, we take the differentiated traffic values within the window as 1 \u00d7 W input vector and the traffic value only at the right edge as output characteristic. For all BSs, we get Ns = (L \u2212 M \u2212 W) N input vectors and output values. These characteristics are then stored as rows of the input characteristic matrix X or the output characteristic matrix Y, respectively."}, {"heading": "C. Normalization", "text": "In our training algorithm, each column of the training matrix X represents a set of values in each dimension of the feature pace. As mobile traffic is highly unevenly distributed, X can have different orders of magnitude in different feature dimensions, which can cause convergence problems in some training algorithms. Consequently, we normalize each column of X (and similar Y) to ensure that it has the same variances in different feature dimensions, and the normalized dataset is represented by X and Y dimensions, and your inputs are calculated as follows: X-ij = Xij \u2212 \u00b5Xj\u03c3Xj (4) Y-i = Yi \u2212 \u00b5Y\u03c3Y (5), where \u00b5Xj = \u0445 Ns i = 1 Xij Ns-1 Xij \u2212 1 \u0445 Ns-i = 1 (Xij \u2212 \u00b5Xj) 2 is the mean or standard deviation of the j columns of X."}, {"heading": "D. Model Training", "text": "For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the differentiated traffic data fulfil the following linear relationship: Y-i = \u03b80 + W-j = 1 \u03b8jX-ij + i (6), where {\u03b8j: j = 0, 1, \u00b7, W} are the parameters we need to train. These parameters include the intercept, \u03b81, \u03b82,..., \u03b8W are property weights, and i stands for residual noise with an expected value 0.The model training process finds a number of parameters {\u03b8j: j = 0, 1, \u00b7, W} that minimize the square error between the prediction and real traffic: J-i = 12Ns-i = 1 (Y-i \u2212 prev0 \u2212 W-J = 1 \u03b8jX-ij) 2 (7) Various algorithms can be used to minimize the cost function. Among them, the conjugate method, due to its universality and simplicity, we apply the same cost adjustment for the same reason."}, {"heading": "E.

MODEL EVALUATION", "text": "In this section we evaluate the proposed BR model and compare the evaluation results with the SA and LR models."}, {"heading": "A. Methodology", "text": "We randomly select 200 BSs and extract their traffic over a consecutive period of 14 days. Traffic data are divided into a training set and a test set. Traffic data for the first 10 days are used as a training set. Train data is differentiated and scanned by sliding windows based on model parameters before being used to estimate model parameters. Accuracy of the trained model is then tested by traffic over the remaining 4 days. Traffic data in the test set is also differentiated and scanned by sliding windows to obtain the test matrix. The test matrix is then used to derive the forecasted traffic as in (8). The forecasted accuracy of each model is evaluated using the standardized root mean square error (NRMSE). For the ith BS, we forecast K-hour traffic and compare the forecasted results with real traffic as follows: NRMSE {i} = 1 K-square error (NRMSE {t} {k} (traffic {i-Mt}), {i-MSE statistics {i}."}, {"heading": "B. Forecasting Accuracy", "text": "The parameters used in our evaluation are as follows: For the BR and SA models, the differential order is set to M = 24 to capture the repetitive daily traffic pattern; the LR model does not include any traffic differentiation, so the raw traffic data is used; the window size for the BR model is set to WBR = 3, while for the LR model, the window size is set to WLR = 72 to include historical traffic information for the last 3 days; the automatic regression and moving average orders for the SA model are 2 and 1, respectively, and the seasonality is 24. The histogram of the NRMSE model of the 200 BSs resulting from the BR model, the SA model and the LR model are shown in Fig. 3. It shows that the NRMSE distribution of the BR and SA models is very similar, and both perform much better than the LR model; the average accuracy of the NRMSE model in all BR, SA and LR models in the table."}, {"heading": "C. Seasonality", "text": "Due to the daily nature of human activity, any integer multiple of 24 hours can reasonably be used as a seasonality. However, after experimenting with our model, we conclude that a 24-hour seasonality is the best choice. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the average NRMSE of all BSs is lowest when the seasonality is set to 24 hours. The reason for this phenomenon could be that the intensity of human activity, and thus of mobile traffic, varies from day to day. Therefore, the traffic value before 24 hours is most evident for forecasting traffic at the current hour."}, {"heading": "D. Model Complexity", "text": "The three models show different model complexity. The proposed BR model has the least complexity, with WBR + 1 parameters for all BSs. The LR model is more complex, with WLR1 parameters for all BSs. In contrast, the SA model has the highest complexity. It assigns a series of parameters to each BS. For each BS, it will introduce WAR + 1 parameters in an auto-regressive step and WMA + 1 parameters in a moving average step. Thus, for a total of N BSs, N parameters are needed (WAR + WMA + 2). For illustration, the complexity of the three models is shown in the table. II with numerical examples. Compared with the SA model, our BR model has a lower complexity in two aspects. First, this differential linear model is simpler than the SA model. Our model could be considered a special ARIMA model, which considers the MA term as 0."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we propose a block regression model for traffic forecasting in wireless communication networks, which reflects the daily repetitive pattern of mobile traffic. The window size of the LR model should be much larger than the BR model and has low model complexity. It could represent the traffic characteristics of all BSs with a single model without losing much accuracy, the reason being that this simplification is based on the spatial similarity that is typical of mobile traffic. We test this model using real mobile traffic data from a large Chinese city and compare the result with the local model of linear regression and the seasonal ARIMA model. The result shows that our model has much higher accuracy than the local model of linear regression. The ARIMA model is widely used in time series analysis and is considered to be one of the most accurate forecasting models. Our result shows that our BR model has the same accuracy as the local model of linear regression."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This work is partly funded by the National Basic Research Programme of China (973 Program: No. 2012CB316001), the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under funding numbers 61201191, No. 61321061, No. 61401250 and No. 61461136004, and Hitachi Ltd."}], "references": [{"title": "Tango: traffic-aware network planning and green operation", "author": ["Z.
