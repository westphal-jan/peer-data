Previous approaches either discover plans by maximally \"matching\" observed actions to plan libraries, assuming target plans are from plan libraries, or infer plans by executing domain models to best explain the observed actions, assuming complete domain models are available. In real world applications, however, target plans are often not from plan libraries and complete domain models are often not available, since building complete sets of plans and complete domain models are often difficult or expensive. In this paper we view plan libraries as corpora and learn vector representations of actions using the corpora; we then discover target plans based on the vector representations. Our approach is capable of discovering underlying plans that are not from plan libraries, without requiring domain models provided. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance to traditional plan recognition approaches in three planning domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 05:50:14 GMT  (119kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05662v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["xin tian", "hankz hankui zhuo", "subbarao kambhampati"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.05662"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.05662.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Discovering Underlying Plans Based on Distributed Representations of Actions", "authors": ["Xin Tian", "Hankz Hankui Zhuo", "Subbarao Kambhampati"], "emails": ["tianxin1860@gmail.com,", "zhuohank@mail.sysu.edu.cn,", "rao@asu.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of the people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move"}, {"heading": "Problem Definition", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one sees oneself in a position to go in search of a solution that adapts to the needs of the people.

ForARMS + PRP, the number of candidate targets for each test example is set to 20. ARMS + PRP aims to identify plans that are optimal in terms of the cost of the actions. We relax ARMS + PRP to Output | Sx | Optimal Plans, some of which may be suboptimal. We varied the number of actions recommended by DUP (or MatchPlan) from 1 to 10. The results are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 that the accuracy of the three approaches generally increases as the size of the recommended actions increases in all three areas. This is consistent with our intuition, as the greater recommended action is recognized, the higher the likelihood that the PRP is the higher the recommended action."}, {"heading": "Related work", "text": "In fact, it is not that it is a way of referring primarily to the abstraction, deconstruction, and functioning of events.

First, we learn the vector representations of actions from plan libraries using the Skip-gram model, which has proven effective. Then, we discover unobserved actions with the vector representations by repeatedly scanning actions and optimizing the likelihood that potential plans will be detected. We also demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of our approach. While in this essay we focused on a unique detection task, human-in-the-loop planning in practice will consist of multiple iterations, whereby DUP recognizes the plan and proposes action alternatives; the human makes a selection and revises the plan. The goal is to provide a form of flexible plan completion tools, similar to the auto-completioners for search engine queries. To do this efficiently, we need to have the DUP recognition algorithm of actions focused on this word, and make the domain algorithm of action interesting."}], "references": [{"title": "Y", "author": ["O.
