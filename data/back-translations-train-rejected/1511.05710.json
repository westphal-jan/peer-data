In general, another kernel matrix, the so-called pseudo-kernel matrix, needs to be included. We have focused on the GPR to develop a new formulation called widely nonlinear complex evaluated GPR (WCGPR), after the widely linear MMSE, because it has a very similar structure. The pseudo-kernel or pseudo-covariance matrix in this formulation models the covariance between the outputs and their conjugates. If this pseudo-covariance cancels, i.e. the outputs are correct, WCGPR delivers a strictly non-linear complex formulation, since the WLMMSE yields a strict LMSE. Other special cases can also be derived from this general solution."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2015, "abstractText": "In this paper we propose a novel Bayesian kernel based solution for regression in complex fields.
