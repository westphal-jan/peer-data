Theoretically, models are developed, tested, and then operated within an organization. Unfortunately, the environment in which the solution is developed differs from that in which the solution is operated. During the operation of the optimal decision, various unexpected events occur, so there is a need on the part of operators to quickly adapt an in-service plan to take into account events that no longer or partially render it unusable.In recent years, the Optimization Solution Team within IBM has been involved in the development of optimization solutions for planning and planning for industrial markets with great potential. In order to better meet the needs of their customers, they strive to develop methods and software tools for repair or restoration.The current research project is intended to help to provide IBM's existing optimization models (mainly Mixed Integer Programming, Linear Programming, or Constraint Programming) with optimization solutions that can be operated as widely as possible."}, {"heading": "Context", "text": "Solving such optimization models leads to solutions that need to be operated within an organization. However, the conditions under which the optimal solution is achieved rarely correspond exactly to the conditions under which the solution is operated within the organization. Therefore, in most practical contexts, the calculated optimal solution is no longer optimal under the conditions under which it is operated. In fact, it may be \"anything but optimal\" or even unfeasible. For various reasons, we have not been able to completely optimize the existing solution or plan. Consequently, it is necessary to look for \"repair solutions,\" i.e. solutions that exhibit good behavior with respect to possible scenarios or with respect to the uncertainty of the parameters of the model. In order to solve the problem, the calculated solution should be such that it can be \"repaired\" by a local optimization led by the user or by a limited modification aimed at minimizing the impacts taking into account the scenarios."}, {"heading": "Goals", "text": "As announced in the introduction, the operational purpose of this research project is to develop repair / recovery infrastructures that will be added to the existing solutions developed by IBM. To achieve this goal, we propose to conduct some preparatory research to optimize two problems related to production planning and scheduling. The first step of this research will be to advance the state of the art in the models and algorithms for formulating and solving the problems. It will attempt to optimize problems related to production planning and scheduling in order to propose mathematical formulations for the existing solutions. Therefore, we will have the opportunity to compare them with models already proposed in the literature, and to evaluate the extent to which the proposed solutions differ from existing approaches. After modeling the existing solutions and their validation using Cplex and OPL, the next goal of this research will be to calculate a repair solution: an up-to-date plan with a common set of decision variables A number of scenarios that will be grouped into a number of variable and frozen in a number of them."}, {"heading": "Research Organization", "text": "First, we examine robust optimal solutions and concepts for repairing solutions. We deal with two study cases from the CPS and PPS family, and at an early stage attempt to extend these solutions and concepts to more general optimization issues. These study cases are developed on a platform called IBM ILOG ODME (Operational Decision Management Enterprise). ODME is a platform for implementing and delivering tailored business solutions for optimization-based planning and planning. Developing a realistic plan or schedule provides the best possible balance between customer service and revenue objectives. ILOG ODM Enterprise enables business leaders to make better decisions through what-if analysis, scenario management and collaboration."}, {"heading": "1. Tail Assignment", "text": "The first case is a solution described by IBM in the context of aircraft operations, where the problem of creating routes for individual aircraft is to cover a number of flights on a timetable, so that various operational restrictions are met, while the arrival and departure times of aircraft are part of the process, starting with market behaviour modelling, which includes information on the arrival and departure times of aircraft, and then carrying out the fleet mapping of aircraft to each type of aircraft to maximise the expected profit."}, {"heading": "2. Production Planning", "text": "The second case study is a classic production planning problem [Murla J. et al. 2006]. The aim of this application is to decide how much of which product must be produced at each site for a certain period of time. Planning can also involve decisions on the transport of raw materials between suppliers and production sites, the transport of intermediates between different production sites and the transport of finished products between production site and customer. Targets can include minimizing production, storage and transport costs as well as minimizing penalties related to inventory or target demand and / or forecast to cover. We will apply the same methodology as for the first case study, from mathematical modelling of the problem to generating a repair algorithm based on specific scenarios. Some typical repair scenarios in this context are the following: Scenario 1. A limitation requires that all customers with priority must have fulfilled all their orders in order for the optimizing machine to run again and find optimal solutions so that the customer can make the decision to change the priority given by a business application, without the customer having to apply the 2 hours."}, {"heading": "3. Generalization", "text": "Dealing with two different models of repair helps us to examine the similarity between them in order to propose a more general framework of repair that could be linked to that of any model of mathematical programming that provides users with a better understanding of the solutions. The general framework is based on a specific definition of scenarios, related criteria to define the effects of taking into account the original solution, and finally on repair algorithms. To model repair algorithms, one possible idea would be, for example, to explore possible links with VNS (Variable Neighborhood Search) [Hansen P. et al.] The reason for this is that VNS is also based on the repeated solution of local reoptimization."}, {"heading": "Liang Z., Chaovalitwongse W.
