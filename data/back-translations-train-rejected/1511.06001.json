Bibliography Appendix RingraziamentiAbstractSurface electromyography is a valid tool to capture muscle contraction signals from intact and amputated subjects. Electromyographic signals can be used to control prosthetic devices in a non-invasive manner and to distinguish the movements performed by the respective EMG electrode activity. According to the literature, several algorithms have been used to control prosthetic hands using s-EMG signals. The main problem is the correct classification of acquired signals as actual motion. This paper presents a study of the performance of the Support Vector Machine in a short period in which two distinct features (Mean Absolute Value Waveform and average signal length problem) lie above the EMG signability."}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "In fact, the classification in the movement classes is still being studied to improve the reliability of the hands, and scientists and engineers are still studying how to reproduce the sensory-motor function of humans. Body actions are controlled by the neural signals of the central nervous system (CNS)."}, {"heading": "2. Related work", "text": "There is a great deal of work in connection with the sEMG devices, which focuses on the classification of the myoelectric control of the prostheses. In all these approaches, a common process has been pursued, which includes the collection and processing of data."}, {"heading": "3. Problem statement", "text": "The term \"repeatability\" refers to the variation of repeated measurements made on the same object and under the same conditions. Therefore, in a repeatability study, variability is based only on errors in the measurement process itself, as indicated in [9]. The aim of this work is to contribute to this topic, especially with regard to the performance of the SVM algorithm in classifying 18 movements (including rest periods) over a short period of time. In fact, the ability to distinguish each type of motion with high accuracy under variable conditions implies the construction of a reliable prosthetic leg. To enable the sEMG signals to control a prosthetic device, several processing steps are required. The acquired data is pre-processed to remove noise from the electrodes and electronic devices."}, {"heading": "4. Material and Methods", "text": "Of the features presented in Chapter 2, only two were used to represent the data in this study. Furthermore, a single method was chosen to classify the data."}, {"heading": "4.1. Data", "text": "The data used in this study do not belong to the Ninapro dataset; they were collected from a single intact subject by sEMG electrodes, Cyberglove and Inclinometer. The latter two were not investigated because the glove sensors experienced problems during the acquisition (signals were useless) and due to the different process required to study the data collected by the inclinometers. The acquisition period lasted four days, with three daily sessions of data acquisition. A short film was presented to the subject showing the movements to be replicated (five seconds each). Only 17 of the 52 positions of the Ninapro database were included in this study, in particular the poses in Exercise 2. Figure 4 shows stills from the film illustrating the movements the subject should imitate. Each hand movement was repeated ten times, with a pause of three seconds between repetitions. The data were inserted in the MS format (the data were quadruped by a set of 100 electrofilters and a set of filters were inserted in the first three EMG)."}, {"heading": "4.2. Feature extraction", "text": "For the presentation of the data two different characteristics were used, which belong to the most common in the literature: the mean absolute value and the waveform length. A part of the signal (Figure 7) is represented as it appears on the basis of MAV and WL in Figure 5 and Figure 6, respectively. The mean absolute value The mean absolute value (MAV) is a time domain characteristic, which estimates the mean absolute value of the signal xi in the i-th segment, i.e. N samples in length: X i = 1 N \u2211 k = 1N | xk | for i = 1,..., where xk is the k-th sample in segment i and I is the total number of segments over the entire sampled signal. In other words, it is calculated by taking the mean value of the absolute value of the sEMG signal. It is a way to detect muscle contraction values. MAV does not require high computational costs, so that it is widely used in research and clinical practice."}, {"heading": "4.3. Classification", "text": "Several studies on sEMG show that no classification method significantly outperforms the other in pattern recognition, so that the performance of linear classifiers practically corresponds to that of non-linear classifiers [1]. In this paper, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was selected within the classification approaches known in the literature."}, {"heading": "4.3.1. Algorithm description", "text": "SVMs are linear classifiers that attempt to maximize the distance between two classes. Although they are binary classifiers, despite their linear approach, they can also be used in one-on-one multilets. SVMs can be used in conjunction with core functions, so they are usually used for nonlinear problems. In practice, core functions perform a transformation by mapping input data into a different space, making it easier for SVM to process them and find a hyperplane to separate the two class data samples. A simple example of this can be seen in Figure 9. Radial Basis Function (RBF)."}, {"heading": "4.3.2. Parameters description", "text": "The RBF requires only two parameters (so-called hyperparameters), which are determined by the grid search: C and \u03b3. The C parameter controls the trade-off between model complexity and error frequency; in other words, a lower C provides a better margin over the hyperplane (although more samples would not be correctly classified), while an increased value aims to separate as many instances as possible (the margin may not be the best possible). Intuitively, the \u03b3 parameter defines the extent of the influence of a single training example: the higher the values, the closer the distance. The first value was chosen between C {2i: i = 0.2,..., 14,16}, while the second one is vice versa reverse vice versa: i: i = 16, \u2212 14,..., \u2212 4, \u2212 2}. The goal is to select the pair (C, \u03b3) so that the classifier can accurately predict the test data set, vice versa reverse: i: i = 14, \u2212 4, \u2212 2}}."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "Following the acquisition, the data was subjected to several steps prior to the classification phase."}, {"heading": "5.1. Experimental setup", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "5.2. Result", "text": "First, the model was trained to select the best hyperparameters using samples from the data set of the first daily session (Acquisitions 2, 6, 9 and 12); for each day, the experiments were conducted to classify the data of the test set. All results are shown in the figures from A2 to A9 in the appendix; some examples are given below to highlight the most common behaviors.The first experiment included the model that trained for Acquisition 2 and was tested for Acquisition 2, 3 and 5 test sets, using both MAV and WL separately for each case. Later, the smoothing function was applied. Figure 12a reports the accuracy rates. Figure 12b shows that the accuracy values of the acquired samples from Acquisition 6, 7 and 8 and the training of the model with Acquisition 6 training set are flawed. Finally, Figure 12c provides an overview of the results obtained, the classification of the data from Acquisition Values, 9 and 11 cases were miscalculated."}, {"heading": "5.3. Discussion", "text": "Between the first and second recording of the day, there is always a drop in performance (about 15%), which may be due to several factors, including muscle fatigue and electrode shifting, for example. Different behavior at the end of the day cannot be associated with any of the aforementioned causes. Even the slight improvement that sometimes occurs in the accuracy of the last daily recording is not significant. In fact, it must be taken into account that a single person was used in this study, so the results obtained cannot be statistically reliable. Moreover, the way the data set is split can lead to different (though not dramatic) performance outcomes, so the increase in accuracy at the end of the day may not have led to changes in the data sets (training, validation and testing)."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "In the current work, we performed a performance evaluation of the pattern recognition algorithm, focusing our study on the problem of repeatability within a short period of time. EMG signals were represented by two different features, the mean absolute value and the waveform length, which appeared to have the best performance in terms of their calculation costs [6]. Support Vector Machine was widely used in previous work and also delivered satisfactory performance in our study. This work shows a practical equivalence between the features that were used to represent data (MAV and WL); in fact, although WL is slightly more efficient, the accuracy percentage generally differs by less than 3%. The remarkable decrease in accuracy that follows the first daily test suggests that a recalibration during the day might be necessary. However, training the model requires a long time, and learning-based strategies may be required to do so, with minimal inconvenience for the day to achieve the improvement it is achieved, in particular during the need for the day to have a better outcome."}, {"heading": "7.
