Fake reviews are often detected based on several signs, including 1) they occur in short bursts of time; 2) fraudulent user accounts have skewed rating distributions. However, these may both be true in any given dataset. Hence, in this paper, we propose an approach for detecting fraudulent reviews which combines these 2 approaches in a principled manner, allowing successful detection even when one of these signs is not present. To combine these 2 approaches, we formulate our Bayesian Inference for Rating Data (BIRD) model, a flexible Bayesian model of user rating behavior. Based on our model we formulate a likelihood-based suspiciousness metric, Normalized Expected Surprise Total (NEST). We propose a linear-time algorithm for performing Bayesian inference using our model and computing the metric.

However, customer reviews have long been studied [8], and many methods for review fraud focus on review texts, such as [5, 11, 19]. While these methods are instructive, many websites have only text-free reviews, or text is easy to manipulate. Therefore, in our environment, we focus on reviews and their temporal characteristics, as review texts are not always available. Graph-based approaches Many of the existing work in fraud or anomaly have focused on detecting fraud in pure graphics; that is, graphics without nodes or edge labels are not always available, including spectral methods that use self-decomposition or singular value decomposition (SVD) to group similar nodes in the chart [10, 21, 24] using an iterative approach to label the labels as honest and dishonest."}, {"heading": "3 Bayesian Model", "text": "Let's start by illustrating why a Bayesian approach is helpful. Consider the users Alice, Bob and Carol, whose rating distributions are as shown in Figure 3. Example Alice rates 4 products, all with 5 stars. Bob has the same, 50 times. Carol gave about 300 ratings, and shows a \"hockey stick\" distribution that is close to the average of all users. Which user is most suspicious (i.e. likely to be rated fraudulently)? Our goal is to find a principled and intuitive measure of how suspicious each user is. Why does Alice's low rating make her less suspicious than Bob? Our answer is: Since we only have 4 products rated by Alice, we have little information about her true (i.e., long-term) rating behavior. She could simply be a normal user who seems unusual, as her first few ratings were high, but being given more ratings would tempt her to a more typical distribution, Bob is much less likely."}, {"heading": "4 Proposed Algorithms", "text": "In this algorithm, we can adjust each parameter and cluster assignments z to convergence. Any of the arg max lines in the algorithm can be efficiently solved, what we describe next, how we fix the cluster parameters here and adjust the cluster assignments z to convergence. Note that the fit only affects the probabilities with respect to xi, because i in cluster distribution we are equally maximizing: zi = K P (xi). To be clear, P (xi) refers to the marginal probabilities here."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "We conducted experiments to answer the following questions: Q1. Real data effectiveness: Does BIRDNEST capture real data fraud? Q2. Scalability: Does it scale to large data sets? Q3: Interpretability: Can the results of the Bayesian model BIRD and the values specified by NEST be interpreted in a real-world environment? We implemented BIRDNEST in Python; all experiments were conducted with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5 Macbook Pro, 16GB RAM, on OS X 10.9.5. the code is available at www.andrew.cmu.edu / user / bhooi / ratings.tar. We test BIRDNEST on a variety of real data sets: Table 2 provides details of the data sets we use. Table 2: Data sets used."}, {"heading": "5.1 Q1: Effectiveness", "text": "The rating on Flipkart data Flipkart is an online trading platform where we sell products to customers where customers rate review products from 1 to 5 stars. We used BIRDNEST to identify the 250 most suspicious users and make them available to Flipkart; in fact, these accounts were examined and hand-labeled by Flipkart, tagging the ratings of 211 users in the top 250 of BIRDNEST who were involved in fraud. Figure 1b shows the precision of the algorithm at various values of up to 250: This precision for the most suspicious users is very high: e.g. precision of 1.0 for the first 50 users. These are essential results for Flipkart. A common pattern that domain experts have found that most users are marked as fraudulent is either spamming 4 / 5 star reviews for several products from a single seller (boosting reviews by several sellers) or by one of others."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we developed BIRD, a Bayesian follow-up approach to valuation data, and NEST, a principle-based fraud detection measure. Our method provides a principal way to combine valuation and time information to detect valuation fraud and to find a trade-off between users with extreme valuation distributions and users with a larger number of ratings. Our contributions are: \u2022 Theoretically sound user behavior model: We define a Bayesian model for data based on a mix model that captures different types of user behavior, which allows us to determine how much an anomalous user deviates from normal behavior. \u2022 Suspiciency metric: We define a probability-based metric that measures how much a user deviates from normal behavior. \u2022 Algorithm: We suggest a scalable and effective algorithm to successfully evaluate the Bayesian model and mistrust our high-accuracy algorithm: 84%."}], "references": [{"title": "Opinion fraud detection in online reviews by network effects", "author": ["L.
