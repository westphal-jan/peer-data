Introduction", "text": "The one who follows the mass will normally go no further than the mass; the one who walks alone is unlikely to find himself in places that no one has ever visited before. \"Albert Einstein. While this quote is lived by many people, this paper is motivated by the opposite. Our work is based on the notion that literally one who follows the mass will surpass the individual, and along with the mass that moves beyond places where no single individual is able to move; a phenomenon known as emerging collective behavior. The nature of the behavior that occurs is created in a swarm or crush with certain classes of beings (e.g. insects, humans, animals, etc.), with each being self-organized and collectively constituting a complex and coordinated collective behavior. The nature of emerging behavior is based on a simple thumb rule of thumb, in which entities engage each other with fundamental interactions."}, {"heading": "1.1. Comparisons with Previous Reviews", "text": "While there are a variety of methods developed for crowd analysis, there are few that focus on crowd analysis, most of which are able to engage in in-depth discussion from the perspective of physics or biologically inspired approaches in the context of crowds. Hughes \"next attempt to bridge the studies between physics and biology in the context of crowds was by Hughes.\" His work emphasizes the need to make the most important distinctions between physics and the actual mass of people."}, {"heading": "1.2. Motivation and Contributions", "text": "A thorough exploration of the current literature offers a broader view of the potential of computer vision to permeate the various disciplines, especially in the two fields of science; physics and biology, to further improve the efficiency of video surveillance of crowded scenes. Therefore, in this paper we focus primarily on the attributes of crowd behavior from physics and biology to computer vision. We discuss existing computer vision solutions that integrate these attributes for the analysis of crowd behavior. Specifically, this paper offers a comprehensive review of computer vision methods in crowd behavior analysis from physics and biologically inspired perspectives. We lay out the underlying prospects for utilizing the studies from the two sciences and merging different disciplines in the hope of taking computer vision to the next level."}, {"heading": "2. Swarm, Crowd and Computer Vision - the Beginnings", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1. What is a swarm or crowd?", "text": "A swarm or crowd is generally referred to as a collection of spatially close groups of beings. Most often, the entities are associated with insects such as bees and ants, which explains the enormous research efforts in the field of swarm intelligence motivated by biology. For example, the well-known Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, inspired by the feeding behavior of a colony of ants, and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, which simulates the synchronized movement of a bird stream. Beekman et al. [35] advocate that swarm intelligence is biology. On the other hand, physicists have long used the term swarm to describe particles or electrons to describe transport equations and fluid flows. [36, 37, 38] Examples of swarm intelligence are shown as shown in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "2.2. What is the role of computer vision in crowd analysis?", "text": "A specific area of interest in public safety includes visual monitoring of mass gatherings of people, for example, during public gatherings (e.g. music festivals, religious events) and demonstrations (e.g. strikes, protests), as shown in Figure 4. The safety of crowds at public events has always been of great importance to the competent authorities due to the dynamics and risk of degeneration. Any busy environment has a high tendency to descend into a panic atmosphere in the face of physical stress (i.e. overcrowding) or sudden outside pressure (e.g. shootings, fires), where the consequences are often devastating. Various examples from historical events have shown how things can easily get out of control when crowds of people gather at large events. Some examples of disasters that have occurred in the past are shown in Figure 5.It is important to understand that in crowded scenes where crowds of hundreds or even thousands of people gather, video surveillance is a daunting task. Frequently, incidents within a crowd are caused solely by the inhabitant surveillance."}, {"heading": "3. Common attributes of crowd", "text": "This paper focuses on the behavioral analysis of human crowds. The literature shows that studies of the two natural sciences, biological and physically inspired approaches to the analysis of crowds in computer vision in general are based on the common attributes: decentralization, collective movement and emerging behavior. The basic idea of the crowd behavior used in the respective approaches is that the emerging behavior is caused by fundamental interactions between individuals without any leadership. Complex collective movements form, which in turn lead to emerging behavior."}, {"heading": "3.1. Decentralized", "text": "Decentralized decision-making is the concept of having no leaders where there is no centralized control structure that dictates how individual actors should behave. In general, the decentralized mechanism requires positive and negative feedback, reinforcement, and multiple interactions between the actors to establish a collective unconscious that enables emergent behavior [68]. Table 4 shows examples of the overlapping criteria from the perspective of the two sciences: biology and physics. Indeed, decentralized behavior or decision-making mechanism is a distinct attribute in most physics and biologically inspired approaches to computer vision that lead to emergent behavior. Simulations and observations of insects, animals, and human behavior in biology and particles in physics have supported this notion. One of common scenarios to represent the decentralized aspect in the crowd is the minimal behaviors produced."}, {"heading": "3.2. Collective motion", "text": "A comprehensive review of the observations and basic laws describing collective motion in mathematics and physics is indeed considered a phenomenon caused by the ordered macroscopic behavior of the constituent units. Collective movements are observed through simulations and experiments that occur not only in systems consisting of humans and animals [76, 77, 79], but also in interactions with physical objects based on mere physical interactions. [80, 81] Numerous models of collective patterns in humans are proposed to describe the leading formation of such complex behaviors."}, {"heading": "3.3. Emergent behavior", "text": "A critical distinction between emerging behavior and collective motion is that the former is a phenomenon resulting from collective motion, while the latter describes the self-organizing pattern of mass. In both nature and technology, complex behaviors can arise as a result of distributed collective processes or collective group behavior. Physicists, biologists, philosophers, and computer scientists have long blocked the emerging properties in their respective domains to shed light on the problem of emerging behavior. Physically, the emergence of complex behaviors in photons and electrons has been observed in quantum systems and in fluid dynamics."}, {"heading": "4. Conflicting attributes of crowd", "text": "When researching the behavior analysis of crowds, abstractions are made regarding the movements of individuals in crowds. Two main aspects discussed in this section are the tendency and ability of individuals to think and have preferences in crowds."}, {"heading": "4.1. Bias or non-bias", "text": "A fairly good example of this is the training of the golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas), where they already have a prejudice against yellow targets. Likewise, each individual is exclusive, where each has its own unique behavior and inclination. Individuals in the crowd are \"bound\" by a common focal point [105] in which each individual exhibits a low relation with different self-interest [106]. Therefore, the task of understanding and modelling the different bias and behavior of each individual is complex. Nevertheless, when individuals are integrated as a group, they change their behavior in accordance with the reactions of neighboring units."}, {"heading": "4.2. Thinking or non-thinking", "text": "Initially, work on the behavior of human masses is often associated with the laws of physics, assuming that it makes sense to consider human masses as a homogeneous mass of bodies. Each individual within the human mass is characterized as a non-thinking particle that has no tendency or ability to make decisions, and the movements and directions of each particle are dictated by external forces (i.e. boundaries, neighboring particles, etc.). [22] For example, the movement of human masses is equated with the flow of liquids that are directed through the path, at the speed of motions calculated analogously to the law of fluid dynamics. In 1995, Sime [111] questioned the practicality of depicting people in human masses as non-thinking particles (or ball bearings); the cancellation of the rules of behaviors often results in tiny behaviors and reactions of individuals within the mass influencing vital interaction."}, {"heading": "5. Applications & Dataset", "text": "The analysis and understanding of crowd behavior is a subject of great scientific interest that encompasses a multidisciplinary field, including computer vision, psychology, sociology, physics and civil engineering, in order to understand the complexity of crowd investigation. Despite the possibility of being an inexhaustible source of research, it is motivated by the need for improved public safety in society [113]. In the following section, we will discuss the public data sets that correspond to the three application areas of crowd behavior analysis: i) crowd segmentation, ii) crowd dynamic analysis, iii) crowd density estimation."}, {"heading": "5.1. Dataset", "text": "Given the success of crowd behavioral analysis in the field of computer vision, public data sets are becoming increasingly important in the visual community to address different research issues. A full list of currently available data sets can be found in Table 7 and Table 8. Although different research from different scientific fields attempts to analyze the same physical entity (i.e. crowds), approaches have progressed independently [114]. Therefore, different techniques, comparison comparisons, and benchmark data sets are characteristic of each other, leading to the difficulty of merging the evaluation protocol and performance comparisons in this area. In an effort to take the next big leap in crowd behavioral analysis, we strongly believe that a common platform is needed to evaluate the different analytical aspects of the crowd. 171819"}, {"heading": "5.2. Crowd segmentation", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to put themselves in a situation in which they are able to put themselves in a situation in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able to move."}, {"heading": "5.3. Crowd dynamic analysis", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to orient themselves in a different direction than in a different direction, namely the direction in which they are moving."}, {"heading": "5.4. Crowd density estimation", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want. In fact, it is the case that they are able to determine for themselves what they want and what they want. In fact, it is the case that they are not ready to decide whether they want to or not. In fact, it is the case that they do not want people to be able to decide whether they want to or not."}, {"heading": "6. The forthcoming crowd behavior analysis", "text": "In fact, most people are able to move to another world, in which they are able, in which they are able to move, and in which they are able, in which they are able to move."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "At this end, it is recognized that the exact similarity or distinction between physics and the biologically inspired approaches to analyzing the behavior of the masses is rather vague, underscored by the complex nature of human behavior, especially in a crowd, and the different perceptions of it in the context of computer vision. Nevertheless, this study aims to provide a platform within which both the well-researched and the neglected corners of these two sciences are addressed in the aspect of the behavior analysis of the masses. It is not the intention of this study to take a stand on the implicit hierarchy of sciences that has long been plagued by physics."}], "references": [{"title": "Complexity", "author": ["J.K.

Computer vision studies related to crowd are observed to resonate with the understanding of the emergent behavior in physics (complex systems) and biology (animal swarm). These studies, which are inspired by biology and physics, share surprisingly common insights, and interesting contradictions. However, this aspect of discussion has not been fully explored. Therefore, this survey provides the readers with a review of the state-of-the-art methods in crowd behavior analysis from the physics and biologically inspired perspectives.
