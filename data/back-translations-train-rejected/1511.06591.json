The key advantage of this approach is that the terminology of a particular domain is localized to the corresponding micro-ontology and the same words can thus be reused in other micro-ontologies covering other parts of the background knowledge. In this way, it will be possible to introduce the rich and expandable background knowledge about the content of words within CNLs such as ACE. Meanwhile, the verb (plot, property) polysector we need to properly cover a new PCNL."}], "references": [{"title": "A Comparison of three Controlled Natural Languages for OWL", "author": ["R.
