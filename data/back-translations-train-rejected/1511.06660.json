In developing countries, where data is scarce, data generated by mobile phones have already helped with planning disaster response and informing public health policy. Basic demographic information such as age or gender is, however, often missing from mobile phone data. There has recently been a growing interest in predicting demographic information from metadata. Previous approaches relied on standard machine learning algorithms and hand-engineered features. We here apply, for the first time, deep learning methods to mobile phone metadata using a convolutional network. We represent the data as 8 matrices summarizing incoming and outgoing mobile phone usage (contacts, calls, texts, call duration) on a given week. Our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on both age and gender prediction. Our analyzes indicate that our method captures compositional hierarchies in the mobile metadata based on the temporal nature of the data. These results show great potential for deep learning approaches for prediction tasks using standard mobile phone metadata.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 16:07:21 GMT  (99kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06660v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 17:13:22 GMT  (99kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06660v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 21:00:39 GMT  (94kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06660v3", null], ["v4", "Sat, 13 Feb 2016 14:08:15 GMT  (29kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06660v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["bjarke felbo", "p{\\aa}l sunds{\\o}y", "alex 'sandy' pentland", "sune lehmann", "yves-alexandre de montjoye"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06660"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.06660.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Bjarke Felbo", "P\u00e5l Sunds\u00f8y", "Sune Lehmann"], "emails": ["bfelbo@dtu.dk", "pal-roe.sundsoy@telenor.com", "sandy@media.mit.edu", "sljo@dtu.dk", "yvesalexandre@demontjoye.com", "yvesalexandre@demontjoye.com"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "Our mobile phones produce metadata every time we send or receive an SMS or phone call. These metadata - which record who calls, how long, and from where, or sends text messages - offer a detailed view of human behavior, including large-scale mobility. These metadata have great potential for good, but often lack basic demographic information, which is why there has recently been a growing interest in predicting demographic information such as age and gender from cell phone metadata. Previous approaches relied on standardized machine learning algorithms and hand-generated functions (Sarraute et al., 2014; Frias-Martinez et al., 2010). Conventional networks (ConvNets) have recently systematically surpassed existing approaches to analyzing large-scale image datasets (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014). In this paper, we show how a ConvNet can be used to predict demographic information such as age and gender metadata from mobile phones."}, {"heading": "2 TEMPORAL REPRESENTATION", "text": "We focus on the use of the temporal information contained in the cell phone metadata. We present the data as 8 matrices summarizing the use of the cell phone in a given week with hours of day on the x-axis and days of the week on the y-axis (see Figure 1). These 8 matrices are combined into a tensor (less formal: a 3-dimensional matrix), with a separate \"channel\" for each of the 8 interesting variables. These 8 channels are the number of unique contacts, calls, texts and the total duration of calls for each incoming and outgoing interaction. We model each week separately. * Corresponding Author: yvesalexandre @ demontjoye.comar Xiv: 151 1.06 660v 4 [cs.L Ghttp: / / localhost: 8888 / 1 of 1 26-May-15 22.01"}, {"heading": "3 CONVNET ARCHITECTURE", "text": "Choosing the right ConvNet architecture for each task is critical to achieving high accuracy for the prediction task. We use a series of 5 horizontal convex layers followed by a vertical convex filter and 2 dense layers (see Table 1) to capture increasingly abstract patterns. ConvNet performs a prediction of the demographic attribute on each data week using the Softmax layer. Traditionally, these predictions are averaged to generate a single prediction for the user. We find that using ConvNet as a feature extractor with a supporting vector engine (SVM) to predict increases accuracy by 1 to 3 percentage points (see Table 2)."}, {"heading": "4 RESULTS", "text": "We demonstrate the effectiveness of our gender and age prediction method.
