NER often aids from added background knowledge in the form of gazetteers. However using such a collection does not deal with name variants and cannot resolve ambiguities associated in identifying the entities in context and associating them with predefined categories. We present a semi-supervised NER approach that starts with identifying named entities with a small set of training data. Using the identified named entities, the word and the context features are used to define the pattern. This pattern of each named entity category is used as a seed pattern to identify the named entities in the test set. Pattern scoring and tuple value score enables the generation of the new patterns to identify the named entity categories. We have evaluated the proposed system for English language with the dataset of tagged (IEER) and untagged (CoNLL 2003) named entity corpus and for Tamil language with the documents from the FIRE corpus and yield an average f-measure of 75% for both the languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 21 Nov 2015 04:11:44 GMT  (410kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06833v1", "13 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["s thenmalar", "j balaji", "t v geetha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06833"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.06833.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Semi-supervised Bootstrapping approach for Named Entity Recognition", "authors": ["S.

Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to play by the rules we have set ourselves in order to fulfil them."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "3. Bootstrapping process for Named Entity Recognition", "text": "Figure 1 shows the entire bootstrapping process for NER. the proposed approach starts with the small set of training examples. The training set is commented manually with the categories of the name identity. The commented training set is pre-processed by identifying the characteristics of the word. We use the context of the word to define the pattern. The patterns associated with each category of the named entity are identified and used as seed patterns. The test data is processed by matching the characteristics of the word with the pattern. When an exact match occurs, the named entity category is identified. To this end, we have identified and categorized named units that have exactly the same characteristics as the originally specified seed unit. However, we need to create new patterns by learning new contexts in which these named units may occur. To this end, the patterns are evaluated to identify named units that may also be used to identify new patterns."}, {"heading": "3.1 Feature set", "text": "A perceptron-based detection method for identifying designated units uses non-local dependencies and external information as features [31]. A supervised learning method with CRF for detecting NERs uses local knowledge traits, external knowledge traits, and non-local dependencies [38]. You have discussed that the system performs poorly when using the local knowledge trait when using the single token and showing the maximum observation of designated units when using the sliding window of 3 tokens. However, when looking at a three-window context, the ambiguity of the type of designated units occurs. The characteristics used also depend on the language. To address the above problem, we will go for a five-star context (wi-2, wi-1, wi + 1, wi + 2). The most commonly used characteristics for NERS systems were part of language elements, shallow parsing, and the gazetteers. Part of the language (POS feature) of this word feature is usually used with English KB, but this feature is not used in both cases."}, {"heading": "3.2 Seed pattern Generation", "text": "In fact, it is a matter of a way in which it is a matter of a way in which it is a matter of a way in which people are able to identify themselves and understand how they are able to identify themselves."}, {"heading": "3.3 Matching", "text": "For certain test data, we mark the words using the Stanford parser in the case of the English language and use a morphological analyzer [39] in the case of the Tamil language for the POS and morphological suffix markup. The root words are then used to obtain the corresponding semantic constraints from the UNL KB [40]. We check the match of the seed patterns with the commented sentences of the documents. Although the pattern consists of a five-word window (wi-2, wi-1, wi + 1, wi + 2), the actual exact match occurs only with the middle word wi of the pattern. If there is a match, the corresponding classes for the exactly matching patterns are labeled. Named units that are not treated by the exact match are processed by partial match. Partial match occurs after selecting the pattern to be changed during the iteration in the next cycle. Once a pattern is identified, the one that recognizes the punctuation type that contributes most to the respective tuple."}, {"heading": "3.4 Generation of new patterns", "text": "The first step in the new pattern generation is to find the most common pattern for each class of named entities specified by Pattern Score. The next step is to find alternative values for POS tags that can occur at position k in the context window of Pattern Pj, with all other tuple values remaining the same, by finding the tuple value of the POS tag with minimum score at position k, which is then considered formatting."}, {"heading": "3.4.1 Pattern Score", "text": "In this thesis we use the Basilisk algorithm to calculate the metric pattern scoring RlogF metric [32]. The extraction pattern is calculated using the following formula: (1) Where Fj is the number of identified named units according to pattern Pj corresponding to a certain type of named units, nj is the total number of identified patterns. The pattern score identifies the pattern for the specific type of named units that are selected to form the new pattern."}, {"heading": "3.4.2 Tuple value Score", "text": "The Tuple Scoring essentially depends on the tuple that corresponds to the POS tag of the words in the context window. Essentially, this scoring evaluates which value of the POS tag of which word in the context window of the specific pattern is strongly associated with a particular pattern. Let's consider a pattern Pj that corresponds to a certain type of named object. The pattern Passive with the named object has four words (wi-2, wi-1, wi + 1, wi + 2) in the 5-word context window and each of these words is associated with a POS value (posi-2, posi-1, posi + 1, posi + 2). The maximum score of the POS value indicates that this POS value contributes most to the Pj pattern in this position, where k = i-2, i-1, i + 1, i + 2 (2)."}, {"heading": "3.4.3 Methods for New Pattern Generation", "text": "The first method of the new pattern generation is to replace the POS pairing value in the corresponding position k. The POS tuple value with the minimum number of points at position k. The new pattern is created by replacing the tuple value of the original pattern with the new tuple value that occurs most frequently at position k in the test data. However, the next method of the new pattern generation is performed by moving the context window to the left or right of the Wi, depending on the frequency of occurrence of the POS pair of wi, wi + 1 or wi-1. Depending on a higher POS pair frequency, a new 5-word pattern is generated in which either wi-1 or w i + 1 becomes the new wi. This method of new pattern generation is possible because named entities are often associated with POS tags that frequently occur together."}, {"heading": "4. Evaluation", "text": "We have tested the performance of the system on IEER datasets tagged to obtain the development data for the NIST 1999 IE-ER evaluation. There were a total of 3174 designated units. We have taken two different seed patterns that occur for each designated entity class (MUC-7). Iterations are performed until the performance of the system is evaluated with precision, and f-meter metrics are defined."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "The method does not use a gazetteer, but instead uses POS information and word-based semantic constraints, giving an average f-measurement of 75% for both languages. Essentially, this ensures that the patterns are function-based and enable the marking of previously invisible named entities. This method can be further improved by taking more domain-specific corpora into account and trying to find domain-specific categories for named entities. Future work will include testing this method for other languages to examine how the methodology needs to be adapted. Pattern definition and chunking strategies are possible aspects that need to be modified."}], "references": [{"title": "Exploiting Feature Hierarchy for Transfer Learning in Named Entity", "author": ["Arnold", "R.A.

entities in unstructured documents, and to classify them into pre-defined semantic categories. NER often aids from added background knowledge in the form of gazetteers. However using such a collection does not deal with name variants and cannot resolve ambiguities associated in identifying the entities in context and associating them with predefined categories. We present a semi-supervised NER approach that starts with identifying named entities with a small set of training data. Using the identified named entities, the word and the context features are used to define the pattern. This pattern of each named entity category is used as a seed pattern to identify the named entities in the test set. Pattern scoring and tuple value score enables the generation of the new patterns to identify the named entity categories. We have evaluated the proposed system for English language with the dataset of tagged (IEER) and untagged (CoNLL 2003) named entity corpus and for Tamil language with the documents from the FIRE corpus and yield an average f-measure of 75% for both the languages.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
