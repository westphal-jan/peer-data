Introduction", "text": "As we have discussed in some recent papers [1,2], the analysis of social networks, which is widely used in several theoretical and applied sciences, is also currently important in the study of literary works. Indeed, network analysis can provide quantitative results in relation to persons, places and interactions by extracting them from the layout of plays and novels [3]. Several studies and projects for automatic analysis of texts exist. In Reference 3, for example, the authors propose an algorithm to derive the social network from an input text, based on some previously defined personal and geographical names. Social relationships are indicated by dialogues and places where characters are active. Another approach was proposed in Reference 4, based on the recognition of face-to-face conversations. By means of their algorithms, the researchers took a systematic and wide view of a large corpus of texts [4]. This is the research also proposed by the Stanford \"Literary Laboratory Analysis,\" we have proposed this is one of the 39 automated projects in the theory of Plot 6."}, {"heading": "2.

Discussion", "text": "The CHAracters and PLaces Interaction Network (CHAPLIN) software provides the basic descriptive statistics and correlations present in the play, with which we have the frequency of characters and the relative performance of their interactions; the entire process is automated, with the exception of the phase in which human intervention is required to select names; the results are easy-to-read diagrams showing networks in which characters are drawn as nodes and the narrative connections between them correspond to the edges; the meaning of each character and the strength of the links are represented by a score ranging from 0 to 1. Note that, in addition to signs and places, any other word in the text can be selected from the list of raw words extracted by the tool; for example, a word that is a leitmotif of the text can be considered just as we have done in [9] in an analysis of the Divine Comedy of Dante. Therefore, leitmotifs can be added as a node of the text that CHAPLIN can bring out of the literary text."}, {"heading": "5.
