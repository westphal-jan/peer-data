The robustness of our approach is evaluated on 785,826 bins of audio that span an extensive range of vehicle speeds, noises from the environment, road surface types, and pavement conditions including international roughness index (IRI) values from 25 in/mi to 1400 in/mi. The training and evaluation of the model are performed on different roads to minimize the impact of environmental and other external factors on the accuracy of the classification. We achieve an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 93.2% across all vehicle speeds including 0 mph. The classifier still works at 0 mph because the discriminating signal is present in the sound of other vehicles driving by. Removing audio segments at speeds below 2.9 mph from consideration improves the UAR to 100%. In the case when the vehicle speed is below 2.9 mph, we were able to discriminate between wet and dry road surfaces from ambient noises and achieve 74.5% UAR.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 Nov 2015 17:20:23 GMT  (1049kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07035v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 20:05:22 GMT  (2415kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07035v2", "Under review in IEEE Signal Processing Letters"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE cs.SD", "authors": ["irman abdi\\'c", "lex fridman", "erik marchi", "daniel e brown", "william angell", "bryan reimer", "bj\\\"orn schuller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.07035"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.07035.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Detecting Road Surface Wetness from Audio: A Deep Learning Approach", "authors": ["Irman Abdi\u0107", "Lex Fridman", "Erik Marchi", "Daniel E.

In addition, wet roads often increase traffic congestion and lead to infrastructure damage and disruptions in the supply chain [2]. However, from a driving safety perspective, detecting wetness during the post-occurrence period is critical whether the road is still wet. In these conditions, human assessment of road moisture and friction properties is less accurate than normal, especially in the form of reduced visibility overnight or in the presence of fog [3].

The amplification level of the microphone and its distance from the tire were kept the same throughout the data collection process, selecting three different routes for each route, one during the rain (or immediately after) and another time when the road surface was completely dry, as shown in Fig. 3. We offer spectrograms in Fig. 4 for wet and dry sections of the same route, highlighting the difference in frequency behavior. Duration and length of trips ranged from 14 minutes to 30 minutes, or 6.1 miles to 9.0 miles.

Features", "text": "Our goal was to model the entire spectrum along with the differences of the first order and then select a subset of characteristics that best distinguishes our classes. We extracted auditory spectral characteristics (ASF) [13], which were calculated by applying the short-term Fourier transformation (STFT) using a frame size of 30 ms and a frame step of 10 ms. Furthermore, each STFT power spectrogram was converted into the Mel frequency scale using 26 triangular filters obtained by the Mel spectrograms M30 (n, m). To do justice to human perception of loudness, a logarithmic representation was chosen: M30log (n, m) = protocol (M 30 (n, m) + 1.0). (1) In addition, the positive first order differences M30 (n, m) were calculated from a comparison of loudness (n, m)."}, {"heading": "C. Classifier", "text": "In this paper, we used a deep learning approach with initialized meshes - LSTM and bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) RNN architectures, which unlike other RNNN do not suffer from the problem of disappearing gradients [32]. BLSTM is an extension of the LSTM architecture, which allows additional forward speed when a predictive buffer can be used, which has proven itself in many applications [8]. In addition, we evaluated various parameters, such as the layout of LSTM and BLSTM hidden layers (54-54, 54-30-54, 156-256-156, 216-216-216-216-216 neurons in the three hidden layers) and learning rates (1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6).

CONCLUSION", "text": "We proposed an in-depth learning approach based on LSTM-RNNs for detecting road moisture using audio recordings of tire-surface interaction and distinguishing between wet and dry classes. This method proves to be robust in terms of vehicle speed, road type and road surface quality on a 785,826 record. It surpasses the most advanced SVMs and achieves outstanding performance in the task of detecting road moisture with a VAR of 93.2% for all vehicle speeds and the more challenging speeds below 2.9 km / h, including stationary vehicle mode.

The training and evaluation of the model are performed on different roads to minimize the impact of environmental and other external factors on the accuracy of the classification. We achieve an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 93.2 % across all vehicle speeds including 0 mph. The classifier still works at 0 mph because the discriminating signal is present in the sound of other vehicles driving by.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
