In order not to reduce the generalization of the approach, we assume that x measurement is a sum above j, y measurement is the basis Qk (x)."}, {"heading": "III. NUMERICAL ESTIMATION", "text": "The main problem of the Christoffel function calculation is the numerical instability. For given observations, all polynomial bases yield identical results, but the numerical stability of the calculations is drastically different, since the gram matrix condition number strongly depends on the base choice. IfQk (x) and Qm (y) are selected as orthogonal polynomials with orthogonal measurements, which then provide the x and y support for discrete measurements of the gram matrix values. [7] The numerical library we have developed, see [6] Appendix A, is able to directly manipulate polynomials in Chebyhev, Legendre, Laguerre and Hermite bases, which allows a stable basis for using and calculating the moments to a very high order, see Ref. [3] as an example. The distribution problem does not require hundreds of moments as in [3], which should be typically lower than 15 and idy respectively."}, {"heading": "IV. DISCUSSION", "text": "The main idea is to use the Christoffel function to present knowledge. Closed form answer (10) is available. The Christoffel function is used twice: first to build a distribution approximation with a \"pocket,\" then to model the distribution of these \"pockets.\" (10) The quadrature nodes give possible results and normalized quadrature weights. The method can be expanded from real values to discrete attributes (the dx and dy should be adjusted properly).The approach proposed in this paper, like most multiple instance learning approaches, has two stages."}], "references": [{"title": "Review of multi-instance learning and its applications", "author": ["Jun Yang"], "venue": "Tech.
