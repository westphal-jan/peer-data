A continuous transportation task is one in which a multi-agent team visits a number of fixed locations, picks up objects, and delivers them to a final destination. The goal is to maximize the rate of transportation while the objects are replenished over time. Examples of problems that need continuous transportation are foraging, area sweeping, and first/last mile problem. Previous approaches typically neglect the interference and are highly dependent on communications among agents. Some also incorporate an additional reconnaissance agent to gather information. In this paper, we present a hybrid of centralized and distributed approaches that minimize the interference and communications in the multi-agent team without the need for a reconnaissance agent. We contribute two partitioning-transportation algorithms inspired by existing algorithms, and contribute one novel online partitioning-transportation algorithm with information gathering in the multi-agent team. Our algorithms have been implemented and tested extensively in the simulation. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms that outperform the existing algorithms, even without any communications between the agents and without the presence of a reconnaissance agent.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 13:04:47 GMT  (190kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07209v1", "Submitted to AAMAS2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 28 Jul 2016 09:11:40 GMT  (74kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07209v2", "2 pages, published in the proceedings of the 15th AAMAS conference"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to AAMAS2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["chao wang", "somchaya liemhetcharat", "kian hsiang low"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.07209"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.07209.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Multi-Agent Continuous Transportation with Online Balanced Partitioning (Extended Abstract)", "authors": ["Chao Wang", "Somchaya Liemhetcharat", "Kian Hsiang Low"], "emails": ["lowkh}@comp.nus.edu.sg,", "liemhet-s@i2r.a-star.edu.sg"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: multi-agent system; partitioning; transport; cooperation"}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "The objects fill up with time and we consider the Poisson model to be a replenishment of objects. The Poisson model is suitable for scenarios with independently occurring objects, such as passengers appearing at transit stops. Similar work has been done in the field of multi-robot search and delivery. [2, 3] A multi-robot team plunders resources from the environment to a residence or delivers items to places on request, while the resources are replenished over time. The goal of continuous foraging is to maximize the rate of resource exploitation and delivery.

PROBLEM AND APPROACH", "text": "In this section, we define in detail the problem of continuous transport with multiple agents and give an overview of our approach. In a continuous transport task, a multi-agent team visits a number of fixed locations and transports objects to a transport node."}, {"heading": "2.1 Formal Problem Definition", "text": "The problem of continuous transport with several agents can be defined as follows: \u2022 A = {a1,..., ak} is the set of transport agents, e.g. autonomous vehicles. \u2022 si, ci, and yi (\u2264 ci) denote the speed, maximum capacity, and current load of the agent ai, i.e. the number of objects transported. \u2022 L = {l1,..., ln} denotes the number of places where l0 is the traffic junction. \u2022 vj, t denotes the number of objects available at the location lj at the time of transport, i.e. the number of passengers appears at the transit stop lj. \u2022 v (i) j, t denotes the estimate of vj, t at the time of transport step. \u2022 oj denotes observation at the location lj. If the transport agent ai arrives at a location lj (j > 0), min (vj, ci \u2212 yi) is the destination of transport lj."}, {"heading": "2.2 Our Approach", "text": "Our approach to solving the problem of continuous transport is: \u2022 We assume that vj, t follows a known model - in this work, we assume that vj, t follows the Poisson model, in which the number of objects replenished at each step follows a Poisson distribution of medium size. However, the parameters of the models (i.e., \u03bbj) are not known in advance; \u2022 Estimates v (i) j, t are updated based on the model and observations of transport agents visiting the site lj; \u2022 In the following [2], transport agents do not share their models v (i) j, as it may be expensive depending on the communication bandwidth and team size. Unlike [2] in our approach, the distribution of destination and cargo among agents is not necessary. We contribute an online algorithm that divides the locations based on their 2D position and estimated replenishment rate, and the transport agents who use v (j) dynamically plan their next location within the cluster."}, {"heading": "3. ALGORITHM AND EVALUATION", "text": "Our Online Balanced Partitioning (OBP) algorithms start with the static division of locations into clusters based on 2D locations with the algorithm. The algorithm is inspired by algorithms that are proposed for continuous search [2]. The main difference is that agents are assigned targets in the cluster rather than covering all locations. Rescheduling the target within each cluster is based on Greedy Rate [3], i.e. maximizing transport rates. Communication of destinations and loads is not required. By taking into account the 2D location of locations, the workload of each agent could not be balanced, i.e. the total replenishment rate of some clusters could be so high that agents cannot afford it."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the NUS Computer Center through the use of its high-performance computers."}], "references": [{"title": "A multi-robot system for continuous area sweeping tasks", "author": ["M.
