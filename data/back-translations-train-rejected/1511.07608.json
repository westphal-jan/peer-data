The goal of the prototype is to be as autonomous as possible and it both calibrates itself and improves its picking with minimal human intervention. The system learns to pick objects better based on a feedback sensor in its gripper and uses machine learning to choosing the best proposal from a random sample produced by simple hard-coded geometric models. We show experimentally the system improving its picking autonomously by measuring the pick success rate as function of time. We also show how this system can pick a conveyor belt clean, depositing 70 out of 80 objects in a difficult to manipulate pile of novel objects into the correct chute. We discuss potential improvements and next steps in this direction.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 08:35:49 GMT  (2318kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07608v1", "6 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["janne v kujala", "tuomas j lukka", "harri holopainen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.07608"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.07608.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Picking a Conveyor Clean by an Autonomously Learning Robot", "authors": ["Janne V.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM", "text": "In this section we describe our prototype system in detail."}, {"heading": "A. Hardware", "text": "The hardware of our system consists of a waste carousel (Fig. 1), a 3D camera (Asus Xtion) and a portal robot (a prototype version of our product model).The portal robot has a wide-opening gripper and a wide-angle compliance system (Fig. 2).The gripper has evolved step by step in previous versions of our product to morphologically adapt well to the task at hand. The gripper is position-controllable and has a sensor that indicates its current aperture. In addition to the gripper opening, the robot has four degrees of freedom, the (x, y, z) coordinate sensor Xiv: 151 1.07 608v 1 [cs.R O] 24 Nov 201 5and rotation around the vertical axis (i.e. the gripper always points downwards)."}, {"heading": "B.

EXPERIMENTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Autonomously learning to pick", "text": "In this experiment, the conveyor belt under the system was released for calibration, calibration was carried out and the conveyor belt started at a slow constant speed. If objects came under the robot, the picking software was started. The system started picking only with the hard coded model of the first stage. After each 100 pick attempts, the system trained the second stage model from the beginning using data from all pick attempts and started using the newly trained model on subsequent picks. For technical reasons related to data acquisition, the system was briefly stopped every 15 minutes.The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 7a. The same experiment was repeated every 10 seconds. The results are shown in Fig. These results indicate that the immediate feedback from the verification allows autonomous learning that can go very quickly."}, {"heading": "B. Picking the conveyor clean", "text": "In this experiment, the conveyor belt was released under the system for calibration, calibration was performed, and after moving the conveyor until there were objects in the work area, the picking software was started. Subsequently, the belt movement was controlled manually, covering short distances in a row so that the robot could clean the conveyor belt. The system started picking only with the first-stage hard-coded model, and the second-stage model was trained on data from all the picking attempts from the beginning every 10 seconds. Picking performance improved during the experiment as in the other experiments. Although slightly more picking attempts will fail than on a constantly moving conveyor belt, the system will repeat picking all objects remaining on the work area until it is successful. An accompanying video shows how, after some training, the system releases a large stack from the conveyor belt (Fig. 8)."}, {"heading": "IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We have shown that it is not possible to accomplish this task with a single camera. However, it is easy to go several ways to improve the performance of the system."}, {"heading": "V.
