Note that we assume that agents act sincerely. While strategic behavior can be beneficial, risk-averse agents tend to choose sincerely, especially if politics and / or utilities are private information. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to consider future work as agents acting strategically (Kalinowski et al. 2013).POSSIBLE / NECESSARY UTILITARIAN / EGALITARIAN WELFARE INput: a set of n items, m agents trading with utilities, a class of policies, and an integral.

All the chairman has to do is choose a policy that gives the agents elements they value most. Theorem 1. The MAXIMUM and POSSIBLE UTILITARIAN WELFARE problems are polynomially solvable. Proof: We order the elements according to the maximum utility assigned by each agent. Ties can be broken in any way. We then construct the policy that allocates elements in that order by selecting the agent that gives an element the larger utility. No assignment can be better than this. MINIMUM EGALITARIAN WELFARE problems are also when they take polynomial time to solve. On the other hand, the POSSIBLE EGALITARIAN WELFARE problems that are generally unsustainable, even in the specific case, all the WORLDWARE problems are identical."}, {"heading": "Balanced policies", "text": "It may be that a policy in which one agent has much more to do than another takes unfair measures in order to maximise costs and increase efficiency, and that it is a policy based on the needs of people who do not play by the rules, but by the rules they have imposed on themselves.

We construct a graph between agents and products with edges for all products that have a benefit greater or equal to the desired egalitarian prosperity. The POSSIBLE EGALITARY SUPPPORT problem is solvable if we can find a perfect match in this graph. In order to construct a satisfactory policy, we find from this match a Pareto-efficient allocation using the top trading cycle algorithm (Shapley and Scarf 1974). A policy can be constructed that achieves this Pareto-efficient allocation by means of Proposition 1 in (Brams and King 2005). This traceability of this case points to an interesting obvious problem. We have proven that the POSSIBILITARY problem is taking place between the POSSIBILITARY SUPORT, but this is a POSSIBILITY problem."}, {"heading": "Other related work", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have set themselves in order to play by the rules."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Our results are summarized in Table 1.
