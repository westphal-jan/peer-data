It is beneficial to many natural language processing tasks, such as Information Retrieval (IR) and document summarisation. Current approaches to text segmentation are similar in that they all use word-frequency metrics to measure the similarity between two regions of text, so that a document is segmented based on the lexical cohesion between its words. Various NLP tasks are now moving towards the semantic web and ontologies, such as ontology-based IR systems, to capture the conceptualizations associated with user needs and contents. Text segmentation based on lexical cohesion between words is hence not sufficient anymore for such tasks. This paper proposes OntoSeg, a novel approach to text segmentation based on the ontological similarity between text blocks. The proposed method uses ontological similarity to explore conceptual relations between text segments and a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm to represent the text as a tree-like hierarchy that is conceptually structured. The rich structure of the created tree further allows the segmentation of text in a linear fashion at various levels of granularity. The proposed method was evaluated on a wellknown dataset, and the results show that using ontological similarity in text segmentation is very promising. Also we enhance the proposed method by combining ontological similarity with lexical similarity and the results show an enhancement of the segmentation quality.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 15:10:18 GMT  (1166kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08411v1", "10 pages, IEEE ICDMW 2015 (SENTIRE Workshop)"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, IEEE ICDMW 2015 (SENTIRE Workshop)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mostafa bayomi", "killian levacher", "m rami ghorab", "s\\'eamus lawless"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.08411"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.08411.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "OntoSeg: a Novel Approach to Text Segmentation using Ontological Similarity", "authors": ["Mostafa Bayomi", "Killian Levacher", "M.Rami Ghorab", "S\u00e9amus Lawless"], "emails": ["seamus.lawless}@scss.tcd.ie"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year it is so far that it will be able to use the mentionlcihsrcnlrVo rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rtef\u00fc the rtef\u00fc the rtef\u00fc the rtef\u00fc the rtef\u00fc the rtef\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rtef\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the rf\u00fc the"}, {"heading": "A. Content-based and Discourse-based", "text": "Content-based approaches focus on the content of the story and solve the segmentation problem by relying on a measure of the difference in word usage on the two sides of a potential boundary: the larger the difference, the more indirect a boundary is. A well-known content-based approach is TextTiling by Hearst [8]. TextTiling is a content-based text segmentation algorithm that uses a sliding window approach to segment a text. It is calculated using two vectors that contain the number of occurring terms in each block. Similarities between adjacent blocks within the text are calculated to detect theme changes. The calculated similarities are smoothed out and used to identify topic boundaries through an intersection function.On the other hand, the discourse-based techniques focus on the structure or discourse of the story. These approaches use prosodic features such as pauses as well as lexical features such as the presence of the cue boundary appear in the semantics of the particular cue."}, {"heading": "B. Supervised and Unsupervised.", "text": "A monitored text segmentation approach called divSeg was introduced by Song et al. [18], in which they use an iterative approach that splits text between two adjacent parts at its weakest point in terms of lexical connectivity strength. Once they find the weakest point in the text, their approach creates a deep and narrow binary tree. Subsequently, the tree is divided into a broad and flat hierarchy by supervised learning of a document set or explicitly entering how a text should be segmented. Hsueh et al. [19] described a supervised hierarchical topic segmentation approach that forms separate classifiers for topic and subtopic segmentation. Eisenstein and Barzilay [14], on the other hand, suggested a Bayesian approach to unattended topic segmentation, showing that lexical cohesion between text segments can be placed in a Bayesian context by treating the words as linear in each segment of text modules [20 and 8]."}, {"heading": "C. Linear and Hierarchical", "text": "If we look at text segmentation from the perspective of text representation, we can divide it into linear and hierarchical approaches. Linear text segmentation deals with the sequential analysis of topical changes where segments are not overlapping and sequential. It has been argued that this sequence model is sufficient for many purposes [8]. An early linear text segmentation algorithm was the TextTiling approach introduced by Hearst [10] in 1997. Galley et al. [21] proposed LcSeg, a TextTiling-based algorithm that uses tf-idf term weights to improve text segmentation results. Another well-known linear text segmentation algorithm is C99, introduced by Choi [20].

In the ontology structure, the is-a relationships group the classes according to how they are conceptually related to each other. Given a pair of two classes, c1 and c2, a well-known method with intuitive explicitness to assess their similarity is to calculate the distance between these classes in an ontology hierarchy; the shorter the distance, the higher the similarity. In the case that multiple paths exist between the nodes, the shortest distance of all paths is used. Several measures have been developed to measure the similarity between two concepts in a taxonomy."}, {"heading": "2) Lexical similarity:", "text": "Lexical similarity is widely used in the literature in text segmentation [8], [20] and, as its name suggests, it splits text into lexically coherent segments. Lexical cohesion refers to the connection between two parts of text in terms of word relationships. Although blocks of text may have ontological similarities with each other, ontological similarity alone may not be sufficient to measure how blocks of text are coherent with each other, for the following reasons: 1 - Text blocks may not contain any entities.2 - The entity extraction algorithm may not detect some entities in the text block.3- Entities extracted from a block of text may not be sufficient to reflect the similarity between blocks of text. 4- The ontology used may not cover all text notations.

(Figure 3 represents a tree representation of an example text of 10 sentences. The advantage of this tree is that it represents different levels of granularity of the document, which in turn means that the document can be divided into different levels of segmentation, which is a strong criterion in the hierarchical representation of the text. In contrast to linear representation, which is achieved in each level of the structure (tree) segmentation with different levels of detail and can usefully be applied to many other tasks. To convert a hierarchical representation into a linear representation of the text corresponding to the number of required segments, it defines and contains the corresponding number of nodes in the tree.

reflect the subtopic structure of the text. It is beneficial to many natural language processing tasks, such as Information Retrieval (IR) and document summarisation. Current approaches to text segmentation are similar in that they all use word-frequency metrics to measure the similarity between two regions of text, so that a document is segmented based on the lexical cohesion between its words. Various NLP tasks are now moving towards the semantic web and ontologies, such as ontology-based IR systems, to capture the conceptualizations associated with user needs and contents. Text segmentation based on lexical cohesion between words is hence not sufficient anymore for such tasks. This paper proposes OntoSeg, a novel approach to text segmentation based on the ontological similarity between text blocks. The proposed method uses ontological similarity to explore conceptual relations between text segments and a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm to represent the text as a tree-like hierarchy that is conceptually structured. The rich structure of the created tree further allows the segmentation of text in a linear fashion at various levels of granularity. The proposed method was evaluated on a wellknown dataset, and the results show that using ontological similarity in text segmentation is very promising. Also we enhance the proposed method by combining ontological similarity with lexical similarity and the results show an enhancement of the segmentation quality.
