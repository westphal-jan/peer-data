DL-Lite_R, the current language of choice for OBDA, has been designed with the goal of delegating query answering to the underlying database engine, and thus is restricted in expressive power. E.g., it does not allow one to express disjunctive information, and any form of recursion on the data. The aim of this paper is to overcome these limitations of DL-Lite_R, and extend OBDA to more expressive ontology languages, while still leveraging the underlying relational technology for query answering. We achieve this by relying on two well-known mechanisms, namely conservative rewriting and approximation, but significantly extend their practical impact by bringing into the picture the mapping, an essential component of OBDA. Specifically, we develop techniques to rewrite OBDA specifications with an expressive ontology to \"equivalent\" ones with a DL-Lite_R ontology, if possible, and to approximate them otherwise. We do so by exploiting the high expressive power of the mapping layer to capture part of the domain semantics of rich ontology languages. We have implemented our techniques making use of a state-of-the-art OBDA system, and we have shown their feasibility and effectiveness with experiments on synthetic and real-world data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 15:12:20 GMT  (54kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08412v1", "The extended version of the AAAI 2016 paper \"Beyond OWL 2 QL in OBDA: Rewritings and Approximations\" by Elena Botoeva, Diego Calvanese, Valerio Santarelli, Domenico Fabio Savo, Alessandro Solimando,and Guohui Xiao"], ["v2", "Tue, 1 Dec 2015 18:26:09 GMT  (51kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08412v2", "The extended version of the AAAI 2016 paper \"Beyond OWL 2 QL in OBDA: Rewritings and Approximations\" by Elena Botoeva, Diego Calvanese, Valerio Santarelli, Domenico Fabio Savo, Alessandro Solimando,and Guohui Xiao"]], "COMMENTS": "The extended version of the AAAI 2016 paper \"Beyond OWL 2 QL in OBDA: Rewritings and Approximations\" by Elena Botoeva, Diego Calvanese, Valerio Santarelli, Domenico Fabio Savo, Alessandro Solimando,and Guohui Xiao", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["elena botoeva", "diego calvanese", "valerio santarelli", "domenico fabio savo", "alessandro solimando", "guohui xiao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.08412"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.08412.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["lastname@inf.unibz.it", "lastname@dis.uniroma1.it", "alessandro.solimando@unige.it"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 151 1,08 412v 1 [cs.A I] 2 6N ov2 01"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Ontology based on data access (OBDA) is a popular paradigm that allows end-users to access data sources through an ontology that abstracts the details of the data sources themselves. Ontology provides a high-level description of the area of interest and is semantically linked to the data sources through a series of mapping assertions (Calvanese et al. 2009; Giese et al. 2015). Typically, data sources are presented as relational data, ontology is constituted by a series of logical axioms about concepts and roles, and each mapping assertion refers to an SQL query through the database to a concept or role of ontology. As an example, we consider a bank domain in which we can specify that a verification account in a person's name is a simple account that is cist by means of the axiom (expressed in the description of logical notation) accounts."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "We give some basic ideas about ontologies and OBDA."}, {"heading": "2.1 Ontologies", "text": "We present some preliminary ontology terms.
