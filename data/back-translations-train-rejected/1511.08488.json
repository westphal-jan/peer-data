We are in contact with different skills and assessments almost daily. The computerized form of the exam also receives increased attention with the increasing prevalence of computers, smartphones and other devices that allow an easy impact on the target audience. In this work, we focus on computer-assisted adaptive testing (CAT) (van der Linden and Glas, 2000; Almond and Mislevy, 1999).CAT aims to create shorter tests and therefore takes less time without sacrificing their reliability. This type of test is computer-controlled and has an accompanying model that models a student (a student model).This model is based on samples from previous students. During the exam, the model is updated to reflect the skills of a particular student who is in the exam process. At the same time, we use the model to adjust the next questions that need to be asked."}, {"heading": "2 DATA COLLECTION", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move to another world, in which they are able to live, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they are able, in which they live, in the world in which they live, in the world in which they live, in the world in which they live, in which they live, in the world in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they"}, {"heading": "42.76 46.68 46.35 43.65 44.53", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3 BAYESIAN NETWORK MODELS", "text": "In this section, we discuss various Bayesian network models that we use to model the relationships between students \"mathematical abilities and results in solving mathematical problems.All the models discussed in this essay consist of the following: \u2022 A set of n variables that we want to estimate {S1,..., Sn}. We will call them skills or skill variables. We will use the symbol S to denote the multivariable (S1,..., Sn) that records the states s = (s1,... sn). \u2022 A set of m questions (mathematical problems) {X1,.., Xm}. We will use the symbol X to denote the multivariable (X1,.., Xm) that assumes the states x = (x1,.., xm). \u2022 A set of arcs between variables that define the relationships between skills and questions, and ultimately also between skills and between questions. The ultimate goal is to estimate the values of the abilities, i.e. the probabilities of S1."}, {"heading": "3.1 QUESTIONS", "text": "Although the numerical scale contains more information and therefore seems to be a better alternative, there are other aspects that discourage such a choice. The main problem is model learning. The more states, the higher the number of model parameters to be learned. In case of limited training data, it can be difficult to estimate the model parameters reliably. We consider two alternatives in our models. Variables that correspond to the problem solutions (questions) can either be \u2022 boolean, i.e. they have two states only 0 and 1 or \u2022 integer, i.e. each Xi takes mi states {1,..., mi}, mi \u0441N, where mi is the maximum number of points for the corresponding mathematical problem. In section 5 we present results of experiments with both options."}, {"heading": "3.2 SKILL NODES", "text": "We assume that the answers of the students can be explained by competence nodes that are the parents of questions. Competence nodes model the abilities of the students and are generally not directly observable. Several decisions have to be made during the creation of the model. The first decision is the number of competence nodes themselves. Should we expect a common skill or should it rather be several different skills that are each related to only a subset of questions? In the later case it is necessary to determine which skills are required to solve each individual question (i.e. a mathematical problem). Skills that are required for the successful solution of a question become parents of the question under consideration. Most networks proposed in this paper have only one competence node. This node is connected to all questions. Thus, the student is modeled by a single variable. Normally, it is not possible to give a precise interpretation of these variables. We have created two models with more than one skill node. One of them is connected to the olean scale of question nodes and the other is the one with the other."}, {"heading": "3.3 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION", "text": "As mentioned above, we have collected not only solutions to problems, but also additional personal information about students. This additional information can improve the quality of the student model, on the other hand, it makes the model more complex (more parameters need to be estimated), it can mislead thinking based solely on questions (especially later, when sufficient information about a student is gathered from his answers), the additional variables are Y1,..., Y 'and they assume the states y1,..., y'. We have tested both versions of most models, i.e. models with or without the additional information."}, {"heading": "3.4 PROPOSED MODELS", "text": "In total, we have created 14 different models that differ in the factors discussed above. Combinations of the parameter settings are shown in Table 3. One model type is shown in Figure 1. \"tf plus\" is a network with a hidden skill node and the additional information3. Models that differ only in the number of variable states have the same structure. Models with the \"obs\" infix in the name and \"o\" in the ID have modified the skill variable to represent score groups and not skills (as explained in Part 3.2 above). Models without additional information do not contain the part of the variable on the right side of the skill variable S1. Figure 2 shows the structure of the expert models with 7 skill variables in the middle part of the figure."}, {"heading": "4 ADAPTIVE TESTS", "text": "In this section, we describe the process of adaptive testing using these models. First, we select the model we want to use. If this model contains additional information variables, it is necessary to insert observed states of these variables before we start selecting them and asking questions. Next, the following steps are repeated: \u2022 The next question to be asked is selected. \u2022 The question is asked and a result is obtained. \u2022 The result is inserted into the network as evidence. 3Please note that the missing problems and problem numbers are due to bi-cyclical testing and troubleshooting. \u2022 The network is updated with this evidence. \u2022 (Optional) The following answers are estimated. This procedure is repeated as long as necessary. It means until we reach a termination criterion that can be either a time restriction, the number of questions or a confidence interval of the estimated variables. Each of these criteria would lead to a different learning strategy (Vomlel, 2004b), but we would have such a hypocrisy-based strategy (Hard)."}, {"heading": "4.1 SELECTING NEXT QUESTION", "text": "A task to be solved during the procedure is the selection of the next question. It is repeated in each step of the test and is described below. Let the test take place in the state after s \u2212 1 steps, from which Xs = \u00b2 \u00b2 \u00b2 skill proceeds,.. Xin | i1,.., where skills are estimated, are unobserved (unanswered) variables ande = {Xk1 = xk1,., Xko = \u00b2 skill,.., ko \u00b2 skill,.., m \u00b2 skill are evidence of observed variables - questions that have already been answered and possibly the initial information. The aim is to select a variable from Xs to be asked as the next question. We select a question with the greatest expected information. We calculate the cumulative Shannon entropy of all variables of skills given to us. It is given by the following formula: H (e) x x."}, {"heading": "4.2 INSERTION OF THE SELECTED QUESTION", "text": "This answer changes the state of the variable X * from unobserved to an observed state x *. Next, the question together with its answer is inserted into the vector of proofs e. We update the probability distributions P (Si | e) of the skill variables with the updated proofs e. We also recalculate the value of entropy H (e). Question X * is also removed from Xs, which form a set of unobserved variables Xs + 1 for the next step, and the selection process can be repeated."}, {"heading": "4.3 ESTIMATING SUBSEQUENT ANSWERS", "text": "In experiments presented in the next section, we will use individual models to estimate answers to all subsequent questions in Xs + 1. This is easy because we enter evidence e and draw conclusions to calculate P (X \u2032 = x \u2032 | e) for all states of X \u2032 Xs + 1 by invoking the distribution and proof procedures in the BN model."}, {"heading": "5 MODEL EVALUATION", "text": "In this section, we report on the results of the tests carried out with the networks proposed in Section 3 of this thesis. The exam was carried out by 10-fold cross-validation. For each model we used as a test system, we used the same approaches as the tests of 10 times a year. The exam was carried out roughly in the manner in which the tests are carried out. The remaining information was used as a test set. This procedure was repeated to obtain 10 networks for each model. The exam was as described in Section 4. For each model and for each student, we simulated a test run. The collected initial evidence and answers were inserted into the model. During the exam, we collected responses from the current students to evidence we provided probability distributions P (Xi e) for all unobserved questions."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "In this paper, we introduced several Bayesian network models designed for adaptive testing and evaluated their performance using data from tests conducted at high schools. In the experiments, we observed the following: \u2022 Larger state space of competence variables is beneficial. Models with 3 states of the hidden competence variable clearly perform better in the key phases of the tests. \u2022 Tests with hidden variables with more than 3 states are still pending. \u2022 Expert models did not perform as well as simpler models, but showed potential for improvement. The proposed expert model is much more complex than other models in this paper and is likely to improve its performance with more collected data. \u2022 Additional information improves results only in the initial phase. This fact is positive, because it can be difficult in practice to obtain such additional information. Furthermore, it can be considered politically incorrect to make assumptions about the abilities of students who use this type of information. In the future, we plan to try to examine models with one or two hidden state models with more than three expert states, and more than three expert states."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The work on this paper was supported by the GACR project no. 13-20012S."}], "references": [{"title": "Graphical Models and Computerized Adaptive Testing", "author": ["R.G.
