Dealing with an enormous amount of knowledge and selective retrieval scenarios, according to different human needs, is an important aspect."}, {"heading": "1.1 The Knowledge Problem", "text": "As already mentioned, current artificial cognitive systems and cognitive architectures are not equipped with knowledge bases comparable to the conceptual knowledge that humans possess and use in everyday life. In epistemological terms, this deficiency poses a problem: in fact, equipping cognitive actors with more \"realistic\" knowledge bases, both in terms of size and type of encoded information, would at least in principle allow the various artificial systems to be tested in situations more similar to those of humans in real life. This problem becomes more relevant if we take cognitive architectures into account (Newell, 1990). While \"cognitive inspired systems\" could indeed be designed to deal only with domain-specific information (e.g., think of a computer simulator of a poker player), cognitive NeaScience - article preprint, in the Proceedings of AISC 2015, 12th Italian Conference on Cognitive Science, Genoa, Italy."}, {"heading": "1.2 The \u201cKnowledge Limit\u201d of Cognitive Architectures", "text": "The design and adaptation of cognitive architectures is a broad and active area of research in cognitive science, artificial intelligence and, more recently, computational neuroscience.
