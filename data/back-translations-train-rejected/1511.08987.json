ANALYSIS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. The Stock Exchange", "text": "The stock exchange is a place where buyers and sellers come together to trade shares. A stock exchange index measures the value of part of the stock market. The SET100 is the primary index of the Thai stock exchange (SET). It shows the prices of the 100 largest companies in the SET, ordered by market capitalization and liquidity. It can be calculated according to the following formula (PHAISARN, Sutheebanjard and Wichian, Premchaiswadi, 2010): SET 100 = current market value \u00d7 100Underlying value"}, {"heading": "B. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)", "text": "The EMH was developed by Fama in 1970 (FAMA, Eugene F, 1970). It states that the price of a security reflects the complete market information. If there is a change in the financial outlook, the market is completely efficient and will therefore immediately adjust the security price to reflect this new information. EMH is controversial and often controversial; its supporters claim that attempts to predict the share price by technical or fundamental analysis are futile, as the market immediately reflects all newly discovered information, and therefore there can be no abnormal gain. Nevertheless, there are three different forms of EMH: the weak EMH claims that only historical information is embedded in the share price; the semi-strong form claims that the price represents all historical information and all available public information, while the strong EMH suggests that the current share price represents all available historical, public and private inside information. Fama itself has deemed the strong EMH invalid."}, {"heading": "C. Random walk theory", "text": "In the context of a stock market, this theory assumes that the short-term direction of the share price cannot be predicted. Therefore, investment services, earnings forecasts and complicated chart patterns are anything but a joke. Future share prices take a completely random, unpredictable path. In this theory, technical and fundamental analysis are considered weak attempts to beat the market. Kendall and Hill first proposed this theory in 1953 and shocked many economists (KENDALL, Maurice George and Hill, Bradford A., 1953). However, after further debate and research, the formal market of the random run theory has been averted. Random run theory and EMH are compatible; the market can move in unpredictable directions while it is efficient. Both theories suggest that an abnormal gain from predicting the share price cannot be achieved."}, {"heading": "D. Fundamental Analysis", "text": "Fundamental analysis looks at the numerical indicators that describe the company underlying the stock, such as the P / E (MCCLURE, Ben, 2014). An analyst looks at the fundamentals of a company to determine whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued and then bought or sold."}, {"heading": "E. Technical Analysis", "text": "Technical analysts or \"chartists\" do not concern themselves with the fundamentals of the company. Technical analyses aim to derive patterns and trends from past prices in order to predict future prices (a form of time series analysis) (INTERACTIVE DATA CORP, 2014). Historical data is tested against specific buying and selling rules to assess whether or not the same strategy can make a profit in the future. Technical analyses are based on the assumption that the pattern derived from historical data is applicable to future data."}, {"heading": "F. The naive Bayes classifier", "text": "Bayesian classifiers are statistical classifiers that can predict the probability of class membership, i.e. the probability that a particular sample belongs to a specific class is high. (...) Bayesian classifiers are a single sample that represents a conditional independence between attributes. (...) This assumption exists only to simplify the n attributes of x and is therefore \"naive\" (STUART, Russell J. and Norvig, Peter, 2009).Suppose X is a single sample that is represented by a one-dimensional vector. (...) In Bayesian statistics, X is referred to as \"proof\" that X is a hypothesis that X belongs to any class C. In classification, we want to find the probability of P (H | X) - the probability that X belongs to class C."}, {"heading": "G. Laplace Smoothing", "text": "In the case that Ak is categorical and xk does not fit within the boundaries of a category of Ak, so that P (xk | Ci) = 0 then P (X | Ci) = 0, because it is recalled that P (X | Ci) is calculated by P (P (n k = 1)). To avoid this error, therefore, the laplac correction can be used to deal with zero probability values (PRABHAKAR, Raghavan et al., 2008). With the laplac estimator, we assume that there is a sample X that contains the attribute xk, which has the attribute Ak of X. If xk does not fit within the boundaries of a category, then we use P (xk | Ci) = 0 instead of the probability to estimate the probability of P (xk | Ci). P () = 1freq (in)"}, {"heading": "H. Support Vector Machines", "text": "Supported vector machines (SVM) are another tool used in supervised machine learning to classify a sample X into a class = C. SVMs work by deriving a linear decision boundary that can represent a nonlinear class boundary by a non-linear mapping of input vectors xk into a higher dimensional trait space. The linear model is constructed in the higher dimensional trait space to represent a nonlinear decision boundary (WESTON, Jason, 2004). Left: Non-linear decision boundary in 2 dimensions Right: Linear decision boundary in 3 dimensions In the new space, a maximum margin hyper-level is derived from training data. This maximum margin hyper level provides maximum separation between two classes. This hyperlinear decision boundary is derived from the examples that are closest to you x x x, x x x, all other examples are considered irrelevant in the definition of the decision boundary in 3 dimensions. For the hyper level, this hyper level provides maximum separation between two classes. (WESTON, Jason, 2004). This hyperlinear decision boundary is derived from the examples of xk in 2 dimensions xk x, x x, x x, x x, x x, x, x x, x x, x x, x x, x x, x x x, x x x, x, x x x x x x, xlinear decision boundary in 3 dimensions, x hyper level, xperformers, xperformers, xperformers, xper level, xperformers, 4, xper level provides maximum margin hyper separation between two classes. This hyper level provides maximum separation between two classes."}, {"heading": "I. Advantages and Disadvantages of the naive Bayes classifier and SVM", "text": "The naive Bayes classifier is easy to implement because we can easily make probability estimates using the formulas detailed in section 2.4. Studies have shown that the naive Bayes can make good parameter estimates with small sets of data (UDDIN, Ashraf et al., 2012). However, the main disadvantage of this classifier is its naive assumption of conditional independence. In practice, there are dependencies between variables, especially in a complicated system such as the stock market. These dependencies are ignored by the naive Bayes classifier, which would result in less accurate predictions (ESMAEL, Bilal, 2013). The maximum margin decision limit used by the SVM is based on a unique principle of structural risk minimization, whereby the decision limit is achieved by minimizing the upper limit of the generalization error."}, {"heading": "III. EXPERIMENT", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Hypothesis", "text": "Based on the theory discussed above, I believe that a support vector engine provides better predictions of the direction of the stock market than a na\u00efve Bayes classifier. SVM's ability to model non-linear decision boundaries using a linear model will be beneficial, as the stock market is definitely a complicated non-linear process. Naive assumption of conditional independence, which is central to the na\u00efve Bayes classifier, will have a detrimental effect on its performance. Due to the interconnectedness of the stock market, it is unlikely that a change in one factor will be entirely independent of a change in another factor in real life."}, {"heading": "B.

COMEX Gold Futures (GOLD) These variables were selected from previous studies of factors influencing market direction (SUTHEEBANJARD, Phaisarn and Premchaiswadi, Wichian, 2009). External factors such as the index were selected to reflect market sentiment, whereas internal factors such as the SET index itself were intended to inform the classifier of the internal market situation. Firstly, the data of the input variables for the period from 1 January 2010 to 1 February 2010 are extracted by MarketWatch.com (see Annex A on page 18 for the program code used to extract the data). Secondly, the data is processed and the percentage change between individual days is fundamental. Thirdly, the market is classified on page A (see Annex 18)."}, {"heading": "IV.

Evaluation", "text": "During the experiment, a limited amount of data was selected to train these models, and a larger training dataset will produce several models that may be better. A 10-fold cross-validation was chosen as the test method, which helps to analyze the extent of overmatch, but the model is still ultimately tested on its own training data. A completely independent dataset could have been used to generate better performance indicators, the data is assumed to be continuous in training models, and some studies have shown that discrediting could be beneficial for the performance of these models, especially the naive Bayes classifier. In future experiments, I could discredit the data before using it to build models."}, {"heading": "B. Conclusion", "text": "The results of the 10-fold layered cross-validation show that the na\u00efve Bayes perform better in terms of the proportion of correctly classified instances, and that the na\u00efve Bayes classifier has benefited from any measurement of errors, which does not support my hypothesis. I believe that this may be due to the excessive complexity of the SVM and Gaussian smoothing that the na\u00efve Bayes classifier has benefited from. Ultimately, both models were able to predict the stock market to some extent. Although these results cannot be used to support or contest the EMH, since the data are all in the past, it suggests that the stock market may not follow a random course. It is likely that behind all the noise and chaos of the market there is a complex nonlinear process, but today's algorithms are clearly not advanced enough to accurately model such a process. Future research should take into account the conditional modeling of the independence relationships between the two."}], "references": [{"title": "A tutorial on support vector machines for pattern recognition", "author": ["CHRISTOPHER", "Burges JC."], "venue": "Data mining and knowledge discovery.
