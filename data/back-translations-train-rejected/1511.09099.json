In particular, we are interested in providing an automated tool for monitoring and incrementing the level of awareness in the operating room and for identifying human errors which occur during the laparoscopy surgical operation. The framework that we present is divided in three different layers: each layer implements algorithms which have an increasing level of complexity and which perform functionality with an higher degree of abstraction. In the first layer, raw data collected from sensors in the operating room during surgical operation, they are pre-processed and aggregated. The results of this initial phase are transferred to a second layer, which implements pattern recognition techniques and extract relevant features from the data. Finally, in the last layer, expert systems are employed to take high level decisions, which represent the final output of the system.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 29 Nov 2015 21:58:30 GMT  (695kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09099v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.LG", "authors": ["filippo maria bianchi", "enrico de santis", "hedieh montazeri", "parisa naraei", "alireza sadeghian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.09099"}, "pdf": {"name": "1511.09099.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Position paper: a general framework for applying machine learning techniques in operating room", "authors": ["Filippo Maria Bianchi", "Enrico De Santis", "Hedieh Montazeri", "Parisa Naraei", "Alireza Sadeghian"], "emails": ["filippo.binachi@ryerson.ca", "enrico.desantis@ryerson.ca", "hedieh.montazeri@ryerson.ca", "parisa.naraei@ryerson.ca", "asadeghi@ryerson.ca"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to acquire a greater degree of sensitivity to data processing than creating a complex environment in which medical staff and patients are confronted with their reciprocal interactions."}, {"heading": "2 Description of the Data", "text": "In fact, most of them are people who are able to acquire their identity, most of them are able to acquire their identity without being able to acquire their identity, most of them are able to acquire their identity, and most of them are able to acquire their identity and most of them are able to acquire their identity."}, {"heading": "3 System Overview", "text": "We propose a system for deriving complex decisions, based on preventive analysis of low-level data. The system is organized in different layers: Each layer receives as input the results of the previous level and generates output with higher semantic complexity. An overview of the system is given in Fig. 1. The audio, video and kinematic data (previously described in Fig. 2) is collected by intelligent sensors and initially processed in the first layer, called the Data Elaboration Layer, where different procedures can be applied to extract numerical features from the raw data. Once the features are generated, they are presented as input into the next layer, the Pattern Recognition Layer, which attempts to identify relevant patterns and regularities in the embedded feature space. Finally, in the last layer, called the Decision Support Layer, expert systems are used for top-level decision making, which can present the final output of the overall system in the following sections, we describe for each of the following sections."}, {"heading": "4 Data Elaboration Layer", "text": "In fact, one is able to be in a position, without seeing oneself in a position, without seeing oneself in a position to move, without being able to move."}, {"heading": "5 Pattern Recognition Layer", "text": "The second level serves as a recognition system for tracking complex actions and behaviors. One of the main objectives of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques is to retrieve relevant features that characterize the data [11] and to identify regularities that in many cases are hidden and cannot be detected by human inspection or with basic tools for analysis. Non-trivial correlations can, for example, exist between different types of errors, between the different stages of the surgical procedure in which the errors were identified, or in the sequence of values (which are collected in a time series) generated from biomedical signals. An important aspect of a knowledge discovery procedure is the definition of an appropriate distance function used to assess the inequality of the elements in the database. This deviation measurement must be configured correctly to capture the most important and relevant patterns in the data set."}, {"heading": "5.1 A technique for knowledge and cluster discovery", "text": "The outcome of the procedure depends greatly on the dissimilation measurement and on the choice of parameters used for its adjustments.

Advances in technology in the construction of smaller recording devices allow them to be used in sensitive environments such as healthcare facilities. In addition, well-known computer vision libraries, together with appropriately designed algorithms, allow multiple people in a room to be tracked and their paths and actions to be recorded using depth images [18]. Once the amount of movements in the room and interactions \"between whom\" have been measured, it is possible to determine whether the tracked interactions follow a characteristic pattern or not. The latter is an important point, as some operations follow a strict protocol and any deviation from it can be interpreted as an alarm of an imminent hazardous event or error."}, {"heading": "6 Decision Support Layer", "text": "In the last level, expert systems are used to perform semantic deduction at the highest level, according to the patterns and regularities identified in the previous layers.

[16] proposes a method to form clusters and categorize different types of technical errors according to some characteristic characteristics. A widespread and effective approach applies cluster techniques to identify similar patterns among the data. Such clusters are used to define different error classes according to the values contained and the assumed concept of similarity. While many approaches are based on clear logic, the fuzzy cluster technique implements a soft cluster scheme. Each member of the cluster belongs to this group with a certain degree of affiliation. Therefore, there is no fixed boundary between clusters [6]. In our application context, an algorithm such as the Fuzzy C mean (FCM) cannot be assigned to different types of errors in the operating room and a type of errors."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion", "text": "At first glance, the framework in which we are redesigning the operating theatre with a high degree of sensitivity appears to be a complex system that uses heterogeneous instruments and competences until an agreement is reached in the communication protocols."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions", "text": "The \"injection of intelligence\" in the operating theatre is a challenging task required in the process of transforming hospital facilities into \"smart hospitals.\" This position paper focuses on an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach designed to complement existing healthcare services, particularly surgery, with machine learning and pattern recognition techniques.

The framework that we present is divided in three different layers: each layer implements algorithms which have an increasing level of complexity and which perform functionality with an higher degree of abstraction. In the first layer, raw data collected from sensors in the operating room during surgical operation, they are preprocessed and aggregated. The results of this initial phase are transferred to a second layer, which implements pattern recognition techniques and extract relevant features from the data. Finally, in the last layer, expert systems are employed to take high level decisions, which represent the final output of the system.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
