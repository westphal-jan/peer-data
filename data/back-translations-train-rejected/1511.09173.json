It is mainly observed to describe the characteristic of this cluster of curves under which phases close to 0 mean that the sine waves with the highest amplitudes start somewhere near time 0. The large coefficients corresponding to 1 Hertz can imply that the time sequence of suicide curves were found high at both FFT coefficients of 1 Hertz and mean value (see parameters of clusters 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7). The large coefficients corresponding to 1 Hertz curves are of relatively significant property of forming an entire suicide period.Besides parameters and auxilities, we have personal pronouns relative to the classification of groups."}], "references": [{"title": "Suicide: current trends", "author": ["S.
