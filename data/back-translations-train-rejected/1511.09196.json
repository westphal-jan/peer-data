Each test consists of some elements and each test is positive if it includes at least one faulty element. Otherwise, the test is negative. There are two types of algorithms for the group test problem, adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms, the results of previous tests can be used in future tests and in non-adaptive algorithms. All tests are performed simultaneously and the faulty items are obtained taking into account the results of all tests. In relation to some extensions of classical group tests, we can refer to group tests, additive models, inhibitory models, etc. (see [11, 12, 16] for more information."}, {"heading": "2 Notation", "text": "Furthermore, we assume that G contains exactly one defective, isomorphic subgraph of H. We denote the maximum degree of H with \u0394= \u0445 (H). Furthermore, G [X] denotes the subgraph of G induced by X-V (G) and for each vertex v-G, NH (v) denotes the quantity of neighbors of the vertex v in diagram H. In the following, we assume that the subgraph H has no isolated vertex, because in the problem of group testing on diagrams only the edges are defective."}, {"heading": "3 Main result", "text": "For 1 \u2264 l \u2264 t, let Fl be a random test achieved by selecting each vertex of V (G), regardless of the probability p.

The lth line of this matrix corresponds to the test Fl and the jth column corresponds to the subgraph Hj.

In the diagram G with O (n2) edges, the parameter rG (H) is high, which is better to use the compound boundary. In this case, we can find the defective subgraph with t = 1 + 2 lnmln 1 1 \u2212 Pk, as well as non-adaptive tests. Finally, by looking at dense and defective subgraphs separately, we can achieve a slightly better upper limit for the number of tests in the case of defective subgraphs."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This study is part of Hamid Kameli's doctoral thesis.
