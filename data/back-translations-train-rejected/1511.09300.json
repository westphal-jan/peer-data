The speed profile determines the speed of the vehicle at each point of the way. We illustrate the proposed method using an example of optimizing the speed profile of a Formula 1 race car at the Silverstone circuit (Velenis and Tsiotras, 2008)."}, {"heading": "2 PHYSICAL MODEL OF THE VEHICLE", "text": "First, we describe a simple physical model of a vehicle.

In diagrams, random variables are represented as circles, decision variables as squares, and utility functions as diamonds. See Figure 3. Random and decision variables are represented by uppercase letters, their states by lowercase letters. A solution to the decision problem described by an influence diagram consists of a series of decision strategies for the decision variables. Decision policy for the decision variable U defines a probability distribution over the states of U for each configuration of U's parents. Decision strategy is a sequence of decision strategies, one for each decision variable. The goal is to find an optimal decision strategy that maximizes the expected overall benefit."}, {"heading": "3.1 SOLVING INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS", "text": "A simple method has already been published in (Howard and Matheson, 1981), where influence diagrams were introduced to integrate the respective influence diagrams into a decision tree and solve them with the help of dynamic programming; another algorithm was developed by (Shachter, 1986) and anticipates future graphical algorithms; three operations were introduced to remove graphics nodes; at least one of them can be used at a given time to reduce an influence diagram into a Bayesian network by converting decision variables into random benefit effects - the solution of a specific inference problem in this Bayesian network then corresponds to the optimal decision policy of the influence diagram (Cooper, 1988)."}, {"heading": "4 INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS FOR VEHICLE SPEED PROFILE OPTIMIZATION", "text": "In this section, we use the physical model of a vehicle from Section 2 to create an influence chart for speed optimization.

The influence chart used in the final experiments consists of 1010 parts that are 5 meters long for a segment. Variable Vi corresponds to the vehicle speed in the segment."}, {"heading": "4.1 IMPLEMENTATION OF CONSTRAINTS", "text": "When drawing the conclusion, we must take into account the speed and control restrictions, both speed and control restrictions are inserted into corresponding cliques of the intersection tree."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Speed constraints", "text": "Velocity constraints are inserted in the form of probability proofs.

Note: The idea behind the formula (12) is that the closer the value of vmaxi is to the nearest value of vmaxi, which is greater than vmaxi, the higher the probability of v. In experiments we observed that by giving the state v just above the maximum value of vmaxi a probability of zero improves the quality of the results."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Control constraints", "text": "The limitations of control (7) in the marginalization of the control variables Ui = \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i \"i\" i."}, {"heading": "4.2 ZERO COMPRESSION", "text": "We solve the influence method with the standard method of strong transition (Jensen et al., 1994), which is briefly described in Section 3.1, but the probability potentials we work with are sparse, i.e. they contain many zeros. This is a consequence of the \"fast\" deterministic probability tables. In Hugin (Andersen et al., 1990), a method called zero compression is used to improve the efficiency of inference with sparse potentials. In this method, an efficient representation of client tables is used so that zeros do not need to be explicitly stored. Savings can be large: in our case, we essentially reduce the dimensions of each table by one. Compression does not affect the accuracy of the inference process because it does not introduce approximations (Cowell et al., 1999), i.e. it is an exact inference method."}, {"heading": "5 EXPERIMENTS", "text": "We carried out experiments with a model of a Formula 1 racing car on the Silverstone Formula 1 circuit (the bridge version), with the aim of finding a speed profile that minimises the overall lap time and meets speed and acceleration restrictions as defined in Definition 1. The speed restrictions are derived from the curve radius and the maximum permissible lateral acceleration amaxn (see Formula (5). For a typical Formula 1 racing car amaxn = 30 ms \u2212 2 - see Example 2. Acceleration restrictions are defined by formula (7). In our experiments, we use the influence diagram described in Section (Velvi). The experiments were carried out in the following ways: 1. Define the length of a segment and sets of variable states V, A, U. 2. Initiate the potentials: CAi, CVi, CAi, and CAi, and CVi, and CVi, and CVi, and set and speed restrictions."}, {"heading": "5.1 ZERO COMPRESSION EXPERIMENTS", "text": "Remember that the symbols | V |, | A | and | U | denote the cardinalities of the respective sets.

In this figure, we compare the calculated speed profile with the performance of the test pilot on the Silverstone circuit (Oxford Technical Solutions, 2002).In the upper part of Figure 6, the speed profile of the test pilot is represented by a dashed line. Note that the test pilot flouts these limitations several times. Furthermore, the acceleration of the test pilot is slower than expected, the speed restrictions used in the model seem to be too cautious and the acceleration ability of the car somewhat exaggerated. It is interesting to compare the total time estimated by the influence chart with the results of the Formula One drivers. While the model is slightly lower than the estimated time of 83.95 seconds achieved by the test pilot - 85.51 seconds, it is higher than the ever achieved lap time - 78.12 seconds - which Sebastian Vettel achieved in his Red Bull Grand Prix 2009 qualifying."}, {"heading": "5.4 ANALYTIC SOLUTION", "text": "The analytical solution was presented in (Velenis and Tsiotras, 2008) and is represented in Figure 7 by a dashed line together with the Influence Diagram Solution. The solutions are quite similar, but there are some differences. Obviously, the analytical solution does not fully comply with the acceleration restrictions, which causes differences in the velocity profiles, otherwise they would be equivalent. We could not explain this observation. In the lower part of Figure 7, we present the control profile of the analytical solution, which was reconstructed from the velocity profile of the analytical solution5."}, {"heading": "6 RELATED WORK", "text": "The problem of velocity profile optimization can also be specified by Markov decision-making processes (MDPs) (Puterman, 1994) with a finite horizon, a non-stationary policy and a non-linear stationary reward function.

In (Velenis and Tsiotras, 2008) the problem was solved analytically by methods of continuous time control (Bertsekas, 2000) using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. We compared the solution of the influence diagram with the analytical solution in Section 5.4 - the solutions were similar. However, analytical solutions to the problem as extended versions with an extended optimization function and additional limitations and do not need to be known and applied numerically."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We proposed an application of influence charts to optimize speed profiles and tested them in a real-world scenario. We summarize what we have achieved and what we have learned: \u2022 We were able to find efficient optimal solutions. \u2022 We verified whether the solutions correspond to the analytical solution of the problem under consideration. \u2022 An important advantage of influence charts is that once the policy is calculated, it can be used immediately to update the optimal speed profile under changed circumstances. \u2022 If, for example, the driver has to slow down due to an unexpected traffic situation, the policy immediately delivers the best new control value and the speed profile is specified by following the pre-calculated optimal guidelines. \u2022 Influence charts are particularly convenient in more complex real-world scenarios where the analytical solution is unknown. \u2022 In applications, various optimization criteria come into play. We can perform calculations efficiently as long as they add up along the path segments."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation through the project 13-20012S."}], "references": [{"title": "HUGIN: a shell for building Bayesian belief universes for expert systems", "author": ["S.K.
