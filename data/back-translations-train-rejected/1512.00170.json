For commonly used language pairs, such as English-French, there are large amounts of parallel corpus readily available. However, some language pairs, such as English-Dutch, have only a limited amount of parallel data due to the popularity of the language pair. In order to solve the limitations of parallel data, the Pivot language method was introduced (de Gispert and Marino, 2006), which bridges two languages with an intermediate language. In addition, the Pivot language method can also be applied to those popular language pairs, such as ChineseEnglish, when bilingual resources for a particular domain are limited. Phrase Pivoting, also called triangulation, is one of the most advanced pivot methods in which a source-to-destination translation model of vot models is generated."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "The first is sentence translation, also known as the transfer or cascade method (Khalilov et al., 2008). We first translate the source sentences into pivot language with source-to-pivot translation system and then translate the pivot sentences into target language with pivot-to-target translation system. Although very simple, it is time-consuming because it should happen two translation systems in a row (Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007). It combines source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target phrase table to induce a source-to-target phrase deposit for pivot translation (Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007)."}, {"heading": "3 Phrase Pivoting Method", "text": "With a source-to-pivot and a pivot-to-target corpus, we can train two translation models and create a pivot translation model, i.e. a source-to-target translation model, by combining the source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target translation models with the appropriate pivot phrases. In the combination process, two elements should be taken into account: the first element is phrase translation probability. As the source phrases and target phrases are extracted from different corpses, we assume that source phrases are independent of target phrases."}, {"heading": "4 Approach", "text": "As mentioned above, pan-based machine translation suffers from serious disruption caused by the compound error in each translation model. In addition, the induced rotation model may be an order of magnitude greater than non-merged models, which are almost occupied with noise phrases pairs. We solve this problem by first truncating the enlarged translation model to exclude noise phrases pairs. Secondly, we extend the translation model by using additional entries from lexicon models."}, {"heading": "4.1 Modified Top-N Pruning Method", "text": "In pivot-based machine translation, we multiply each feature (such as translation probabilities and the calculation of weight) by the highest N value. That is, we select the best N candidates for a particular source phrase in the pivot phrase table. It has proven to be a simple and useful phrase cropping strategy (Zhu et al., 2013a; Kholy et al., 2013). However, we have noticed that most of the cropping methods rarely take the source phrase coverage into account, and we believe that the noise does not only exist in target phrases, but also in source phrases. Motivated by this, we propose a modified Top-N cropping method that will result in a much more compact phrase table and significant improvements in translation performance. If we give a source phrase S, we select their Top-N-rated phrases and discard those that do not appear to be in the top-N list (to multiply the top-N)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Augmenting Phrase Table by Adding Lexicons", "text": "As we mentioned in Section 1, pivot-based machine translation suffers from a serious phrase sparseness problem and even a basic translation unit, the unirams, which cannot be covered by induced phrase pairs of the pivot model. < Until the pivot method can not make full use of the source topivot and pivot-to-target-corpus resources (although similar phrases can be covered in the pivot side of the target corpus), however, if we combine the source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target-to-target-corpus table, we find that the phrase coverage problem could result from word alignment errors, which could prevent us from extracting useful phrase pairs. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel approach to the phrase pairing table."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Experiment Setup", "text": "In this thesis, we build a Chinese-Japanese translation system without using a parallel corpus. We select English as the pivot language due to its high availability of a bilingual corpus. We randomly select 50K Chinese-English or 59K Japanese-English sentences from an internal parallel corpus containing spoken corpus from different areas. We use a Chinese-Japanese parallel corpus to create a 2K tuning set and a 1K test set, each with a single reference. Note that the training set, the tuning set and the test set are independent of each other. We are also conducting our experiments with an open source, phrase-based SMT toolkit Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). Text alignment and phrase extraction are done by GIZA + + (Och and Ney, 2003). 5 gram language models are also coached by SRM Toolkit Minimal (Parameter 2002, MERT)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Experiment of Modified Top-N Pruning", "text": "As illustrated in Section 4.1, it is difficult to select suitable values for N and M. The results of the experiment are shown in Table 1. Since the size of the original trimming table is huge (about 252M), we set a trimmed term table with Top-100 as our base system. The values in the size column represent the number of pairs of terms. Inv represents the reverse trimming of Top-N, which is the second step of the modified Top-N trimming method. BLEU values, which are statistically more significant than the base threshold (over 95%), are marked with a bold face. We observed that: (1) Top-N trimming table proved to be a simple and useful trimming table."}, {"heading": "5.3 Experiment of Augmenting Phrase Table", "text": "In this experiment, we will augment the performance of the phrase table as we mentioned in Section 4.2 to test its performance. To make the results more accurate, we will use the method for calculating lexical weight gain, and only 20 candidates for the approach we mentioned in Section 4.2. Table 2.0 shows the method for calculating lexical weight gain."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we introduced a modified method for truncating the phrase table that takes into account both source and target phrase coverage to alleviate the noise problem of pivoting machine translation. In addition, we introduced a new approach to improving phrase coverage in the phrase table by using the Word extension model as an additional resource in IBM models. Experimental results show that our truncation method significantly exceeds the original one, not only in reducing the phrase table, but also in improving overall translation performance. And after applying our strategy to expand the phrase table, the phrase coverage increased in terms of the OOV, which was reduced to less than 50% of its origin. In our future work, we plan to incorporate linguistic information into the phrase table augmentation method in order to obtain a better pivot table. In addition, we will explore new pivot models, such as integrating pivot point reader models."}], "references": [{"title": "Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation with Pivot Languages", "author": ["Nicola Bertoldi", "Madalina Barbaiani", "Marcello Federico", "Roldano Cattoni."], "venue": "Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT), pages 143-149.", "citeRegEx": "Bertoldi et al\\.,? 2008", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bertoldi et al\\.", "year": 2008}, {"title": "The mathematics of statistical machine translation: Parameter estimation", "author": ["Peter F.
