Although no criterion is universally accepted as the overall best, a number of meta-evaluation conditions to be satisfied by biclustering algorithms have been enunciated. In this work, we present MOCICE-BCubed F$_1$, a new external measure for evaluating biclusterings, in the scenario where gold standard annotations are available for both the object clusters and the associated feature subspaces. Our proposal relies on the so-called micro-objects transformation and satisfies the most comprehensive set of meta-evaluation conditions so far enunciated for biclusterings. Additionally, the proposed measure adequately handles the occurrence of overlapping in both the object and feature spaces. Moreover, when used for evaluating traditional clusterings, which are viewed as a particular case of biclustering, the proposed measure also satisfies the most comprehensive set of meta-evaluation conditions so far enunciated for this task.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Dec 2015 11:26:50 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00228v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 21 Jan 2016 11:35:22 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00228v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR", "authors": ["henry rosales-m\\'endez", "yunior ram\\'irez-cruz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.00228"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.00228.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Henry Rosales-M\u00e9ndez", "Yunior Ram\u0131\u0301rez-Cruz"], "emails": ["hrosmendez@gmail.com,", "yunior.ramirez@urv.cat"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 151 2.00 228v 1 [cs.L G"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The aim of clustering algorithms (also known as uncontrolled classification algorithms) is to structure a collection of objects into a series of groups or clusters that aim to place different objects in different clusters and similar objects in a cluster. Clustering can be used to model the solutions to a large number of real-world problems. Clustering is also often used as an auxiliary task in many areas, such as the use of wireless sensor networks [21], speech recognition [25], stochastic optimization of data [12], document organization, etc. In traditional clusters, the feature space on which objects are represented is determined for the execution of the clustering method apart from the representation of each object. In recent decades, a more general generalization of the traditional task, called biclustering task, has been called biclustering \"biclustering.\""}, {"heading": "2 Background and previous work", "text": "In view of the fact that this is a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case concerning a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a case involving a"}, {"heading": "3 Our proposal", "text": "The basis of our new proposal is the measurement of CICE-BCubed F1, which was presented in [32, 33] for traditional clustering, with an emphasis on the appropriate handling of the occurrence of overlapping clusters. It has been shown that CICE-BCubed F1 conditions A.1 to A.5. Building on this proposal, our new measurement variable is designed so that the elements of the CICE-BCubed F1 meet these conditions, while the adjustment to the two-dimensional scenario takes place in such a way that conditions B.1 to B.5 are also met. We do this by combining CICE-BCubed F1 with the micro-objects of the transformation. CICE-BCubed F1 is based on BCubed F1 [4]. Both redefine the traditional information retrieval variables Precision and Recall, whose values are combined to F1."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have introduced MOCICE-BCubed F1, a new external evaluation metric for twin-beam algorithms, which is an adjustment based on the transformation of micro-objects to CICE-BCubed F1, which has been shown to meet the most comprehensive meta-evaluation conditions for the traditional cluster task. We show that the new metric is equivalent to CICE-BCubed F1 in the evaluation of traditional clusters, as it is considered a special case of twin-beam clusters, and thus inherits compliance with the most comprehensive meta-evaluation conditions for this task. This behavior distinguishes MOCICE-BCubed F1 from previously proposed micro-object-based measures, for which we provide counter-examples showing the non-compliance of several of these conditions. Furthermore, we show that MOCICE-BCubed F1 also fulfils the most comprehensive meta-evaluation conditions for this task. Our main direction for future work has to do with the practical difficulty of combining standby combining the two-beam of gold objects with the viewing angles."}], "references": [{"title": "Finding Generalized Projected Clusters in High Dimensional Spaces", "author": ["C.

Although no criterion is universally accepted as the overall best, a number of meta-evaluation conditions to be satisfied by biclustering algorithms have been enunciated. In this work, we present MOCICE-BCubed F1, a new external measure for evaluating biclusterings, in the scenario where gold standard annotations are available for both the object clusters and the associated feature subspaces. Our proposal relies on the so-called micro-objects transformation and satisfies the most comprehensive set of meta-evaluation conditions so far enunciated for biclusterings. Additionally, the proposed measure adequately handles the occurrence of overlapping in both the object and feature spaces. Moreover, when used for evaluating traditional clusterings, which are viewed as a particular case of biclustering, the proposed measure also satisfies the most comprehensive set of meta-evaluation conditions so far enunciated for this task.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
