Many physical systems are well described in terms of a set of objects, attributes of these objects and relationships between them. The number and properties of objects in the world may change over time, and they are only partially observable due to noise and occlusion in the observation process. Domains that are appropriately modeled include: a household robot that must maintain an estimate of the contents of a refrigerator used by several other people based on partial views of its contents; a wildlife surveillance drone that must maintain an estimate of the number, age and health of elephants in a herd moving through a forest; a monitoring satellite that must capture the number, activity and immobility of soldiers in an enemy camp in photos that only capture humans."}, {"heading": "2 Problem Definition", "text": "In world modeling we look for the state of the world, consisting of an unknown finite number of Kt of objects that change over time. Object k in epoch t has attribute values \u03b8kt. Sometimes we decompose \u03b8kt into (ak, xkt), where a is a vector of fixed attributes, and x is a vector of attributes that can change between epochs. The top line in Figure 1 illustrates the state of the world in three epochs for a simple range. Our system obtains loud, partial views of the world. Each view v produces a series of observations Otv = {otvi}, where otvi = (btvi, y tv i) correspond to the fixed attributes one and dynamic attributes xt of some (possibly non-existent) objects1. Each view is also associated with a field of view Bav, representing variations of the world in a single epoch."}, {"heading": "2.1 Observation noise model", "text": "The observation model describes how probably an observation o = (b, y) was generated from some given object states \u03b8 = (a, x) (if any) given by the probability f (o; \u03b8). For a single object, \u03b8c and \u03b8d should be the true continuous and separate attribute values, and likewise oc and od for a single observation of the object. Typically, we consider observation noise models of the following form: f (o; \u03b8) = \u03c6\u03b8d (od) N (oc; \u03b8c, S) (1) Here \u03c6 represents a discrete confusion matrix in which \u03c6\u03b8d (od) is the probability of observation that the true object has discrete attributes \u0445d. The continuously evaluated observation soc is the true value \u0445c corrupts with the zero mean Gaussian noise, with fixed perceptual covariance S. The noise on oc and od is assumed to be independent for reasons of simplicity."}, {"heading": "2.2 Additional assumption: Cannot-link constraint (CLC)", "text": "Finally, there is another common domain assumption on target tracking issues that is critical: within a single view, each visible object can produce at most one Bar-Shalom and Fortmann detection (1988), which implies that within a view, each observation must be assigned to another hypothetical underlying object. To paraphrase the terminology of the cluster, we call this a \"can-link constraint\" (CLC). This constraint is effective because it can reduce ambiguity when there are similar objects nearby. Cluster algorithms, however, typically cannot handle such constraints, and similar to the DPMM-based data association work of Wong et al. (2015), we will need to change the DDP model and inference algorithms to address the global modeling problem."}, {"heading": "3 A Clustering-Based Approach", "text": "Since the number of clusters is unknown, we opted for the use of non-parametric models that allow for an indefinite and unlimited number of mixture components (although the number of instantiated components is limited by the size of the data).The Dexklet Process (DP) (Teh (2010) provides a good overview and its application to mixture modelling (Antoniak, 1974; Neal, 2000) is a widely studied earlier process for density estimation and clustering. The popularity of DP is based on its simplicity and elegance. However, a major limitation is that clusters cannot change over time, a consequence of the fact that observations are assumed to be fully interchangeable. This assumption is violated for problems such as ours, where the observed entities change over time and in space."}, {"heading": "3.1 Inference by forward sampling", "text": "As mentioned in the problem definition, we will focus on the determination of latent mappings Z = > q of the observations O = {oti} of the clusters with parameters 1 and 2.

Specifically, instead of iteratively capturing correspondence vectors from their conditional distributions in Gibbs sampling, we find the most likely ones, update the parameters based on them, and repeat them for each view. Since we are still dealing with the common space of assignments for all observations in a given view, the search for the maximizer potentially still requires searching through combinatorial space. Fortunately, the search for the most likely match can be formulated as the maximum weighted assignment problem for which efficient algorithms such as the Hungarian algorithm exist (and were previously used in the data association)."}, {"heading": "5.2 A two-stage inference scheme", "text": "Although the presented ICM algorithm can find good clusters in a single epoch very quickly, experiments will show that it does not converge to good cluster trajectories. The problem is that ICM movements are local by taking into account one view at a time. Suppose we have correctly identified all objects in epoch 1 using ICM (by reviving them from the previous epoch). If we look at the first view in epoch 2, there can be significant changes, and if we use only the first view, ICM decides whether to assign the new observations to existing clusters (by reviving them from the previous epoch). Since uncertainty in object states is high immediately after a transition, cluster connection decisions are based on a single view. Since ICM can reliably find good clusters within individual epochs, we apply ICM to the data of each epoch first and treat them as unrelated static worlds."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "Approximate MAP conclusions for global modeling using ICM, MCMCDA, and the two-stage ICM-MCMC algorithm were tested on a simulated domain and on a sequence of real robot vision data constructed from the static scenes in Wong et al.

The correct object type was observed with a probability of 0.6, with an equal probability (0.1) of being confused with the other 3 object types. Places were observed with isotropic Gaussian noise, standard deviation 1.0.

Such an example is shown in Figure 5.Objects in different scenes were all placed on the same table top measuring 1.2 m x 0.6 m; all data were placed in the reference frame of the table. Four object types were present, and each scene typically had 5-10 objects. Unlike the previous simulation, we do not assume that objects have velocities; between epochs, we assume that the location changes with isotropic Gaussian noise, standard approach 0.1. Since changes between epochs were significant, we assumed a relatively low probability of survival of 0.5. Object locations are detected with Gaussian noise, standard analysis 0.03; the object type noise model and the probability of detection is 0.1."}, {"heading": "A Background on dependent Dirichlet processes", "text": "Lin et al.

By considering transitions to the underlying Poisson processes and limiting ourselves to transitional steps in which the Poisson process remains closed in transition (fundamentally by preserving complete randomness), we obtain a new spatial Poisson process in the next stage that can be converted back to a new DP.

The methods mentioned above were all formulated for multiple-target tracking problems, where the each target\u2019s state (typically location) changes between observations. However, if we consider applications such as tracking objects in a household, the dynamics are typically different: most objects tend to stay in the same state when they are not being actively used. In this paper, we study the world modeling problem in semi-static environments, where time is divided into known epochs, and within each epoch the world is stationary. It seems intuitive that data association should be easier within static periods, since there is no uncertainty arising from stochastic dynamics. An alternative approach to data association is to perform inference over the entire time-series of observations and to think of it as a problem of clustering: we wish to group together similar detections over time, under the assumption that they will have been generated by the same individual. Bayesian nonparametric models, such as the Dirichlet-process mixture model (DPMM), can be used to model domains in which the number of individuals is unknown a priori ; in Wong et al.
