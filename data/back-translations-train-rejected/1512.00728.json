In this work, we solicit annotations from workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk for 109 texts ranging from Homer's _Iliad_ to Joyce's _Ulysses_ on four dimensions of interest: for a given pair of characters, we collect judgments as to the coarse-grained category (professional, social, familial), fine-grained category (friend, lover, parent, rival, employer), and affinity (positive, negative, neutral) that describes their primary relationship in a text. We do not assume that this relationship is static; we also collect judgments as to whether it changes at any point in the course of the text.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Dec 2015 15:09:31 GMT  (355kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00728v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["philip massey", "patrick xia", "david bamman", "noah a smith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.00728"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.00728.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Annotating Character Relationships in Literary Texts", "authors": ["Philip Massey", "David Bamman"], "emails": ["pmassey@cmu.edu", "paxia@cmu.edu", "dbamman@berkeley.edu", "nasmith@cs.washington.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Character Relationships in Literary TextsPhilip Massey and Patrick Xia School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University {pmassey, paxia} @ cmu.eduDavid Bamman School of Information University of California, Berkeley dbamman @ berkeley.eduNoah A.
