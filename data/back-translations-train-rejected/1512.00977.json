Construction of Liufeng-Shiyong Architecture Based on the Standard", "text": "Intelligent modelAs mentioned above, the Von Neumann architecture consists of five components, i.e. calculator, logic control unit, memory, input system and output system. By comparing the intelligent standard model described in Section 1 and the knowledge interaction diagram of the intelligent standard model, it can be established that the von Neumann architecture consists mainly of two parts: the innovative and creative function, namely the ability to find new knowledge elements and laws based on existing knowledge, and the ability to enter these into the computer memory and control system and achieve knowledge interaction with the outside world via the input / output system, and the external knowledge base and cloud storage, which can achieve knowledge exchange. However, the external storage function of the von Neumann architecture serves only one system. Therefore, we extend the von Neumann architecture and form the Liufeng Shiyong architecture, as shown in Fig.2.2.1."}, {"heading": "3.

Definition of Artificial Intelligence IQ", "text": "As mentioned above, a standardized intelligent system must have four characteristics, i.e. the ability to acquire knowledge, the ability to master knowledge, the ability to renew knowledge, and the ability to feedback knowledge. If we intend to evaluate the intelligence level of an intelligent system, we should test the four characteristics simultaneously to verify its level of development, as shown in Fig.4.1. The ability to acquire knowledge can be verified by testing whether the knowledge can be fed into the intelligent system; the ability to master knowledge can be verified by testing the volume of the knowledge base; the ability to innovate can be verified by testing how much knowledge can be converted by the intelligent system into the content of the new knowledge, and the ability to feedback the knowledge can be verified by testing whether the standard intelligent intelligent system can transmit to the outside knowledge base. Based on the intelligence evaluation model to the content of the new knowledge, and the ability to evaluate the feedback of the knowledge can be verified by testing whether the standard intelligent system can transmit to the outside knowledge base. Based on the intelligence evaluation model to the intelligence level, the intelligent point of the IQ is determined in this article as follows from the Intelligent Point I of the Intelligent Point of the IQ:"}, {"heading": "5.

Summary and Prospect", "text": "Through testing, we obtain the following results and conclusions: The general IQ of the search engines tested is far lower than that of the human groups tested. Google's IQ, as the top ranking among the machines tested, is less than half that of the children at age 6; the knowledge acquisition and feedback skills of the search engines tested are weaker than those of the human control groups. In terms of the ability to master knowledge (general knowledge, computation and translation), the search engines tested have caught up with or exceeded the human control group, but their capacity for knowledge innovation is almost zero, indicating that the AI system has a very low capacity for innovation. Therefore, we recommend that future research into the AI system, including search engines, should focus on how to improve the ability to innovate, especially in the aspects of association, selection, creation and discovery of laws. Starting in 2015, we can test smarter systems that use the AI test system, including the search engines developed by Google, IBIRIQ, and IBIRIQ, as well as the human search engines developed by Google SIRIQ and IBIRIQ, and IBIQ, as the IBIQ system specifically for IBIRIQ and IBM."}], "references": [{"title": "Gemanb,Neil Hallonquist.Visual Turing test for computer vision systems.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of AmericaPNAS", "author": ["Donald Gemana", "Stuart"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2015}, {"title": "The theory of intelligent testing isn't consistent with the Turing test.http://www.forbeschina.com/review/- 201503/-0041388_2.shtml.2015", "author": ["Qiang", "Yang"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Intelligent Planning: A Decomposition and Abstraction Based Approach.Springer.2014 ISBN9783540619017", "author": ["Qiang", "Yang"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 1901}, {"title": "Draft of a Report on the EDVAC", "author": ["John von Neumann.First"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 1993}, {"title": "Shi.The Search Engine IQ Test based on the Internet IQ Evaluation Algorithm", "author": ["Liu Feng", "Yong"], "venue": "Proceedings of the Secondi.International Conference on Information Technology and Quantitative Management, Procedia Computer Science, Volume", "citeRegEx": "10", "shortCiteRegEx": "10", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Harthb,J\u00fcrgen Umbrich.Searching and browsing Linked Data with SWSE: The Semantic Web Search Engine.JWS special issue on Semantic Search.2011", "author": ["Aidan Hogana", "Andreas"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "11", "shortCiteRegEx": "11", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Wang.World Search Engine IQ Test Based on the Internet IQ Evaluation Algorithms.International", "author": ["Liu Feng", "Yong Shi", "Bo"], "venue": "Journal of Information Technology & Decision", "citeRegEx": "12", "shortCiteRegEx": "12", "year": 2015}], "referenceMentions": [{"referenceID": 0, "context": "[2] , which is used to conduct more in-depth assessment on the computer ability to identify images.", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 3}, {"referenceID": 1, "context": "Each of such tests should be conducted aiming at an individual intelligence characteristic [3] .", "startOffset": 91, "endOffset": 94}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "If such level is rising over time, the computer may be considered as intelligent [5] .", "startOffset": 81, "endOffset": 84}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "(2)Von Neumann Architecture: On June 30, 1945,John Von Neumann proposed the Von Neumann Architecture in his report \u201cFirst Draft of a Report on the EDVAC \u201d [7] .", "startOffset": 155, "endOffset": 158}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "By giving weights [10] to the 15 sub-tests in the AI intelligence scale with the Delphi method, we obtain the contents shown in Table 5.", "startOffset": 18, "endOffset": 22}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "Since 2014, we have tested 50 search engines and 3 human subject at different ages across the world, and finally obtains the AI IQ ranking list 2014 [10,12] , as shown in Table 5.", "startOffset": 149, "endOffset": 156}, {"referenceID": 6, "context": "Since 2014, we have tested 50 search engines and 3 human subject at different ages across the world, and finally obtains the AI IQ ranking list 2014 [10,12] , as shown in Table 5.", "startOffset": 149, "endOffset": 156}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "236 [2]Donald Gemana,Stuart Gemanb,Neil Hallonquist.", "startOffset": 4, "endOffset": 7}, {"referenceID": 1, "context": "12 [3] Qiang, Yang.", "startOffset": 3, "endOffset": 6}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "6142 [5] Qiang, Yang.", "startOffset": 5, "endOffset": 8}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "1936:230-265 [7]John von Neumann.", "startOffset": 13, "endOffset": 16}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "2007,4(4):211-219 [10]Liu Feng,Yong Shi.", "startOffset": 18, "endOffset": 22}, {"referenceID": 5, "context": "[11]Aidan Hogana, Andreas Harthb,J\u00fcrgen Umbrich.", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 4}, {"referenceID": 6, "context": "2011 9(4):365\u2013401 [12]Liu Feng, Yong Shi, and Bo Wang.", "startOffset": 18, "endOffset": 22}], "year": 2015, "abstractText": "Currently, potential threats of artificial intelligence (AI) to human have triggered a large controversy in society, behind which, the nature of the issue is whether the artificial intelligence (AI) system can be evaluated quantitatively.
