In a general sense, sentiment analysis determines the opinion regarding the object / subject in the discussion. Its original use was used to analyze feelings based on long texts such as letters, emails, etc. It is also used in the area of analyzing criminal activity before and after crimes. With the explosion of Internet applications such as microblogging websites, forums and social networks, this field of study has lately gained its spotlight. People discuss, comment and criticize various topics and write reviews, recommendations, etc. using these applications. User-generated data carry a lot of valuable information about products, people, events, etc. The fierce competition in the modern world has led to advanced mechanisms of customer feedback and satisfaction to innovation cycles. The large user-generated content requires the use of automated techniques for mining jobs, mineral mining, and the analytics are difficult to work in this area, as the early in the evaluation process."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "This section describes Twitter-specific approaches to Mood Analysis. Research on Mood Analysis has so far focused on two things: determining whether a particular unit of text is subjective or objective, and identifying the polarity of subjective texts [3]. Most Mood Analysis studies use machine learning approaches; in the field of Mood Analysis, texts belong to either positive or negative classes; there may also be polyvalent or binary classes such as positive, negative and neutral (or irrelevant); and the core complexity of classifying texts in Mood Analysis compared to other topic-based catalogs is based on the unusability of keywords [2], although the number of classes in Mood Analysis is lower than in the later approach of [4]."}, {"heading": "2.1 Lexical analysis", "text": "This technique is governed by the use of a dictionary consisting of pre-tagged lexicon, and the input text is converted into tokenizer by the tokenizer. Each new token is then matched for the lexicon in the dictionary. If there is a positive match, the score is added to the total pool of scores for the input text. For example, if \"dramatic\" is a positive match in the dictionary, then the total score of the text is incremented. Otherwise, the score is reduced or the word is marked as negative. Although this technique appears to be amateur in nature, its variants have proved worthy ([11], [8]. Fig. 1 shows how a lexical technique works. The classification of a text depends on the total score it achieves. A considerable amount of work has been devoted to measuring the best lexical information."}, {"heading": "2.2 Machine learning based analysis", "text": "In fact, most people who are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance, to"}, {"heading": "2.3 Hybrid analysis", "text": "Advances in sentiment analysis led researchers to explore the possibility of a hybrid approach that could collectively demonstrate the accuracy of a machine learning approach and the speed of a lexical approach. In [17], authors use two-word lexicographs and unlabeled data and divide these two-word lexicographs into two distinct classes of negative and positive. Pseudo-documents, which include all words from the set of selected lexicographs, are created. Then, they calculate the cosmic similarity between the pseudo-documents and the unlabeled documents. Depending on the degree of similarity, the documents received either a positive or a negative mood. This training dataset was then fed to a naive classifier called Polling Multinomial for training purposes. Another approach presented by [18] derived a \"uniform framework\" that used lexical background information as word class associations. Authors renewed information for certain areas of use of the available datasets, or suggested that the PMomical was used only for training purposes."}, {"heading": "3 Summary", "text": "In a survey conducted by [20], the comparison of all approaches showed that the best results of machine learning approaches and the least of lexical approaches were observed. However, without proper training of a classifier in the machine learning approach, the results can deteriorate drastically. Hybrid approaches are being worked on, so to our knowledge only limited information is available so far. [20] The techniques have been tested by [20] in a user-tweets-based area for movie ratings and recommendations and news reviews, and their results appear to be promising for further research, using: Cornel Movie Review Dataset [2], General Inquirer Adjective Lists [12], Yahoo Web Search API [13], Porter Stemmer [22], WordNet Java API [23], Stanford Log Linear POS Tagger with Penn Treebank Tag Set [23], WEKA M.L. Java API (for machine learning purposes only) [24]."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "Open social networks are the best examples of sociological trust. Exchange of messages, followers and friends, and users \"differing perceptions, provide a primitive platform to study trust in behavior in the field of emotional analysis. Machine learning approaches have so far been good at delivering accurate results. Depending on the application, the success of each approach varies. The lexical approach is ready to use and does not require prior information or training. While machine learning, on the other hand, requires a well-designed classifier, huge amounts of pre-deployment training data, and performance tuning, the hybrid approach has so far shown a positive mood in terms of performance. Although it has been used using unigrams and charts, its performance on trigrams is worse."}], "references": [{"title": "Thumbs up or thumbs down?.
