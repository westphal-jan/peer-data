In recent years, the use of network methods to analyze language has allowed the discovery of several interesting findings, including the proposition of novel models to explain the emergence of fundamental universal patterns. While syntactical networks, one of the most prevalent networked models of written texts, display both scale-free and small-world properties, such representation fails in capturing other textual features, such as the organization in topics or subjects. In this context, we propose a novel network representation whose main purpose is to capture the semantical relationships of words in a simple way. To do so, we link all words co-occurring in the same semantic context, which is defined in a threefold way. We show that the proposed representations favours the emergence of communities of semantically related words, and this feature may be used to identify relevant topics. The proposed methodology to detect topics was applied to segment selected Wikipedia articles. We have found that, in general, our methods outperform traditional bag-of-words representations, which suggests that a high-level textual representation may be useful to study semantical features of texts.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 12:22:26 GMT  (783kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01384v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["henrique f de arruda", "luciano da f costa", "diego r amancio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.01384"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.01384.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Topic segmentation via community detection in complex networks", "authors": ["Henrique F. de Arruda", "Luciano da F.

Note that the distance \u03c9 controls the total number of edges of the network, so comparing the network modularity for different values of \u03c9 is equivalent to comparing networks with different averages. Since the average degree plays an important role in calculating modularity [26], we have defined a normalized modularity QN here that only takes into account the organization of the network in modules and is not distorted in the direction of dense networks."}, {"heading": "Performance analysis", "text": "In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed network-based methods, we have developed two additional methods based on linguistic attributes to compare the performance of networked and non-networked methods in Section III. However, both methods are based on a pocket-of-words strategy [1], in which each paragraph is represented by the frequency of occurrence of its words. To cluster the paragraphs in different subjects, we have used two traditional clustering methods: k-means [46] and expectation maximization [47], in which the pocket-of-words strategy is represented, based on the k-means and expectation maximization algorithms are referred to as BOWK and BOW-EM-EM, maximizing the results of maximization [47]."}, {"heading": "V.

2015, "abstractText": "Many real systems have been modelled in terms of network concepts, and written texts are a particular example of information networks. In recent years, the use of network methods to analyze language has allowed the discovery of several interesting findings, including the proposition of novel models to explain the emergence of fundamental universal patterns. While syntactical networks, one of the most prevalent networked models of written texts, display both scale-free and small-world properties, such representation fails in capturing other textual features, such as the organization in topics or subjects. In this context, we propose a novel network representation whose main purpose is to capture the semantical relationships of words in a simple way. To do so, we link all words co-occurring in the same semantic context, which is defined in a threefold way. We show that the proposed representations favours the emergence of communities of semantically related words, and this feature may be used to identify relevant topics. The proposed methodology to detect topics was applied to segment selected Wikipedia articles. We have found that, in general, our methods outperform traditional bag-of-words representations, which suggests that a high-level textual representation may be useful to study semantical features of texts.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
