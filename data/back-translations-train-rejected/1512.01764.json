The key idea behind game-theoretic approach to network analysis is to treat nodes as players in a cooperative game, where the value of each coalition of nodes is determined by certain graph properties. Next, the centrality of any individual node is determined by a chosen game-theoretic solution concept (notably, the Shapley value) in the same way as the payoff of a player in a cooperative game. On one hand, the advantage of game-theoretic centrality measures is that nodes are ranked not only according to their individual roles but also according to how they contribute to the role played by all possible subsets of nodes. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that the game-theoretic solution concepts are typically computationally challenging. The main contribution of this dissertation is that we show that a wide variety of game-theoretic solution concepts on networks can be computed in polynomial time. Our focus is on centralities based on the Shapley value and its various extensions, such as the Semivalues and Coalitional Semivalues. Furthermore, we prove #P-hardness of computing the Shapley value in connectivity games and propose an algorithm to compute it. Finally, we analyse computational properties of generalized version of cooperative games in which order of player matters. We propose a new representation for such games, called generalized marginal contribution networks, that allows for polynomial computation in the size of the representation of two dedicated extensions of the Shapley value to this class of games.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Dec 2015 09:56:48 GMT  (210kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01764v1", "Doctoral Dissertation at Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology"]], "COMMENTS": "Doctoral Dissertation at Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.SI", "authors": ["piotr lech szczepa\\'nski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.01764"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.01764.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "WARSAW UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology", "authors": ["DOCTORAL DISSERTATION", "mgr Piotr Szczepa\u0144ski"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "It is.

Introduction", "text": "The Shapley values are probably the most well-known normative payoff schemes in cooperative game theory [Shapley, 1953]. One of their interesting applications is the measurement of the importance (or centrality) of nodes in networks. Unfortunately, although such a game theory approach to centrality is often more advantageous than the classical measurements, the Shapley value and other related concepts from cooperative game theory are mathematically challenging. In particular, they typically require all the marginal contributions that n players in cooperative game could make to all 2n coalitions (subsets of players). Clearly, the application of such a direct approach to calculating game theory concepts to very small systems. The main thesis of this thesis is that it is possible to calculate different measurements based on game theory solution concepts in polynomial time."}, {"heading": "1.1.

Preliminaries", "text": "In this chapter, we present the basic notation and definitions from both graph theory and game theory used throughout the work. First, we present cooperative games (also known as cooperative games), in which we focus on the central solution concepts and their computational aspects. In particular, we define the Shapley value - the most popular normative concept for cooperative games. In addition, we introduce a parameterized generalization of the Shapley value, the so-called semivalue. Since the standard model (or representation) of cooperative games, i.e. the characteristic function, is mathematically sophisticated, we discuss an alternative representation, the so-called Marginal Contribution Networks. For certain games, this representation allows the calculation of the Shapley value in polynomial time in the number of agents. Second, we define the basic notation of a graph and introduce elementary concepts related to the analysis of social networks, such as centralities and communities."}, {"heading": "2.1. Coalitional Games", "text": "The first class of games is one in which the players make decisions independently of each other. In the second class, a coalitional game consists of a series of players (or agents) A \"ta1, a2,. a,\" and the characteristic function, however: 2A \"R,\" which assigns each player a real value (or payout) indicating their performance, where the coalitional game g \"is a pair g\" pA \"in the characteristic function form.

The Shapley Value", "text": "In principle, there may be an infinite number of divisions of the value of the Grand Coalition among the players, but we are interested in those that meet certain desirable criteria. To illustrate these criteria, we introduce the concept of Marginal Support.

That is, we take into account four characteristics that a certain ownership scheme should fulfill. We denounce the ownership of players received by a player ai in the game pA-2 players. Symmetrical payouts are not dependent on the names of the players. That is, when a certain ownership scheme should be fulfilled."}, {"heading": "2.3. Semivalues", "text": "The Shapley value is designed to split the payout, which is equivalent to evaluating the power of agents in the cooperative game. However, if we focus only on the performance index of the players, we can drop the efficiency axiom. Semivalues introduced by Dubey et al. [1981] constitute an important class of performance indices, among which only the Shapley value fulfills the efficiency. To define semivalues, we will use the term of the limit contribution of player i to coalition C, which was introduced in definition 4.

One of the most interesting and highly intuitive techniques for displaying coalitional games was introduced by Ieong and Shoham [2005].

Using the additive property of the Shapley value, each basic rule can be considered separately as a game in itself.

The syntax of read-once Boolean formulas is the same as in General Marginal Contribution Networks, but each literal ai can occur only once.

Against this background, we present in this chapter the study of the computational aspects of the Shapley value for network centralities. Specifically, we develop accurate analytical formulas for Shapley value-based centrality in weighted and unweighted networks, and develop efficient (polynomial time) and exact algorithms based on them.

The key idea behind game-theoretic approach to network analysis is to treat nodes as players in a cooperative game, where the value of each coalition of nodes is determined by certain graph properties. Next, the centrality of any individual node is determined by a chosen game-theoretic solution concept (notably, the Shapley value) in the same way as the payoff of a player in a cooperative game. On one hand, the advantage of game-theoretic centrality measures is that nodes are ranked not only according to their individual roles but also according to how they contribute to the role played by all possible subsets of nodes. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that the game-theoretic solution concepts are typically computationally challenging. The main contribution of this dissertation is that we show that a wide variety of game-theoretic solution concepts on networks can be computed in polynomial time. Our focus is on centralities based on the Shapley value and its various extensions, such as the Semivalues and Coalitional Semivalues. Furthermore, we prove #P-hardness of computing the Shapley value in connectivity games and propose an algorithm to compute it.
