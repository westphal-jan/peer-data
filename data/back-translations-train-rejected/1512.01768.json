A Reddit Inspired Study on How to Pose Questions", "abstract": "Questions form an integral part of our everyday communication, both offline and online. Getting responses to our questions from others is fundamental to satisfying our information need and in extending our knowledge boundaries. A question may be represented using various factors such as social, syntactic, semantic, etc. We hypothesize that these factors contribute with varying degrees towards getting responses from others for a given question. We perform a thorough empirical study to measure effects of these factors using a novel question and answer dataset from the website Reddit.com. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such analysis of its kind on this important topic. We also use a sparse nonnegative matrix factorization technique to automatically induce interpretable semantic factors from the question dataset. We also document various patterns on response prediction we observe during our analysis in the data. For instance, we found that preference-probing questions are scantily answered.

CONCLUSION", "text": "Question-answers are an integral part of our everyday communication, and while some questions elicit a lot of answers, many others remain unanswered. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive empirical analysis to identify factors that elicit answers, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first such analysis of its kind. In particular, we focus on the online setting Multiple Inquirers Single Responder (MISR), where multiple users ask questions to a single respondent and the respondent has the choice not to answer a specific question. We used a novel dataset from the Reddit.com website and looked at several factors underlying the questions, namely orthographic, temporal, syntactic and semantic aspects. For semantic features, we used sparse, non-negative matrix factoring techniques to identify automatically interpretable latent factors, and this automated analysis enables us to observe some interesting and non-trivial trends."}, {"heading": "VII.
