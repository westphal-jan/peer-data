There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based approaches and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the vast interest on the theme and wide popularity of some methods, it is unclear which method is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message. Thus, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough apple-to-apple comparison of sentiment analysis methods, as they are used in practice, across multiple datasets originated from different data sources. Such a comparison is key for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods. This study aims at filling this gap by presenting a benchmark comparison of twenty one popular sentiment analysis methods (which we call the state-of-the-practice methods). Our evaluation is based on a benchmark of twenty labeled datasets, covering messages posted on social networks, movie and product reviews, as well as opinions and comments in news articles. Our results highlight the extent to which the prediction performance of these methods varies widely across datasets. Aiming at boosting the development of this research area, we open the methods' codes and datasets used in this paper and we deploy a benchmark system, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing sentence-level sentiment analysis methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Dec 2015 18:52:51 GMT  (233kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01818v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 00:32:23 GMT  (279kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01818v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 1 Feb 2016 18:54:51 GMT  (171kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01818v3", null], ["v4", "Sat, 4 Jun 2016 16:52:29 GMT  (185kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01818v4", null], ["v5", "Thu, 14 Jul 2016 22:51:39 GMT  (181kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01818v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["filipe nunes ribeiro", "matheus ara\\'ujo", "pollyanna gon\\c{c}alves", "fabr\\'icio benevenuto", "marcos", "r\\'e gon\\c{c}alves"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.01818"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.01818.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Benchmark Comparison of State-of-the-Practice Sentiment Analysis Methods", "authors": ["Pollyanna Gon\u00e7alves", "Matheus Ara\u00fajo", "Filipe Ribeiro", "Marcos Gon\u00e7alves"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": ""}, {"heading": "A Benchmark Comparison of State-of-the-Practice Sentiment Analysis Methods", "text": "Pollyanna Gonc alves, Federal University of Minas Gerais Matheus Arau jo, Federal University of Minas Gerais Filipe Ribeiro, Federal University of Minas Gerais and Federal University of Ouro Preto Fabr\u00ed \u0301 cio Benevenuto, Federal University of Minas Gerais Marcos Gonc alves, Federal University of Minas Gerais In recent years, thousands of scientific papers have examined mood analysis, several startups have emerged that measure opinions on real data, and a number of innovative products have been developed on the subject.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "Sentiment analysis has been an extremely popular tool, applied in several analytical domains, especially on the Web and social media. To illustrate the growth of interest in the field, Figure 1 shows the steady increase in the number of searches on the topic, according to Google Trends1, especially after the popularization of online social networks (OSNs). More than 7,000 articles have been written about sensation analysis and various startups that develop tools and strategies to extract sensations from text [Feldman 2013].The number of possible applications of such a technique is also considerable, many of them focusing on monitoring the reputation or opinion of a company or brand with the analysis of consumer products or services."}, {"heading": "2.

Focus on Sentiment Level", "text": "Since the sensation analysis can be applied to different tasks, we limit our focus to comparing those efforts related to the detection of polarity (i.e. positivity or negativity) of a given short text (i.e. sensor level).The detection of polarity is a common function of all sensation methods considered in our work and provides valuable information for a number of different applications, especially those that examine short messages that are commonly available on social media [Feldman 2013].Sentence level sentiment analysis can be performed under supervision (i.e. it requires labeled training data) or not. An advantage of the monitored methods lies in their ability to adapt and create trained models for specific purposes and contexts. A disadvantage is the need for labeled data, which can be very costly and even prohibitive for some tasks. On the other hand, the lexical methods make use of a predefined list of words in which each word is linked to a specific sensitivity depending on the context in which they are created."}, {"heading": "2.2.

A recent survey summarizes several of these efforts [Tsytsarau and Palpanas 2012] and concludes that a systematic comparison study implements and evaluates all relevant algorithms within the same framework, still lacking in the literature. As new methods emerge and compare themselves only with one or another method that uses different assessment data sets and testing methods, it is difficult to determine whether one method triumphs over the other."}, {"heading": "3.

scientific papers have explored sentiment analysis, several startups that measures opinions on real data have emerged, and a number of innovative products related to this theme have been developed. There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based approaches and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the vast interest on the theme and wide popularity of some methods, it is unclear which method is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message. Thus, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough apple-to-apple comparison of sentiment analysis methods, as they are used in practice, across multiple datasets originated from different data sources. Such a comparison is key for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods. This study aims at filling this gap by presenting a benchmark comparison of twenty one popular sentiment analysis methods (which we call the state-of-the-practice methods). Our evaluation is based on a benchmark of twenty labeled datasets, covering messages posted on social networks, movie and product reviews, as well as opinions and comments in news articles. Our results highlight the extent to which the prediction performance of these methods varies widely across datasets. Aiming at boosting the development of this research area, we open the methods\u2019 codes and datasets used in this paper and we deploy a benchmark system, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing sentence-level sentiment analysis methods.
