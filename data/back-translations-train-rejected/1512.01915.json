We characterize this relation in the standard context of imperfect information concurrent game. We assume that whenever a set of agents form a coalition to achieve a goal, they share their knowledge before acting. Based on this assumption, we propose new semantics for alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information and perfect recall. It turns out that this semantics is sufficient to preserve all the desirable properties of coalition ability in traditional coalitional logics. Meanwhile, we investigate how knowledge sharing within a group of agents contributes to its coalitional ability through the interplay of epistemic and coalition modalities.

First, the shuffler places a ball in one of the two bowls (the left (L) or the right (R)). The guessler g1 can observe what action the shuffler does, while the other guessler g2 cannot. A guessler or a coalition of two wins if it picks up the bowl containing the ball.

Compared to the existing alternative semantics, we have shown that our semantics can not only preserve the desirable characteristics of coalition ability in traditional coalition logic, but also provide a finer idea of perfect memory, in which an actor must remember both past states and past actions. More importantly, we have examined the interplay of epistemic and coalitional operators. In the future, we intend to investigate the computerized complexity of ATL with this new semantics, such as the problem of model verification. In this paper, we have examined how knowledge exchange within a group of actors contributes to their coalitional ability. This work can be seen as an attempt to investigate the question: What kind of group knowledge is required to achieve a goal in the context of imperfect information?"}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We are grateful to Heng Zhang for his valuable help, and special thanks to three anonymous referees for their insightful comments.

between knowledge shared by a group of agents and its coalition ability. We characterize this relation in the standard context of imperfect information concurrent game. We assume that whenever a set of agents form a coalition to achieve a goal, they share their knowledge before acting. Based on this assumption, we propose new semantics for alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information and perfect recall. It turns out that this semantics is sufficient to preserve all the desirable properties of coalition ability in traditional coalition logics. Meanwhile, we investigate how knowledge sharing within a group of agents contributes to its coalitional ability through the interplay of epistemic and coalition modalities. This work provides a partial answer to the question: which kind of group knowledge is required for a group to achieve their goals in the context of imperfect information.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
