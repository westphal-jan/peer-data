In this way, we can explicitly indicate what information is given by the game and what information is obtained from the players during the games, thus clarifying different interpretations of information sets in imperfect information games. We show that under certain (strong) conditions on the game structures, the distinction between rules and runs is negligible, why it is sometimes harmless to mix the two in practice. We propose a logic to think about game runs under two equivalent semantics, based on the ideas of the DEL and ETL. We also give a complete axiomatization of logic in order to syntactically capture the assumptions.

GDL-II is a simple yet elegant language of specifying game rules with imperfect information. GDL-II is given a semantics to compute the corresponding game runs with uncertainty in a very similar way to the update product in this paper. In GDL-II, a player i cannot distinguish two histories h and h\u2032 if i sees (a special predicate) exactly the same information provided by the game along h and h\u2032 and the local actions in h and h\u2032 for i are the same. Under synchronicity, the indistinguishability at the next stage of the game runs only depends on the indistinguishability at the previous stage and the local actions, which implicitly assumes (variants of) perfect recall and no miracles. On the other hand, GDL-II does not distinguish the assumptions about the players and the information provided by the game and assume a unique starting state which is common knowledge.
