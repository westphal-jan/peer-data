A map from one RYS S1 to another S2 is referred to as correspondence. (...) It is called a morphism if and only if it preserves the operations and results of the SNC. (...) We will also speak of such (...) morphisms and morphisms if the correspondence preserves only one of the partial / complete operations. (...) One problem with SNCs is that it is not possible to adequately capture the correspondence that makes the associated correspondence with elements representable and does not necessarily oblige the context to Galois connections. (...) One question with SNCs is that granulate can be centric correspondence that may violate the injectivity limitations and not be good with morphism definitions.

The operations used in semantics are very closely related and one might expect that the first of the three criteria is relatively clear, but the second and third are relatively significant in the intended use of semantics. The natural way of realizing the contamination of operations of relative basic operations would be determined by some concepts of definability or representability.
