Multilinear and polynomial parametric models", "text": "In this section we will first provide a generic definition of a parametric statistical model together with the term interpolating polynomia. We will then categorize parametric models according to the shape of their interpolating polynomials and show that many commonly used models fall into two classes. Although our methods are applied directly when the inputs of Y are random vectors, we will henceforth assume that their elements are univariate.Definition 1. Denote pta (y) y (y) the vector of the values of a probability mass function pta: Y \u2192 [0, 1] which depends on a choice of parameters."}, {"heading": "3. Sensitivity analysis in multilinear models", "text": "We mainly focus on disposable sensitivity methods. Although some preliminary work on reusable analyses is now available (5, 10), the calculation costs of such analyses are limited in practice. However, in Section 6 we present some novel results for this type of analysis. We now show that all results on disposable sensitivity analyses in BN models are directly extended to multilinear parametric models and therefore under much weaker assumptions about the structure of both the sample space and the underlying conditional dependence on dences.3.1. Covariation In disposable analyses, a parameter is directly varied within a model. If this is done, some of the remaining parameters must be varied to respect the sum-to-one condition, so that the resulting measurement is a probability measurement."}, {"heading": "4.

(F)"}, {"heading": "5. Sensitivity analysis in non-multilinear models", "text": "For multilinear models, we have created a unifying framework to perform different sensitivity analyses by deriving closed forms for both sensitivity functions and CD distance. Unfortunately, this is not possible for non-multilinear parametric models, as they depend on the degree of both indefinite and covaried parameters, which are not necessarily the same. However, the representation of the model by its interpolating polynomial factors enables us to study the central properties of both sensitivity functions and CD distance. As in Section 3, we are distinguished from the covaried parameters in which we represent the model by its interpolar polynomial factors."}, {"heading": "6. Multi-way sensitivity analysis in multilinear models", "text": "So far, we have focused on a one-way sensitivity analysis, which is most commonly performed in practice. We are now looking at reusable sensitivity methods, in which more than one parameter is varied simultaneously. We will first focus on a specific type of analysis, which is usually referred to as completely single CPT analyses. In this type of method, one parameter is given from each individual probability table, which contains a complete probability table. We are now generalizing the complete CPT method from BNs to general multilinear models. This type of analysis is easier than other reusable methods because the parameters are varied."}, {"heading": "7. Discussion", "text": "Defining a parametric model by its interpolating polynomial has proven useful in investigating how changes in the input probabilities affect an output of interest. We have shown that standard results for BN models apply to a large number of other models, such as context-specific BNs and square CEGs. Within this framework, the flexibility of interpolating polynomial representation allowed us to investigate an even larger class of models, such as DBNs and non-square CEGs, extending sensitivity methods to dynamic settings. Within this framework, both sensitivity functions and CD distances exhibit different characteristics than in the simpler multilinear case, with the potential for even more informative sensitivity investigations. We then demonstrated the optimality of the proportional covariation scheme in full conditional CPT analysis not only for BNs, but also for multilinear models that we have focused on the discrete function of probability models in terms of determining determinable probability."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Christiane Go \ufffd rgen was supported by the EPSRC scholarship EP / L505110 / 1, while Jim Q.

These methods usually focus on the study of sensitivity functions and on the impact of a parameter change to the Chan-Darwiche distance. Although not fully recognized, the majority of these results heavily rely on the multilinear structure of atomic probabilities in terms of the conditional probability parameters associated with this type of network. By defining a statistical model through the polynomial expression of its associated defining conditional probabilities, we develop a unifying approach to sensitivity methods applicable to a large suite of models including extensions of Bayesian networks, for instance context-specific and dynamic ones, and chain event graphs. By then focusing on models whose defining polynomial is multilinear, our algebraic approach enables us to prove that the Chan-Darwiche distance is minimized for a certain class of multi-parameter contemporaneous variations when parameters are proportionally covaried.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
