INTRODUCTION", "text": "In business analysis, measurements are often summarized, but often other aggregation measures, such as averages or discrepancies, are more appropriate. For example, the data set in Figure 1 includes employment statistics for the Australian states for 2007 and 2008; clearly, while the summation of the partitions by year may be appropriate, but the summation over the entire column is not. The result of a standard aggregation (sum) of these data is shown in Figure 2 in response to the user question: \"What are the values of the total volume employed by state?\" Figure 3 shows another sample data set that tracks information about credit requests received from a bank branch office. In an industry after industry analysis, the number of customers is added incorrectly (see Figure 4). Here, the addition of credit amounts makes sense for each industry, but the addition of the number of customers does not. This problem is usually avoided while IBM Canada.v extraction is performed by manually defining the standard aggregation behavior of the time before data stiching."}, {"heading": "2. CBR ARCHITECTURE", "text": "CBR has been successfully applied in many practical areas [Lamontagne and Plaza, 2014; Jalali and Leake, 2014; Chen et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2014; Freyne and Smyth, 2010; Jurisica, 1997]. The main idea in CBR is to draw parallels between a new case and cases that have already been resolved. Figure 5 shows an example case represented by characteristic values that need to be extracted; the action for each known case is defined and applied to the current case; the best action for the current case is selected on the basis of the most similar cases to the current case; that is, the current case is compared with the known cases by characteristic similarities and case features, then the action for the most similar case is selected from all known cases and applied to the current case. Figure 6 shows the architecture of our developed aggregated learner."}, {"heading": "3. EXTRACTED FEATURES", "text": "At the heart of our system, and of any CBR system, is a carefully selected feature that is used to measure the similarity of the current case to known cases (as shown in Figure 5).The role that each feature plays in the general similarity measurement (i.e., the feature weights) can be manually or automatically assigned to a number of optimization techniques similar to those used by Lamontagne and Guyard [2014].Table 1 shows the presentation of a case with the extracted features for the bank loan example in Figure 3. Our feature consists of factors that we found most useful in determining the standard aggregation behavior, in particular the following features: 1. Semantic annotations of measurement columns and rubric columns, similar to those defined in Rais-Ghasem et al. [2013] 2. Type of association between category columns and measurement columns; 3. Efficient variation of the code V as a reference to categories in the context."}, {"heading": "4. FEATURE SIMILARITY FUNCTION", "text": "The similarity function for each feature is defined as follows: feature 1 (column concepts): sim (f1 (c1), f1 (c2) = map (f1 (c1) and f1 (c2) = map (f1 (c1))) + map (f1 (c2), where c1 and c2 are case 1 and case 2 respectively; and f1 (ci) gives the value of feature 1 for case i. Note that feature 1 is the list of column concepts. In the formula above, card () gives the cardinality of each set. Effectively, the similarity is the number of common concepts (feature 1 values) for case 1 and case 2 divided by the total number of column concepts. If the two cases do not share a concept, the similarity is 0, and if the two cases are identical, the similarity is 1: The similarity is feature 1 (association type between columns) \u2212 feature 1: This similarity is defined by our experts as the similarity between two cases, if the similarity between two is the similarity between the two."}, {"heading": "5. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "We collected about 100 such use cases from IBM Watson Analytics and used 65% of them to be used as the known cases in our CBR system and the remaining 35% to evaluate our approach. Each case contains a question that is asked on a 2-dimensional datasheet in which we explicitly designate the category and measurement columns that are executed manually by our domain experts. We then extracted the three features described in Section 3 for all known cases in our CBR system. We then tested our approach using the remaining rating data. Our ratings use a \"majority voting scheme\" in which the top k-like cases are selected for the test case and the overall action for the test case is selected based on the most common overall action of these k-like cases. In extreme cases, if k = 1, the action of the most similar \"known\" case is selected as the total action for the test case and the total action of the most similar cases for the test case."}, {"heading": "5.1 Examples of experimental results", "text": "Here we isolate three test cases and their most similar cases as identified by our approach, illustrated in Table 5. In the first two cases, our approach was able to find the correct overall action, but our approach fails to learn the correct overall action in the third case. Our approach does not learn the correct overall action for test case 3 (code coverage of each component). The proposed measure of our approach is the sum instead of the last time span. The code coverage table retains the percentage of code that has been tested over time for each component of a software. Therefore, the correct overall action takes the last value. We believe that this error is caused by a small number of rows in the code coverage table. Specifically, the calculated CoV for data in the code coverage dataset does not represent the trend of code coverage values well enough."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a method for learning semi-additive behavior in data analysis tools, primarily IBM Watson Analytics, where these experiments were conducted. Specifically, we have introduced three features that are used in the case-based reasoning to learn aggregated actions in business analysis. Specifically, the data trend of a variable is an important factor that can be used to learn the standard aggregation of these variables. We calculated the data trend using the coefficient of variation (CoV), the use of which can empirically increase accuracy by up to 30%. Overall, our approach is capable of learning the standard aggregation of our test data with up to 90% accuracy. In this work, we used the same feature weights for all characteristics (all feature weights are 1.0). In the future, we intend to learn feature weights using optimization techniques such as linear programming, and collect more test cases to experiment our approach on larger data sets."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "This research is supported in part by a contribution from IBM Canada."}], "references": [{"title": "Sentiment and preference guided social recommendation", "author": ["Y.Y.
