By learning data from several mobile sensors, we detect nearness of the human body to a mobile device in a three-dimensional space with no physical contact with the device for non-invasive health diagnostics. We show that the human body generates wave patterns that interact with other naturally occurring ambient signals that could be measured by mobile sensors, such as, temperature, humidity, magnetic field, acceleration, gravity, and light.

However, it is rather unclear whether other sensors could also contribute to the prediction, and perhaps combining two or more sensors could lead to a better prediction of different activities. In this paper, we predict a novel activity related to the proximity or proximity of a human body without physically touching or holding the mobile device. As such, we refer to spatial proximity for distance detection as \"proximity detection,\" and thus to the fact that we are constantly able to detect the environment."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "Most related work has performed activity detection for a healthy lifestyle and fitness with the accelerometer [1], [4]. For example, [1] performed activity detection with the accelerometer on Android-based mobile devices. Multiple activities such as walking, jogging, standing, sitting, and climbing or descending stairs were predicted after learning a number of transformed features. Acceleration data was transformed into 43 learnable features. More recently, approach detection was introduced to develop several non-invasive diagnostic tools for the healthcare industry that use Body Area Network (BAN) techniques [5]. Our work differs from [1] in predicting the proximity or noticeable proximity of the human body to a mobile device. More recently, approach detection was introduced to develop several non-invasive diagnostic tools for the healthcare industry that use Body Area Network (BAN) techniques [5].

STEADY AND NON-STEADY SPACES", "text": "In this work, we identify a three-dimensional space as an inhabitable area that supports physical interactions between a human body and other objects in it. Steady and unstable spaces can be compared with the popular continuous and transient states of thermodynamics [6] and the processing of audio signals [7], where the output of a filter generates unstable sine waves before they lead to a steady sine wave of similar frequency, see Figures 2 and 3. Similarly, we propose that a space in a certain spatio-temporal window Sw could enter an unstable space within a certain time interval t1 \u2212 tn \u2212 1 and then enter an unstable space in another time interval t1 \u2212 tm \u2212 1 due to a sudden interference caused by a human body in unstable space."}, {"heading": "A. Steady Space", "text": "We refer to a continuous space as a three-dimensional space around a mobile device with measurable sinusoids for a certain period of time T. The continuous state excludes the presence or existence of a human body in close proximity to the mobile device, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 4 shows a continuous three-dimensional space with the sinusoidal output of a pressure sensor within a period of 60 seconds (i.e. T = 60s). As such, we define the characteristic of a continuous space asf (t) = Sn \u2211 i = 1 a sin\u03c9t + \u03bb (1), where Sn is the number of sinusoidal signals present, a the constant amplitude of each sinusoid, \u03c9 the frequency of each sinusoid, and \u03bb is a normalization parameter for each continuous space signal. 0 10 20 30 40 50 601 0 5.91 1 0 0 5.94 1 0 5.97Time (s) P res ure (h Pa) Fig = a continuous three-dimensional space with an iconstant pressure."}, {"heading": "B. Non-Steady Space", "text": "We identify an unstable space as a three-dimensional unstable space that enters into transient space as a result of the additional oscillation and radiation introduced by the entry of a human body into unstable space. Figure 5 thus shows an unstable three-dimensional space, again with the sinusoidal output of a pressure sensor within a period of 60 seconds (i.e. T = 60s). Thus, we define the characteristic of an unstable space asf (t) = Sn + H \u2211 i = 1 \u03b3 (t) sin\u03c9t + \u03bb (2), where H is the additional human oscillation or the additional signal introduced into the set of existing sinusoidal signals, \u03b3 (t) is the transient component introduced as a result of the introduction of H, \u03c9 is the frequency of each sinusoid, and \u03bb is a normalization factor for the sinusoids."}, {"heading": "IV. NEARNESS RECOGNITION", "text": "After defining the characteristics of continuous and unstable spaces, we propose to learn the characteristics to recognize human-mobile proximity. We propose that a person is likely to be near or in the immediate vicinity of a mobile device if the condition in Equation 2 is met. Furthermore, signals characterized by Equation 2 are also characterized by a similar and popular equation in speech signal processing [8]: 3 F (t) = g (t) ej\u03c9t + h (t), t = 0,... n \u2212 1 (3), where g (t) is the random amplitude, h (t) is a noise component and \u03c9 is defined as a transient frequency. In order to detect human-mobile proximity, one could learn the g (t), vi (t) and h (t) components where g (t) is the random amplitude. [9] Furthermore, research results have shown that the human body's electromagnetic state is generated by the three-dimensional wave sequence of the human body."}, {"heading": "A. Data Collection", "text": "We developed an Android application to log multiple sensor readings of a Samsung Galaxy S4 mobile device in a controlled environment. Sensors include pressure, gravity, accelerometer, ambient temperature, relative humidity, magnetometer, gyroscope, ambient light, and rotation vector. The data logged per measurement point includes the X, Y, Z coordinates of each sensor and the time stamp in milliseconds. Our controlled environment is a specific behavioral laboratory designed for conducting behavioral experiments related to humans. Therefore, we consider the behavioral laboratory to be a three-dimensional space, as discussed in Section III. As we propose to learn both continuous and non-continuous spaces, we conducted data acquisition in two phases. In Phase 1, a three-dimensional continuous space is simulated by running the data acquisition app with the mobile laboratory, which is placed on a table in the shared area of this human presence is not required."}, {"heading": "B. Data Transformation", "text": "It is essential to transform the raw time series values to produce different learnable characteristics [9]. As such, we use several statistical and numerical techniques to transform the data for each sensor. \u2022 Mean (\u00b5) [1]: Average of each coordinate X, Y and Zover is the total number of reading instances in a reading window. \u2022 Standard Deviation (SD) [1]: the standard deviation for each coordinate X, Y and Z is the total number of reading instances in each coordinate, r is a reading value, and Wr is the reading window set to 512. \u2022 Standard Deviation (SD) [1]: The default deviation for each coordinate X, Y and Z is the total number of reading instances in a reading window.SD (X, Y, Z) = distortion of the values we have."}, {"heading": "C. Features Set", "text": "Table I shows the combined characteristics resulting from the transformation processes used in the formation of various machine learning algorithms to predict a person's proximity to a mobile device."}, {"heading": "V. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "We conducted experiments using three different machine learning (ML) classifiers (algorithms) with the WEKA ML Platform with default settings [18]. The classifiers consisted of, Sequential Minimum Optimization (SMO), which is a variant of Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks with Multilayer Perceptron (NN-MP).To learn the classifiers, we used a meta-classification technique to reduce the functional space while discarding the less contributory functions. As such, we used the attribute selection algorithm, along with the ranking algorithm. Our Dataset1 consists of 1000 instances that are for stable space."}, {"heading": "A. Results and Discussion", "text": "In the first stage, we evaluated the predictive performance of the three ML classifiers in the control and near category with random 60% training and 40% test set, see Table II.In the second stage of our experiment, we evaluated the contributions of each sensor to predicting the near category with the SVM-SMO classifier using a 60% -40% portion on the 1000 instances. This means knowing which sensor is more effective for predicting (see Table II). As such, we removed the readings from each sensor individually and then classified them with all other sensors, see Table II. Using the SVM-SMO 79.4% F measurement as the initial value (see Table II), we identified which sensor did not improve the performance of the classifier. If a sensor is removed and the performance of the model increases by more than 79.4%, the sensor shows that the sensor does not improve the performance of the model."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We performed human-to-cell phone detection for non-invasive health diagnostics by analyzing and learning data from 9 different sensors on a mobile device. Multiple data transformations were performed to learn the unique characteristics of both continuous and non-continuous three-dimensional spaces that predict human proximity to a mobile device. Limitation of this work is the fact that the test data consists of sensor measurements that are limited to a controlled environment. It might be better to consider multiple uncontrolled environments, including a public space that could contain multiple ambient noise signals at different times of day and weather, and it might be difficult to execute the complex state-of-the-art ML algorithms on the devices. Thus, aggregated ambient sensor data could be sent in real time to a remote server where the trained model can be used for prediction and the results sent back to the device. In the future, we plan to incorporate the human respiratory interface with the same diagnostic technique."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "text": "This project was funded by the VITAL and Tropical Medicine and Biology Fellowships of Monash University Malaysia."}], "references": [{"title": "Activity recognition using cell phone accelerometers", "author": ["J.R.
