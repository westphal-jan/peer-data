Counter correlative, b) correlated substratum, c) adjunct limiting scope of correlated substratum, and e) relation between adjuncts in a and d. In the SNOMED-CT context, the steps would be: a). There is no heart attack, b) chest pain, c) coronary heart disease, d) coronary angiograms, e) whenever there is a heart attack. These relationships can be traced back through parent-child classes in SNOMED CT. Such a process, also known as logical implication, helps to draw conclusions in the description of logical terminologies. Entities in a class share characteristics of their parents. Since all classes inherit characteristics of their parents and some parents have, AIDS may have a reason that a child may have a limited extent of parental illness."}, {"heading": "2.2 Dataset preparation", "text": "All diseases and characteristics are identified by SNOMED CT unique ID. Characteristics are classified as one of the categories: a) concomitant in assertion and denial, b) concomitant in assertion alone c) concomitant in denial alone.

We use these vectors to find the weight of characteristics of certain diseases. If a characteristic and a certain disease have small differences in their vectors, then they are closely related. In contrast, characteristics and diseases in their vectors are very different. A high preference is given to those who are closely related. A low preference is given to those who have large differences. If a characteristic and a certain disease have an intermediate difference in their vector, they are preferred between the last two categories."}, {"heading": "2.5 Allocation of weights to features given disease", "text": "The preferences described here are used to weight disease characteristics in ranges from 0.09 to 0.81. Estimation is made in 3 steps: a). The preferences of disease characteristics are classified in tandem as described in Figures 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 (see Figure 3). b) The preferences of the characteristics that show the highest overall preference are classified as 0.81. The preferences of the characteristics that show the highest preference are indicated as 2.1 and 2.2, but as low as 2.3. Similar allocations are made for ranges from 0.36 to 0.54 and 0.09 to 0.27. Weight distribution in PAIRS is as shown in Figure 4. The large number of disease characteristics is in the range from 0.09 to 0.27 and only a few in the range from 0.54 to 0.81. This indicates that there are fewer confirmatory findings for diseases."}, {"heading": "2.6 Diagnostic decision support engine", "text": "The DDS engine is based on the variation method described 6 and is hosted on the web at www.ai-med.inge. A Natural Language Processor is developed using the SNOMED-CT algorithm and word marks, and its indexes are stored in a database. Transitive closure tables are used to find relationships to features and their synonyms from the PAIRS database for display. The application uses either text or XML files for diagnosis, and the diagnostic engine runs to generate lower limits and a transformation process to generate diagnostic possibilities. The 20 best options are presented in the form of infections, neoplasia, connective tissue disorders, or others."}, {"heading": "3.

The data is obtained by a three-step process as described in Figure 3. A large number of features (11,000) have weights in the range of 0.09 to 0.36, with a small number (1,000) of them having weights in the range of 0.63 to 0.81, indicating that there are fewer corroborative findings for diseases. A large number of features (16,569) are associated with assertion or denial. A small number of features (1828) are associated with assertion and denial (Figure 3). Logically, accompanying features are expected to be corroborating in assertion and denial, corresponding to a smaller number of features in the range of 0.63 to 0.81, as indicated and shown in Figure 4. Also, a large number of features in assertion or denial are expected to have a higher number of features in the range of 0.09 to 0.36 to 0.54, and in the range of 0.54 to 0.36 weights, as indicated in Figure 4."}, {"heading": "3.2 Quantitative analysis: estimation of weights using SNOMED CT", "text": "The hierarchy of the SNOMED-CT class is complex, and its multiple inheritances and over-use of Is-A type relationships preclude reasoning by descriptive logic 11. We are able to assign weight by introducing assertions and / or negations as a class for disease-related traits. Coupled with logical implications (or co-extensions) of disease-related traits, they give a hierarchical preference for weights. As shown in Figure 3, a large number of disease-related traits (13,031) do not share a system or organ, while a small number of them (2288) share the same system. Some disease-related traits (3078) share the same system, but no organ."}, {"heading": "3.3 Qualitative analysis: estimation of weights in PAIRS using SNOMED CT", "text": "PAIRS data use these weights in their DDS. Therefore, large-scale descriptive logic-based SNOMED CT terminologies can be used to arrive at conclusions such as diagnoses. As the principles proposed here are simple, they can be easily integrated into the existing architecture of any terminology."}, {"heading": "3.4 Evaluation of PAIRS", "text": "We used clinical cases of MGH in the New England Journal of Medicine to evaluate PAIRS. We are looking for the possibility of a diagnosis that appears in the top 20 of PAIRS diagnoses, and the actual diagnosis appears in 28 out of 30 cases in the top 20. Results are available at http: / / www.ai-med.in / cases / Further diagnostic evaluations of PAIRS are in progress."}, {"heading": "4. Discussion", "text": "SNOMED CT is a comprehensive terminology based on descriptive logic that has been developed since 1965. It gathers decades of knowledge from several thousand physicians around the world. Despite this enormous effort, there are shortcomings with regard to conclusions, and by introducing new inference classes in it, one can improve their performance. We used PAIRS as an example to show how to use SNOMED CT to assign weights to characteristics of certain disease. These weights are further used to make a diagnosis in DDS.Aristotelian logic uses 3 terms (main term, secondary term and middle term) to derive conclusions. A similar theory is proposed in Indian logic, and a comprehensive coverage of perception and conclusions has been available for over 5 millennia in the Sanskrit literature. Modern logic finds shortcomings in Aristotelian logic and several new theories on cause or conclusion."}], "references": [{"title": "Probabilistic diagnosis Using Reformulation of the Internist/QMR database", "author": ["Middleton", "Shwe", "M. et.al"], "venue": "Methods Inf Med", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1991}, {"title": "Variational probabilistic inference and the QMR-DT network", "author": ["Jaakkola.TS", "M.
