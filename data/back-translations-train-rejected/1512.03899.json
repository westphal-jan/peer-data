A quad is an extension of an RDF triple with contextual information of the triple. In this paper, we study the problem of query answering over quads augmented with forall-existential bridge rules that enable interoperability of reasoning between triples in various contexts. We call a set of quads together with such expressive bridge rules, a quad-system. Query answering over quad-systems is undecidable, in general. We derive decidable classes of quad-systems, for which query answering can be done using forward chaining. Sound, complete and terminating procedures, which are adaptations of the well known chase algorithm, are provided for these classes for deciding query entailment. Safe, msafe, and csafe class of quad-systems restrict the structure of blank nodes generated during the chase computation process to be directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of bounded depth. RR and restricted RR classes do not allow the generation of blank nodes during the chase computation process. Both data and combined complexity of query entailment has been established for the classes derived. We further show that quad-systems are equivalent to forall-existential rules whose predicates are restricted to ternary arity, modulo polynomial time translations. We subsequently show that the technique of safety, strictly subsumes in expressivity, some of the well known and expressive techniques, such as joint acyclicity and model faithful acyclicity, used for decidability guarantees in the realm of forall-existential rules.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Dec 2015 09:56:38 GMT  (314kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03899v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["mathew joseph", "gabriel kuper", "till mossakowski", "luciano serafini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.03899"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.03899.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Query Answering over Contextualized RDF/OWL Knowledge with Forall-Existential Bridge Rules: Decidable Finite Extension Classes (Post Print)", "authors": ["Mathew Joseph", "Gabriel Kuper", "Till Mossakowski", "Luciano Serafini"], "emails": ["kuper}@disi.unitn.it,", "serafini@fbk.eu,", "mossakow@iws.cs.uni-magdeburg.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 151 2.03 899v 1 [cs.D BKeywords: Contextualized Query Answering, Contextualized RDF / OWL knowledge bases, Multi-Context Systems, Quads, Query Answering, forall-existential rules, Knowledge Representation, Semantic Web"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it will be able to leave the country to return to the EU and leave the EU."}, {"heading": "2 Contextualized Quad-Systems", "text": "In this section, we formalize the concept of a quad system and its semantics as any number of Q elements.

In this paper, we study the problem of query answering over quads augmented with forall-existential bridge rules that enable interoperability of reasoning between triples in various contexts. We call a set of quads together with such expressive bridge rules, a quad-system. Query answering over quadsystems is undecidable, in general. We derive decidable classes of quad-systems, for which query answering can be done using forward chaining. Sound, complete and terminating procedures, which are adaptations of the well known chase algorithm, are provided for these classes for deciding query entailment. Safe, msafe, and csafe class of quad-systems restrict the structure of blank nodes generated during the chase computation process to be directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of bounded depth. RR and restricted RR classes do not allow the generation of blank nodes during the chase computation process. Both data and combined complexity of query entailment has been established for the classes derived. We further show that quad-systems are equivalent to forall-existential rules whose predicates are restricted to ternary arity, modulo polynomial time translations. We subsequently show that the technique of safety, strictly subsumes in expressivity, some of the well known and expressive techniques, such as joint acyclicity and model faithful acyclicity, used for decidability guarantees in the realm of forall-existential rules.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
