She has three alternatives: (i) she can visit John; (ii) she can visit her parents, who live near John's home; or (ii) she can watch a movie at home.

The agent typically defines a priori her desires and intentions, and only after this is done the system verifies their mutual consistency by using additional axioms. Such entities are therefore not interrelated with one another since \u201cthe notion of intention [. . . ] has equal status with the notions of belief and desire, and cannot be reduced to these concepts\u201d [Rao and Georgeff, 1991].
