This article presents Cerbere, a production system designed to perform online causal, temporal and epistemic reasoning based on the Event Calculus. The framework implements the declarative semantics of the underlying logic theories in a forward-chaining rule-based reasoning system, coupling the high expressiveness of its formalisms with the efficiency of rule-based systems. To illustrate its applicability, we present both the modeling of benchmark problems in the field, as well as its utilization in the challenging domain of smart spaces. A hybrid framework that combines logic-based with probabilistic reasoning has been developed, that aims to accommodate activity recognition and monitoring tasks in smart spaces.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Dec 2015 15:18:58 GMT  (1164kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04358v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 17:57:42 GMT  (1167kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04358v2", "Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["theodore patkos", "dimitris plexousakis", "abdelghani chibani", "yacine amirat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.04358"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.04358.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "An Event Calculus Production Rule System for Reasoning in Dynamic and Uncertain Domains", "authors": ["Theodore Patkos", "Dimitris Plexousakis", "Abdelghani Chibani", "Yacine Amirat"], "emails": ["dp}@ics.forth.gr", "chibani@u-pec.fr", "amirat@u-pec.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 151 2.04 358v 2 [csming.KEYWORDS: event calculation, rule-based thinking, intelligent environments"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "2 The Theoretical Foundations", "text": "The event is a narrative-based system of action and knowledge that deals with the effects of action and change, in which the nature of events points to changes in the environment, the way things continue over time, unless they are influenced by an event. It also relies on the technique of circumscription (Lifschitz, 1994) to support the principle of inertia for argumentation; a set of predicates is defined to express what constitutes the property of things that persist over time, when events occur (happenings) that are their effects (beginnings, terminations, terminations) and whether a flight is subject to the law of inertia (release date)."}, {"heading": "3 A Rule-Based Production System for the Event Calculus", "text": "In this section, we describe Cerbere, a universally accepted rule-based event calculator designed to perform causal, temporal, and epistemic reasoning tasks with information obtained at runtime.

Fig. 3 shows Cerbere's visual development environment through a typical interaction loop: The developer designs a domain axiomatization using an intuitive event calculation syntax (Fig. 3a) that divides the system into appropriate Jess rules (Fig. 3b) and finally, at execution time, the programmer is informed about the progress of the argumentation and the establishment of sound knowledge (Fig. 3c). The visual development environment allows the programmer to implement the mental state of rational agents on a more abstract level by modifying only event calculations and optionally specific rules of the Jess program for specialized tasks. New events and observations can be manipulated either manually, by interacting with the user interface, or through a Java interface that enables the system to automatically rationalize the incoming information from an older system before it can manipulate the incorporation or incorporation of incoming tasks."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Combining Reactive Reasoning with Multiple Models", "text": "Most reasoning tools for logic programming are capable of generating all valid models that are allowed by their semantics in the face of a particular instance of problem. ASP reasoning tools, for example, produce all the answers that are valid for a particular program. This is typically not the case for rule-based reasoners like Jess or drools, which are primarily used to implement the reactive behavior of a system. In the face of an occurring series of events, the triggering of rules in these systems typically occurs in a deterministic space, and therefore several alternative models are not generated. Cerbere, which is located on both the convergence of logical and rule-based reasoning, is designed to support multiple model generations. The use of released liquids that introduce a non-determinism in the truth value of liquids requires the creation of alternative conclusions.

Instead of implementing a parallel paraphrase of predicates, as applied by standard event calculations (NaF), and the semi-destructive updating of KB contained in our rules-based system, we offer a solution to the arithmetic framework problem without the need to write additional frame axioms to perform predicate completion (NaF). By using NaF, all flows that do not exist in KB are considered false by default; only flows held at a given time are stored as facts, effectively reducing the argumentation. The semi-destructive update of KB is an option that can be deactivated for the user, or the option to deactivate."}, {"heading": "3.3.3 Epistemic Reasoning", "text": "To illustrate the capacity of Cerbere, epistemic reasoning is needed to solve a problem that relates to complex ramifications and has expanded it in the context of partial observability. So-called Shanahan circuit, which is shown in Figure 4 (a), is a variation of Thielsher's circuit (Thielscher, 2000) that involves delayed effects and cyclic flowing dependencies: when initially open S1, but closed S2 and S3, it leads to radar ramification effects that cause light L to be illuminated and unilluminated time and again. Shanahan (1999), as well as Mueller (2006, p. 120), presents a correct behavior for this circuit with Event Calculus trigger axioms under complete world knowledge. However, a question that can be made in Shepanahan's original paper about the possible inferences requires explicit to be made explicit, requiring explicit, explicit requires explicit to be explained."}, {"heading": "4 Reasoning in Situation-aware Dynamic Environments", "text": "To illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed system, in this section we describe a hybrid framework for reasoning in intelligent spaces that integrate Cerbere.

On the one hand, so called data-driven approaches adopt primarily a probabilistic and statistical view of information and widely rely on the enormous impact of machine learning techniques in real-world applications (Lu and Fu, 2009; Singla et al., 2010). Their ability to learn from datasets and their capacity to model uncertainty are two of their distinctive characteristics. Knowledge-based approaches, on the other hand, model the rules of inference from first principles, rather than learned from raw data, and typically rely on formal specifications of their syntax and semantics, exploiting symbolic modeling and logic-based reasoning techniques. The expressive power, along with the capacity to verify the correctness properties of their axiomatizations, are key advantages of these methodologies. Data-driven methods are currently the mainstream choice to activity recognition; yet, many activities are characterized by constraints and relationships among context data that can neither be directly acquired from sensors nor can be derived through statistical reasoning alone (Riboni and Bettini, 2011). Even trivial user actions, such as the process of making coffee, pre-assume a significant extent of commonsense and domain knowledge with respect to their causal effects and ramifications. In addition, their compositions, often referred to as situations, have rich structural and temporal aspects, such as duration, frequency and subsumption relations. A seamless integration of data-driven with knowledge-based methodologies is essential for the materialization of smart spaces. Much of current research is working towards this end (e.g., (Riboni and Bettini, 2011; Roy et al., 2011; Helaoui et al., 2012; Skarlatidis et al., 2011). Moreover, activity and situation awareness only pose one step towards the implementation of intelligent environments. Reacting effectively on exceptional situations is equally important, requiring a coherent approach to inference, sensing and actuation, as pointed out by Pecora et al.
