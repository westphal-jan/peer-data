Referring to Table 1, our contribution focuses on the following steps illustrated in Figure 2: - Argumentation Modeling: The security case is created using GSN - Confidence modeling: We propose to comment on the GSN models and transform them into a trust network - Confidence estimation: Confidence in the network sheets is estimated and propogation formulas are used - Sensitivity Analysis: Effects of trust fluctuations are analyzed to identify weaknesses in the security case."}, {"heading": "4 Measuring Confidence", "text": "Trust can be used as a common concept for various theories, including probability and D-S. As in [1, 4], we define trust using the D-S approach. In this theory, a faith function is defined from the powerset P (ig) of possible events in [0; 1]. In this example, the faith function Bel is defined as the mass m of faith, which can have two values: Bel ({on} and P (ig) = {on}, {on}, {on}, {on}, {off}, \u2205}. In this example, the faith function Bel is defined as the mass m of faith like Bel ({off}) represents the credibility of the light that should be AN. As an example, a possible estimate would be Bel ({on}) = m ({on}) = 0.2, Bel ({off}) = uncertainty (off}) = m (off) = 0.5 etm (on, off}) = 0.3. If events are Boolean, as in this example, we can consider another epure (S) = two elements."}, {"heading": "5 Propagating Confidence", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.1 Argument Types", "text": "The very basic conclusion is the simplest: \"A is supported by B.\" Nevertheless, most arguments are more complex than direct one-to-one conclusions. Consider, for example, the example presented with the main claim \"A: System is usable,\" which is supported by both \"B: Tests are conclusive\" and \"C: Formal verification has been performed.\" In this case, we can expect both proofs to independently increase confidence in A. This concept is presented in [20] as an \"alternative argument\": even if there is no confidence in B, the fact that C also independently supports A will maintain a certain degree of confidence. Another form of conclusion is proposed in the GSN \"Pattern of Danger Avoidance,\" which is shown in Figure 1. In this case, the main objective \"System is Safe,\" depends on all the sub-targets together (we do not consider \"Strategy\" as a node because it is only a descriptive element)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Simple Argument", "text": "The basic conclusion \"A is supported by B\" can be applied to the cases (a) a target is refined to a sub-target and (b) a target is supported by evidence, as in Figure 6. In this case, the trust network is represented as a BBN, using two nodes and an edge. We suggest using the following table to describe the spread of confidence: g (B) 0 1 g (A) 0 pIn this table, trust in A is estimated if there is no trust in B (i.e. if g (B) = 0), then g (A) = 0 and if there is a maximum trust in g (B). In this case, trust in A depends on a factor p representing confidence in the conclusion \"A is supported by B.\" The final trust is achieved using this table as a probability table: g (A) = p \u0445 g (B). The result is a linear dependence (A) illustrated in Figure 6 taking into account different values for B (p)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Alternative Arguments", "text": "In this case, trust in A can be increased by trust in B and C. Such an approach could be applied to solutions or sub-goals (Figure 7. The strategy node is not part of the confidence network, as it only provides explanations for the decisions made to argue. We chose trust for this type of trust to use a leaky trust - or as defined in the theory of probability [8]. It was originally introduced in [23], and it is based on a logical OR between parent node (Yi) and a child node (X), but it implies the fact that the relationship between parent and child node is not necessary. The leaky effect corresponds to the fact that even if both parents (B and C) have a 0-value probability, there is still a \"leaky\" probability for the child."}, {"heading": "5.4 Complementary Arguments", "text": "Complementary arguments are used when a set of solutions or objectives are required at the same time to support the main objective q = 1. However, a weight is assigned to each element to evaluate its relative importance. For example, in the \"Hazard Avoidance Pattern,\" some hazards can have a lower impact on overall safety, and the lack of confidence in their treatment can lead to a lower reduction in the main confidence than for other more serious hazards. Multiple models are used in the literature for such arguments, such as simple And-Gate [7], or Noisy-And [18]. In our case, after several simulations, we have decided to define our own Noisy-And in order to obtain the trends that are relevant to the reasoning."}, {"heading": "5.5 Mixed Arguments", "text": "In fact, a context is actually a complementary element to the argument under consideration. Figure 10 is a complementary argument with a context also defined. In this case, the resulting network is a node A with three parents (B, C, D) and a noise and table for node A. If an alternative argument is used between B and C, then a subnode I _ BC with an alternative table for B and C. The confidence table in A is a noise table - and between D and I _ BC."}, {"heading": "5.6 Sensitivity Analysis", "text": "We propose to perform a sensitivity analysis using a Tornado chart. It is a simple statistical tool that shows the positive or negative influence of the basic elements on the main function. Basically, the Tornado analysis consists in estimating for each xi analysis [Xmin, Xmax], the values f (X1,..., Xi \u2212 1,... Xn), the values f (Xmin, Xmax], the maximum and minimum allowable values x. Therefore, for each xi we get an interval of possible variations of the function f. The Tornado graph is a visual representation with ordered intervals. In our case, we estimate the intervals g-values with Xmin = 0 and Xmax = If we take the example of alternative arguments, with arbitrary q-values = 0.7 = 0.7 = we estimate the following values."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We argue that it is important to have a separation between the security case and the trust case. Our goal is to analyze uncertainties that can arise in a security case, using sensitivity analysis. Our approach is based on the Dempster-Shafer theory for the definitions of trust and uncertainty. However, the constraint m (X, X) = 0 brings the main advantage of using mathematical tools, such as BBN. Therefore, for most common security case models in GSN, we have proposed some transformation rules in a trust network. In particular, we introduce the use of loud or alternative arguments and an adapted version of loud and complementary arguments. An experiment on a real case study of a rehabilitation robot [15] has been carried out. [9] A trust chart of 65 nodes has been identified with only two alternative arguments (all the others were complementary). Full analysis is still in development, but we were able to compute this complete result, a trust chart with only a few trustworthy ones and a trust chart."}], "references": [{"title": "A systematic approach to justifying sufficient confidence in software safety arguments", "author": ["A.
