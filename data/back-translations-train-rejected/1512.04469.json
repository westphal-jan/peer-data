To do so, the DYCOS algorithm makes use of the structure of the graph as well as content which is assigned to the node. Aggarwal and Li measured in an experimental analysis that DYCOS adds the missing labels to a Graph with 19396 nodes of which 14814 are labeled and another Graph with 806635 nodes of which 18999 are labeld on one core of an Intel Xeon 2.5 GHz CPU with 32 G RAM within less than a minute.

It works on graphs whose nodes are partially labeled, and adds automatic labels for nodes that do not yet have labels. This process is called \"classification,\" using the structure of the graph and textual information associated with the nodes. Experimental analysis described in [AL11] showed that even on dynamic graphs with 19,396 and 806 635 nodes, of which only 14,814 and 18,999 were labeled, it can run on a core of an Intel Xeon 2.5 GHz CPU in less than a minute."}, {"heading": "32 G RAM ausgef\u00fchrt werden kann.

Motivation", "text": "Partially labeled graphs are ubiquitous. Publication databases with publications as nodes, references and quotations as edges and user-assigned labels (so-called tags) or categories as node labels; Wikipedia with articles as nodes, links as edges and categories as node labels as well as social networks with user properties as node labels are three examples of this. Often, node labels are only partially available and it is desirable to fill in the missing node labels automatically."}, {"heading": "B.

Definition 1 (node classification problem) Be Gt = (Vt, Et, VL, t) a directed graph, where Vt denotes the set of all nodes, Et Vt \u00b7 Vt the edge set and VL, t'Vt the set of described nodes at the time t. Also, Lt is the set of all labels assigned at the time t and f: VL, t \u00b2 Lt is the function that maps a node to its label.

Herausforderungen", "text": "The graphs for which this algorithm was designed are many 10,000 nodes large and dynamic. \"Dynamic\" means in this context that new nodes and possibly also new edges can be added or edges or nodes can be removed. In addition, textual content is available for the nodes that can be used in the classification. In case of small changes, not everything should have to be calculated again, but based on previously authorized node labels, the classification should be adapted."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "Both the problem of node classification and that of text classification has already been analysed in different contexts, but so far it seems to be either the structure of the underlying graph or only the properties of the texts used. Thus, in [BCM11], [SJ01], among other things, methods for node classification are described, which are described like the DYCOS algorithm presented in [AL11], which is the subject of this elaboration, also based on random paths.Although there are also some papers on text classification [ZG02], [JCSZ10], none of them deal with the specific case of text classification with an underlying graph.The given methods for text classification also vary greatly. There are procedures based on the bagof words model [costelle12] how it is classified."}, {"heading": "III.

Anzahl der Knotenbeschriftungen", "text": "The way the DYCOS algorithm was introduced, only graphs with a maximum of one label can be edited. However, in many cases, such as Wikipedia with categories as node labels, nodes have many labels. At first glance, this weakness is easy to fix, since counting the node labels counts every label for each node. Then, there is the question of how many labels the affected node should be labeled with. However, in Wikipedia articles, for example, a hierarchy is defined on the node. Thus, the category \"classification method\" is a subcategory of \"classification.\" When categorizing articles, specific categories are absolutely preferable, and one cannot simply count for this category as well as for the category \"classification.\""}, {"heading": "B. \u00dcberanpassung und Reklassifizierung", "text": "Aggarwal and Li do not describe in [AL11] to which node the classification algorithm should be applied.
