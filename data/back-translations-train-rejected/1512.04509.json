DAMODHAR RAO, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and TechnologyRecently, an algorithm was discovered that separates points in the n-dimension by planes so that no two points remain separated by at least one plane [1-3]. By using this new algorithm, we show that there are two types of classification by a neural network, for a large dimensional space, both of which are non-iterative and deterministic. To demonstrate the power of these two methods, we apply them exhaustively to the classic pattern recognition problem: The Fisher-Andersons, IRIS flower data set and present the results. These methods are now widely expected to be used for forming neural networks for deep learning, not only because of their non-iterative and deterministic nature, but also because of their efficiency and speed."}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to trump themselves, and they are able to trump themselves, \"he said in an interview with the New York Times."}, {"heading": "2.1. An application to Data Classification and Retrieval", "text": "Suppose you have N points in an n dimension X-space and the algorithm was used to separate all N points, and it was determined after running the algorithm that q levels were finally necessary. We will now show that this information can be used as a data retrieval device. That is, all data can now be stored in such a way that the retrieval can be performed on the other side with great efficiency. 2It is assumed that each level will have a specific (defined) normal direction, a point that lies on the positive side of normality is said to be on the positive side of the plane when the point on the other side is said to be on the negative side. This direction is easy to find if the equation of the plane is known, for example, if 1 + \u03b11x1 + \u03b1x2 +..., + \u03b1xn = 0 is the equation to a certain dimensional plane."}, {"heading": "2.2.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we used a new algorithm that separates points in ndimensional space by planes to develop non-titerative classification techniques to solve pattern recognition problems using neural networks. Methods developed in this paper are very new and will be applied in neural research and deep learning, not only because of their non-titerative and deterministic nature, but also because of their efficiency and speed. It is strongly believed that they have the potential to replace other classification methods that are iterative in nature and rely on error minimization."}, {"heading": "5.

By using this new algorithm we show that there are two ways of classification by a neural network, for a large dimension feature space, both of which are non-iterative and deterministic. To demonstrate the power of both these methods we apply them exhaustively to the classical pattern recognition problem: The Fisher-Anderson\u2019s, IRIS flower data set and present the results. It is expected these methods will now be widely used for the training of neural networks for Deep Learning not only because of their non-iterative and deterministic nature but also because of their efficiency and speed and will supersede other classification methods which are iterative in nature and rely on error minimization.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
