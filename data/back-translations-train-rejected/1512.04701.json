We present a hierarchical And-Or graph (AOG) to jointly represent the latent structure of both texts and visuals. The AOG embeds a context sensitive grammar that can describe the hierarchical composition of news topics by semantic elements about people involved, related places and what happened, and model contextual relationships between elements in the hierarchy. We detect news topics through a cluster sampling process which groups stories about closely related events. Swendsen-Wang Cuts (SWC), an effective cluster sampling algorithm, is adopted for traversing the solution space and obtaining optimal clustering solutions by maximizing a Bayesian posterior probability. Topics are tracked to deal with the continuously updated news streams. We generate topic trajectories to show how topics emerge, evolve and disappear over time. The experimental results show that our method can explicitly describe the textual and visual data in news videos and produce meaningful topic trajectories. Our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on both a public dataset Reuters-21578 and a self-collected dataset named UCLA Broadcast News Dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Dec 2015 10:01:37 GMT  (2503kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04701v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["weixin li", "jungseock joo", "hang qi", "song-chun zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.04701"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.04701.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Joint Image-Text News Topic Detection and Tracking with And-Or Graph Representation", "authors": ["Weixin Li", "Jungseock Joo", "Hang Qi", "Song-Chun Zhu"], "emails": ["hangqi}@cs.ucla.edu", "sczhu@stat.ucla.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Index Terms - Multimedia News Topic Detection and Tracking, And-Or-Diagram, Clustersampling.F"}, {"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "1.1 Motivation and Objective", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "1.2 Overview of Our Method", "text": "Fig. 1 provides an overview of our theme detection and tracking methodology, including both message videos and closed captions (texts) as input into our methodology.

We aim to identify topics within short periods of time and generate long-term news histories. Therefore, we can show both detailed descriptions of each topic over different periods of time, as well as how each topic evolves over time. It also helps to avoid the heavy computation that occurs by periodically identifying topics using the entire updated news collection. To identify topics, we group stories that work on the same topics. The proposed AOG explicitly describes components of different topics, so we can effectively group related stories and generatemeaningful topics based on the AOG. We solve the grouping problem by clustering methods by maximizing a downstream probability. An efficient cluster sampling algorithm introduced in image segmentation, i.e. SwendsenWang Cuts (SWC) [17], shows temporary topics."}, {"heading": "1.3 Summary of Contributions", "text": "This paper contains the following contributions: \u2022 We have proposed a common image-text composition for a common text theme, based on And-Or diagrams that make better use of multimodal data and provide interpretations with an appropriate amount of detail compared to single-modal methods and other representations [1], [3], [6], [8], [18], [19]. \u2022 We solve the issue of topic recognition with the clustering sampling method Swendsen-Wang Cuts, which performs better than commonly used greedy algorithms [3], [6], [8], [20]. \u2022 We identify and track topics simultaneously over time by generating both topic summaries in different time periods and long-term themes. The results show how topics evolve over time and provide useful data for further media analysis, with 4 topics hardly being fulfilled by traditional recognition methods. \u2022 We have compiled a message database for a common text-theme-picture-theme."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "Our work focuses on the following four lines of research: (1) Topic Modeling, (2) Topic Clustering, (3) Topic Tracking and (4) News Collecting and Delivery Systems."}, {"heading": "2.1 Topic Modeling", "text": "Among the large number of methods of topic modeling, probabilistic topic models [21], [2] and their extensions [23], [24], [25], [4], [26], [27] are effectively used to identify and analyze latent topics. Although these methods are effective in general topic modeling, they can hardly perform well in the news field by using only the sack-of-words representation (BoW), which is mathematically efficient but ignores the compositional structures that are important for news analysis. News stories are generally driven by events, so information from aspects such as \"who,\" \"where\" and \"what\" is crucial for summarizing these stories and generating significant news topics. Newman et al. [28] considered these aspects, but included them as a whole. Li et al. [29] used information from the above aspects in their image representation assumes that they are generally only relevant to actual data."}, {"heading": "2.2 Topic Clustering", "text": "They assume that every news story talks about a news event that corresponds to a topic. A large number of methods for topic capture in topic capture and tracking (TDT) research [15] (e.g. [1], [34]) use cluster methods to detect news topics that collect stories on the same topic. Traditional cluster methods [5] can also be used for topic capture, but most of these methods are one-modular and mainly focus on the text domain. Multimodal topic cluster methods have been proposed by taking both texts and visualizations into account. In most of these methods, texts are presented with the BoW representation [8], [36], [7]. For visual representation, some methods are presented using the color histograms of the keyframes [8]."}, {"heading": "2.3 Topic Tracking", "text": "The traditional topic-tracking problem in TDT [15], [1] is defined as the process of finding related additional stories for some topics that have already been learned. Many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, such as those in [15], [37], [38]. However, deciding on the topic of each new story based on the topics learned previously can take a long time in a large data set. Furthermore, they can hardly deal with the newly emerging topics. In the community of probability models, some models also contain time information, such as the Dynamic Topic Model (DTM) [4], which can model theme development over time. However, the topics are assumed to exist over the entire period, which is not usually true in news broadcasts. It also leads to extensive calculations for constantly updated new flows. Instead of using the previous two methods, we opt to link the news topics identified in different time periods and follow the themes over time."}, {"heading": "2.4 News Gathering and Delivering System", "text": "In [41], [42] Chang et al. introduced a system called News Rover to integrate multimodal news sources. News topics are collected from sources such as Google News and organized into a hierarchical topic structure, and news stories are then assigned to those topics. Another personalized news video system, Own News [43], [44], can aggregate news videos from multiple sources, matching the extracted news stories with online news articles to obtain the corresponding news categories.

To obtain the face component, we first perform face recognition and extract facial features based on local binary patterns, and then we use the k-mean algorithm to group the faces into groups. To obtain the object component, we first extract patches from images that can generate possible object locations. We then obtain the patch features using Caffe [49], an open source implementation of the deep convolution network trained on over a million images that come with 1,000 ImageNet [50] classes.

These text-image word pairs are marked by djointi = [(w1, w2). The term scorejoint (djointi, w2) in Eq. 2 describes the contextual relationships between the text part and the image part.

We present this cluster problem as a graph distribution problem in which news stories are divided into coherent groups (max.) as vertices in the neighborhood diagram. We show an example of the neighborhood diagram in Fig. 6. Edges in the neighborhood diagram are associated with certain weights that correspond to related similarities. Partitions can be achieved by dividing the vertices into groups with specific properties and also keeping the number of edges between separated components small. Graph partitioning can help detect the news topic because even when news stories from a topic evolve over time and drive the topic, they can still be summarized by linking contiguous stories with minor changes and similar sub-ranges."}, {"heading": "4.2 Inference by Swendsen-Wang Cuts", "text": "It is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that can efficiently scan the solution space. An alternative method will therefore solve the coupling problem of the Gibbs sampler algorithms (which select a single vertex label) by jumping quickly between local minima. SWC starts with an initial partition that sets the labels of a group of vertices at the same time. So it can solve the coupling problem of the Gibbs sampler components (which move a single vertex label) by jumping quickly between local minima. SWC starts with an initial partition that puts all stories in the same group, or can be set randomly. We refer to the series of edges whose related two vertices belong to the same group."}, {"heading": "5 TOPIC TRACKING", "text": "In this section, we describe our method of tracking a variable number of topics that are detected in certain continuous periods of time. [15] Unlike the traditional topic tracking problem [15], where the topic to be followed is provided and the task is to determine whether new stories belong to the given topic, we instead link all captured topics in different periods of time to form topic paths over time. Then, based on the trajectories, we can perform further analyses, such as the analysis of sentiment / emotion topics that evolve with the topic. We divide the entire news data collection into several subcollections that consist of news stories in different periods of time. Topic collection is performed separately within each subcollection. Subcollection of the news corpus D is defined by {C1,..., CM} where the C1 components of the CM = D and M are the number of subcollections. Each subcollection contains news documents containing news models from a certain period of time."}, {"heading": "6 EXPERIMENTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1 Datasets", "text": "Two sets of data are used in our experiment: 1) Reuters-21578.

Two metrics are then used to evaluate cluster performance, i.e. accuracy and normalized mutual information.

Accuracy is then defined as the percentage of documents that have the correct cluster identification after mapping. Mutual information measurement measures the interdependence of cluster assignments and the obtained cluster assignments for the documents. Normalized mutual information is a standardized version of this unit of measurement. Further details of the definitions of these two metrics can be found in [53].

We use the And-Or graph as a structured representation of topics that jointly models the image and text portions of topics. We identify topics using the SWC-based cluster sampling method. Topics are also tracked over time to cope with the continuous updates of news flows. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation results show both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method for topic identification and tracking. In the future, we intend to expand our study to the problem of media analysis for social and political science research. Based on our topic recognition and tracking results, we can analyze how media tends to be for different topics, what is the agenda-setting pattern, what are the causal relationships between topics, etc."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This project is supported by the NSF CDI Project CNS 1028381.

tracking topics in broadcast news. We present a hierarchical And-Or graph (AOG) to jointly represent the latent structure of both texts and visuals. The AOG embeds a context sensitive grammar that can describe the hierarchical composition of news topics by semantic elements about people involved, related places and what happened, and model contextual relationships between elements in the hierarchy. We detect news topics through a cluster sampling process which groups stories about closely related events. Swendsen-Wang Cuts (SWC), an effective cluster sampling algorithm, is adopted for traversing the solution space and obtaining optimal clustering solutions by maximizing a Bayesian posterior probability. Topics are tracked to deal with the continuously updated news streams. We generate topic trajectories to show how topics emerge, evolve and disappear over time. The experimental results show that our method can explicitly describe the textual and visual data in news videos and produce meaningful topic trajectories. Our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on both a public dataset Reuters-21578 and a self-collected dataset named UCLA Broadcast News Dataset.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
