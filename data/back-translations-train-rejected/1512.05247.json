While this variety is useful to widen the application potential, each variant requires a new algorithm for finding the stable matchings. To address this issue, we propose an encoding of the SMP using answer set programming (ASP), which can straightforwardly be adapted and extended to suit the needs of specific applications. The use of ASP also means that we can take advantage of highly efficient off-the-shelf solvers. To illustrate the flexibility of our approach, we show how our ASP encoding naturally allows us to select optimal stable matchings, i.e. matchings that are optimal according to some user-specified criterion. To the best of our knowledge, our encoding offers the first exact implementation to find sex-equal, minimum regret, egalitarian or maximum cardinality stable matchings for SMP instances in which individuals may designate unacceptable partners and ties between preferences are allowed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 16:59:14 GMT  (50kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05247v1", "Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1302.7251"]], "COMMENTS": "Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1302.7251", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sofie de clercq", "steven schockaert", "martine de cock", "ann now\\'e"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.05247"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.05247.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Solving Stable Matching Problems using Answer Set Programming", "authors": ["SOFIE DE CLERCQ", "STEVEN SCHOCKAERT", "MARTINE DE COCK"], "emails": ["SofieR.DeClercq@ugent.be)", "SchockaertS1@cardiff.ac.uk)", "MDeCock@u.washington.edu)", "ANowe@vub.ac.be)"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 151 2.05 24KEYWORDS: Programming of answers, logic rules, stable marriage problem, optimal stable matches"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to move into another world, in which they are able to move into another world, in which they are able to move into another world, in which they are able to move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they are able to live, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they, in which they are"}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.1 The Stable Marriage Problem", "text": "To solve the original SMP, Gale and Shapley (Gale and Shapley 1962) have built a stable algorithm structure (Gale-Shapley algorithm, G-S algorithm, or deferred acceptance algorithm - to calculate a particular stable matching procedure of an SMP instance) that works as follows: in turn 1, every man proposes his first choice of all women. A woman, when proposed, then rejects all men, but her first choice among men who have proposed a temporary husband to her. In the next rounds, all rejected men propose their first choice among women who have not yet rejected them, regardless of whether that woman already has a temporary husband if she then rejects all men, but her first choice among men who have proposed only her and her temporary partner.

In this section, we model the SMTI using ASP. A few suggestions for using non-monotonous reasoning for modeling the SMP have already been described in the literature. (Marek et al. 1990) mentions a specific variant of the SMP (in which boys each know a subset of a group of girls and want to be associated with a girl they know) and in (Dung 1995) an abductive program is used to find a stable matrimonial matching in which two fixed persons are paired with strict, complete preference lists. To the best of our knowledge, beyond a few specific examples, no comprehensive study is done on the use of ASP or related paradigms in this context. In particular, the universality of our ASP framework for weak stable pairings of SMTI instances allows us to easily adjust the coding of 1962 (the problem of the Gomromate, the SMP)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Modeling the 3-Dimensional SMTI in ASP", "text": "To further illustrate the flexibility of our ASP approach, we look at a variant of the SMP and show how small adjustments to the ASP coding can solve this variant. Extending the SMP by adding another dimension to the problem was first proposed in (Knuth 1976). We work out the three-dimensional SMTI lists of men, in which n men should match p women and r children. Definition 1 can be generalized directly to a three-dimensional problem (SM, SW, SC), in which preference lists of men are defined by the set of woman-child pairs and similarly the women have preferences over man-child pairs and the children have preferences over manwoman pairs. In the three-dimensional case, the list of disjoint subsets of {1,., p} behaves."}, {"heading": "4 Selecting Optimal Stable Matchings", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Notions of Optimality of Stable Matchings", "text": "S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-"}, {"heading": "4.2 Finding Stable Matchings using Disjunctive Naf-free ASP", "text": "As discussed in Section 4.3, we can design our ASP coding in combination with a disjunctive ASP program so that the optimal stable partnerships correspond to the responses of an associated ASP program.

Our technique for extending this program to a program that can each optimize the cost of gender equality is very similar in any case. We start by accepting it in the case of gender equality. Our first step is to add a set of rules that can calculate the gender equality of a series of marriages. For each man mi and each x x acceptable leiM {mi} we use the following rule to determine the cost of mi: mancost (i, cmi))))) we accept (mi, x) (6) and similarly for each x acceptable j W. \""}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In addition to the availability of efficient ASP solvers, the main advantage of our approach is its flexibility, which allows us to find solutions to a wide range of stable matching problems. For example, we can calculate stable matching solutions for variants such as the three-dimensional stable matching problem and select stable matching solutions based on optimality criteria, even for problems with unacceptable partners and attachments. We have illustrated our method for gender equality, egalitarianism, minimum remorse and maximum cardinality, but the approach can easily be adapted to other optimality criteria (e.g. popular matching solutions) or to different matching problems (e.g. the roommate problem). To the best of our knowledge, there are no other exact algorithms to find an optimal stable matching solution for an SMP instance with attachments, regardless of whether the optimum preference is gender equality, egalitarianism, maximum duration for coexactness or first assortment."}], "references": [{"title": "Popular matchings", "author": ["D.

introduction of the stable marriage problem (SMP) by Gale and Shapley (1962), several variants and extensions have been investigated. While this variety is useful to widen the application potential, each variant requires a new algorithm for finding the stable matchings. To address this issue, we propose an encoding of the SMP using answer set programming (ASP), which can straightforwardly be adapted and extended to suit the needs of specific applications. The use of ASP also means that we can take advantage of highly efficient off-the-shelf solvers. To illustrate the flexibility of our approach, we show how our ASP encoding naturally allows us to select optimal stable matchings, i.e. matchings that are optimal according to some user-specified criterion. To the best of our knowledge, our encoding offers the first exact implementation to find sex-equal, minimum regret, egalitarian or maximum cardinality stable matchings for SMP instances in which individuals may designate unacceptable partners and ties between preferences are allowed.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
