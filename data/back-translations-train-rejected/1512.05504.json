Our model is motivated by the fact that in many settings, agents cannot express the numerical values of their utility for different outcomes, but are still able to rank the outcomes in their order of preference. Specifically, we study problems where the ground truth exists in the form of a weighted graph of agent utilities, but the algorithm receives as input only a preference ordering for each agent induced by the underlying weights. Against this backdrop, we design algorithms to approximate the true optimum solution with respect to the hidden weights. Perhaps surprisingly, such algorithms are possible for many important problems, as we show using our framework based on greedy and random techniques. Our framework yields a 1.6-approximation algorithm for the maximum weighted matching problem, a 2-approximation for the problem of clustering agents into equal sized partitions, a 4-approximation algorithm for Densest $k$-subgraph, and a 1.88-approximation algorithm for Max TSP as long as the hidden weights constitute a metric. Our results are the first non-trivial ordinal approximation algorithms for such problems, and indicate that in many situations, we can design robust algorithms even when we are agnostic to the precise agent utilities.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Dec 2015 09:29:48 GMT  (36kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05504v1", "This paper contains the results that appeared in a AAAI'16 paper along with several new results for other problems"], ["v2", "Mon, 1 Aug 2016 21:29:51 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05504v2", "This paper contains the results that appeared in a AAAI'16 paper along with some new results for other problems"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper contains the results that appeared in a AAAI'16 paper along with several new results for other problems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["elliot anshelevich", "shreyas sekar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.05504"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.05504.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 151 2.05 504v 2 [cs.G T] 1A ug"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "Model and Problem Statements", "text": "We assume that the input preference orders are derived from a set of underlying hidden edge weights (w (x, y), which are considered the basis for the down-to-earth truth not known to the algorithm.

First, different sets of edge weights can lead to the same preference order, and in addition, the optimal matching may be different for each of these weights. Therefore, unlike the full information setting, no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can calculate the optimal matching solely on the basis of ordinal information. More generally, the limitation that only ordinal information is available excludes almost all known algorithms for calculating a match. So what kind of algorithms only use preference orders? An algorithm that can still be implemented is a version of the extremely popular greedy matching algorithm, in which we select successive pairs of agents that choose each other as their best choice. Another trivial algorithm consists in randomly selecting a matching: This certainly does not require numerical maximum information! Generally, it is not difficult to show that both algorithms are actually complemented by the risk of delivering a better result."}, {"heading": "Our Contributions", "text": "Our main results are summarized in Table 1. All the problems we are investigating have a rich history of complete information setting algorithms. As seen in the table, our ordinal algorithms provide approximation factors that are closest to those best known for complete information versions. In other words, we show that it is possible to find good solutions to such problems even without knowing the true weights by using only ordinal preference information.Our central result in this paper is an ordinal 1.6 approximation algorithm for maximum weight match, which is achieved by carefully linking greedy and random comparisons. We also present a deterministic 2 approximation algorithm for max k-matching = N2 is the same as the MWM problem. We also offer a general possibility to use matching algorithms as a black box to form ordinal approximation algorithms for other problems: Given an ordinal alpha approximation algorithm for maximum weight, we show the problem is an overmatch for the MWM problem."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "By and large, the abundance of algorithms proposed in the matching literature is one of two classes: (i) ordinary algorithms that ignore agent services and focus on (unquantifiable) axiomatic properties such as stability, and (ii) optimization problems where the numerical utilities are fully specified. In our view, algorithms belonging to the former class, with the exception of Greedy, are not resulting in good approximations for the hidden optimum, while the techniques used in the latter (e.g. [11, 12]) depend heavily on improved cycles and are therefore unsuitable for ordinary settings. A notable exception to the above dichotomy is the class of optimization problems that study ordinal measures of efficiency [1, 9], for example, the average rank of an agent partner in matching. Such settings often include the definition of \"new service functions\" that are based on our model and therefore different from our preference."}, {"heading": "2 Framework for Ordinal Matching Algorithms", "text": "In this section, we present our framework for developing ordinal approximation algorithms and set tight upper and lower limits on the performance of algorithms that randomly select matching edges either greedily or uniformly. As a simple consequence of this framework, we show that the algorithms that greedily or randomly select all edges both provide a 2 approximation to the maximum weight fit. In the following section, we show how we can improve this performance by greedily or randomly selecting some edges. Finally, we note that for convenience and brevity, we often assume N to be even and sometimes divisible by 3. As we discuss in the appendix, even if this is not the case, our results still apply with only minor changes."}, {"heading": "Fundamental Subroutine: Greedy", "text": "We start with algorithm 1, which describes a simple greedy procedure for the output of a matching system: at each stage the algorithm selects an edge (x, y) (x, y) (x, y) (x, y) (x, y) (x, y) (x, y) (x, y) (x, y) (x, y) (x, y) (x)."}, {"heading": "Fundamental Subroutine: Random", "text": "It is not that we remove all edges from E (x, y) to MR (x, y) to MR (x, y) all edges from E (x, y), the x or y from E (endAlgorithm 2: Random k-Matching AlgorithmLemma 2.5.

Unfortunately, since we do not have access to the weights themselves, we cannot simply select the best of these two matching types and are therefore forced to choose one, which gives us a good performance in expectation.

Perhaps, our results suggest that ordinary algorithms work almost as well as the best algorithms that know the underlying metric weights for many problems, including matching, densest subgraph, and traveling salesman, suggesting that for situations where it is expensive or impossible to obtain the true numerical weights or tools, ordinal mechanisms can be used without major losses in well-being. While many of our algorithms are randomized and the quality guarantees are \"in anticipation,\" similar techniques can be used to achieve weaker boundaries for deterministic algorithms (boundaries of 2 for matching and of 4 for the other problems considered). It may also be possible to provide the deterministic approximation factor for the adjustment that would be better than some:"}, {"heading": "A Friendship Networks", "text": "The classical theory of structural equilibrium [10] argues that agents embedded in a social network must have the property that \"a friend of a friend is a friend.\" This phenomenon has also been observed in many real-life networks (see, for example, [18]). Mathematically, if we have an unweighted social network, G = (V, E) of (say) friendships, it is easy to verify whether this property holds w. If this property is also an edge for each (i, j, k), then (i, k) this property must also hold E. For this reason, this property has also been designated as transitive or triadic. What about weighted networks that capture the \"intensity of friendships\"? There is no obvious way that this property can be extended to weighted graphs without placing severe constraints on the weights. For example, if we place this property for each edge (j, k, and each node)."}, {"heading": "B Odd Number of Agents: Extensions", "text": "In many of our algorithms, we assumed that N (the number of agents) could even be used for convenience and to concisely capture our main ideas without worrying about the borderline cases.

Our model is motivated by the fact that in many settings, agents cannot express the numerical values of their utility for different outcomes, but are still able to rank the outcomes in their order of preference. Specifically, we study problems where the ground truth exists in the form of a weighted graph, and look to design algorithms that approximate the true optimum matching using only the preference orderings for each agent (induced by the hidden weights) as input. If no restrictions are placed on the weights, then one cannot hope to do better than the simple greedy algorithm, which yields a half optimal matching. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that by imposing a little structure on the weights, we can improve upon the trivial algorithm significantly: we design a 1.6-approximation algorithm for instances where the hidden weights obey the metric inequality. Using our algorithms for matching as a black-box, we also design new approximation algorithms for other closely related problems: these include a a 3.2-approximation for the problem of clustering agents into equal sized partitions, a 4-approximation algorithm for Densest k-subgraph, and a 2.14-approximation algorithm for Max TSP. These results are the first non-trivial ordinal approximation algorithms for such problems, and indicate that we can design robust algorithms even when we are agnostic to the precise agent utilities.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
