Preliminaries towards thermodynamics", "text": "In this section we reproduce the definition of terms such as energy, exergy and entropy based on Dincer and Cengel (2001) for the sake of completeness. The section also describes the two fundamental laws governing the science of thermodynamics. Definition 2.1. Energy (U) of a system is defined as its ability to perform work. It cannot be created or destroyed, but can only be transformed from one form to another. It depends on the parameters of matter or energy flow and is independent of environmental parameters. It is a measure of the quantity alone.Definition 2.2. Exergy (X) of a system is the maximum useful work that brings the system into balance with the specified reference environment. Exergy is the potential of a system to cause change as it achieves equilibrium with its environment."}, {"heading": "3.

Conclusions", "text": "The definition of thermodynamic indicators is derived from the first principles; the energy indicator associated with a rating gives an idea of the quantity of potential energy that a rating entails (based on the first law of thermodynamics); the expression of the exergy indicator derives from the second law of thermodynamics; the exergy indicator provides information on the amount of energy that can be converted into useful work; the entropy indicator gives an idea of the unevenness in the evaluation of an alternative; the entropy in the present study is defined as the difference between energy and exergy (Prathap, 2011), which differs from the definition 28 of Shannon and Weaver, 1963. Shannon's entropy is based on a prior distribution of assessments, while no such assumption is made in the present study. Confidence in assessments decreases when there are large deviations in the evaluation method used by decision-makers to neglect."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors would like to thank their colleagues from the Shock and Vibration Group, CSIR-SERC, for their help.
