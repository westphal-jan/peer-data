This section is a systematic arrangement of rules that enumerates various affixes that are used in the derivation under specific semantic relations. We propose a system that automates the process of generation of derivative nouns as per the rules in Astadhyayi. The proposed system follows a completely object oriented approach, that models each rule as a class of its own and then groups them as rule groups. The rule groups are decided on the basis of selective grouping of rules by virtue of anuvrtti. The grouping of rules results in an inheritance network of rules which is a directed acyclic graph. Every rule group has a head rule and the head rule notifies all the direct member rules of the group about the environment which contains all the details about data entities, participating in the derivation process. The system implements this mechanism using multilevel inheritance and observer design patterns. The system focuses not only on generation of the desired final form, but also on the correctness of sequence of rules applied to make sure that the derivation has taken place in strict adherence to Astadhyayi. The proposed system's design allows to incorporate various conflict resolution methods mentioned in authentic texts and hence the effectiveness of those rules can be validated with the results from the system. We also present cases where we have checked the applicability of the system with the rules which are not specifically applicable to derivation of derivative nouns, in order to see the effectiveness of the proposed schema as a generic system for modeling Astadhyayi.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Dec 2015 16:55:57 GMT  (565kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05670v1", "16th World Sanskrit Conference, Bangkok June 28th - July 02 2016"], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Dec 2015 10:07:35 GMT  (565kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05670v2", "16th World Sanskrit Conference, Bangkok June 28th - July 02 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "16th World Sanskrit Conference, Bangkok June 28th - July 02 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["amrith krishna", "pawan goyal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.05670"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.05670.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Towards automating the generation of derivative nouns in Sanskrit by simulating Pa\u0304n\u0323ini", "authors": ["Amrith Krishna", "Pawan Goyal"], "emails": ["amrith@iitkgp.ac.in", "pawang@cse.iitkgp.ernet.in"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Towards the automation of the generation of derived nouns in Sanskrit by the simulation of P\u0101\u1e47iniAmrith Krishna Department of CSE, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, Indiaamrith @ iitkgp.ac.inPawan Goyal Department of CSE, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India pawang @ cse.iitkgp.ernet.in (Presented at the 16th World Sanskrit Conference, Bangkok June 28 - July 2, 2016) AbstractAbout 1115 rules in A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b from A.4.1.76 to A.5.4.160 deal with the generation of derived nouns and make it one of the largest thematic sections in Actuat\u0101dhy\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b, called the Taddhita section, which is the main rule A.4.1.76.

Seminar works from Cardona (1965) and Staal (1965) on the formatting of rules of grammar with emphasis on meta-rules describing the context of sensitive aspects were a starting point with further improvements from Cardona (1969), where he applies his formalization to other rules related to phonetic changes.Cardona (2009) emphasizes the relevance of affixation and how it is well integrated with syntax as a continuum in Paganini's derivative system."}, {"heading": "3 Linguistic and Structural aspects of Taddhita Section", "text": "In the section Taddhita, P\u0101\u1e47ini identifies about 300 semantic relations, among which Pr\u0101tipadikas can be created with Taddhita appendages.

The rules in the section Taddhita deal with three entities, namely semantic relations, appendices and tribes or the collection of tribes from ga\u1e47ap\u0101\u1e6dha. The rules are defined in such a way that they facilitate the attachment of the correct Taddhita appendices in relation to the intended semantic relationship.

The essential steps of the derivative process are outlined in Table 1. Once the Taddhita addition is introduced, there remains a series of operations on the environment that lead to a final form. The rules thus triggered can be regarded as a continuous iteration of two sub-processes, one being the identification and assignment of technical terms (as well as the assignment of technical terms) to the surrounding chain or to a relevant sub-chain thereof."}, {"heading": "4.2 Overview of the Implementation System", "text": "For the automation of the derivative process, we propose the following method, which is based on object-oriented concepts. Each rule forms a class and each instance of the rule class (henceforth referred to as the rule itself) is registered with the environment, so that if there is a change in the environment, the rules are notified. Each rule checks the possibility that it is applied to the environment, and for one rule, if all the conditions are met, the rule can ideally be applied to the environment. However, in a general scenario, several rules can claim their competence to apply to the environment. In order to handle such scenarios, we keep these competing rules in a list called the candidate list. Then, a conflict resolution method is applied that decides the winning rule, and other rules are removed from the list. By removing rules other than the winning rule, we believe that the remote rules are not applied to the current instance of the environment, although they are notified when the surrounding rule reappears in Figure 2 of the implementation system."}, {"heading": "4.3 Tools and Techniques Used", "text": "We take a completely object-oriented approach to implementing the system.

The object on which the state changes occur is called the subject and it keeps a list of its dependencies, called observers. As shown in Figure 3, each observer object, which in our case is the s\u016btra or the rule, is registered with an object called the \"subject\" and in our case represents the environment. Subject class has a method for registering the observers. Whenever a change in the value of an attribute of the subject occurs, it calls the method \"notify\" of the abstract observer class, which is implemented for each object of the observer."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Multilevel Inheritance", "text": "To form rule groups, i.e. a network of inheritance between rules, we use multi-level inheritance between rules. Although multi-level inheritance is permitted, multi-level inheritance is not permitted in the system, and therefore no single rule directly inherits from two different rules. Figure 4 shows the inheritance achieved for each class in A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b. All classes inherit from a base class called \"s\u016btra,\" a generic class that defines all possible traits that a rule or s\u016btra can possess. All other rules inherit from it."}, {"heading": "4.4 Rule Triggering and Propagation", "text": "The environment forms the subject class for the design pattern of the observer. However, not all rules are applied directly to the environment, but only those rules that do not fall within the domain of any adhik\u0101ra rules or of a controlling leader of a set of rules by anuv\u1e5btti (which are usually rules that assign technical terms to the assignments), which are inherent in the classes R1, R2, etc. in Figure 5. Then there are rule groups represented by RG1, RG2, etc. These are set of rules with the same head. The rule classes that fall within the group under the same head are inherent in the head rule class. The head rule object, like the design pattern of the observer, registers the inherited objects as observers. Now, the head class notifies the observers whenever the environment meets the conditions of the head rule. The tested conditions are those conditions that must be fulfilled by all rules registered under the head. Here, \"by head we mean either a k\u0101ra or a component passed on."}, {"heading": "4.4.1 Working", "text": "It is not the only rule that it can apply in the ruleset, and this rule can be called the check phase.

The check phase for the applicable rules on the ruleset can be called the check phase.

Instances of the \"\u015babda collection\" are used to represent various technical terms that can be attributed to the environment or part of it. Figure 7 shows how the environment is used after the affixation of Taddhita affix's object affix. As already seen in Section 4.4.1, the Taddhita affixation of objects occurs due to the presence of the technical term pr\u0101tipadika."}, {"heading": "4.6 Rule Selection and Conflict Resolution", "text": "In such cases, we need to apply mechanisms to help us resolve the conflicts. There is little information on conflict resolution among the applicant rules in the applicant countries, but there are no specific rules to be applied by other scholars. It may be the case that we have adopted these principles, which were predominant in his time as a prerequisite for understanding his treatise on grammar, but this has led to debates among scholars leading to different schools of thought. Following such a scenario, we have decided to implement the conflict resolution module as a separate pluggable module in our system, so that we can try different methods that have brought scholars in general to a consensus."}, {"heading": "5 Derivation of a Derivative Noun", "text": "In this section we will show how to derive the nominal characteristics of the system.

Here, the user input \"which has led to an affixation of the desired characteristics,\" has led to the affixation of the desired affixation. Affixation has been added to the environment in the form of \"pratyaya,\" shown in Figure 7, and two other attributes have also been added to the \"pratyaya\" object.

The only aspect passed by A.6.1.77 as part of the inheritance is nothing other than the verification of a vowel right as right context.

If, for example, we consider rule 4-1-147 as a condition that includes a multitude of linguistic traits from phonetic to semantic traits, P\u0101\u1e47ini occasionally describes the intention of the speaker as a condition to be fulfilled. If we regard rule 4-1-147 as a condition, the term \"A.hierarchy\" means the intention of the speaker whether we want to address someone or not by referring to the \"descendants of the\" relationship in an disrespectful manner."}, {"heading": "8.2 Conclusions and Future directions", "text": "The proposed scheme, which aims primarily at the automated generation of derivative nouns, can essentially be used as a tool for verifying the system. Our proposed scheme, which mainly aims at the automated generation of derivative nouns, or what is called the Taddhita section, adopts a fully object-oriented approach to modeling the system. In order to improve the authors \"knowledge, the system is the first of its kind to specifically focus on modeling Taddhita methods in A\u1e63\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b. The system focuses not only on generating correct definitive forms, but also on producing the correct sequence of rules that are applied to the entire derivative process. This approach doubles the system as a pedagogical tool, where a learner can use the system to learn about the derivative process by focusing nominally on his choice, rather than focusing on a set of rules that can be separated from a set of examples already discussed or solved from a series of text books."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank Dr. G\u00e9rard Huet, Dr. Peter Scharf and Dr. Amba Kulkarni for their support and valuable contributions from the discussions we had in connection with the work.

This section is a systematic arrangement of rules that enumerates various affixes that are used in the derivation under specific semantic relations. We propose a system that automates the process of generation of derivative nouns as per the rules in A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b. The proposed system follows a completely object oriented approach, that models each rule as a class of its own and then groups them as rule groups. The rule groups are decided on the basis of selective grouping of rules by virtue of anuv\u1e5btti. The grouping of rules results in an inheritance network of rules which is a directed acyclic graph. Every rule group has a head rule and the head rule notifies all the direct member rules of the group about the environment which contains all the details about data entities, participating in the derivation process. The system implements this mechanism using multilevel inheritance and observer design patterns. The system focuses not only on generation of the desired final form, but also on the correctness of sequence of rules applied to make sure that the derivation has taken place in strict adherence to A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b. The proposed system\u2019s design allows to incorporate various conflict resolution methods mentioned in authentic texts and hence the effectiveness of those rules can be validated with the results from the system. We also present cases where we have checked the applicability of the system with the rules which are not specifically applicable to derivation of derivative nouns, in order to see the effectiveness of the proposed schema as a generic system for modeling A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b.", "creator": " XeTeX output 2015.12.17:2032"}}}
