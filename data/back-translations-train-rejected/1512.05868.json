The difference is that there is a fixed number of candidates in our environment, while the large workload at the facility's location seems to consider each point in the metric space as a possible candidate, resulting in three types of mechanisms that differ in the granularity of their input space (coordination, ranking, and location mechanisms). We examine the relationships between these three classes of mechanisms. Although it may seem that the 1948 mean algorithm is optimal for candidate selection on the line, this is not the case. We specify appropriate upper and lower limits for a variety of settings. In particular when candidates and voters are on the line, our generally true spike mechanism yields a [narrow] approximation of two. In evaluating the candidate selection mechanisms, we look for several desirable characteristics: (a) efficiency (minimization of social costs) (b) truthfulness (simplicity) (monopoly), (monopoly) effectiveness and (efficacy)."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive themselves, and that they are able to survive themselves.

Ergo, the top is optimal above all truthful expectation mechanisms.

A question closely related to candidate selection is that of minimizing the sum of distances for facility location. The difference is that in our setting there is a fixed set of candidates, whereas the large body of work on facility location seems to consider every point in the metric space to be a possible candidate. This gives rise to three types of mechanisms which differ in the granularity of their input space (voting, ranking and location mechanisms). We study the relationships between these three classes of mechanisms. While it may seem that Black\u2019s 1948 median algorithm is optimal for candidate selection on the line, this is not the case. We give matching upper and lower bounds for a variety of settings. In particular, when candidates and voters are on the line, our universally truthful spike mechanism gives a [tight] approximation of two.
