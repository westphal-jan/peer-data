In this paper, we address a specific class of global-state networks which comprises of a set of network instances sharing a similar structure yet having different values at local nodes. Each instance is associated with a global state which indicates the occurrence of an event. The objective is to uncover a small set of discriminative subnetworks that can optimally classify global network values. Unlike most existing studies which explore an exponential subnetwork space, we address this difficult problem by adopting a space transformation approach. Specifically, we present an algorithm that optimizes a constrained dual-objective function to learn a low-dimensional subspace that is capable of discriminating networks labelled by different global states, while reconciling with common network topology sharing across instances. Our algorithm takes an appealing approach from spectral graph learning and we show that the globally optimum solution can be achieved via matrix eigen-decomposition.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Dec 2015 01:20:02 GMT  (250kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06173v1", "manuscript for the ECML 2014 paper"]], "COMMENTS": "manuscript for the ECML 2014 paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xuan hong dang", "ambuj k singh", "petko bogdanov", "hongyuan you", "bayyuan hsu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.06173"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.06173.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Discriminative Subnetworks with Regularized Spectral Learning for Global-state Network Data", "authors": ["Xuan Hong Dang", "Ambuj K.

In accordance with the approach used in [8] with c as the user parameter, we select the uppermost c entries in each {ui} d i = 1 corresponding to the selective nodes. Nevertheless, it is possible for more than c nodes to be selected by combining d eigenvectors. Therefore, in practice, we can apply a simple approach by first selecting the largest absolute entries via d eigenvectors: v = {v1,., vn}, where vp = max i | ui, p | ui, (13), where ui, p vectors of these eigenvectors are subordinated, and then the uppermost hierarchical in the networks can be selected."}, {"heading": "3.5 Computational Complexity", "text": "We call our algorithm SNL, an acronym stands for SubNetwork Spectral Learning.

Second, when building the two subsequent meta-graphs, the cosinal distance between any two network instances is calculated, which is O (n2m) or O (mn log n) when using the multidimensional binary search tree [3]. Since the size of the matrix VD1 / 2 m \u00b7 n is n, its singular value substitution O (mn log n) with the Lanczos technique [12] also assumes O (n2 logn), which is the size of the matrix. Therefore, the combination of the number + 2 is the maximum number of the networks."}, {"heading": "4 Empirical Studies", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1 Datasets and Experimental Setup", "text": "Another algorithm for comparison is the Network Guided Forests (NGF) [11], which was developed specifically for protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We use both synthetic and real data sets for experiments. As global states are available in all data sets, we compare the average accuracy for 10-fold cross-validation of synthetic data and 5-fold cross-validation of real data (due to a smaller number of network instances). SNL continues to use cross-validation to select the optimal \u03b1 parameter (discussed briefly below). Unless otherwise specified, we set k = 10 and use linear SVM to perform training and testing in transformed space (by retaining the top 50 nodes) in SNL. We use the MINDS parameters as follows: 10,000 sampling iterations, 0.8 discriminatory potential threshold, and K = 200 as recommended in the paper [25]."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results on Synthetic Datasets", "text": "We use synthetic data to evaluate the performance of our technology in training robust classifiers and selecting relevant subnetworks.We generate scale-free backbone networks by preferentially attaching a predefined size that adds 20 edges for each new node. However, the probabilities of the backbone edges are evaluated by a truncated Gaussian network: N (0.9, 0.1) for edges between the ground truth nodes (pre-selected nodes with high correlation to the network state) and N (0.7, 0.1) for the rest of the edges.The weighted backbone serves as our generalized template for generating network instances by independently sampling the existence of each edge based on its probability. Global states are binary Si (0, 1) with balanced distribution. We further add noise to global and local states of the truth nodes, each with levels 10% and 30%..0850.A"}, {"heading": "4.3 Real-world Datasets", "text": "This year we will be in a position to put ourselves at the top, \"he said."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "In the case of network classification, most representative algorithms are LEAP [28], graphSig [26], GAIA [17], and COM [16], which are generally based on a database consisting of positive and negative networks that need to be classified, and although these approaches are diverse in terms of their underlying algorithms, all aim to extract a set of significant subnetworks that are more common in a class of positive networks and less common in the negative class. Unlike the problems mentioned above, our aim is to minimize subnets that are represented in all network substances; nevertheless, the node values, together with the network structures, can discriminate against the global states of the networks. Another line of related research focuses on the degradation of dynamic developing subnets [23,4,5], the problem in this case being to obtain subnets that are developing significantly (outliers)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We proposed a novel algorithm called SNL to solve the challenging problem of detecting the relationship between local state values located on nodes and global network events. While most existing studies solve this problem by scanning the exponential subnetwork, we are pursuing an efficient and effective subspace transformation approach. Specifically, we are defining three meta-graphs to capture the essential adjacent relationships between network instances and develop a spectral graph theory algorithm to learn an optimal subspace in which networks with different global states are well separated, while the common structure between samples is smoothly respected to enable the discovery of subnetworks. By experimental analysis of synthetic data and real data sets, we demonstrated its appealing performance in terms of both classification accuracy and the real relevance of the discriminating subnetwork features discovered."}], "references": [{"title": "A survey of clustering algorithms for graph data", "author": ["C.C.

facing challenges from data with network structure. In this paper, we address a specific class of global-state networks which comprises of a set of network instances sharing a similar structure yet having different values at local nodes. Each instance is associated with a global state which indicates the occurrence of an event. The objective is to uncover a small set of discriminative subnetworks that can optimally classify global network values. Unlike most existing studies which explore an exponential subnetwork space, we address this difficult problem by adopting a space transformation approach. Specifically, we present an algorithm that optimizes a constrained dualobjective function to learn a low-dimensional subspace that is capable of discriminating networks labelled by different global states, while reconciling with common network topology sharing across instances. Our algorithm takes an appealing approach from spectral graph learning and we show that the globally optimum solution can be achieved via matrix eigen-decomposition.", "creator": "gnuplot 4.6 patchlevel 3"}}}
