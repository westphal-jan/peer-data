Introduction", "text": "Remote monitoring captures the activity and other anthropometric data of the subjects. It can perform online analysis of this data, provide health-care feedback to the tested subjects, and also make the data available to the physician for further analysis. A typical application is in physical therapy, especially for older subjects, where physicians must monitor the physical performance of the subjects at home during training sessions and perform further treatments based on the performance of the subjects. This research was conducted by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 1111965.Human Performance Capture Systems have been extensively studied and applied in many applications. However, traditional motion capture systems require special system configurations and markers that make the tested subjects impractical to use motion data at home. Other motion sensors, such as the inertia sensors, are sensitive to noise, making them unsuitable for motion capture in everyday human life."}, {"heading": "2. Interactive Exercise Coaching System", "text": "The system consists of four main modules: data acquisition, data processing, performance evaluation and feedback. The pipeline of this system is shown in Figure 1. In the data acquisition module, we use the Microsoft Kinect camera to record the movement of the subjects. Microsoft Kinect captures both the texture and depth information of the scene and provides real-time human skeletal joint data [zhengyou zhang]. Based on skeletal data estimated by Microsoft Kinect SDK, the data processing module removes the outliers caused by loss tracking with the common Gaussian joint and the unified distribution model introduced in Section 3. It further extracts the kinematic parameters from the skeletal movement data. The performance evaluation module performs a real-time motion analysis, including repetition counting, most movable joints, achievable range and movement time, which can be used to further measure the flexibility, test subjects \"load data to automatically determine the results of the synchronization screen and the results of the test subjects."}, {"heading": "3. Kinect Data Accuracy Evaluation", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1. Data accuracy evaluation", "text": "In this study, we evaluate both the first and second generation of Microsoft Kinect, hereinafter referred to as Kinect 1 and Kinect 2. The motion detection system we use in this evaluation is the PhaseSpace Optical Motion Capture System, which can provide high-precision motion detection data at 120 Hz. Kinect 1 and Kinect 2 capture motion data at 20 Hz. When evaluating, all three systems simultaneously capture human movement. Motion data from these three devices are time synchronized with Network Time Protocol (NTP). Skeletal joint data from Kinect 1 and Kinect 2 are collected based on the latest SDK systems. Kinect 2 skeletal joint data is obtained by sitting and motion detection through Recap2 software."}, {"heading": "3.2. Outlier data removal", "text": "The misalignment and variance of the joint position in general depend on various sources of error, such as systematic errors, noise from depth quantization, occlusions and ambiguity, etc. Compared to the multi-view motion capture system, the Kinect camera captures motion data from a single point of view [7]. The occlusions and ambiguities from a single point of view result in a loss of traceability. Although the Kinect can derive the joint position based on the associated body part [3], it is not useful to perform a motion data analysis based on the derived motion data due to the traceability loss. Therefore, we analyze the error distribution to distinguish between the random errors and the errors due to traceability losses. Generally, the random systematic errors of the Gaussian distribution follow, while the errors due to the traceability loss can be treated as outliers belonging to a uniform distribution. Therefore, we use a mixed model of a Gaussian distribution and a uniform distribution of the joints."}, {"heading": "4. Kinematic parameter estimation", "text": "Kinematic parameters such as segment length, joint quaternion and joint positions are often used in human motion analysis and human robotic interaction, but for high-resolution motion data, kinematic parameters can be estimated directly from the skeletal joint position. However, generating kinematic parameters from the noisy motion data collected by Kinect spreads the noise to the following processing and analysis steps. To reduce noise in the kinematic parameters derived from the kinematic data, we propose a kinematic filtering approach in this section."}, {"heading": "4.1. Kinematic model", "text": "In the motion analysis, the human skeleton can be presented as a series of joints connected by bone. Therefore, each joint position can be derived by its parent joint position, the corresponding segment orientation and length. Thus, the human skeleton can be presented as a kinematic chain. In this essay, we treat the root joint as the root of every kinematic chain.

Kinematic filtering", "text": "With the kinematic model presented in the last section, we propose a kinematic filtering algorithm based on Kalman filtering to generate the kinematic parameter from the Kinect motion data [6]. The input status vector consists of the root joint position, segment length and segment rotation squaternion. The observation vector consists of the remaining joint positions. The state transition is modelled by a random-walk process [4] for filtering. Since the observation measurement function is a set of the kinematic model function according to Equation 2. Since the state transition and the observation functions are non-linear, we apply the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) [4] for filtering. Since the segment lengths for a given person are constants, we propose a four-pass UKF to fulfill these limitations. In the first forward pass, the UKF (F) (following function \u2212 x) (4) is defined by (x) x (1)."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "This paper summarizes recent advances in motion analysis for physical therapy with an affordable and accessible device such as Microsoft Kinect. Based on preliminary studies, our Remote Health Coaching System receives positive feedback from users regarding its accessibility and interaction. As the motion data collected by Microsoft Kinect is noisy, we further investigated the data fidelity of each joint position and segment length. We also propose a blending model to distinguish the outliers caused by the loss of tracking. It can help reduce noise in further motion data analysis. Finally, UKF-based kinematic filtering provides a solution to extract smooth kinematic parameters from the noisy motion data."}], "references": [{"title": "A review on technical and clinical impact of microsoft Kinect on physical therapy and rehabilitation", "author": ["H.M.
