Unlike previous work, which failed to provide scalable algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees, hashing-based techniques offer scalable sampling and counting algorithms with strong guarantees of the quality of the approach. However, many challenges remain to make this approach more practical for real-world problem cases. Promising directions for future research include the design of efficient hash functions and the development of SAT / SMT solvers specializing in overcoming constraints arising from these techniques."}], "references": [{"title": "and Barak", "author": ["S.
