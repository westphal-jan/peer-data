SUBSEQUENCE DTW (DTWSUBSEQ)", "text": "An obvious disadvantage of DTWD is the exaggeration of the dissimilarity between two copies of a time series q when a copy is moved horizontally. DTWD cannot match the ends of the two copies without incurring costs. For example, a sine curve and a cosine curve can be derived from the scan from a long series, but DTWD returns a positive value. This limits the functionality of DTWD as a similarity measurement. To mitigate this, we propose a modification of DTW based on sequence match [13]. We relax the boundary condition that the optimal path must start at the bottom leftD [1, 1] and at the upper right D [m, m] of the distance matrix D. Calculating all possible paths DTW based on subsequence match [13]."}, {"heading": "V. TEMPLATE SELECTION AND CLASSIFICATION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Overview", "text": "As described in Section II, the standard approach to HAR classification first extracts features from the motion data time series and then classifies them using well-established algorithms. Working with the raw data in the time domain is preferable if it is sufficiently able to capture information about the data. We propose a method based on DTWsubseq and hierarchical clustering that avoids intensive feature extraction and can alleviate many of the feature extraction problems discussed in Section II. Our approach to classification is to use the training data to create time series templates that represent each activity, and then to classify the test data by means of DTWsubseqD based on their similarity to these templates. This type of template-based method is robust to speed and style variations in subjects \"movements and potentially requires less training data than function-based methods [8] before we present a general template to complete the classification."}, {"heading": "B. Cluster", "text": "There are two main parts of the cluster step: 1) Calculation of the distance matrix by determining the DTWsubseqD between all pairs of points in each activity, 2) formation of clusters in hierarchical clustering by calculating the distance between two clusters Ci and Cj is calculated asd (Ci, Cj) = max s \u00b2 Ci, t \u00b2 Cj DTWsubseqD (s, t), and removal of flat clusters by limiting the paired distances within a cluster to be truncated \u00d7 max Ci, Cj d (Ci, Cj). We use hierarchical cluster formation as a cluster algorithm because it is flexible to work with a similarity measurement. Defining the parameter section increases the number of clusters for each activity. We show the results for different cross-section values in Section VII."}, {"heading": "C. Build Templates", "text": "We consider two methods for selecting templates: DTW Pointwise Averaging (DPA) and DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA). We provide the algorithm for DPA in algorithm 4 and brief descriptions of DBA.DPA is a simple method for calculating the average of a series of time series. The algorithm first finds the point with minimum distance to all other time series, aligns each time series to that point and finally computes a pointwise average. DBA is a global method that calculates an average series that minimizes the sum of square DTW distances to all rows in the cluster. In each iteration of the algorithm, 1) Run DTW between the average row and each row in the cluster, and extract the associations between the coordinates of the pair."}, {"heading": "D. Classify", "text": "For each training and test sample, we first calculate DTWsubseqD for each template. This returns a distance vector corresponding to the number of templates for each sample. We treat this distance vector as a feature vector and continue by running a dimensionality reduction algorithm (such as PCA) and a classifier (such as SVM) on the DTWsubseqD vectors."}, {"heading": "VI.

UCI HAR Data", "text": "The data set contains a total of 10,299 samples from 30 subjects who performed six activities in a laboratory: 3 dynamic activities (walking, climbing stairs, going down stairs) and 3 static activities (sitting, standing, lying down). We used 7,352 samples for training and the remaining 2,947 samples for testing.Each measurement (time series) is six-dimensional with dimensions corresponding to acceleration (in ms \u2212 2) and angular velocity (in s \u2212 1) in the x-y-z axis. Acceleration range is [\u2212 1, 1] and angular velocity range is [\u2212 3, 3]. This data set is already pre-processed as provided by the application of noise filters and then scanned in fixed width sliding windows with 50% overlap (128 readings / windows)."}, {"heading": "B. Synthetic Data", "text": "This dataset was created to test the ability of our proposed method to classify time series belonging to new subjects, in the case of noise that may be present in this type of use of smartphone sensors. In the simulation, we consider short bursts of noise in the observations due to reasons such as jerky movements, sudden shifts of the sensor and sensor noise. Training data is generated from a dimension (Accx, acceleration in the x-axis) of a random template calculated from the UCI HAR dataset, from each of the following activities: walking, walking up, walking down, sitting. This data can be taken to represent the movement of a subject. Test data is generated from another random template for each activity to simulate movements from another subject. The training set has a total of 800 samples, 200 for each activity. The test set has 200 samples, 50 for each activity is generated from a random template for each activity, to simulate movements from a different subject. The training set has a total of 800 samples, 200 for each activity, 200 for each activity. The test set has 200 samples, 50 for each activity is distributed from each sample to zero (each sample is generated from the template of the length of the 1) and one is generated from the template of the template of the template of the template of the template of the template of the template of the template of the template of the template of the template of the template of the template of the length of 251."}, {"heading": "VII. RESULTS", "text": "In this section, we present the results of the UCI-HAR dataset and synthetic data. We examine templates generated by our method and also examine the benefits of using different values of the intersection parameter at the cluster stage. We draw templates that correspond to different clusters of the same activity to demonstrate the performance of our cluster and template construction methods. Templates are shown in Figure 6 and 7 for both DBA and DPA for the UCI dataset and synthetic datasets. Classification accuracy is shown in Tables I and II. Each table shows the accuracy for all four combinations of the distance method (DTW, DTWsubseq) and the mean method (DPA, DBA), as well as two different values of the intersection parameter (0.25, 0.5)."}, {"heading": "VIII. DISCUSSION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Comparison with Feature Extraction", "text": "We have calculated 568 characteristics using mean, standard deviation, correlation, RMSE of [4], energy [17], mean absolute difference [18], maximum 5 FFT magnitudes, autocorrelation, kurtosis, skew of [7], auto-regression coefficients [5] and number of zeros for the original time series and first difference time series. We have also calculated the mean, standard deviation, curtosis and skew for the orders of magnitude of the FFT [16]. We have performed the standard classification of these characteristics using PCA for dimension reduction and linear SVM as a classifier (as in Section V-D. The results for classification of both synthetic data and UCI data set are given in Table III.Before comparing accuracy, we will comment on some advantages of our method over feature extraction."}, {"heading": "B. UCI HAR Data", "text": "In this context, it should be noted that this project is a project which is, first and foremost, a project."}, {"heading": "C. Synthetic Data", "text": "Our synthetic data experiments reflect the satisfactory performance of our methods in the case of noisy data and new subjects that are not present in the training phase. Comparing the construction of templates, Figure 7 shows that templates created with DBA are significantly more robust against sporadic noise than those created with DPA. Samples in Figure 7 are created from a single time series and modified by adding noise in a small region of the curve. DBA takes this into account successfully because its template is identical with all curves at points other than the noisy region and its shape is fairly similar to the noisy region. On the other hand, DPA does not manage to capture the identical shape of the curve because it underestimates the magnitudes of the peaks and depths. Since the test data is constructed from a different template (simulating another person), DBA overlaps the training data. All methods with DPA work similarly or better than DBA."}, {"heading": "D. Summary of Results", "text": "We summarize the accuracy results obtained with our algorithm for clarification in Table V. We see that the accuracy of our algorithm is comparable to that of extractions and in most cases performs better."}, {"heading": "IX. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we presented modifications of the DTW as a more accurate time series similarity measurement and a template-based approach to human activity detection. By experimenting with real data and synthetic data, we show that our approach provides comparable and sometimes even better classification accuracy than the most common method of feature extraction. Compared to feature extraction on real data, our approach has comparable overall test accuracy and better accuracy within activities in the dynamic category. In the case of synthetic data, it achieved higher accuracy in terms of noise robustness and the ability to classify data from new subjects. This is a particularly useful feature for the practical implementation of such classification algorithms, such as on a smartphone app. In addition, the application of our approach goes beyond HAR as long as the dataset meets our definition of multidimensional time series. Since the template approach allows us to extract characteristics without domain knowledge, it can be applied to new datasets without being applied to new datasets."}, {"heading": "X. FUTURE WORK", "text": "We plan to improve our activity detection and template usage in several ways. Possible directions include: modifying DTW to learn more complex activities; cross-validating parameters in hierarchical clusters and DTW such as intersection or bandwidth to increase predictive accuracy; removing redundant templates and limiting overmatch; and creating synthetic data from templates that increase predictive power or can be used instead of real-world data. As the work presented in this paper is not specific to HAR applications, we also plan to apply and evaluate our algorithm to sequential data in other areas of research."}], "references": [{"title": "Detecting falls with wearable sensors using machine learning techniques", "author": ["A.T.
