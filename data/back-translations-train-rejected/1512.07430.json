An ontology defines the primitives with which to model the knowledge resources for a community of discourse (Gruber 2009). These primitives, consisting of classes, relationships and properties, are represented by the entity-relationship-attribute ERA data model (Chen 1976). An ontology uses formal axioms to constrain the interpretation of these primitives. In short, an ontology specifies a logical theory. This paper is the first in a series of three papers that provide a rigorous mathematical representation for the ERA data model in particular, and ontologies in general, within the first-order logical environment FOLE. The first two papers show how FOLE represents the formalism and semantics of (many-sorted) first-order logic in a classification form corresponding to ideas discussed in the Information Flow Framework (IFF). In particular, this first paper provides a foundation that connects elements of the ERA data model with components of the first-order logical environment FOLE, and the second paper provides a superstructure that extends FOLE to the formalisms of first-order logic. The third paper defines an interpretation of FOLE in terms of the transformational passage, first described in (Kent 2013), from the classification form of first-order logic to an equivalent interpretation form, thereby defining the formalism and semantics of first-order logical/relational database systems (Kent 2011).

Institutions in general and logical environments in particular give equal heterogeneous and homogeneous representations to logical systems. FOLE is an institution because \"satisfaction under change of notation is invariant.\" FOLE is a logical environment because \"satisfaction respects the structure linkage.\" As an institution, the architecture of FOLE consists of languages as indexing components, structures representing semantic content, specifications representing formal content, and logics that combine formalism with semantics. FOLE structures are interpreted as relational / logical databases. This is the first of three papers dealing with the presentation of FOLE elements: (1) the FOLE basis, (FOLE) structure, the (FOLE) structure, the (FOLE) structure."}, {"heading": "2 Overview", "text": "A conceptual model for a community represents the information required by the community - the content, relationships and constraints necessary to describe the community. Content consists of things of importance to the community (entities) and properties of these things (attributes). Relations are associations between these things. Entities are the core terms used to represent the semantics of the community. Entities are described by attributes that are the different properties, properties, modifiers, aspects or features of entities. Therefore, the entity relationship attribute (ERA) formalism is a ternary representation of knowledge as it uses three types of representation: entities, attributes and relationships, the logical environment of the first order, aspects or features of entities."}, {"heading": "3.1 Attributes.", "text": "In the ERA data model, attributes are represented by a typed domain that consists of a collection of data types.

For each type (attribute type) x-X, the data domain of this type is the A extension Ax = extA (x) = {y-Y | y | = A x}. The passage X extA \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 > Y represents a kind of x-X to its data domain (A circumference) Ax Y.

An entity type is a category of existence; entity types classify entity instances. There can be many instances of an entity type, and an entity instance can be classified by many types. An entity instance (E >) is also referred to as an object. Each entity is uniquely identified by a key. In FOLE, entities and their types are summarized locally in an entity classification E = < R, K, | = E >. In database interpretation in \u00a7 4.4, each entity type r-R is considered the name for a relationship (or table) in the database: for each entity type (entity name) K and an entity classification relationship."}, {"heading": "3.3 Relations.", "text": "Here we will discuss how the relationship aspect of the ERA data model is handled in FOLE. Some relationships are special. An example is subtyping, which indicates that one category of existence is more general in nature than another. This occurs when the taxonomic aspect of ontologies is represented. Subtyping is handled by the binary sequences 5 in the FOLE specifications (each of which plays a thematic role for the relationship).6Consider the example (fig. 2) of a simple entity attribute diagram.
