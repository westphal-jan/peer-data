To further increase the number of facts in RDF knowledge bases, logic rules can be used to predict new facts based on the existing ones. Therefore, how to automatically learn reliable rules from large-scale knowledge bases becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we propose a novel rule learning approach named RDF2Rules for RDF knowledge bases. RDF2Rules first mines frequent predicate cycles (FPCs), a kind of interesting frequent patterns in knowledge bases, and then generates rules from the mined FPCs. Because each FPC can produce multiple rules, and effective pruning strategy is used in the process of mining FPCs, RDF2Rules works very efficiently. Another advantage of RDF2Rules is that it uses the entity type information when generates and evaluates rules, which makes the learned rules more accurate. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the compared approach in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Dec 2015 07:19:01 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07734v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["zhichun wang", "juanzi li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.07734"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.07734.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "RDF2Rules: Learning Rules from RDF Knowledge Bases by Mining Frequent Predicate Cycles", "authors": ["Zhichun Wang", "Juanzi Li"], "emails": ["zcwang@bnu.edu.cn", "lijuanzi@tsinghua.edu.cn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 151 2.07 734v 1 [cs.A I] 2 4D ec2 01"}, {"heading": "1.

RDF expresses information by making statements about resources in the form of < subject > < predicate > < object >. The subject and object represent two resources, the predicate represents the relationship (directionally) between subject and object. RDF statements are called triples because they consist of three elements. RDF is a graph-based data model; a set of RDF triples represents an RDF graph in which nodes represent resources and directed depressions. There can be three types of nodes (resources) in an RDF graph: IRIs, letters, and blank nodes. An IRI is a global identifier of a resource, such as people, organization, and place; literals are basic values such as strings, data, and numbers, etc."}, {"heading": "2.2 Definitions", "text": "D (D) D (D) D (D) D (D) D (D) D (D) D (D) D (D) D (D) D (D) D (D) D (D).

But, if the entity that initiates x2 is a small town, the prediction of this rule is more prone to be wrong because most people would not stay in the same town in their entire lives. If the entity that initiates x2 becomes a country, the prediction will have a higher probability of being correct.

RDF INDEXING FOR MINING ALGORITHM", "text": "To ensure the efficiency of our approach, we suggest using an in-memory index structure in our mining algorithm to support the mining algorithm, rather than using existing RDF storage systems. Generally, there are three types of queries about the RDF graph in our mining algorithm: (1) The query of the first type is used to generate frequent 1-predicate paths in algorithm 1; (2) The second is used in the predicate path growth process; (3) The query of the first type is used to generate frequent 1-predicate paths in algorithm 1; and the second is used in the predicate path growth process to count the predicate paths and find predicate cycles.

DBpedia is a large-scale RDF KB that is built by extracting structured content from the information contained in Wikipedia. Details of the data sets used are given in Table 1. Entity types of YAGO2 come from YAGO3 [13] (the latest version of YAGO), as Gal\u00e1rraga et al. have done in their work [8]. For DBpedia 2014, we use the data set of mapping-based properties, entity types come from the DBpedia ontology. The third column in Table 1 are the numbers of facts that exclude the rdf: type statements. For each KB used, one data set without an entity type is used, a data set without an entity type is generated, and the third column in Table 1 is the data set with an entity type, the &ltp is the old data type."}, {"heading": "6.2 Mining Efficiency Analysis", "text": "The running time and number of learned rules are compared with those of AMIE, i.e. 2, 3 and 4.

We find that the second and third rules in Table 5 dictate isPoliticianOf facts; as we discussed in Section 4.3, there may be many people who havingdiedIn and isLocatedIn relationships, but only a small number of them are politicians. Most predictions of these two rules would be wrong. Soft trust penalizes the above two rules and it is not in the top 10 list. To further evaluate the effectiveness of our new confidence measurement, we leave RDF2Rules and AMIE + learn rules from DBpedia KB."}, {"heading": "7.

To further increase the number of facts in RDF knowledge bases, logic rules can be used to predict new facts based on the existing ones. Therefore, how to automatically learn reliable rules from large-scale knowledge bases becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we propose a novel rule learning approach named RDF2Rules for RDF knowledge bases. RDF2Rules first mines frequent predicate cycles (FPCs), a kind of interesting frequent patterns in knowledge bases, and then generates rules from the mined FPCs. Because each FPC can produce multiple rules, and effective pruning strategy is used in the process of mining FPCs, RDF2Rules works very efficiently. Another advantage of RDF2Rules is that it uses the entity type information when generates and evaluates rules, which makes the learned rules more accurate. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the compared approach in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
