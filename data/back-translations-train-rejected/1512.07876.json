The basic idea is that a symbol sequence (i.e. discredited time series) resulting from a process can be called the Markov chain of order D (also called depth), [22] which captures the key behavior of the underlying process. The discrediting or symbolization process is called partitioning [15]. There are various approaches proposed in the literature, depending on different objective functions [19], such as uniform partitioning (UP), maximum entropy partitioning (MEP), maximum bijective discretization (MBD) [23]. This study uses simple uniform partitioning of the D-Markov machine is essentially a probabilistic state automation (PSA) that can be found between different states (data states), and can be described by FSA."}, {"heading": "2.2 Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)", "text": "The basic structure of RBM is illustrated in Fig. 2 (upper left corner) in an unattended learning layer. As an energy-based model [7], weights and distortions are learned, so that the characteristic configurations observed during nominal system operation receive a low energy (or high probability). Consider a system state, which can be described as required by a series of visible variables v = (v1, v2, \u00b7 \u00b7, vD) and a series of hidden (latent) variables h = (h1, h2, \u00b7, hF). Variables can be evaluated binary or real. Now, each common configuration of these variables determines a particular state of the system and an energy value E (v, h) is associated with it. Energy values are functions of the weights between the variables. (For RBM, within the variables, the hidden associations are considered probable (v) and not an association variable (v)."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY", "text": "The proposed data-based framework for system-wide detection of anomalies is in Fig. 2. During the training, the learning steps of the STPN + RBM model are: 1. Learn APs and RPs (individual node behavior and paired interaction behavior) from the multivariate training symbol sequences. 2. Consider short symbol sequences from the training sequences and evaluate for each short sub-sequence 3. For a sub-sequence based on a user-defined threshold, assign state 0 or 1 to each AP and RP; therefore, each sub-sequence results in a binary vector of length L, where L = # AP + # RP4.
