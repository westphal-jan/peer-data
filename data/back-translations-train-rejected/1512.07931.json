Physionet is a research resource that provides access to a considerable range of recorded physiological signals and their open source software.

The sampling rate is also consistent among these examples at 250 samples per second. The next data set is the Physionet Challenge 2014 extended training set (set-p2), consisting of 100 data sets (Goldberger et al. 2000 (June 13).These data sets contain signals that show more noise and artifacts than that of set-p1. The signals in set-p2 are mostly 10 minutes long, although there are occasionally shorter signals. The sampling frequency varies between 250 samples per second and 360 data sets per second.The final data set we use is the Rubicon Foundation (Massachusetts General Hospital / MGH), which is a database with three MGH functions."}, {"heading": "2.2 Related Work", "text": "The six best algorithms submitted to the Physionet 2014 Challenge, ordered by performance at Physionet, are Pangerc (Pangerc & Jager 2014), Johnson (Johnson, Bechar, Andreotti, Clifford & Oster 2014), Antink (Hoog Antink, Bruser & Leonhardt 2014), De Cooman (De Cooman, Goovaerts, Varon, Widjaja & Huffel 2014), Johannesen (Johannesen, Vicente, Scully, Galeotti & Strauss 2014) and Vollmer (Vollmer 2014).

Precise filtering is often insoluble, except in certain cases, but approximate filtering using the particle filter (a Monte Carlo sequential method) is feasible in many applications (Arulampalam, Maskell, Gordon & Clapp 2002) (Doucet & Johansen 2011). The specific method we use is the sequential import sampling resampling (SIR), also known as bootstrap filtering and particle filtering. This representation is based on the approximation of posterior density, p (xt | y0: t, 2001). The specific method we use is sequential import sampling filtering and particle filtering (also known as SIR and resampling)."}, {"heading": "4 Methods - Model", "text": "Our approach is based on the assumption that human physiology follows a pattern that can be modelled in a Bayesian way. Specifically, we construct a DBN that corresponds to human physiology, with static variables defining an observational model.

We proceed to use the filtering techniques covered in the previous section to perform state assessments based on the DBN that we have constructed."}, {"heading": "4.3 Performing State Estimation", "text": "Our particle filter follows SIR, performing three steps recursively: dispersion, weighting and repetition. First, we divide our signals into 25 millisecond windows and calculate the values of the variables of the observation model for each of these windows. Then, the particle filter assigns a prior belief to our set of particles (in our algorithm we use a set of 2000). For the propagation step, we propagate the particles individually according to our transition model to capture the state of the model one step into the future. Next, we calculate a weight for each particle that is representative of the probability of the realized state of this particle, since the observations we made at the appropriate time are the last recursive steps to restore the particles according to the weights we have calculated."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "Now that we have established the algorithm, we will discuss the performance of the algorithm on several datasets.

First, it is important to note that our algorithm is slower than other standard signal acquisition, mainly because it is a simulation based on a filter algorithm. Generally, our algorithm takes 94.33 seconds to run on an online algorithm. This is simply because particle filters process data sequentially. We have shown an example of double annotation in the previous section. To mitigate the duplicate annotations we have, we need to expand our model."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "Based on our results, we find that the use of particle filters based on our DBN model works pretty well. It matches or exceeds the majority of the top submissions for the Physionet 2014 Challenge. In terms of the standard Physionet beat detector GQRS, we are improving in set-p2 by about 4% in both sensitivity and positive predictive power. As a whole, our particle filter serves as strong evidence of the concept that a probabilistic model based on inference approaches can detect heartbeats robustly. Our probabilistic model is not completely perfect, but some of the benefits of our algorithm include: 1. Uses multi-channel information by incorporating the ECG-ABP peak delay (latency). 2. Flexible model - easy to integrate new variables and relationships. 3. Flexible observations - simply turn off GQRS and WABP for other signal processing algorithms. 4. We can be implemented with a physiological perspective."}, {"heading": "8 Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Xiao Hu, Quan Ding, Yong Bai, Rebeca Salas-Boni and Daniel Schindler for helpful conversations."}, {"heading": "A Propagation Model", "text": "The dispersion model (transition model) encodes the interdependent evolution of our relevant physiological variables over time.

Conversely, the ABP beats do not fall on the mapped peaks, but reliably well before the peaks. In our model, latency is an integer static variable that represents this relationship between heartbeat and blood pressure. The previous value is a Gaussian value of about 200 milliseconds.

Over time, the P parameter will change depending on the current values of TrueHR and ECGLastPeak, which is the number of windows per beat based on the current heart rate. First, we define the difference between the current timestep and the last peak as di f = t \u2212 ECGLastPeakt.

ECGLastPeak is a uniform distribution of integers between [\u2212 BeatWindow, \u2212 1]. ECGLastPeak helps to shift the expected position of all heartbeats due to the multimodal value of P in ECGPeak. Uniform sampling means that the predecessor believes that the expected heartbeats can be shifted to cover all possible initializations. It obeys the following propagation function: ECGLastPeakt + 1 = {t + 1 i f ECGPeakt + 1 = = 1 ECGLastPeakt i f ECGPeakt + 1 = = 0In other words, this equation states that ECGLastPeak changes to record the last time ECGLastPeak was 1."}, {"heading": "A.5 ABPPeak", "text": "ABPPeak is a Boolean variable that indicates whether there is a peak based on the ABP and the ECG.

Admittedly, this is unorthodox, but it means that we mitigate the problem of double and triple annotations at adjacent locations for the ABPPeak. If the particle filter had a while to learn the latency and let it converge, then this correction would be unnecessary, but as it is, this correction means that the particles of the particle filter at the ABPPeak do not differ excessively."}, {"heading": "A.6 ABPLastPeak", "text": "ABPLastPeak is an integer variable that represents the last time we thought there was a peak on both ECG and ABP.

The number of beats that match between the two algorithms is calculated as a real number between 0 and 1. ABPSQI is calculated by checking whether the pressure, mean artery pressure, heart rate, pulse pressure, and a variety of other physiological details are within normal ranges or not.

Particle filters fail for models that include such variables, while methods that use Gibbs sampling of parameter variables may incur a per-sample cost that grows linearly with the length of the observation sequence. Storvik (2002) devised a method for incremental computation of exact sufficient statistics that, for some cases, reduces the per-sample cost to a constant. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between Storvik\u2019s filter and a Kalman filter in parameter space and establish more general conditions under which it works. Drawing on an analogy to the extended Kalman filter, we develop and analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, a Taylor approximation to the parameter posterior that allows Storvik\u2019s method to be applied to a broader class of models. Our experiments on both synthetic examples and real applications show improvement over existing methods.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
