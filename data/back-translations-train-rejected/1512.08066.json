Evaluation", "text": "We applied the improved algorithm to the English-Korean translation system \"Ryongnamsan\" in order to improve its translation accuracy. The example text concerned the computer operating system. Sentences with negative words represent 518 or 8.2% of the total 6377 sentences. The following table shows the number of negative sentences of each kind. There were 5 partially negative sentences out of 505 individual negatives. The following examples show the translation results of the partially negative and intensified negative by the proposed algorithm compared to the previous one. If a process is executed, it is not always executed at the place where it is started."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2015, "abstractText": "This paper describes the algorithm for translating English negative sentences into Korean in English-Korean Machine Translation (EKMT).
