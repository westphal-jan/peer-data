For example, New York City Taxi Limousine Commission regularly releases source-destination information about trips in the taxis they regulate. Taxi data provide information about traffic patterns, and thus enable the study of urban flow -- what will traffic between two locations look like at a certain date and time in the future? Existing big data methods try to outdo each other in terms of complexity and algorithmic sophistication. In the spirit of \"big data beats algorithms\", we present a very simple baseline which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, including Bing Maps and Baidu Maps (whose APIs permit large scale experimentation). Such a travel time estimation baseline has several important uses, such as navigation (fast travel time estimates can serve as approximate heuristics for A search variants for path finding) and trip planning (which uses operating hours for popular destinations along with travel time estimates to create an itinerary).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Dec 2015 20:31:38 GMT  (5294kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08580v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CY", "authors": ["hongjian wang", "zhenhui li", "yu-hsuan kuo", "dan kifer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.08580"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.08580.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Simple Baseline for Travel Time Estimation using Large-Scale Trip Data", "authors": ["Hongjian Wang", "Zhenhui Li", "Yu-Hsuan Kuo", "Dan Kifer"], "emails": ["hxw186@ist.psu.edu,", "jessieli@ist.psu.edu,", "yzk5145@cse.psu.edu", "dkifer@cse.psu.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "II.

PROBLEM DEFINITION", "text": "A journey pi is defined as a 5-tuple (oi, di, si, li, ti) consisting of the origin oi, the destination di and the start time si. Both starting and finishing points are GPS coordinates. We use li and ti to indicate the distance or travel time for this journey. Note that we assume here that the intermediate points of the journeys are not available. In the real world applications, it is quite possible that we can only obtain such limited information about journeys due to privacy concerns and tracking costs. To our knowledge, the most extensive public travel data we can obtain has recently been published in New York [1]. And due to concerns about the privacy of passengers and drivers, no information about intermediate GPS points will be published (or even recorded).Problem 1 (OD travel time estimate): Suppose we have a database of journeys, D = {pi} Ni = 1. Due to concerns about the privacy of passengers and drivers, no information about intermediate GPS points will be published (or even recorded).Assume we have a database of journeys, D = Ni = 1. Our destination consists of the query q, q = q, and the destination oq =."}, {"heading": "A. Approach Overview", "text": "An intuitive solution is that we find similar trips to the query trip q and use the travel time q of these similar trips to estimate the travel time for q. The problem can be broken down into two sub-problems: (1) how to define similar trips; and (2) how to summarize the travel time of similar trips q. (2) We call similar trips as neighboring trips (or simply neighbors) of the query trip q. Note that the aggregation is not trivial because different start times and traffic conditions are defined. We call trip pi a neighbor of the trip q if the origin (and destination) of pi is spatially close to the origin (and destination) of q. (3) Thus, the compilation of q's neighbors is called: N (q) = {pi, oq)."}, {"heading": "IV.

Relative Temporal Speed Reference", "text": "In this section we assume that V (s) has a regular daily or weekly velocity pattern."}, {"heading": "B. Absolute Temporal Speed Reference", "text": "In the previous section, the relative speed reference assumes the speed based on daily or weekly regularity. However, in the real6 scenario, there are always traffic irregularities. For example, during national holidays, traffic conditions will differ significantly from the usual days. In Figure 6, we show the actual average traffic speed during the Christmas week (22 December 2013 - 28 December 2013). Compared to the relative speed reference, we can see that traffic conditions during the day are better than usual as people celebrate Christmas. Assuming that we have enough data, it would be more accurate if we could derive the average speed directly from historical data. In this section, we propose an alternative approach to directly capture traffic conditions at different times. We extend our relative reference from section IV-A to an absolute time speed reference. To this end, we partition the original time line into time slots (1 hour)."}, {"heading": "C. The Effect of Geographic Regions", "text": "So far, we have assumed that traffic conditions in all geographic locations follow the same temporal pattern. However, in practice, this means that travel within a large geographical area (e.g. New York City) may exhibit different traffic patterns depending on spatial conditions. \u2192 In Figure 7, we show the speed references of two different regional pairs (A, B). Speed references in regional pairs (A, B) show greater variation than (C, D). Especially for (A, B) pairs, the average speed is 22.7 miles per hour on Thursday and 8.5 miles per hour on Wednesday. But for (C, D) pairs, the average speed is only 11.2 miles per hour and 7.0 miles per hour at these two corresponding times. This could be because A is a residential area while B is a business district. Therefore, the traffic pattern between A and B exhibits a very strong daily peak hour pattern."}, {"heading": "D. Time Complexity Analysis", "text": "Our approach consists of three steps: 1) Mapping training trips in networks; 2) Extracting neighbors of a given OD pair (Q = Q = Q = Q = Q = Q = Q = Q = Q = Q = Q = Q = Q = Step 1. To quickly retrieve neighboring trips, in our experiment we use a grid partition of the city (e.g. 50 by 50 meters grid in our experiment), and preparing N training trips takes O (N) time. This step can be pre-processed offline. Step 2. On a test trip q, we find the corresponding origin in O (1) time. Then, retrieving all neighboring trips in the same grid O (N) time would take O (N / h) time if the travels are evenly distributed, where h is the total number of networks. In practice, however, the number of trips in each grid follows a long tail distribution. Therefore, the worst time complexity of the call N = Network time expenditure for the travels is the number of adjacent ARA (where Q is the number of ARs)."}, {"heading": "V. FILTERING OUTLIERS", "text": "In the NYC taxi data, we observe many anomalous journeys that cause major errors in our estimation.A malfunction of the tracking device could be the main cause of outliers. For example, if a journey deviates significantly from such a correlation, it is very likely that it is an outlier, while its actual distances are not zero. In particular, the correlation of distance and time could help us find anomalous journeys at extremely fast or slow cruising speeds; the correlation of travel distance and distance between endpoints could help us to find outlier procedures. In principle, any outlier detection algorithm can be used to purify the data. In this paper, we assume that there is a linear correlation between some feature pairs. Based on this assumption, we are designing a linear regression model to adjust the data."}, {"heading": "VI.

After filtering the outliers, there are 127,534,711 journeys for our experimental evaluation.

There is only one parameter in our proposed method, the distance threshold \u03c4, to define the neighbors. We use the first 11 months from the dataset NYC to study the parameter \u03c4. For computing efficiency, we divide the map into small grids of 50 by 50 meters. Distance in equivalent (1) is now defined as the distance L1 between two grids. For example, if p1 is a neighboring travel of q for \u03c4 = 0, this means that the pick-up (and drop-off) position of p1 is in the same grid as the pick-up (and drop-off) position of q."}, {"heading": "D.

Performance on Shanghai Data", "text": "In this section we carry out experiments in the field of taxi centers."}, {"heading": "F. The Impacts of Outliers", "text": "We have implemented several outlier filters to work as a pipeline. For NYC data, we have filters that use time and distance, time and fare, distance and distance between endpoints, travel time and distance between endpoints. Overall, an estimated 7% outliers will be found. The outliers will affect experimental performance in two ways: (1) the outliers in the training data will make travel time estimation less accurate; and (2) the outliers in the test trips will make the experimental outliers less reliable because the errors of the upstream test trips will greatly affect overall accuracy. We are investigating how outliers affect these two aspects by using the NYC dataset of November trips as a training and December trips as a test. \"The number of anomalous trips in November and December is 758, 253 of 11, 915, 496 (i.e. 6.36%) and 801, 503 of 11, 434, 273 (i.e., the second phase I outliers will be selected as the MAI outliers in Stage III, as the third stage I, when the MAI are three different."}, {"heading": "G. Running Time", "text": "Table IV presents the transit time comparison between TEMPabs + R and SUBPATH. We profile the transit time of TEMPabs + R on the journeys of the last two months in the NYC dataset and SUBPATH on the entire Shanghai dataset. Note that the NYC dataset is larger than the Shanghai dataset and TEMPabs + R is the most mathematically expensive method and also the most accurate method among our proposed methods. Pre-processing time for TEMPabs + R consists of mapping trips to grid networks, calculating the speed reference and learning the ARIMA parameters. The preparation time for SUBPATH includes indexing the trajectory by road segment. In TEMPabs + R, both the preparation of training trips and learning ARIMA can be carried out offline or updated hourly with the 12 new data."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "This work shows that the travel time between an origin and a destination can be estimated very efficiently and effectively using extensive travel data. Our proposed method retrieves all adjacent historical trips with similar origin and estimated locations and estimates the travel time based on these neighboring trips. We further improve our method by taking into account traffic conditions due to different temporal granularities and spatial dynamics. In addition, we are developing a failing filtering method to make our estimate more accurate and experimental results more reliable. Finally, we are conducting experiments on two large real data sets and show that our method can by far outperform the most modern methods and online mapping services. In the future, we are interested in finding out what other new insights such big data could offer, such as how crime and economic status of places correlate with travel flows."}], "references": [{"title": "Continuous-time dynamic shortest path algorithms", "author": ["B.C.
