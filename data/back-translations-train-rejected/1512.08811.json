FCMs, however, exhibit some similarity to neural networks based on structural properties and reasoning techniques. However, they are considered a semantic modeling tool: concepts typically identified by experts occur in the problem domain and weights that specify influences based on expert knowledge or data used in the learning process. Below, we present a brief theoretical introduction to FCMs.Let C = {c1,.,. cn} be a set of FCM concepts. A state of FCM is an n-dimensional vector of the conceptualization levels."}, {"heading": "2 Related works", "text": "A large number of applications of FCM have been reported, e.g. in project risk modeling [9], crisis management and decision-making, in the development of economic systems and the introduction of new technologies [7], in traffic forecasting [10], in signal processing and decision support in medicine. Over the last 15 years, a number of FCM enhancements have been proposed. Fuzzy Grey cognitive maps use gray numbers (pairs defining interval limits) as a weight factor in the influence matrix."}, {"heading": "3 Fuzzy cognitive maps for discrete random variables", "text": "A random variable X is called discrete if E is finite or countable, otherwise it is continuous. The probability function p (x) = P (X = x) assigns a value of [0, 1] to a result of a random variable X. In addition, it is required that the sum (or integral) of p (x) over x \u00b2 E equal 1.0.In the model presented, random variables are used as conceptual activation levels of fuzzy cognitive maps. Although we assume that their values lie within a certain interval [min, max] R, e.g. min = \u2212 1, max = 1, we consider them discrete, i.e. their ranges E are finite. Specifically, we present them as discrete probability mass functions p: E \u2192 [0, 1] as singular effects and as special factors (c = 1)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Arithmetic of discrete random variables", "text": "Let X and Y be two independent discrete random variables (DRV) with probability distributions px (x) and py (z), whose probability distribution pz (z) is a confusion of px (x) and py (y) (2).

In our experiments, EX was finite and therefore limited: EX-X [xmin, xmax]. The basic idea behind at least three aggregators described in this section is to perform one-dimensional clustering. The values x-EX, which are close together, are grouped in clusters EX1,..., EXi,... EXk, and each cluster EXi is replaced by a single pair (vi, pi). The method for determining vi and pi depends on the algorithm, typically vi is determined by the type of averages in EXi and pi by summing probabilities."}, {"heading": "4.1 Simple k-means", "text": "Simple k-mean is an adaptation of the well-known k-mean cluster algorithm [20]. The main difference is that initial centroids are not randomly selected, but are evenly distributed in the range [xmin, xmax]. For the resulting pV = {(vi, pi)} elements, vi are cluster centers and pi is a sum of probabilities assigned to the elements EXi = {xij} that form a cluster: pi = \u2211 x EXi p (x). The method does not guarantee that the mean value of X is kept around V. Nevertheless, during the E (X) and E (V) experiments, a rather close connection was established."}, {"heading": "4.2 DBSCAN", "text": "DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) is a widely used cluster algorithm [20] characterized by low complexity O (n logn). It is controlled by two parameters - minimum distance between data points forming a neighborhood and \u03bb - minimum cluster size. During the execution of algorithms, points whose neighborhood size is smaller than \u03bb are discarded as outliers. On the other hand, neighborhoods with at least \u03bb elements are converted into clusters and expanded further. Results of the algorithm, including the number of clusters, depend on established values of \u03b5 and \u03bb.The aggregator discussed is based on the DBSCAN implementation in the JavaML library [1] with the following parameters: \u03b5 = xmax \u2212 xmink, where k is an upper limit for the number of resulting clusters and \u03bb = 6. After executing the cluster algorithm, values belonging to the clusters (Xi) were converted to pairs (7)."}, {"heading": "4.3 UniBins aggregator", "text": "The UniBins aggregator divides the range [xmin, xmax] of an input variable X into k uniformly distributed containers, which are represented by the values v0,.., vn \u2212 1.

This concept is illustrated in Fig. 1."}, {"heading": "4.4 Percentile rank aggregator", "text": "The percentile rank aggregator assigns the same probability \u2206 p = 1 / k to each output value, while maintaining the percentile ranges of the input distribution. The assumed granulation level is \u2206 p. The basic idea of the algorithm is shown in Fig. 2a. Let's analyze the order (xi, pi),... (xi + 3, pi + 3). As pi + pi + 1 + pi + 2 < p < pi + pi + 1 + pi + 2 + pi + 3, the value vk + 1 becomes between xi + 3 and xi + 4. The exact position depends on p \u2212 pi \u2212 pi + 1 \u2212 pi + 2, the smaller the distance between xi + 3 and vk + 1. Another characteristic of the percentile rank aggregator is its ability to generate multiple output values when the input ranges PMF changes quickly."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments and results", "text": "This year it is so far that it only takes a few days to reach an agreement."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we discuss FCM4DRV, an extension of the classic FCM model, which consists of replacing concept activation levels with discrete random variables. The proposed model aims to define areas of activation levels achieved during FCM reasoning. We were motivated by a specific problem to select precise thresholds when analyzing IT security risk with FCM [19, 17, 18], but the solution presented here is more general and can be applied to a variety of problems. FCM4DRV extension includes extending the classic FCM state equation to include suitable operators applicable to DRVs, as well as introducing aggregators, special functions that transform DRVs into similar but less memory and require less computing."}], "references": [{"title": "Java-ml: A machine learning library", "author": ["Thomas Abeel", "Yves Van de Peer", "Yvan Saeys"], "venue": "The Journal of Machine Learning Research,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Dynamic random fuzzy cognitive maps", "author": ["Jos\u00e9 Aguilar"], "venue": "Computacio\u0301n y Sistemas,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2004}, {"title": "A Survey about Fuzzy Cognitive Maps Papers", "author": ["Jose Aguilar"], "venue": "Invited Paper ).
