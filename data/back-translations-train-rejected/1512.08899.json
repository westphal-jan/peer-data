We represent this reasoning problem in Answer Set Programming (ASP), in order to obtain a flexible framework for experimenting with global constraints and objective functions, and to test the boundaries of what is possible with ASP, because realizing this problem in ASP is challenging as it requires value invention and equivalence between certain constants as the Unique Names Assumption does not hold in general. For permitting reasoning in cyclic theories, we formally describe fine-grained variations of limiting Skolemization. We evaluate our encodings and extensions experimentally on the ACCEL benchmark for plan recognition in Natural Language Understanding. Our encodings are publicly available, modular, and our approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art solvers on the ACCEL benchmark. We identify term equivalence as a main instantiation bottleneck, and experiment with on-demand constraints that were used to eliminate the same bottleneck in state-of-the-art solvers and make them applicable for larger datasets. Surprisingly, experiments show that this method is beneficial only for cardinality minimality with our ASP encodings.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 10:22:14 GMT  (82kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08899v1", "Technical Report"], ["v2", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 13:26:15 GMT  (94kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08899v2", "Technical Report"], ["v3", "Sun, 30 Oct 2016 14:00:03 GMT  (94kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08899v3", "Technical Report"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical Report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter sch\\\"uller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.08899"}, "pdf": {"name": "1512.08899.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Modeling Variations of First-Order Horn Abduction in Answer Set Programming", "authors": ["Peter Sch\u00fcller"], "emails": ["peter.schuller@marmara.edu.tr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar Xiv: 151 2.08 899v 3 [cs.A I] 3 0O ct"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In fact, it is so that most people are able to identify themselves as if they were able to survive themselves.

Next, we formalize two extensions of these encodings and describe their computational implementation. In Section 4.1, we introduce Flexible Value Invention for fine-grained control of scolemization, which makes our encodings applicable to cyclic theories. In Section 4.2, we show how we can replace certain constraints in our encodings with rotten variants to reduce the grounding size and potentially improve evaluation performance.

The formulation as a constraint allows us to eliminate (30) from the encoding and inertia only create those instances of (30) that are violated in the search for the optimal solution.

We represent this reasoning problem in Answer Set Programming (ASP), in order to obtain a flexible framework for experimenting with global constraints and objective functions, and to test the boundaries of what is possible with ASP. Realizing this problem in ASP is challenging as it requires value invention and equivalence between certain constants, because the Unique Names Assumption does not hold in general. To permit reasoning in cyclic theories, we formally describe fine-grained variations of limiting Skolemization. We identify term equivalence as a main instantiation bottleneck, and improve the efficiency of our approach with on-demand constraints that were used to eliminate the same bottleneck in state-of-the-art solvers. We evaluate our approach experimentally on the ACCEL benchmark for plan recognition in Natural Language Understanding. Our encodings are publicly available, modular, and our approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art solvers on the ACCEL benchmark.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
