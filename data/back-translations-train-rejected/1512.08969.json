INTRODUCTIONThe Computer Go section focuses primarily on the problem of creating a program to play the game by finding the best move from a particular board position [1]. We focus on analyzing existing game records with the aim of helping people to play and understand the game better. Go is a full information board game for two players, played on a square grid (usually 19 x 19 lines) with black and white tiles; the aim of the game is to surround territories and capture hostile tiles. In the following text we assume that basic familiarity with the game rules can be found, a small glossary at the end of the paper. Following our initial research [2 sets of game information] we present a method of winning."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "As the game Go enjoys worldwide popularity, large collections of Go game records have been assembled covering both amateur and professional games, e.g. [3], [4].Currently, the possibilities of using these records can be divided into two directions. Firstly, there is the area of the computer game Go, where the records have been used to evaluate certain patterns that serve as heuristics to speed up tree search [5], or to create databases with standard openings [6]. They have also been used as a source of training data from various neural network-based train predictors, which until recently have not worked convincingly [7]. Recent improvements [8], [9] based on deep revolutionary neural networks seem to change the situation and promise big changes in the field.Secondly, the records of professional games have traditionally served as study material for human players. There are software tools [10] designed to enable the user to search for the game."}, {"heading": "III. FEATURE EXTRACTION", "text": "In this section, the methods for extracting the evaluation vector (ev) from a series of games are presented. As we aggregate data by player, each game in the group is accompanied by the color that specifies our interesting player. Therefore, the sample is considered as a series of colored games, GC = {(game1, color1),...}.The evaluation vector ev consists of concatenating several sub-vectors of characteristics - examples are the above-mentioned local patterns or statistics of Sent and Gote sequences, which are described in detail in the rest of this section. Some details are omitted, see [17] for a more detailed description."}, {"heading": "A. Raw Game Processing", "text": "The games are processed by the Pachi Go Engine [18], which exports a variety of analytical data about each turn in the game. Pachi prints a list of key pairs of values related to the current turn: \u2022 atari flag - whether the train placed enemy stones in atari, \u2022 atari escape flag - whether the train saved its own stones from atari, \u2022 capture - number of enemy stones captured, \u2022 connection to the last turn - the grid distance (see Equation 1) from the last move, \u2022 board edge distance - the distance from the nearest edge of the board, \u2022 spatial pattern - configuration of stones around the played move. We use this information to calculate the higher characteristics given below. The spatial pattern consists of positions of stones around the current move up to a certain distance, which is determined by the grid metricd (x, y) = | spatial metricd (x, y) + = max ()."}, {"heading": "B. Patterns", "text": "The pattern identification family is essentially a statistic of the N most common spatial patterns (along with the two atari flags); the list of N most frequently played patterns is calculated in advance from the entire game database; the patterns are normalized so that it is black's turn, and they are invariant under rotation and mirroring; we used N = 1000 for the range of strength and N = 600 for the range of style (which has a smaller dataset, see section V-B for details); then, given a series of colored games GC, we count how often each of the N patterns has been played - and thus get a vector ~ c of the number (| ~ c | = N); however, with simple occurrence counting, certain numbers ci increase proportionally to the number of games in GC. To maintain the inventory among the number of games in the sample, normalization is required."}, {"heading": "C. \u03c9-local Sente and Gote Sequences", "text": "Based on this intuition, we have developed a statistic that attempts to capture the distribution of sente and goth games in the games from the sample. In general, it is difficult to decide which moves are sente or goth. Therefore, we limit ourselves to what we call \u03c9-local (sente and goth) sequences. We say that a move is \u03c9-local (in relation to the previous move) if its grid distance from the previous move is less than a fixed number \u03c9; in this paper, we used \u03c9 = 10 for the strength record and \u03c9 = 5 for the style dataset. The simplistic assumption we make is that reactions to sente moves are always local. Although this generally does not apply, the feature proves useful. Assumption allows us to divide each game into disjunct \u03c9-local sequences (i.e., each move in the sequence is dependent on its previous move)."}, {"heading": "D. Border Distance", "text": "The Boundary Distance feature is a two-dimensional histogram that counts the average number of moves in the sample played low or high at different stages of the game.The original inspiration was to help distinguish between territorial and influence moves in the opening, although it turns out that the feature is useful in other phases of the game.We use the ByDist = [< 1, 2 >, < 3 >, < 4 >, < 5,)} Boundary Distance feature (distinction between the first 2 lines, 3rd line of territory, 4th line of influence and higher game elements for the remainder).The move number division is given by Bylt; 3 >, < 4 >, < 5, \u221e) division for the Boundary Distance dimension (distinction between the first 2 lines, 4th line of influence and higher game elements for the rest."}, {"heading": "E. Captured Stones", "text": "The motivation is simple - especially beginners tend to capture stones because \"they could,\" rather than because it is the \"best move.\" Such capture could be a serious mistake in the opening and would not be played by experienced players. One of the dimensions is given as before by the intervals ByMoves = [< 1, 60 >, < 61, 240 >, < 241, \u221e), which try to determine the game stages (roughly: opening, middle game, endgame), the subdivision into game stages is more coarse than in the previous function because catches are relatively rare. A finer grain would require more data. The second dimension has a fixed size of three containers. In addition to the number of captives of the player (the first container), we also count the number of captives of his opponent (the second container) and a difference between the two numbers (the third column)."}, {"heading": "F. Win/Loss Statistic", "text": "The next feature is a statistic of wins and losses and whether they came about by points or resignation. The motivation is that many weak players continue to play games that are already lost to the end, either because their count is not very good (they do not know that there is no way to win), or because they hope that the opponent will make a mistake. On the other hand, professionals do not hesitate to resign if they believe that nothing can be done, and a lost game could even be considered rudimentary. We ignore lost, unfinished or unfinished games in this feature because the frequency of these events is so low that a very large data set would be required to reliably use them. In the colored games of GC we count how often the player was interested: \u2022 by counting, \u2022 by resignation, \u2022 by losing, \u2022 by counting, \u2022 by losing, \u2022 by counting, \u2022 and by resignation. Again, we divide these four numbers by | GC | to maintain the inventory of the number of games in GC."}, {"heading": "IV. PREDICTION", "text": "To predict different player attributes, we start with a given input dataset D, which consists of the pairs D = {(GCi, yi),... where GCi corresponds to a series of colored games of the i-th player and yi to the target attribute. Yi could be quite arbitrary as long as it has any relationship to the GCi. For example, yi could be the strength of i. Let's call our evaluation process previously presented as evaluation and allow the evaluation of the i-th player, evi = evaluation (GCi). Then we can turn D into Dev = {(evi, yi), which forms our training datasets."}, {"heading": "A. Prediction Model", "text": "Choosing the best predictor is often a tedious task that depends on the nature of the data set at hand and requires expert judgement and repeated trial and error. In [17], we experimented with various methods from which stacked ensembles [20] with different base learners proved to be most powerful. As this paper focuses on evaluation and not on finding the very best predictive model, we opted for a packaged artificial neural network with 20 hidden units in a hidden layer. The neurons have a standard sigmoidal activation function and the network is trained using the RPROP algorithm [22] for a maximum of 100 iterations (or until the error is less than 0.001). In both sets of data, the respective strength of the target is processed in different ways (< 1)."}, {"heading": "B. Reference Model and Performance Measures", "text": "In our experiments, the mean regression was used as the reference model. Mean regression is a simple method that continuously predicts the average of the target variables y in the dataset regardless of the assessment. Although the mean regression is a very trivial model, it provides some useful insights into the distribution of the target variables y. For example, a low error of the mean regression model raises the suspicion that the target attribute y is inaccurately defined, as in the result section of the style prediction, Section V-B. To assess the efficiency of our method and to give estimates of its precision for invisible inputs, we measure the performance of our algorithm in the face of a data set Dev. A standard method for this is the division of the Dev into training and test parts and the calculation of the error of the method on the test part. For this purpose, we have used a standard method of 10-fold cross-validation (the RValidation [24], which randomly divides the prediction of the data set sections 10."}, {"heading": "V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Strength", "text": "One of the two large domains in which we have tested our framework is predicting game strength. > Dataset: We have collected a large sample of games from the public archives of the Kiseido Go server [25]. The sample consists of over 100,000 records of games in.sgf format [26].For each rank r in the range of 6-dan to 20-kyu, we have compiled a list of players Pr of the respective rank. To avoid distortions caused by different strategies, the sample consists only of games played on a board of 19 \u00d7 19 between players of comparable strength (excluding games with handicap tiles).The number of colored games GCp for a player p-Pr consists of the games played by player p when he had the rank r. We use the GCp only if the number of games is not less than 10 games; if the sample is larger than 50 games, we randomly select a subset of the sample of the games (the < the subset of the prediction of the prediction of the < the number of the prediction we would select directly from the < the < the number of the prediction of the interface)."}, {"heading": "B. Style", "text": "The second domain is the prediction of different aspects of game styles. Dataset: The collection of games in this dataset comes from the Games of Go on Disk by [4] database, which contains more than 70,000 professional games ranging from antiquity to the present. We selected 25 popular professional players (mainly from the 20th century) and asked several experts (professional and strong amateur players) to rate them by means of a questionnaire. Experts (Alexander Dinerchtein 3-pro, Motoki Noguchi 7-dan, Vladim\u0131 r Dane 5-dan, Luka s Podpe 5-dan and V\u0131 t Brunner 4-dan) were asked to rate the players on four scales, each ranging from 1 to 10.

CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper presents a method for evaluating players based on a sample of their games, from which we extract a number of different domain-specific characteristics and try to gather different information, and the resulting summary ratings prove to be very useful for predicting different player attributes (such as strength or style of play) with appropriate accuracy. The ability to predict such player attributes has some very interesting applications both in the Go computer game and in developing learning tools for human players, some of which we have implemented in an online web application, and the work also discusses other potential extensions and applications that we will explore in the future.We believe that applying our findings can help improve both the human and computer understanding of the Go.VIII game. The code used in this work is published online as part of the GoStyle project [30]. Most of the source code is implemented and evaluated in the Python programming language."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "This research was supported in part by the project of the Czech Science Foundation P103-15-19877S.

The evaluations capture different aspects of the games such as played patterns or statistic of sente/gote sequences. Using machine learning algorithms, the evaluations can be utilized to predict different relevant target variables. We apply this methodology to predict the strength and playing style of the player (e.g. territoriality or aggressivity) with good accuracy. We propose a number of possible applications including aiding in Go study, seeding realwork ranks of internet players or tuning of Go-playing programs.", "creator": "gnuplot 4.6 patchlevel 1"}}}
