Computational Pathology: The systems view", "text": "Modern pathological studies of biopsy tissues include multiple stains of histological material, genomics and proteomics analyses, as well as comparative statistical analysis of patient data. Pathology not only forms a scientific basis for clinical medicine, but also serves as a bridge between basic sciences in the natural sciences, medicine and patient care. Therefore, it can be considered one of the central nodes for translational research in the health and life sciences, and subsequently facilitates translational medicine. In particular, the wealth of heterogeneous data sources with a significant degree of randomness and noise poses challenges for statistics and machine learning. Automatic processing of this wealth of data rounds off a standardized and hopefully more objective diagnosis of a patient's disease status than a manual inspection can offer today. An automatic computational pathology pipeline also allows medical users to quantitatively identify the pre-life-sensitive and error-sensitive steps that can significantly affect the survival of biopsy tissues."}, {"heading": "1.1.

Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma", "text": "During this period, we use Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) as a disease case and optimize a computerized pathology framework because it has a number of properties that are very relevant for the calculation of pathologies. Therefore, identifying biomarkers for predicting disease patterns in Western society statistics is very important, as many patients already have metastases at the time of initial diagnosis. Identifying biomarkers for predicting prognostic markers or responding to therapy (predictive markers) is very important to improve patient prognosis."}, {"heading": "2.2. Tissue Microarrays", "text": "Tissue Microarray Technology (TMA) significantly accelerates studies in search of associations between molecular changes and clinical endpoints [7].This technology extracts 0.6 mm tissue cylinders from primary tumor material of hundreds of different patients and then embeds these cylinders into a tissue block of the recipient. Sections of such cylinders can then be used for simultaneous in situ analysis of hundreds or thousands of primary tumors at the DNA, RNA and protein levels (cf. 2).These results can then be integrated with expression profile data to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of ccRCC [8, 3, 9].The high speed of arraying processes, the absence of significant damage to donor blocks, and the regular arrangement of array samples allow automated analysis. Although the production of tissue microarrays is an almost routine task for most laboratory diagnostic assessments requiring tissue samples to be analyzed."}, {"heading": "2.3.

Expert Variability in Fluorescence Microscopy", "text": "In addition to immunohistochemical TMA analysis, fluorescence microscopy is commonly used for high-throughput screening of molecular phenotypes. [12] A comprehensive study evaluating the performance of domain experts in the detection of lymphocytes is presented by [12]. At best, an expert of medium expertise needs an average of one hour to analyze a fluorescence microscopy. Each microscopy contains between 100 and 400 cells and is 658 x 517 pixels in size. Four exemplary microscopes were evaluated blindly by five experts. To evaluate the variability between observers nattkemper et al. [12] define a gold standard that includes all cell positions detected by at least two experts in a microscopy. Submitted via CD3, CD4, CD7 and CD8, the sensitivity of the four biomedical experts varies between 67.5% and 91.2% and the positive preference value (PgesaV)."}, {"heading": "2.5. Generating a Gold Standard", "text": "The main advantage of labeling experiments like the ones described above is not to show the high inter- and intra-variability between pathologists, but to generate a gold standard. In the absence of an objective measurement method for truth on the ground, a gold standard is critical for the use of statistical learning, firstly for learning a classifier or regressor, and secondly for validating the statistical model. Section 5 shows an example of how the information collected in the experiments of Section 2.3 can be used to train a computerized pathology system. In addition to labeling applications developed for specific scenarios, such as the one described in Section 2.3, there are several other ways to collect data in a structured manner in pathology. Although tablet computer software is the most convenient approach to collect information directly in the hospital, it is limited by the small number of test subjects who can complete an experiment to overcome the limitations of web-based technologies."}, {"heading": "2.6.

Although a comprehensive archive such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository is far from being available for computer pathology, there are a number of datasets and initiatives that disseminate different types of datasets. Immunohistochemistry: The most comprehensive database of antibodies and human tissue is by far the Human Protein Atlas [25, 26], which includes patches of tissue microarrays of 45 normal human tissue types ranging from 0 \u2212 6 images for each tissue.

Software Engineering Aspects", "text": "One of the earliest approaches for supercomputers in pathology used image matching algorithms based on decision trees to retrieve images from a database [79] and applied to Gleason grading in prostate cancer. Web-based data management frameworks for TMAs such as [80] facilitate not only the storage of image data, but also the storage of experimental and production parameters throughout the TMA workflow. [81] A critical requirement for software engineering is the ability to scale automated analyses to multiple points of a TMA slide and even to several whole microscopy slides. Besides cloud computing, one way to achieve this goal is grid computing. [81] The feasibility of such a system has been demonstrated by the use of the caGrid infrastructure [82] for the gridable use of an automated algorithm for segmentation of cancer tissue in public domain pathology, which is available in a comprehensive list of TMAs available at www.TMa.org."}, {"heading": "4. Statistics: Survival Analysis and Machine Learning in Medical Statistics", "text": "The main objective of computational pathology research is to create fully probabilistic models of complete histological and medical data processing pipelines. In medical research, this almost always involves time to collect data, with the event being either overall survival, specific survival, event-free survival or relapse-free survival of patients. Statistics and machine learning in this context are defined as survival analysis."}, {"heading": "4.1. Censoring and Descriptive Statistics", "text": "Most difficulties in survival statistics arise from the fact that almost all clinical records contain patients with censored survival times.The most common form of censorship is correctly censored data, which means that the death of the patient is not observed during the duration of the study or that the patient has left the study, for example, because he has moved to a different place.The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator [83] is often used to estimate survival function based on correctly censored data.This procedure first requires the order of survival times from the smallest to the greatest detail, so that t1 \u2264 t2 \u2264 t3 \u2264... \u2264 tn, with t j being the jth largest unique survival time. Kaplan-Meier estimation of survival function is then presented as S value (t) = highest possible deaths."}, {"heading": "4.2. Survival Analysis", "text": "Survival analysis as a branch of statistics is not limited to medicine, but analyses the time to failure or event, and is also applicable to biology, technology, economics, etc. Particularly in the context of medical statistics, it is a powerful tool for understanding the effects of patient traits on survival patterns within certain groups [85]. A parametric approach to such analysis involves estimating parameters of a probability density function that models time. Generally, the distribution of a random variable T (representing time) is defined over the interval [0, \u221e). Furthermore, a standard survival function based on cumulative distribution over T is specified as follows: S (t) = 1 \u2212 p (T \u2264 t0) = 1 \u2212 t00 p (t) dt, (4), which defines the probability of an individual surviving to time t0."}, {"heading": "4.3. A Bayesian View of Survival Regression", "text": "Bayean methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning in general and in medical statistics in particular. A major advantage in survival analysis is the ability to study the posterior distribution of a model. In particular, in models with regulated survival regression [87] it is possible to obtain a posterior distribution even on zero coefficients, i.e. for biomarkers, which are therefore not included in the model. A common distribution method for modelling time is the Weibull distribution, which is flexible in terms of modelling a variety of survival functions and risk data. Besides flexibility, it is also the only distribution that covers both the accelerated time model and the proportionality risk model. [88] Weibull distribution is defined as follows: p (t | w, w) = p (t | w) = p (t | w) = p \u2212 w t\u03b1w \u2212 1 exp (\u2212 1), (\u03b1w), w, w (w), w) and \u2212 where the parameters of the above-mentioned time are applied."}, {"heading": "4.4. Higher Order Interactions", "text": "A recurring question in biomedical research projects, and especially in TMA analysis studies, is the interaction of markers and their influence on the target. Two modern approaches in computational pathology attempt to solve this question from the point of view of a frequency [89] and a Bayesian [87]. The most common approach to modelling higher interactions (such as pairs or triplets of features, etc.) instead of modelling only the main effects (single features) are polynomial expansions of features. For example, the vector x = {x1, x2, x3} can be extended up to the order of magnitude 2 as x \u2032 = {x1, x2, x3, x1: x2, x3, x1: x2: x3}. Additional flexibility is built into this model by including a random effect in the model in the following ways: Procedure = x, Manfred + coincident (N) and coincident (N)."}, {"heading": "4.5. Mixtures of Survival Experts", "text": "This information could indicate the disease mechanisms. Statistically, this grouping is represented by a mixture model or specifically by a mixture of survival experts. [91] For this purpose, a finite mixture of expert models is defined by maximizing the partial probability for the regression coefficients, and by using some heuristics to resolve the number of experts in the model. More recently [92], a maximum probability is used to derive the parameters of the model and the Akake information criterion (AIC) to determine the number of mixing components."}, {"heading": "5. The Computational Pathology Pipeline: A holistic View", "text": "This chapter describes a real computer pathology project, conceived according to the principles described in the previous sections. It is an ongoing project in kidney cancer research, which was carried out at the University Hospital of Zurich and the ETH Zurich. Parts of it have been published in [100] and [42], which also include algorithmic details of the computer-aided approach. Figure 8 shows a schematic overview of the project, which is divided into the three main parts discussed below:"}, {"heading": "5.1. Data Generation", "text": "The data generation process consists of the acquisition of images of the TMA spots, representing the covariates X in the statistical model and the target variable Y, which contain recognition and classification markers for nucleic nucleus.The tissue microarray block was generated in a study at the University Hospital of Zurich. TMA slides were immunohistochemically stained with the MIB-1 (Ki-67) antigen and scanned on a C9600 virtual light microscope scanner by HAMATSU. Magnification of 40 \u00d7 resulted in a resolution of 0.23 micrometers per pixel. The tissue microarry was tiled into individual spots of 3000 x 3000 pixels, each representing a patient. Various strategies can be developed to estimate the progression status of cancerous tissue: (i) we were able to first detect cell nuclei and then identify the nuclei as selective or single nuclei."}, {"heading": "5.2. Image Analysis", "text": "The image analysis part of the pipeline consists of learning a relational detection forest [42] based on the samples extracted in the previous step. To ensure the illumination inventory, the characteristic basis described in Section 3.1 is used. [43] The strong class imbalance in the training set is taken into account by random background class subsamples for each tree in the ensemble. Model parameters are adjusted by optimizing the out-of-bag error (OOB) [43] and they consist of the number of trees, the maximum tree depth and the number of characteristics sampled at each node in a tree. To predict, each pixel of a TMA point is classified according to the relation detection forest. Therefore, a probability map of the size of the image in which the gray value indicates the probability at each position to be the location of a carcinogenic nucleaner in a tree is cleaned up. Finally, the weighted average shift of the cluster of the cleansed radius is carried out with an acidified acid basis of the final cleansed patient being cleansed on this basis."}, {"heading": "5.3. Survival Statistics", "text": "The only objective endpoint in most TMA studies is the prediction of the number of months a patient survives. As the experiments described in Section 2.3 document the major discrepancy between pathologists in estimating staining, it is therefore not desirable to adapt an algorithm to the estimates of a single pathologist or to a pathologist's consensus vote. To this end, the proposed computerized pathological framework is validated against the correct censored clinical survival data of the 133 ccRCC patients. Additionally, these results were compared with the estimates of a pathologist specializing in renal cell carcinoma. He analyzed all points in an exceptionally thorough manner that required more than two hours. This time-consuming annotation significantly exceeds standard clinical practice by a factor of 10 \u2212 20, and therefore the results can be considered an excellent human estimate for these datasets. Figure 9 shows Kaplan-Meier diagrams of the estimated cumulative pathological survival framework for the framework and pathologist."}, {"heading": "5.4. Project Conclusion", "text": "The presented framework of computer pathology can be characterized by the following characteristics: (i) simplicity: it can be used in plug-and-play fashion to train object detectors in near real time for a variety of tasks. (ii) novel feature base: The introduced relational features are able to capture form information, they are illumination invariant and extremely fast to evaluate. (iii) randomization: The randomized tree reduction algorithm is able to exploit the richness of the insoluble large feature space and exploit it it through an increasing diversity of the ensemble. (iv) real-world applicability: The proposed algorithms work well not only in kidney cancer tissue, but also in fluorescent imaging of pancreatic islands [78] and in quantifying stains in murine samples [102]."}, {"heading": "6. Future Directions", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "6.1. Histopathological Imaging", "text": "A promising line of research in medical image analysis points to online learning and interactive learning of computer image models, which requires real-world applications to adapt quickly to changing tissue types and staining modalities. Domain experts should be able to interactively train these models to adapt to new data. [103] For example, a fully digital pathology slide archive compiled through high-volume tissue scans. Peta-bytes of histological data, which will be available in the near future, also pose a number of software challenges, including distributed processing of worn slides and TMUs into image processors and real-world data centers."}, {"heading": "6.2. Clinical Application and Decision Support", "text": "In today's patient care, we are seeing an interesting trend towards integrating pathological diagnoses into web-based medical records. Avatar-based visualization has proven useful not only for medical professionals, but also for a new generation of patients who are better informed and need online updated and visualized information about their own condition and treatment routines. In addition, this approach to decision support can be extended by statistical models that are able to leverage this unified view of patients using data from a variety of clinical sources such as pathology, cytology, radiology, etc."}, {"heading": "6.3. Pathology@home", "text": "Real-time detection of cancer in vivo at the cellular level seems like a dream in patient care, but could become a reality in a few years. [104] The fiber optic fluorescence microscope includes an LED light, objective lens, fiber optic bundle and consumer-level DSLR. The system was used to image an oral cancer cell line, a human tissue preparation and the oral mucosa of a healthy person in vivo after topical application of 0.01% proflavin. The fiber optic microscope detached individual cell nuclei in all samples and tissues imaged, enabling qualitative and quantitative differences between normal and preventive or cancer-related problems that need to be identified. Combined with a framework for computer-assisted pathology, this technique would enable real-time classification of cancer cells in healthcare."}, {"heading": "6.4. Standards and Exchange Formats", "text": "One of the main obstacles to the widespread use of computer pathology is the lack of generally accepted standards and exchange formats. This deficit not only impedes film processing management and digital imaging of entire films [106], but also extends to statistical models and analysis software. Standardized exchange formats would support project-specific combinations of object detectors, staining algorithms and medical statistics. It would be highly desirable if at least the research community agreed on a few simple interfaces for data and model exchange."}, {"heading": "6.5.

Medical doctors need to assess these information sources and they rely on data driven automatic analysis tools. Methods for classification, grouping and segmentation of heterogeneous data sources as well as regression of noisy dependencies and estimation of survival probabilities enter the processing workflow of a pathology diagnosis system at various stages. This paper reports on state-of-the-art of the design and effectiveness of computational pathology workflows and it discusses future research directions in this emergent field of medical informatics and diagnostic machine learning.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
