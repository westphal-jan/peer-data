INTRODUCTION", "text": "The spectral evolution of harmonic sounds conveys essential information about audio classification, blind source separation, transcription, and other processing tasks, but this information is difficult to capture in time-varying polyphonic mixtures. On the one hand, spectral pattern recognition algorithms [1] are subject to recognition errors because they impose severe limitations on the form of harmonic patterns. On the other, time-variable generalizations of matrix factorization [2] are suppressed and therefore cannot lead to a satisfactory solution. In this article, we address the characterization of harmonic structures without any recognition or training. Wavelets have long proven that they provide significant, sparse activations as long as they operate on a dimension where the signal already exhibits a certain regularity. Although a single sine wave traces a regular edge at the time-frequency level, a harmonic composition is formed from sharp sharp spikes."}, {"heading": "2.

To address this, And\u00e9n et al. [4] have redefined wave frequencies as functions of both time and log frequency, indexed by pairs \u03bb2 = (\u03b1, \u03b2), where \u03b1 is a modulation frequency in hertz and \u03b2 is a frequency along the log frequencies in cycles per octave, defining the common wave frequencies as a function of the log frequency axis, i.e. along the chromes."}, {"heading": "2.3. Spiral scattering", "text": "The frequency spiral defined in Equation (7) corresponds in its total height to the variability of pitch. However, it is not aware that the harmonic structure of spoken sounds, such as vowels or musical notes, in the multi-stage evolution of this structure yields relevant information about transients and formal changes that are almost independent of pitch. To capture this information, we extend the common time frequency to regularity in time in conjunction with regularity along adjacent constant Q bands. Just like the wave filter banks along time and the log frequency, we were defined in the two previous subsections by introducing a third wave filter bank. We roll the log frequency variably into a tone spiral that makes a complete rotation in each octave (see Figure 1)."}, {"heading": "3. DEFORMATIONS OF THE SOURCE-FILTER MODEL", "text": "A classic model for the production of spoken language consists in the folding of a harmonic glottal source e (t) with a voice tract filter h (t).

The distorted source filter model is the signal xenvelope. We show in this section that e.g. \"t\" (t) and \"p\" (t) cause a change in fundamental frequency relatively uniformly over the support of first order waves, whereas \"p\" (t) is responsible for a local expansion of the spectral hull."}, {"heading": "3.2.

According to (a), partials p-6 = p have a negligible contribution to the source scalogram on the log frequency log (c). In the absence of an interference, this scalogram is constant over time, and we can drop the dependence into t: p-division p \u00b2 6 = p-division on the source scalogram on the log frequency log (g)."}, {"heading": "3.3. Harmonicity and spectral smoothness properties", "text": "The second step of the proof is to show that the folding along the chromes with the number \u03b2 applies only to e1, while the folding over octaves with the number 3 applies only to h1. In fact, all wavelengths are designed to have a negligible mean, i.e., to be interwoven with a constant yield of zero. Therefore, the harmonicity and spectral smothness properties are rewritten in the definition of spiral scattering [18] and [17] in the definition of spiral scattering yields."}, {"heading": "3.4.
