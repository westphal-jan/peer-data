Modeling the HSPTS Problem for the BusPlus Project", "text": "The HSPTS is a variant of the lift / arch location problem, where customers have access to a multimodal transport network, where buses run on a fixed network and taxis can transport customers on any pair of departure / destination points. Bus lines can be opened for a fixed price, which represents the cost of operating high frequency buses along the arc. The goal is to minimize the cost of the system, i.e. the fixed cost of operating the bus lines and the variable cost of each taxi ride, along with maximizing the convenience for the traveler. We use travel time as a substitute for the convenience of the traveler in the model. In order to make the design of the HSPTS controllable from a computational point of view, a number of simplifications are introduced. First, travel is modeled as a single commodity and the number of passengers is a factor in the cost of the journey. Second, the route and appointment aspects of the bus are ignored. Taxis are made available as in any place within a short time, and always from this system to the pick-up time."}, {"heading": "3. Review of Prior Work", "text": "The problem of linking a number of hubs to arcs is called Hub-Arc Location Problem or Hub-Spoke Network Design Problem: It was introduced by Campbell et al. (2005a, b) and is defined as the problem of locating a certain number of hubs location problem in a way that minimizes total flow costs. It is mainly used in transshipment contexts where economies of scale can be expected through grouping flows. Hub-Arc Location Problem (HALP) can be considered a two-step decision problem, which arcs are opened first and then how the flow is conducted at minimal cost. As such, its structure appears ideally suited to benders decomposition (Benders 1962). In recent years, a significant research body has been devoted to solving variants of the hub location problem and the HALP using benders decomposition, which studies typically impose limitations on network topology."}, {"heading": "4.

The entrances to the HSPTS are as follows: 1. a complete graph G with a series of nodes; 2. a series of service trips where each journey is made by a tuple (o, d, p) with an origin and destination of a journey dr, N, and a number of passengers pr, N, and a subset of nodes that can be used as a bus. Since the HSPTS problem aims to jointly optimize cost and convenience, we use a conversion factor to transform travel times into financial costs. Travel distance and travel time from nodes i to j (i, j) are given by dij and tij respectively. The value of the journey shifts the solution towards cost or convenience by changing travel times into financial costs."}, {"heading": "4.2.

A solution (and the associated cut) that dominates all other solutions is considered Pareto-optimal. Magnanti and Wong (1981) showed how to create an optimal Pareto cut by solving an optimization problem by using the notion of a core of a set of s, i.e., a point in the relative interior of the convex shell of S designated by ri (S) can be achieved by solving the following optimization problem."}, {"heading": "6.

First, note that each of the independent sub-problems is a minimal cost flow with edges of unlimited capacity and corresponds to a shortest path problem. Therefore, the original sub-problem for a given journey can be solved by calculation, whereby for each journey a shortest path between the origin and the destination using the edges defined by the union of Dr, the useful taxi sheets and Z, the amount of open bus legs in the current route. To define the Pareto sub-problem, it is necessary to find a core point that meets the circuit restriction (1a). It can be easily selected by assigning the same value to all z-variables."}, {"heading": "7.

Experimental Setting", "text": "The results in Section 4.2 already indicate that the difference between the days of the week is minimal. As a result, the experimental results use a single day and two groups of instances: a series of small instances with a number of trips ranging from 100 to over 2,000 trips; and a series of large instances ranging from 1,000 to over 20,000 trips. The small instances are primarily used to eliminate certain algorithmic options. The large instances are useful to demonstrate the scalability of the various advanced functions. Unless otherwise stated, the algorithms are used with the parameter settings shown in Table 3. Note that the time penalty emulates the waiting time associated with each bus ride, i.e. it includes at least ten minutes of waiting time - five minutes at the first and last stop. The LP / MIP solver (Gurobi Optimization) used in the experiments in Gurobi v6.0 (Gurobi Optimization 2015) will emulate the waiting time associated with each bus ride, i.e. it includes a minimum of ten minutes of waiting time - five minutes at the first and last stop."}, {"heading": "7.2. Justification of the Benders Approach", "text": "7.2.1. Benders \"Schemes Figure 4 reports on the results of the following implementations of Ben-ders\" small-scale composition: CR: A single standard subproblem; CP: A sing Pareto subproblem; SR: Multiple independent standard subproblems; SP: Multiple independent Pareto subproblem.The results increasingly refer to the small set of instances and use the standard parameters. The algorithms have a limit of 100 iterations: If the benders decomposition requires more than 100 iterations, it is most likely to have significant degenerations.The results in Figure 4 clearly show the value of the Pareto-optimal sections, as the standard approach can only solve the lower half of the instances before it requires more than one hundred iterations. They also show that a single pareto subproblem creates a hard MIP problem and execution times become a significant problem. Solving independent pareto problems subaddresses both problems 7.2."}, {"heading": "7.3. Benefits on the Case Study", "text": "We conclude this section by evaluating the approach based on the real case study: The Canberra public transport system. Table 5 compares the results of our BusPlus approach with the current Canberra public transport system known as Action. For BusPlus, the table gives the cost of the bus network, the total cost of the system and the average travel time in the three columns. For Action, the table gives the cost of the system and the average travel time. Experimental settings differ slightly between BusPlus and Action to reflect the state of the system as accurately as possible. In particular, we do not take into account the waiting time when boarding the bus in action, as this data is not available. The main reason for this reduction is the significant number of journeys served by taxis. Furthermore, the results show that the BusPlus approach divides the average travel time by two, even taking into account the waiting time for the bus in action."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusion", "text": "The BusPlus project aims to improve off-peak public transport in Canberra, Australia, covering a large geographical area that makes public transport particularly challenging. To address this difficulty, the BusPlus project proposes a lift and shuttle model consisting of a combination of some high-frequency bus lines between major hubs and a large number of shuttles that take passengers from their point of origin to the nearest hub and take them from their last bus stop to their destination. This paper focused on the design of the bus network, which can be modeled as a variant of the lift / arch problem. It proposed a series of pre-processing techniques, trip filtering and link filtering to reduce the problem size. It then introduced a bender decomposition approach that uses dedicated solution techniques to solve independent partial problems, Pareto optimal cuts, bundling and core point filtering to validate the benefits of these public design decisions."}], "references": [{"title": "Network flows", "author": ["Ahuja", "Ravindra K", "Thomas L Magnanti", "James B Orlin."], "venue": "Tech. rep., DTIC Document.
