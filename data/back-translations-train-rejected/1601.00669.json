In recent years, many cognitive models have focused on dual process theories to better describe and implement complex cognitive skills in artificial agents, but creativity has been approached only at a descriptive level. In previous works we have described various modules of the cognitive architecture that allows a robot to execute creative paintings. By means of dual process theories we refine some relevant mechanisms to obtain artworks, and in particular we explain details about the resolution level of the CA dealing with different strategies of access to the Long Term Memory (LTM) and managing the interaction between S1 and S2 processes of the dual process theory. The creative process involves both divergent and convergent processes in either implicit or explicit manner. This leads to four activities (exploratory, reflective, tacit, and analytic) that, triggered by urges and motivations, generate creative acts. These creative acts exploit both the LTM and the WM in order to make novel substitutions to a perceived image by properly mixing parts of pictures coming from different domains. The paper highlights the role of the interaction between S1 and S2 processes, modulated by the resolution level, which focuses the attention of the creative agent by broadening or narrowing the exploration of novel solutions, or even drawing the solution from a set of already made associations. An example of artificial painter is described in some experimentations by using a robotic platform.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Jan 2016 21:24:48 GMT  (5340kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00669v1", "30 pages, 8 figures, to appear in Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "30 pages, 8 figures, to appear in Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["agnese augello", "ignazio infantino", "antonio lieto", "giovanni pilato", "riccardo rizzo", "filippo vella"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.00669"}, "pdf": {"name": "1601.00669.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Artwork creation by a cognitive architecture integrating computational creativity and dual process approaches", "authors": ["Agnese Augello", "Ignazio Infantino", "Antonio Lieto", "Giovanni Pilato", "Riccardo Rizzo", "Filippo Vella"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "In recent years, many cognitive models have focused on dual process theories in order to better describe and implement complex cognitive skills in artificial agents, but creativity has only been approached on a descriptive level.

Cognitive architecture", "text": "The proposed cognitive architecture is inspired by the PSI model [5]: we have made small modifications to some functions and processes that block the original PSI model in order to implement the S1-S2 model and its interpretation of the four quadrants (Fig. 1). A creative process arises from a series of interactions highlighted by bold arrows in Fig. 1 that encompass both convergent and divergent processes. Such interactions can be described in the sense of a dual theory model that oscillates between divergent and convergent thinking and encompasses all four types of processes. Each process is labeled according to the corresponding system type: For example, an S1 system that operates a divergent process performs an \"exploration task.\" The creative process begins when the actor has adequate motivation. It is inspired by the perceptions of the actor (perception module), and it is phased through exploration, evaluation and evaluation."}, {"heading": "3.1. Resolution Level", "text": "In the original description of the PSI model, the Resolution Level Block works both as a modulator at the level of coded perception (output of the sampling phase) and as a communication module with the LTM. In our perspective, the resolution level can additionally control the S1 process outputs in the direction of S2 processes. The resolution level is correlated inversely with an activation parameter, which in turn is influenced by the impulses of the artist [5]. The creative process begins when there is an appropriate level of motivation leading to a value of artistic production. It aims at achieving a creative goal, such as the realization of a work of art. The resolution level seeks inspiration resulting from its perceptions. A high level of activation leads to a reduction of the resolution level, which leads to an acceleration of artistic production."}, {"heading": "3.2.

Motivation of the artist", "text": "The motivation parameter is the element that activates the creative process and influences the execution planning. This parameter is altered by an evaluation process (both internal and external). In fact, a good evaluation of the artworks and the reception of satisfaction by the public leads to an increase in the motivation of the artist. At the same time, the motivation increases when the artist who performs a difficult activity achieves a valuable result (in terms of his expectations). As a result, he experiences great satisfaction, feels a kind of competence. External and internal evaluation play a very important role in determining the artist's urges and consequently his motivation. In particular, the evaluation competence and sovereignty influence the others urges to determine the motivation of the artist. Competence is defined by Goertzel ([12]) as the effectiveness of the artist in fulfilling his needs."}, {"heading": "4.

paper proposes a novel cognitive architecture (CA) for computational creativity based on the Psi model and on the mechanisms inspired by dual process theories of reasoning and rationality. In recent years, many cognitive models have focused on dual process theories to better describe and implement complex cognitive skills in artificial agents, but creativity has been approached only at a descriptive level. In previous works we have described various modules of the cognitive architecture that allows a robot to execute creative paintings. By means of dual process theories we refine some relevant mechanisms to obtain artworks, and in particular we explain details about the resolution level of the CA dealing with different strategies of access to the Long Term Memory (LTM) and managing the interaction between S1 and S2 processes of the dual process theory. The creative process involves both divergent and convergent processes in either implicit or explicit manner. This leads to four activities (exploratory, reflective, tacit, and analytic) that, triggered by urges and motivations, generate creative acts. These creative acts exploit both the LTM and the WM in order to make novel substitutions to a perceived image by properly mixing parts of pictures coming from different domains. The paper highlights the role of the interaction between S1 and S2 processes, modulated by the resolution level, which focuses the attention of the creative agent by broadening or narrowing the exploration of novel solutions, or even drawing the solution from a set of already made associations. An example of artificial painter is described in some experimentations by using a robotic platform. Preprint submitted to BICA Journal (to appear).
