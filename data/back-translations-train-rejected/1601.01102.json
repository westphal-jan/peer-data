INTRODUCTION", "text": "While people enjoy the openness and convenience of social media, many malicious behaviors, such as bullying, terrorist attacks, and the spread of scam information on social media, can be observed. Therefore, it is extremely important that we can detect these abnormal activities as accurately and early as possible to prevent disasters and attacks. Of course, we have to say that more social information is available than the most difficult question is what useful patterns can be extracted from this influence of social media to task.By definition, the abnormal detection aims to \"find an observation that differs from other observations in order to raise suspicions that it was generated by some other mechanism.\" The common approach is to build a reference model, i.e., a statistical model that captures the generational process of the observed (or normal) data."}, {"heading": "2.

The algorithm aims to detect abnormal structures that differ from the general clustering structure. The rationality behind this method is that removing an edge can make partitioning the graph much easier, then the two linked nodes may have an anomalous relationship. Partitioning algorithm attempts to find the best number of partitions, so that the Minimal Description Length (MDL) is needed to encode and transmit the partitions of the graph. For a graph with a group of nodes, the minimized number of partitions."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "In this paper, we present an overview of social media detection methods. Based on the nature of the target anomalies, these methods fall into two categories: detection of dot anomalies and detection of group anomalies. Furthermore, given the different formats of input information, they can be further classified into activity-based approaches and graph-based approaches. In graph-based approaches, we divide the methods according to whether they take into account the time dynamics of the social chart. A challenge in detecting anomalies is to distinguish between data errors and \"real\" anomalies, i.e. those caused by changing the underlying data distribution. As in most cases, it is very difficult to obtain the basic truths for the anomalies. Usually, we ignore the differences before performing the anomaly detection. Only after obtaining the detection results and conducting detailed analysis can we elicit out the data error and \"acknowledge\" the anomalies."}, {"heading": "5. ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We would like to thank Dr. Sanjay Chawla of the University of Sydney for his encouragement and detailed advice in formulating the anomaly categorization, the difference between the data error and true anomalies.

With the recent popularity of social media, new types of anomalous behaviors arise, causing concerns from various parties. While a large amount of work have been dedicated to traditional anomaly detection problems, we observe a surge of research interests in the new realm of social media anomaly detection. In this paper, we present a survey on existing approaches to address this problem. We focus on the new type of anomalous phenomena in the social media and review the recent developed techniques to detect those special types of anomalies. We provide a general overview of the problem domain, common formulations, existing methodologies and potential directions. With this work, we hope to call out the attention from the research community on this challenging problem and open up new directions that we can contribute in the future.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
