This is in contrast to the problem of binary classification, where l belongs to either class 0 or 1 (or -1.1).The generalization performance of such a function measures how well it is able to predict the correct designation for a previously invisible sample. There are various approaches to this problem, and one against one (OAO), one against all (OAA), and P-against-Q (PAQ) methods (see [1]). Most of these methods are more empirical in nature and a precise mathematical theory to guide our choice of algorithms, because it does not seem to be a problem for classification."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related work", "text": "The problem of multi-class classification has been thoroughly investigated in [1], with the focus on the modelling of pattern classes with one against one, one against one, and P against Q. This study compares the advantages and disadvantages of each approach by using either a single or a series of neural networks supported by various decision-making functions.The results of this analysis show the advantages and disadvantages of dividing the task into several independently formed neural networks, some of which are the detected feature space regions and ambiguities.The authors of [3] demonstrate the increasing difficulty of the classification problem with an unbalanced class distribution. To solve the multi-class classification problem with support vector machines, without creating independent classifiers, a single optimization routine was proposed in [4].Whether to rely on an OAO, OAA, or PAQ approach is a non-trivial question, and a deeper analysis of the OAA approach can be found in [5]."}, {"heading": "2 Database and Descriptors", "text": "To increase the variance of the data, snapshots were taken in three regions in the range of 20cm-50cm and participants were asked to translate and rotate their hands during recording. In total, the total number of samples is 450,000 samples. Each sample is taken from raw point cloud data, which is transformed into a histogram of fixed size using a global point cloud descriptor. The descriptor describes the global shape of the cloud using the relationship of angles calculated from a sample subset of point cloud pairs. For a more detailed specification of this function transformation, see [2]. Interested in the multi-step classification task of shape recognition, we automatically remove the background from the record by simple distance threshold. Gestures selected for this classification task are relevant for HMI applications and contain a significant amount of ambiguity, creating a hard problem for a meaningful benchmark."}, {"heading": "3 Multi-class classification and fusion technique", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.1 Neural network topology", "text": "We strive for an OAA classification approach and therefore design our neural networks accordingly. We implement a two-step approach with two different multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks. Each neural network consists of three layers - input, hide and output layer, with the input and hidden layers fully connected to their subsequent layers. Input to the first network is formed by the point cloud descriptor of the current sample, the output layer consists of 10 output neurons, one for each class. Input to the second network differs in that it takes into account not only the descriptor of the current sample, but also the output values of the first network classifying the same sample. Determining the number of hidden neurons for each network is described in the following chapter."}, {"heading": "3.2 Early fusion technique", "text": "In order to train the two-step architecture described in the previous chapter, the available data samples must be divided into three disjunct sets. We distinguish between the training sets (D1 and D2) and the generalization sets (D3), the latter consisting of all sets (approximately 30,000), which are of person 1 \u2264 i \u2264 15. The remaining sets are divided into the two sets of equal size D1 and D2. In order to monitor the training performance, we also randomly divide each D1 and D2 into the sets D1.train, D1.test, D2.train and D2.test at a ratio of 9: 1. These sets are used during the training of each network to achieve a more independent measurement of the current generation performance. For the first network, D1.train is used for training the network, while the mean square error measured on the D1.test is used for selecting the most powerful network among all the performed iterations. As soon as the first network is trained, the second network is followed by the main sample, the second one is trained on D2."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments and Results", "text": "All experiments were performed with the FANN library and implemented under Ubuntu in C + +. We have tested several configurations to determine the hidden layer size and optimal training parameters, and initial tests have shown that the best generalization results can be achieved by setting the size of the hidden layer between 25-40 neurons for both networks, the remaining parameters have been selected as defaults, and various configurations have been tested that do not provide meaningful insights into our problem. The training algorithm is RPROP, the activation function is the symmetrical signature function for both hidden and output layers. On average, we have been able to improve the generalization results between 2-4% taking into account all classes, as shown in Table 1 when using two nets of 40 neurons each in the hidden layer. The top row shows the results for nets 1 alone, with the bottom row only feeding the feature vector while the bottom row is doubled."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion and Outlook", "text": "This paper presents a novel fusion technology for the multi-class pattern classification problem of hand position recognition with neural networks. The described approach is a 2-step deep neural network with a total of 5 layers. Our fusion approach exceeds the performance of a normal neural network by about 2-3% compared to the average of more than 15 people occurring classification errors, each of which has been removed from the training set, which is equivalent to a kind of cross-validation procedure. Specifically, we are able to significantly increase the performance of a normal neural network in a number of cases, especially where postures are more difficult to decipher. Nevertheless, in two cases we see a decrease in classification performance, which must also be taken into account when designing a real-time applicable system. In these cases, however, one can simply rely on the first network to design a decision function and use the second network for the other instances to stabilize our performance. In terms of the process, we have further demonstrated that we have this authentication capability by leveraging our decision system to the first network and to the second network for the other instances."}], "references": [{"title": "Multi-class pattern classification using neural networks", "author": ["Guobin Ou", "Yi Lu Murphey"], "venue": "Pattern Recognition,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Neural network based data fusion for hand pose recognition with multiple tof sensors", "author": ["Thomas Kopinski", "Alexander Gepperth", "Stefan Geisler", "Uwe Handmann"], "venue": "In Artificial Neural Networks\u2013ICANN", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Oaho: an effective algorithm for multi-class learning from imbalanced data", "author": ["Yi Lu Murphey", "Haoxing Wang", "Guobin Ou", "Lee A Feldkamp"], "venue": "In Neural Networks,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Support vector machines for multi-class pattern recognition", "author": ["Jason Weston", "Chris Watkins"], "venue": "In ESANN,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 1999}, {"title": "In defense of one-vs-all classification", "author": ["Ryan Rifkin", "Aldebaro Klautau"], "venue": "The Journal of Machine Learning Research,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Multi-class protein fold recognition using support vector machines and neural networks", "author": ["Chris HQ Ding", "Inna Dubchak"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2001}, {"title": "The german traffic sign recognition benchmark: a multi-class classification competition", "author": ["Johannes Stallkamp", "Marc Schlipsing", "Jan Salmen", "Christian Igel"], "venue": "In Neural Networks (IJCNN), The 2011 International Joint Conference on,", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2011}, {"title": "A real-time applicable 3d gesture recognition system for automobile hmi", "author": ["Thomas Kopinski", "Stefan Geisler", "Louis-Charles Caron", "Alexander Gepperth", "Uwe Handmann"], "venue": "In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC),", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2014}], "referenceMentions": [{"referenceID": 0, "context": "Various approaches exist for this problem and one generally distinguishes oneagainst-one (OAO), one-against-all(OAA) and P-against-Q (PAQ) methods (see [1]).", "startOffset": 152, "endOffset": 155}, {"referenceID": 1, "context": "We present a novel approach which is somewhere in the middle between OAA and OAO, applied to the problem of hand pose recognition with a single ToF[2].", "startOffset": 147, "endOffset": 150}, {"referenceID": 0, "context": "The problem of multi-class classification has been thoroughly researched in [1] with special emphasis of modelling pattern classes with one-against-all, oneagainst-one and P-against-Q.", "startOffset": 76, "endOffset": 79}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "The authors of [3] show the increased difficulty in the classification problem with an imbalanced class distribution.", "startOffset": 15, "endOffset": 18}, {"referenceID": 3, "context": "In order to solve the multi-class classification problem with support vector machines without creating independent classifiers a single optimisation routine has been proposed in [4].", "startOffset": 178, "endOffset": 181}, {"referenceID": 4, "context": "Whether to rely on an OAO, OAA or an PAQ approach is a non-trivial question and a more in-depth analysis in favor of the OAA approach can be found in [5].", "startOffset": 150, "endOffset": 153}, {"referenceID": 5, "context": "In [6] the authors successfully show how a multi-class classifier can be efficiently applied to the problem of protein folding with a special focus on the comparison of various discriminative methods.", "startOffset": 3, "endOffset": 6}, {"referenceID": 6, "context": "In [7] the performance of different neural network topologies is tested on the multi-class problem of traffic sign recognition.", "startOffset": 3, "endOffset": 6}, {"referenceID": 1, "context": "For a more in-depth specification of this feature transformation please refer to [2].", "startOffset": 81, "endOffset": 84}, {"referenceID": 7, "context": "In terms of applicability we have implemented this fusion technique into our realtime hand gesture recognition system and it has shown to stabilize the results when designing the decision process as described above [8].", "startOffset": 215, "endOffset": 218}], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "We present a novel method to perform multi-class pattern classification with neural networks and test it on a challenging 3D hand gesture recognition problem.
