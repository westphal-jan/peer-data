INTRODUCTION", "text": "Part of language (POS) tagging is the task of assigning grammatical categories (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to words in a natural language sentence [1]. POS tagging can be used in various NLP (Natural Language Processing) applications. Interest in the application of NLP methods for analyzing non-standardized texts, such as social media texts, is growing rapidly [2], because the automatic analysis of social media texts is one of the essential prerequisites for the task of sentiment analysis [3]. Since social media texts contain blog comments or chat messages, it differs from standardized texts in word usage, but also in their grammatical structure. This creates the need for adaptation of NLP methods for analyzing social media texts and in particular for adapting POS tagging methods to such text types. Most state-of-the-art tagger texts have been developed for standardized text."}, {"heading": "2. PREPARATION OF TRAINING DATA", "text": "The training data published for the ICON 2015 joint task contain three files: a file for Bengali-English language pairs, a file for Hindi-English language pairs, and a file for Tamil-English language pairs. Each line in a file contains tokens in the respective pair's languages, language tag, and part-of-speech tag. Participants are instructed to generate the output in the same format after testing the system based on the test data, where the test data per line includes a tab-separated token and the corresponding language tag. Our system uses a training file for a language pair and converts each sentence into a sequence of tokens and tags, each token in this new format being formed by combining the source token and some other information such as language tag. Details of this format will be discussed in later sections."}, {"heading": "3.

We follow the following rules for assigning this broad POS tag extracted from the dictionary to the token: If a raw token is found in the dictionary and the broad POS tag of the token in question is XXXX, then Meta tag = \"XXXX\" ending ifAs we have used only verb, pronouns and conjunctions in the dictionaries, XXXX can assume one of three values: VERB, PNON and CONJ."}, {"heading": "5.

CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper describes a POS tagging system for code-mixed social media text in Indian languages. Features such as dictionary-based information and some other word-level features were introduced into the HMM model. Experimental results show that the performance of our system is comparable to the best performing systems that participated in the ICON task 2015: POS tagging for code-mixed Indian social media text. The POS tagging system was developed on the basis of the Visual Basic platform so that a suitable user interface can be designed for beginners. The system was designed so that only changing the training corpus in one file can make the system portable to other Indian languages."}], "references": [{"title": "November.
