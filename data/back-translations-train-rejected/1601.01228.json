There are many different performance metrics that have been employed in prior financial fraud detection research.

Results and Analysis", "text": "We have values for all binary classification variables listed in Table 1, except for cost minimization, as there was no readily available information about the cost of each metric in the dataset. We also listed the percentage of classification errors in Table 3, which was defined as the percentage of total samples. Finally, we have the standard deviation of each metric across all cross-sectional folds in Table 4. Using the metrics, we can immediately see that several algorithms achieved very high performance across different criteria: SVM, GP2, FL, and the accuracy of each metric above 90% and the false positive folds in Table 4.0."}, {"heading": "FL 0.002 0.012 0.002 0.273 0.002 0.020 0.013", "text": "Since each fold is a subset of the same dataset, large variations in the results between the folds can indicate higher sensitivity to minor changes in the data, which is a desirable feature in a complicated problem such as detecting financial fraud. Precision showed the largest standard deviation from any metric, most likely as another consequence of the unbalanced nature of the dataset, leading to greater variance in the metrics they analyze. Since this imbalance is typical of the problem of detecting financial fraud, precision is probably an excellent metric for evaluating algorithm performance. In addition, we can see that the optimization of the colony and the two neural networks all tend to a higher standard deviation over metrics than other methods. Specifically, NN2 had the highest of all methods that examine sensitivity and 0.071 for specificity."}], "references": [{"title": "Data mining for credit card fraud: A comparative study", "author": ["S.
