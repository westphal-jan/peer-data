Solving such a problem is often reduced to heuristic programming, which can provide good results, but in this case the complex solution of the problem is not provided. Systems based on knowledge representation models (KRMs) belong to the largest classes of IIS. To date, the following models are known and actively used: semantic networks, conceptual graphs, frames, scripts, logical and production models, ontologies, etc. However, despite the use of one or other KRM as the basis for an IIS, an implemented system consists of at least two levels, namely the KRM level and the level of its practical implementation. Implementation of an RM often creates defined problems and complexities linked to the interaction of different levels of the system, and the structural model itself is a representative object that is presented in this context, a structural object that is partially oriented in a]."}, {"heading": "Fuzzy Objects and Classes", "text": "It is obvious that each object (regardless of its nature) has certain properties that are characteristic of it. In fact, in order to show whether the numbers \u2212 1, 4,67 and 5 are natural, it is necessary to check their properties, in particular, to check whether these numbers have the same properties as natural numbers. As a result of the verification, it becomes obvious that \u2212 1 and 4,67 are not natural numbers. From this it is possible to conclude that a natural number is a crisply defined object. \u2212 1 and 4,67 are not natural numbers."}, {"heading": "Operations Over Fuzzy Objects and Classes", "text": "A distinguishing feature of all the methods mentioned above, irrespective of the class in which they are defined, is that all of them are local, i.e. closed under the class in which they are defined. This is because methods of objects are defined intrinsically, i.e., based on properties. There are methods that are defined in a class of fuzzy objects ({} (T) (T) (2), but can be applied simultaneously to other classes of fuzzy objects, i.e., they are polymorphic within certain limits. To implement polymorphism, some object-oriented programming languages use the mechanism called operator overload [5]. In [3] operations such as merge, difference, symmetric difference and cloning are considered, which can be applied to any objects and classes of objects; at the same time, they do not require overloading and are rather universal distinguishing features of these classes."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This article formulates definitions of a blurred object and a class of blurred objects, which can form the basis of structural descriptions of blurred objects and at the same time allow their classification; it also takes into account two types of operations on blurred objects and classes of blurred objects (exploiters and modifiers), which can be used to create sets and new classes of objects; and changes in the structure of objects and their properties can be modelled, in particular, under the influence of external factors. This approach makes it possible to model some capabilities of human intelligence, in particular mechanisms of analysis, classification, search and recognition of objects and object classes based on their properties. The results obtained allow us to attest that blurred object-oriented dynamic networks are constructed as models for the representation of knowledge of blurred objects, classes and concepts."}, {"heading": "1.
