PROBLEM STATEMENT", "text": "Safety is an ability of the electrical energy system to withstand sudden disturbances without unforeseen effects on electricity consumers. It is ensured by the control capacities of the energy systems. In operational practice, the required level of safety can be achieved both through preventive control measures (before a fault) and emergency control measures (after a fault).The complexity of a problem lies in the fact that most of the hazardous (pre-emergency) states of the electrical energy system, which lead to large-scale blackouts, are unique and that there is no single algorithm (to solve) to effectively detect such states as time. The problem is complicated by the fact that the safety limit of the electrical energy system is constantly changing, so fast methods of monitoring the safety in real time are needed to analyze the current safety level and capture the most vulnerable regions along this period."}, {"heading": "III. ENSEMBLE ALGORITHMS OF CLASSIFICATION AND THE PROBLEM OF POWER SECURITY ASSESSMENT", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to determine for themselves what they want to do and what they want to do."}, {"heading": "IV. CALCULATION OF A POWER SYSTEM SECURITY ON THE BASIS OF ENSEMBLE MODELS", "text": "Figure 1 represents a general scheme of the proposed approach to estimating the safety of the power system. The primary principle of the approach is the automatic collection of the mathematical model based on the ensemble method of classification, which automatically provides a sufficiently accurate assessment of the conditions of the power system according to the criterion \"secure / unsecure\" on the basis of significant classification attributes of a power system, for example active and reactive current flows, bus voltage, etc. A large number of such attributes are collected on the basis of randomly generated data, consisting of a number of really possible states of the power system [2]. Depending on the ensemble method applied to each decision rule, their subsampling will train and supplement the principles. The final decision on the classification of any power system is made within the generalized classification according to other principles of simple majority selection, weighted decision-making or competent selection."}, {"heading": "V. CASE STUDY", "text": "The feasibility of the proof-of-concept approach was demonstrated at the IEEE 118 power supply system, which consists of more than 118 buses, 54 generators and 186 transmission lines. An open source R [16] environment with Caret package [17] is used as a computing environment for the design and testing of proposed models."}, {"heading": "A. Data base generation", "text": "Database generation and data conversion are performed in MATLAB. The general procedure of database generation, the aim of which was to provide a representative sample of possible states of the power supply system, combining various operating states and faults prior to the fault, is shown in Figure 2.To obtain the database consisting of 6877 states, a sample of different states prior to the fault was first generated and random faults applied to each state to generate the corresponding stability scenarios. To obtain the database consisting of 6877 states, each of the states prior to the fault was combined with the possible faults, which were simulated with a variable step MATLAB / PSAT, which composed the attribute values and enabled us to classify the scenarios based on the safety index as normal, alarm, emergency 1 and emergency 2."}, {"heading": "B. Estimating Performance For Classification", "text": "We used the following parameters: \u2022 The general accuracy of a model indicates how well the model predicts the actual data. \u2022 The Kappa statistics take into account the expected error rate: k = O \u2212 E 1 \u2212 E (4), where O is the observed accuracy and E is the expected accuracy under random agreement."}, {"heading": "C. Overview of obtained results", "text": "Table II shows the comparison of the accuracy achieved by the state-of-the-art classification tree learning algorithms. Notably, the following classifiers were tested: J48 Decision Tree, conventional Breiman's non-parametric decision technology CART, packaged CART (BCART), Random Forest, Extra Trees (ET) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGB) method. The ensemble and single tree methods were trained on 6877 random samples and tested on 1715 random samples. The fusion matrix is shown in Tab I. Each column of the matrix represents the distances in a predicted class, while each row represents the distances in an actual ClassFig. 3 indicates test errors in the number of trees for normal, alarm, emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency, and emergency."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "The ensemble classification methods have been tested on the modified IEEE 118 power supply system and show that the proposed technique can be used to investigate whether the power supply system is safe under stationary operating conditions. Experimental studies showed that the ensemble methods can identify important system parameters as safety indicators with high accuracy and that the obtained safety tree model can generate an alarm to trigger emergency control systems if required. In the next stage of this work, real data of the power supply system will be collected and the multiple decision-making with many power subscribers modelled."}], "references": [{"title": "Development of software for modelling decentralized intelligent systems for security monitoring and control in power systems", "author": ["D.
