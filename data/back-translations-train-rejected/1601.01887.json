Semi-automatic categorization means that the mistakes made by automatic pre-categorization and relationship-extraction will be corrected through a wikipedia-like front-end by volunteers from general public.

TERMINOLOGY", "text": "A scientific document that is published is a publication. It can be an essay that has the format title, abstract, body and references. It can also be a data set, an encoded algorithm or an audiovisual sample - complementary material. It can also be a combination of these things. A scientific document is an essay in any device-independent file format such as PDF, PS, DVI, etc. The metadata of the paper is represented by its BIBTEX entry plus the list of cited publications."}, {"heading": "III. DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECTIVE", "text": "In fact, it is a kind of conspiracy theory that is able to hide."}, {"heading": "IV. ACCESSING SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL", "text": "In the scientific tradition, supplementary material of an essay can be accessed by making a request to the authors. This tradition is based on the idea that any insight by colleagues should be verified on the basis of supplementary material. As one has a Scientometric ontology in which each work has a type, one would easily create a query to obtain names of authors who possess similar supplementary material and address them all in the request for supplementary material. The less traditional way is to publish the supplementary material along with the essay. The second approach obviously provides quicker access. Hereby, the authors must agree to a certain type of license whose disadvantages may outweigh the academic incentive for some of the authors. In the case of standalone publication of data sets as a subtype of supplementary material, the academic incentive is recently explained by the Data Citation Synthesis Group by a list of justifiable reasons [15]."}, {"heading": "V. CREATING CLUSTERS MANUALLY", "text": "It is a publication with experimental data that is not involved in a survey. It should only be a study of human behavior and decision-making. There are two distinct communities that deal with two sides of the same problem, that is, the data that scientists deal with huge noisy datasets of human behavior from web and behavioral economists who collect clean small but insightful datasets while conducting experiments on human subjects. There is some interest in integrating domain knowledge and datasets from behavioral economics into web mining. As the website ExLab (exlab.bus.ucf.edu) for supplementarymaterials of human subject research is defunct, there is no other way to accessing the data than to email the author the new type \"laboratory behavior study\" = Labbehavior in the scientometric ontology."}, {"heading": "VI. RELATED WORK", "text": "The semantics of ScienceDocCl is that it is a publication with clusters calculated on scientific documents, and the methodology presented should be scalable to up to 5M of papers, as currently available on Citeseerx. It should not be clusters based on (co) quotes or other metadata, but clusters of scientific documents should be formed according to the type of practical work done and not according to the topic of research. Assessment of cluster algorithms on document sets has been a subject of research for decades [9]. An essay [20] is particularly interesting because it evaluates cluster algorithms on 2M of scientific documents. The best result of cluster formation could be impressively represented by graph visualization software. Unfortunately, it was a topic-oriented cluster. Clusters according to the type of practical work carried out will be a greater challenge - it requires a deeper understanding of language than] the best result of clustering by a web visualization software."}, {"heading": "VII. TIME & COST PLAN", "text": "The most important practical work for this research proposal will be to build a \"big data\" infrastructure, where massive (24 / 7) parallel runs with different clustering approaches are carried out and the performance of the generated classifiers is recorded on the manually generated sample clusters. This would require some investment in hardware. There is a certain trend towards the GPU in the text cluster [23]. Collecting scientific documents and their metadata is not a completely trivial task. There is a cheap way to download this data from Citeseerx, which will result in very loud metadata, and there is a more expensive way to get cleaner data from sources such as the Web of Science.Finally, the search for a custom ontology website system will run in parallel. Given the current pace of progress, such systems will be developed in a year or two."}], "references": [{"title": "The Semantic Web of Data", "author": ["T.
