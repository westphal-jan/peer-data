As a first step toward achieving that goal, we propose a model that observes in real time the diversity brought by each item relatively to a short sequence of consultations, corresponding to the recent user history. Our model has a complexity in constant time, and is generic since it can apply to any type of items within an online service (e.g. profiles, products, music tracks) and any application domain (e-commerce, social network, music streaming), as long as we have partial item descriptions. The observation of the diversity level over time allows us to detect implicit changes. In the long term, we plan to characterize the context, i.e. to find common features among a contiguous sub-sequence of items between two changes of context determined by our model. This will allow us to make context-aware and privacy-preserving recommendations, to explain them to users. As this is an ongoing research, the first step consists here in studying the robustness of our model while detecting changes of context. In order to do so, we use a music corpus of 100 users and more than 210,000 consultations (number of songs played in the global history). We validate the relevancy of our detections by finding connections between changes of context and events, such as ends of session. Of course, these events are a subset of the possible changes of context, since there might be several contexts within a session. We altered the quality of our corpus in several manners, so as to test the performances of our model when confronted with sparsity and different types of items. The results show that our model is robust and constitutes a promising approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Jan 2016 15:50:03 GMT  (1748kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01917v1", "27th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI 2015), Nov 2015, Vietri sul Mare, Italy"]], "COMMENTS": "27th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI 2015), Nov 2015, Vietri sul Mare, Italy", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["sylvain castagnos", "amaury l 'huillier", "anne boyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.01917"}, "pdf": {"name": "1601.01917.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Toward a Robust Diversity-Based Model to Detect Changes of Context", "authors": ["Sylvain Castagnos"], "emails": ["sylvain.castagnos@loria.fr", "amaury.lhuillier@loria.fr", "anne.boyer@loria.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "This year is the highest in the history of the country."}, {"heading": "II.

Diversity in Recommender Systems", "text": "This dimension is considered in the literature in two ways: some analyze the impact of diversity on user behavior, while others integrate diversity within a set of items. Thus, the diversification of recommendations consists in identifying the best items that are very similar to the known preferences of users, while reducing the similarity between these recommendations. A diversity classification was proposed by Adomavicius and Kwon [1], which distinguishes individual diversity and aggregate diversity depending on whether we are interested in making recommendations to individuals or groups of users."}, {"heading": "B. Context-Aware Recommender Systems", "text": "Integrating context into the referral process is an increasing field of research known as CARS, acronym for Context Aware Recommender Systems. In their state-of-the-art, Adomavicius et al. present several approaches such as contextual modeling, pre / post-filter method for using contextual factors to adapt recommendations to the context of users [2]. Contextual factors are all information that can be collected and used by a system to determine and characterize the current context of the user. For example, a system can use the location of the user to adapt the recommendation [13]. The main drawbacks of this type of systems are that they are invasive, using personal information and most often require a complex representation model. For example, such systems can use ontologies to determine the user context [7]. However, such an ontology cannot be transferred from one domain to another."}, {"heading": "III. MODEL AND HYPOTHESES", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Overview", "text": "As explained above, the role of our model is to monitor the diversity level within the user's navigation path over time and derive its implicit context from it. Specifically, each time a user consults a new element, we will calculate the added value of that element - called the goal - relative to a short history (i.e. the previously consulted elements k) in terms of diversity. To ensure a better understanding of our model, we will rely on an example shown in Figure 1. Let's imagine an online service that allows users to listen to music and browse various types of profiles, as we can do on social networks (profiles of other users, profiles of artists, information about record companies, etc.) For each user, we can then consider his / her sequence of consultations. In this example, we understand that there could be multiple contexts within one session, and several ways to classify them."}, {"heading": "B. Formalism", "text": "Before assessing the relative diversity that the new model entails, we will formally introduce it and introduce some notations. We call it U = {u1, u2,..., un} the number of users. (...) The current user history of size k in time t, called Cuk, can be written in the form of a sequence of items. (..., c u \u2212 2, c \u2212 1, c u \u2212 1 >. In the end, Ai = a1, a2, ah is the number of attributes of an item i. Let us note that each item consulted, such as section, reference to an item i of series I. Our model is a Markov model. (i.e.) Each time the active user consults a new item, calculates the relative diversity that is brought to C by the new item consulted."}, {"heading": "C. Hypotheses", "text": "The scientific question now is whether our model is stable against a realistic situation in which: (1) we do not know what will happen after the current time t, (2) we have scant data in terms of article descriptions, for these reasons we will make 3 assumptions discussed in Section IV. H1. The extension of our model presented in this paper is able to detect changes in the implicit context without knowing the consultation at the time t + 1, and a large number of these discoveries coincide with events such as the end of the session. This assumption was not taken into account in our preliminary work in [3], as we analysed variations of diversity a posteriori across the user's entire navigation path and conducted consultations at all times. We will therefore examine how many endings of the session we can retrieve by using only data at a time t, even if this does not reduce the interests and relevance of our other discoveries, as explained above (see Section III-A)."}, {"heading": "IV.

Material", "text": "To test our various hypotheses, we decided to do our evaluation based on a set of music data. This choice was made because music files have many advantages. Firstly, music files have their own consultation time, i.e. the time spent consulting a song cannot vary from one user to another. Secondly, song metadata can be easily accessed by using some specialized services such as Echnonest1 or Musicbrainz2. Finally, users often listen to several songs in a row, as opposed to a film corpus, for example. Our data set contains 212,233 tracks listened to by 100 users. We obtained these consultations by using the Last.fm3 API to collect listening events from June 28, 2005 to December 18, 2014. Our data set consists of 41,742 individual records performed by 5,370 individual artists. To create the sessions for all users, we assumed that a session is a sequence of metadata larger than the 15 minutes."}, {"heading": "B.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "Our model allows to monitor the natural diversity that is contained in the user's navigation path over time and, although part of an ongoing research, already presents many strengths to characterize the context of the user. First, it has a complexity in constant time, since at each step of the time we only accept computational diversity on a fixed and small scale of history. This makes our model highly scalable. Furthermore, it preserves privacy since it does not require personal information about the active user (even if it allows the use of information that other users accept) and allows us to forget the navigation path beyond recent history. Finally, it is awesome because our equations correspond to any kind of attributes and do not require ontology to put words into context. One of the issues addressed in this paper was our ability to predict changes in the implicit context without knowing what will happen next."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This work was financed by the Lorraine Region and the Municipality of Greater Nancy in collaboration with Yupeek."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Being able to automatically and quickly under-<lb>stand the user context during a session is a main issue for<lb>recommender systems.
