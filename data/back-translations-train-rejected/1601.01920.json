INTRODUCTION", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "2. MOTIVATION AND PROBLEM STATEMENTS", "text": "This research was motivated by the following factors: lack of ontological semantic intermediaries for the representation of environmental processes. According to [17], ontology is the formal description of a discourse domain intended for exchange between different applications and expressed in a language that can be used for argumentation. Ontological modeling of key terms for environmental phenomena such as object, state, process and event ensures the drawing of precise conclusions from the sequence of processes leading to an event. This can easily be achieved by using an ontology that gains widespread acceptance of the semantic community and broadens it to meet current environmental requirements, ensuring the development of high-quality environmental ontologies that allow an explicit representation of the process."}, {"heading": "3.

HIGH-LEVEL APPROACH TO MIDDLEWARE DESIGN", "text": "The development of the semantic middleware follows a step-by-step approach. The proposed middleware is a software layer consisting of a series of different sublayers that are interconnected between the application layer and the physical layer. It is essential for the middleware to conceal the complexity of data heterogeneity from multiple data sources and to represent the data semantically on a uniform ontology. It also provides an application programming interface (API) for physical layer communication, abstraction of network communication and presentation of data in a machine-readable format for easy integration and interoperability. Based on these needs, an environmental process-oriented ontology is required to overcome the problems associated with the dynamic nature of environmental data and data heterogeneities. The study proposes to use a fundamental fundamentalism theory of ontology DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic Engineering)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Middleware Development", "text": "According to [8], an ontology is a desirable solution to achieve semantic interoperability, since it captures concepts of a domain and provides a basis for the discovery and resolution of semantic conflicts in sensor data. It consists of formal axioms that describe concepts, individuals, and the relationships between them. Developing a middleware framework will be based on ontology. By using ontologies to enrich the descriptions of the domain, the semantics of the data content or service functionality will become machine-interpretable, and users will be able to make concise and expressive queries, implying that the ontology developed identifies entities and physical properties, followed by the relationships between them for the semantic reference of metadata. Since ontology is merely a passive object, an inference engine is also required to enable query and argumentation with the semantic descriptions of sensor devices and service devices."}, {"heading": "4.2 Middleware Architecture", "text": "The middleware layer is a three-tiered architecture consisting of application abstraction layer, ontology segment layer and interface protocol layer as illustrated in Figure 3.4.2.1. This layer provides a high degree of software abstraction that enables communication between applications and the semantic middle layers. 4.2.2 Ontology segment layer The middleware layer semantically refers to the heterogeneous data streams based on uniform ontology. This layer contains the ontology module, the argumentation module, the inference engine and the description module of semantic services. 4.2.3 Interface protocol layer The interface protocol layer connects to the cloud storage database to download the semi-processed sensory reading."}, {"heading": "5. OUTLOOK ON IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "The first step is the acquisition of the data by the sensors, which involves setting up WSNs for the area currently under investigation. Research uses Libelium sensor nodes, in particular the Waspmote Mote Runner8. The motors are based on the 6LoWPAN protocol, which enables the transmission of compressed IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Environmental measurements are uploaded via SMS gateway for storage in the cloud, followed by the capture of native knowledge about drought through questionnaires, workshops and interactive sessions. The middleware layer acts as a link between heterogeneous domains of the application community via heterogeneous interfaces. It integrates interface protocols, with 8http: / / www.libelium.com / liaise using the cloud storage database to represent semi-processed sensory reading accurately, based on ontology by a mediator [4]."}, {"heading": "6. EXPECTED OUTCOMES", "text": "The study is expected to produce an ontology-based semantic middleware that facilitates the semantic representation and integration of heterogeneous sensor data with indigenous knowledge. It will enhance effective integration in a heterogeneous environment, particularly for seamless data transfer and communication for an IoT-based DEWS. The middleware will be used to assign semantic meaning to observed property, and the detection-oriented CEP engine will derive patterns from observed properties based on indicators derived from indigenous knowledge, which will increase the accuracy of drought forecasting information disseminated through output channels. Furthermore, the representation of heterogeneous data sources through the proposed ontology and integration with indigenous knowledge will be demonstrated."}, {"heading": "7.
