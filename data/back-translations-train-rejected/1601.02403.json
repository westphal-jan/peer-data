We are selecting several target areas in the field of education policy, such as homeschooling, singlesex, or mainstream. 5 A new aspect of the corpus is the coverage of user accounts, such as comments on articles, discussion positions, and professional news agencies. Since the data comes from a variety of sources, we can derive the actual content of the reasoning."}, {"heading": "2. Theoretical background", "text": "Let us first present some definitions of the term reasoning itself. Ketcham (1917, p. 3) defines reasoning as \"the art of persuading others to think or act in a certain way. It encompasses all writings and speeches that are convincing in their form.\" According to MacEwan (1898), \"reasoning is the process of proving or refuting a statement; its purpose is to create a new belief, truth, or combat error in the mind of another.\" Freeley and Steinberg (2008, p. 2) limit the scope of reasoning to \"giving in communicative situations by people whose purpose is to justify actions, beliefs, attitudes, and values.\" Although these definitions differ, the purpose of reasoning remains the same - to convince others. We would like to emphasize that our perception of reasoning goes beyond any limited reasons (Freeley and Steinberg 2008; Damer 2013)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Argumentation models", "text": "Despite the lack of consensus on the ultimate reasoning theory, various argumentation models have been proposed that capture the reasoning at different levels. Argumentation models abstract from the language level to a concept level that emphasizes the connections between the various components of an argument or the relationship between arguments (Prakken and Vreeswijk 2002). Bentahar, Moulin and B\u00e9langer (2010) propose a taxonomy of reasoning models that is divided horizontally into three categories - micro-level models, macro-level models and rhetorical models. In this article we will deal with micro-level reasoning (also referred to as reasoning as a product or monological model). Micro-level reasoning focuses on the structure of a single argument. Macro-level models (also called dialogical models) and rhetorical models highlight the process of reasoning in a dialogue (Bentahar, Moulin and B\u00e9langer 2010, p. 215)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Dimensions of argument", "text": "The aforementioned models essentially focus on only one dimension of the argument, namely the logos dimension. According to the classical Aristotle theory (Aristotle and Kennedy (translator) 1991), the argument can exist in three dimensions, namely logos, pathos and ethos. The logos dimension represents proof by reason, an attempt to convince by establishing a logical argument. For example, syllogism belongs to this dimension of argument (Rapp and Wagner 2012; Amossy 2009). The pathos dimension uses the attraction to the emotions of the recipient and influences his insight (Micheli 2008). The ethos dimension of the argument is based on the credibility of the argumentator. This distinction will have practical implications later in Section 4.4, which deals with argumentation on the website.7 However, there are some argumentation theorists who disagree with this distinction and regard argumentation as purely dialogical."}, {"heading": "2.3 Original Toulmin\u2019s model", "text": "We conclude the theoretical section with a detailed presentation of a (micro-plane) argumentation model - a widely used conceptual argumentation model introduced by Toulmin (1958), which we will henceforth refer to as the original model of Toulmin.8 This model will later play an important role in the annotation studies (Section 4.4) and in the experimental work (Section 5.1).The model consists of six parts that are referred to as the argumentation components, each component.Claim is a claim that is publicly presented for general acceptance (Toulmin, Rieke and Janik 1984, p. 29) or the conclusion that we are trying to establish through our arguments (Freeley and Steinberg 2008, p. 153). Data (reason) It is the evidence to establish the basis of the claim (Schiappa and Nordin 2013) or, as simply put by Toulmin: \"the data represent what we have to do."}, {"heading": "3. Related work in computational linguistics", "text": "We divide this work into three sub-categories, namely reasoning mining, position recognition, persuasion work and online dialogues, as these are the areas closest to the focus of this article. An up-to-date overview of general discourse analysis can be found in Webber, Egg and Kordoni 2012. Furthermore, research on computer-aided reasoning has also been very active; see e.g. (Scheuer et al. 2010) for an overview of different models and argumentation formalisms from an educational perspective or (Schneider, Groza and Passant 2013), which examines reasoning on the Semantic Web."}, {"heading": "3.1 Argumentation Mining", "text": "The reasoning that has developed in the field of scientific publications has developed very quickly in recent years, leading to several workshops held in conjunction with the major NLP conferences. We present first coherent work with a focus on annotations and then reviews of experiments with classifying argumentation components, schemes or relations. One of the first publications to deal with commentating argumentative discourses is the reasoning of argumentation and argumentation arguments for scientific publications (Teufel, Carletta and Moens 1999). Later, Teufel, Siddharthan, and Batchelor (2009) expanded the original 7 categories to 15 and annotated 39 articles from two domains, in which each sentence is assigned to a category. Fleiss's reasoning received was 0.71 and 0.65. In their approach, they deliberately ignored domain knowledge and relied only on general, rhetorical and logical aspects of the annotated texts."}, {"heading": "3.2 Stance detection", "text": "In this case, the entire document (discussion post, article) is considered to represent the author's point of view on the topic under discussion. As the topic is formulated as a controversial question, the author is either for or against. Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) have developed a computational model for recognizing attitudes in two-topic debates on named entities in the domain of electronic products by combining preferences learned from PDTB web data and discourse markers (Prasad et al. 2008). Hasan and Ng (2013) have determined the stance in online debates on four topics using data from createdebate.com, using higher-level machine learning and features ranging from N grammars to semantic frames."}, {"heading": "3.3 Online persuasion", "text": "Another strand of research was devoted to persuasion in the online media, which we consider to be a more general research topic than argumentation.Schlosser (2011) examined the persuasive power of online reviews and concluded that the presentation of two pages is not always more helpful and may even be less convincing than the presentation of one page. Mohammadi et al. (2013) examined the persuasive power of speakers in YouTube videos and concluded that people are perceived more convincingly in videos than in audio and text. Miceli, de Rosis and Poggi (2006) proposed a computational model that integrates emotional and non-emotional persuasive work. In the Murphy study (2001), the persuasive power was attributed to 21 articles (out of 100 manually selected) and four of them are analyzed in detail to compare the perception of persuasive work between experts and students."}, {"heading": "4. Annotation studies and corpus creation", "text": "This section describes the process of data selection, annotation, curation and evaluation with the aim of creating a new corpus suitable for research into argumentation mining in the field of computational linguistics. Since argumentation mining is an evolving discipline without established and widely accepted annotation programs, procedures and evaluation, we would like to keep this overview in detail to ensure the full reproducibility of our approach. Given the wide range of perspectives on argumentation mining itself (van Eemeren et al. 2014), the diversity of argumentation models (Bentahar, Moulin and B\u00e9langer 2010), and the high cost of discourse or pragmatic annotations (Prasad et al. 2008), the creation of a new, reliable corpus for argumentation mining represents a considerable expenditure. A motivation for creating a new corpus stems from the various applications discussed in the introduction, as well as some research gaps, e.g. those discussed in section 3.1 or missing in the survey)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Topics and registers", "text": "We believe that this diversity leads to linguistic variability in educational topics and thus poses a challenge to the NLP. In collaboration with researchers from the German Institute for International Education Research9, we have identified the following current controversial topics in the field of education in English-speaking countries: (1) homeschooling, (2) public versus private schools, (3) redshirting - deliberately delaying the entry of an age-appropriate child into kindergarten to give their child more time to emotionally and physically mature (Huang and Invernizzi 2013), (4) prayer in schools - whether prayer should be allowed in schools and taken as part of education or banned outright, (5) single sex education - inserted classes (males and females are separated from each other.) sex classes against mixed classes (this prayer should be allowed in schools and considered part of education), (3) blogs as discussion categories in which articles about news wire are written (we will be co-authored with readers), (6) we will be included in a special discussion (6)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Raw corpus statistics", "text": "In light of the six controversial topics and four different registers, we have compiled a collection of plain text documents, which we call the raw body. It contains 694,110 characters in 5,444 documents. As a coarse analysis of the data, we have examined the length and number of paragraphs (see Figure 5). Comments and forum posts follow a similar distribution and are on average shorter than 300 characters, while articles and blogs are longer than 400 characters and have an average of 9.2 paragraphs. The process of compiling the raw body and its further statistics is described in detail in Annex 6."}, {"heading": "4.3 Annotation study 1: Identifying persuasive documents in forums and comments", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before an agreement is reached."}, {"heading": "4.4 Annotation study 2: Annotating micro-structure of arguments", "text": "The aim of this study was to comment on documents at a detailed level in relation to an argumentation model (Artsistein and Poesio 2008). Firstly, we will present the annotation scheme. Secondly, we will describe the annotation process. Finally, we will evaluate the agreement and draw some conclusions. Secondly, there should be empirical evidence that such a model was briefly introduced in Section 2, we will motivate our choice of the argumentation model by the following requirements. Firstly, it is likely that the scope of this work covers argumentation within a single document and thus focuses on micro-level models. Secondly, there should be empirical evidence that such a model has been used to analyze the reasoning in previous work, making it suitable for our argumentative discourse analysis in user-generated content. Concerning the first requirement, two typical examinations 13 According to the terminology proposed by Landis and Koch (1977, p. 165), although they claim that the subdivisions are clearly arbitrary."}, {"heading": "4.4.8 Causes of disagreement \u2013 qualitative analysis and problematic phenomena.", "text": "We analyzed the notes and found the following phenomena, which usually cause discrepancies between annotators.Granularity of the argumentation components. Each component of the argumentation (e.g. premise or support) should express consistent and coherent information, for example a single reason in the case of the premise (see Section 4.4.5). However, the decision whether a longer text should be divided as a single argumentation component or into several components is subjective and highly text-specific. 21Rhetorical questions have been extensively researched in linguistics (Schmidt-Radefeldt 1977; Han 2002; Lee-Goldman 2006), their role in the argumentation represents a substantial research question (Roberts and Kreuz 1994; Ottati, Rhoads and Graesser 1999; Petty, Cacioppo, Heesacker 1981; Frank 1990; Ilie 1999) provokes a brief history of rhetorical questions to the reader."}, {"heading": "4.5 Summary of annotation studies", "text": "In Section 4.3, we advocated a distinction of persuasive power at the document level. We commented on 990 comments and forum contributions and achieved moderate agreement among the commentators (Fleiss' \u03c0 0.59). Section 4.4 motivated the selection of a model for micro-level argumentation comments, proposed its expansion on the basis of observations from the preliminary study and outlined the annotation structure. This annotation study resulted in 340 documents commented on using the modified Toulmin model and achieved moderate agreement among the commentators in the logos dimension (Krippendorff's \u03b1U 0.48). These results make the commented company suitable for training and evaluation components, and each of these two annotation studies will have their experimental counterparts in the following section."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "In this section, we will present experiments carried out with the commented corpora introduced in Section 4. We will focus on the identification of argument elements in the discourse. In order to match the terminology of machine learning, we will use the term domain as the equivalent of a topic in this section (remember that our dataset includes six different topics; see Section 4.1). We will evaluate three different scenarios: First, we will report a tenfold cross-validation of a random arrangement of the entire dataset; second, we will deal with a tenfold cross-validation within a domain for each of the six domains; third, we will train the system on five domains and test the remaining for all six domains (which we report as cross-domain validation) to evaluate the portability of our approach."}, {"heading": "5.1 Identification of argument components", "text": "This year, it has reached the stage where it will be able to take the lead."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "Firstly, as we have shown in Section 4.4.2, existing argumentation theories offer models for capturing argumentation in user-generated content on the Web. We build on the Toulmin model and propose some extensions. Secondly, compared to the negative experience of capturing arguments using Walton's schemes (see Sections 4.4.1 and 3.1), our modified Toulmin model offers a trade-off between its expressiveness and annotation reliability. However, we found that the model's ability to capture argumentation depends on the register and subject, the length of the document, and by nature on the literary devices and structures used to express argumentation, as these properties influenced agreement among annotators. Thirdly, there are aspects of online reasoning that lack their established theoretical counterparts, such as rhetorical questions, narratives, and fallacies in general. We have tried to model some of them in the pathos (Section 4.10) of the Arguments."}, {"heading": "Appendix A: Raw corpus compilation", "text": "Given the six controversial topics and four different tabs introduced in Section 4.1, we have put together the body semi-automatically. Websites with relevant comments on articles and discussion forums were manually identified (Google search engine) to maximize their relationship to the search topic. We did not prefer a specific platform or data source. We automatically extracted the texts, but used minimal pre-selection and purification of data. If article comments formed a tree structure, we only retained the master comments, as we observed they were most likely comments on the topic of the article. In discussion forums, we automatically removed all quotations (users usually cite the previous post to which they respond). Articles and blogs were also selected manually; we quickly sketched the texts to check if they were discussing the given topic in an argumentative manner. As we wanted to ensure the reliability of the extracted texts in terms of proper paragraph formatting and manually removing the text we extracted the boiler content."}, {"heading": "Appendix B: Examples of annotated documents from the second annotation study", "text": "An example of reasoning: Note with a reworded claim and both dimensions (logos, pathos:).
