At the meeting points of these intervals intervals - the curves are limited to have smooth transitions, and beyond the observed values, the independent observation variables (in this case) are assumed to be linear in relation to the dependent variables (in this case, chatspeak probabilities)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "This year, it has come to the point that it has never come as far as it has this year."}], "references": [{"title": "Exploring language variation on the Internet: Regional speech in a chat community", "author": ["J.
