Prior to the commercial deployment of a speech solution, it is imperative to have a quantitative measurement of the performance of the speech solution, which is based primarily on the speech recognition of the machine used. Generally, the recognition performance of a language-based solution is quantitatively evaluated by being actually used by the people who are the intended users and then analyzes the logs to identify successful and unsuccessful transactions. This assessment is then used to determine further enhancing the overall speech recognition solution to improve the transaction rate."}, {"heading": "2 Evaluation without Testing", "text": "In fact, most of them are not a \"normal\" person, but a person who is able to identify himself, and who is able to identify himself.

Similarly, when the language system was actually tested by submitting speech samples, 17 out of 20 instances of / pnr / were detected as fare and vice versa. Similarly, 19 out of 20 instances / pnr / were incorrectly detected as prsthan and vice versa This confusion is expected, as can be seen from the processing distance analysis of the active words in Table 2. This modified active word list (removal of fare and pnr) increased the recognition accuracy at the service node (Fig. 3) by up to 90%. A similar analysis was performed at other recognition nodes and the active word list was appropriately modified to avoid possible confusion between active word pairs. This analysis and modification of the list of active words on one node resulted in a significant improvement in transaction completion rate."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we proposed a method for identifying words that could lead to confusion on any node of a speech recognition system. We used 8 Edit Distance as a measurement to identify the possible confusion between the active words. We demonstrated that this measurement can be used effectively to improve the performance of a speech solution without actually testing it. There is a significant saving in terms of the ability to detect bottlenecks in a human-based speech solution through this analysis, as there is no need for actual testing of the system by people. This method has been used to restructure the number of active words on each node for better speech recognition in an actual human-based speech recognition system that is mass oriented."}], "references": [{"title": "Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences: Computer Science and Computational Biology", "author": ["D.
