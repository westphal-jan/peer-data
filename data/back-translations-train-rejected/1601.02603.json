It seeks to minimize J by iterating an assignment phase and a centrifugal update phase until the partition does not change between two iterations. The outline of the algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. Random function randomly selects an observation phase for each centrifugal phase (xti, x d i). In the assignment phase, for each observation phase xi, the best cluster function selects a cluster Cj so that the temporal dissimilarity from the size of the cluster is added to the centrifugal proportions."}, {"heading": "3.4.

Experiments", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "4.1. Dataset", "text": "Experiments with time-based K averages are conducted on the basis of a data set drawn from the political sciences: Comparative Political Data Set I 1. It is a collection of political and institutional data consisting of annual data for 23 democratic countries for the period 1960-2009. The data set contains 207 political, demographic, social and economic variables, the data set has been cleaned up by removing redundant variables (e.g. country ID and zip code), and the corpus has been pre-processed by removing entity distortions from the data. Thus, for example, it is difficult to use the raw data to compare population development between populous countries and those with fewer inhabitants, as any development in the 50-year time span of the data set becomes meaningless due to the initial difference. Inspired by panel data econometry 8, we remove the entity-specific, time-invariant effects, as we assume they are determined over time."}, {"heading": "4.2. Qualitative evaluation", "text": "If one examines the development of countries over the years, it becomes quite obvious to the human reader why the developments of Eastern European countries are similar for most of the second half of the twentieth century. The reader would form a group called \"Communism,\" which would extend from immediately after the Second World War until about 1990, to define the typical development of communist countries. It would be expected that the algorithms, based on a political dataset, would successfully identify such typical developments and segment the time series of each of these countries accordingly. Figure 6 shows the typical development patterns constructed by TDCK measures (with \u03b2 = 0.003 and \u03b4 = 3, as in Section 4.5), when asked for 8 clusters. Distribution of observations over time in each cluster is given in Figure 6a. All constructed clusters are relatively compact in time and exhibit limited temporal extensions, and can be divided into two time groups."}, {"heading": "5 entities | score 0.22", "text": "Similar conclusions can be drawn from the constructed graph structure shown in Figure 7. Each temporal cluster is represented as a node and the values shown on each edge are represented as shown in Equation 14. The graph containing all transitions is shown in Figure 7a (no filtering, \u03b3 = 0). We obtain a graph showing more general developments by filtering with the threshold \u03b3 = 0.2. Some \"rare\" phases disappear completely (i.e. the phases \u00b52 and \u00b53) along with some of the arcs. In the resulting graph, shown in Figure 7b, we see some of the previously identified developments. Evolution \u00b54 \u2212 \u2192 \u00b55 \u2212 \u2192 \u00b56 corresponds to the \"Swedish Social and Economic Model,\" while evolution \u00b55 \u2212 > \u00b56 \u2212 \u2192 \u00b58 identifies the fragile European economies of the economic crises of 2008. From the filtered evolution graph, a more typical development emerges as those of the US and Germany."}, {"heading": "4.3. Evaluation measures", "text": "It is desirable that observations with similar multidimensional descriptions be divided among the same cluster. Similarity in the description space is measured by the multidimensional component of the time-conscious measure of dissimilarity. This goal is pursued by all classic cluster algorithms (such as K-Means) and every traditional cluster evaluation is used to evaluate it. We select the mean cluster variance, which is traditionally used to quantify the dispersion of observations in clusters."}, {"heading": "4.4. Quantitative evaluation", "text": "We vary m, the number of clusters, from 2 to 36. The performances of five algorithms are compared from a quantitative point of view: \u2022 Simple K-Means - clusters the observations based exclusively on their similarity in demultidimensional space; \u2022 Temporal-driven K-Means - optimizes only the temporal and multidimensional components, without any limitations on contiguity; combines K-Means with the temporal dissimilarity defined in Section 3.1. Parameters: \u03b1 = 0 (\u03b1 defined in Equation 4) and \u03b2 = 0 (\u03b2 defined in Equation 4); Restricted K-Means - uses only multidimensional space (and not the temporal component) along with the punitive component, as proposed in Section 3.2."}, {"heading": "4.5. Impact of parameters \u03b2 and \u03b4", "text": "The \u03b2 parameters control the effects of the contiguity constraints in Equation (4). If set to zero, no constraints are imposed, and the algorithm behaves like the simple K-Means. The higher the values of \u03b2, the higher the penalty that will be imposed if a constraint is broken. If this happens, the penalty factor may take precedence over the number of clusters rather than the number of units. To evaluate the influence of the parameters \u03b2, we are assigned to the same cluster, regardless of their similarity in the description space. If this happens, the algorithm cannot create partitions with a higher number of clusters than the number of units."}, {"heading": "4.6. The tuning parameter \u03b1", "text": "The parameter \u03b1, proposed in section 3.4, allows fine-tuning the ratio between the multidimensional component and the temporal component in the temporal \u03b2-conscious dissimilarity measurement. If \u03b1 is close to -1, the temporal component prevails. Conversely, if \u03b1 is close to 1, the multidimensional component takes precedence. The two components have the same weights when \u03b1 = 0. To evaluate the influence of the parameters \u03b1, we perform temporal K-Means with a deviation of -1 with a step of 0.1. In order not to distort the results and to evaluate only the effects of the tuning parameter, we remove the related constraints from the objective function J by setting \u03b2 = 0. We executed the ForS haPeach value of the component 10 times and present the averages. Figure 11a shows the evolution of the measurement variables MDvar and Tvar with their effects."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion and future work", "text": "In this paper, we have examined the recognition of typical evolutions from a collection of observations. We have proposed a novel method to introduce temporal information directly into the dissimilarity measurement, with the Euclidean component in the description space weighted by the temporal component. We have proposed TDCK means, an extension of K means that use time-conscious dissimilarity measurement and a new objective function that takes into account the temporal dimension. We have used a streamlining factor to ensure that the observation series, which relates to an entity, is segmented into continuous chunks. We conclude from a new centrifugal actualization formula in which time-distant elements contribute less to centridynamics than near-time. We have an intersection similarity measurement between two temporal clusters and a method for calculating a posterior adjacency matrix. We use this adjacency matrix to structure the detected evolutionary phases as graphs."}], "references": [{"title": "Comparative political data set 1960-2009", "author": ["Klaus Armingeon", "David Weisstanner", "Sarah Engler", "Panajotis Potolidis", "Marl\u00e8ne Gerber", "Philipp Leimgruber"], "venue": "Institute of Political Science, University of Berne.,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Semi-supervised clustering by seeding", "author": ["Sugato Basu", "Arindam Banerjee", "Raymond J.
