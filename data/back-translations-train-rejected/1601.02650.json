INTRODUCTIONResource Description Framework (RDF) is a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information implemented in web resources. RDF schema (RDFS) expands RDF to include classes that provide basic elements for describing vocabulary. OWL adds more vocabulary to describe properties and classes, i.e. relationships between classes, cardinality, and richer typing of properties. Unfortunately, OWL has a high worst-case complexity for key-conclusion problems. To solve this problem, we propose a lightweight OWL profile called the OWL-P.A rule, which is perhaps one of the most comprehensible concepts in computer science. It consists of the condition and the conclusion. If a condition that is verifiable in some data sets is processed, then the conclusion."}, {"heading": "II. PRELIMINARIES", "text": "The RDF data model is based on the concept of creating web resource statements in the form of subject-predicate-object expressions, referred to in IRDF terminology as triples (or statements).An RDF triangle comprises a subject, predicate, and object.

[28] Following are definitions of RDF triples.

We check which terms are most frequently used, and propose a new version of OWL 2 called OWL-P. We also have the time complexity to recognize a required rule application and commonly used vocabulary terms in our corpus.The snapshot (Table III) is created by [13] and uses seeds from [24].
