INTRODUCTION", "text": "However, the availability of log data from virtual learning environments (VLEs) such as Moodle is a way to improve learning outcomes and tackle challenges such as high levels of dropouts [1, 9, 13]. Research has shown that certain activity patterns indicate that students perform well. At the most basic level, it is typically the case that a higher level of activity is correlated with good grades [8]. Digging deeper shows that papers submitted just before the deadline are less likely to be rated well [3] and that dropout activity is a better predictor of good performance than day-to-day activity [8]. The most important contribution of this work is to analyze a large amount of Moodle activity data to determine whether they can provide early indicators of students \"good or bad performance. We are using the data to test three basic hypotheses suggested in a number of recent studies: 1. Submitting a task before the deadline is predictable [3]."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "In fact, the fact is that most of them will be able to demonstrate that they are able, that they are able to achieve their goals, and that they are able to achieve their goals."}, {"heading": "3. EVALUATION", "text": "Our main task was to test the three hypotheses outlined in the introduction to our Moodle data. We note that the hypotheses are largely supported by the data, except that there are some scenarios where the effort is negatively correlated with the grade."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data", "text": "UCD Moodle data included 360 courses, 2,194 papers and 71,077 paper submissions. Student records were anonymized before an analysis was conducted, and we only took into account data relating to grades, deadlines, submission times and general paper records. For our experiments, we focused on a subset of 60 papers from courses conducted during the first semester of the 2014 / 2015 academic year for which full paper submission information was available."}, {"heading": "3.2 Hypothesis 1", "text": "The expectation is that submissions at the last minute would not have performed well, so the remaining time between submission and submission should correlate with the grade. We excluded all submissions after the deadline, so late submissions would not distort the results. We calculated the correlation between grades and the time remaining until submission of the 60 tasks. These correlations are sorted and plotted in Figure 1. Most submissions (42 out of 60) show a positive correlation, but there are some anomalies. Some of the reasons for these anomalies are: vague deadlines, time extensions, artifacts in the assessment plans (see Figure 2), many submissions after the deadline and no penalties for late submissions. The first figure in Figure 2 shows that most submissions were very close to the deadline and early submissions with a very low grade distorts the correlation. The second figure shows that the number of places is one in a row with a few submissions at the top of 80."}, {"heading": "3.3 Hypothesis 2", "text": "The second hypothesis suggests that a high level of Moodle activity correlates with a high grade. Overall, activity charts confirm the results reported in [8] about periods in which students are more active on Moodle. We found that the first part of the week (Mon-Wed) and noon are the busiest. We can conclude from the results that high activity is caused by lectures and practical sessions. There are also peaks in activity in the evenings, when students submit their tasks and their work from home. The largest activity peaks occur during the exams. The main analysis performed for Hypothesis 2 is similar to that for the first hypothesis. Due to the fact that each course contains a number of tasks and each might have a different structure, time for submission, other factors that affect the submissions, we opted to do a correlation analysis at a correlation level and not at a course level Moodle analysis, and that many events are not expected to be recorded for this and there are some."}, {"heading": "3.4 Hypothesis 3", "text": "In order to determine appropriate time intervals, we examined the total number of activities per hour in all courses. The most significant increase in daily activity occurred between 8am and 6pm, while evening activity increased between 6pm and midnight. Our analysis showed that evening activity actually had a higher correlation (Table 1), i.e. the correlation between evening activity and the degree of daily activity is stronger, which shows that the timing of activities is important in addition to the number of activities. This motivated the time series analysis we report on in the next section."}, {"heading": "4. CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK", "text": "We used a large set of Moodle log data from computer science courses to investigate the extent to which these hypotheses were supported. Although incomplete and loud log data may have led to correlations in our experiments that were not particularly strong, these correlations were largely positive, suggesting that the factors we chose influence grades in the way we expect them to be. Observations from our experiments continue to support the idea that students who work more actively on Moodle and submit tasks earlier will achieve better results. In the next step, we plan to further investigate the validity of the clusters that divide students into \"good\" and \"bad\" students at the task and course level. While we observed outliers in our correlation analysis, the associated courses should be considered on the basis of a separate analysis of whether external factors play a role (e.g. continuous assessment rather than discreet assignments, lack of material for Moodle courses that are helpful for certain reasons outside of course activity)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This publication is the result of research funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under grant number SFI / 12 / RC / 2289."}, {"heading": "5.
