Introduction", "text": "In our modern society, the composite problems of daily life require a higher order of thought for their solution, which can be conceived as a complex way of thinking that often produces multiple solutions. Such a way of thinking, usually referred to as critical thinking (CT), involves synthesis and analysis, abstraction, uncertainty, application of multiple criteria, reflection, decision-making, conclusions and generalizations, self-regulation, etc. It also facilitates the transfer of knowledge, i.e. the use and transformation of existing knowledge to create new knowledge. The complexity of CT is evident from the fact that there is no definition that is universally accepted. Some of the most characteristic definitions of the CT existing in literature are the following: \"disciplined thinking that is clear, rational, open-minded and informed by evidence\" [1]; the ability and tendency to deal with reflective scepticism in an activity. \""}, {"heading": "2. Summary of our previous researches", "text": "In fact, it is a way in which people are able to determine for themselves how they want to behave."}, {"heading": "3. The Generalized Rectangular Model (GRM).", "text": "However, the question is: is this why it is necessary to change the shape of the evaluation model (triangles or trapezoids instead of rectangles)? The effort to answer this question led to the development of the GRM [12]. The central idea of the GRM is the \"movement\" of the rectangles of the RM to the left, which makes the adjacent rectangles into common parts (Figure 2). The above treatment better reflects than RM the results of students who are on the boundaries between two consecutive evaluation degrees and therefore belong to the common parts of the adjacent rectangles. Indeed, it is assumed (unlike RM) that these values belong to both successive evaluation grades, we will consider twice the common parts of the rectangles for calculating the range that lies between the resulting diagram and the OX axis."}, {"heading": "4.

Discussion and conclusions", "text": "Methods for evaluating the performance of a group, which are normally applied in practice, are based on the principles of bivalent logic (yes-no). However, this approach is not the most appropriate when dealing with the ambiguous evaluation situations that often occur in practice. In such cases, FL, due to its way of incorporating multiple values, offers a wider and richer range of resources. This gave us the impetus to apply the GRM, a generalized form of RM (a modification of the COG decimation technique) that better reflects the ambiguous cases of student marks that are located on the boundary between two consecutive evaluation levels. The conclusions of our classroom application, linking students \"CT skills to their language skills, provided strong evidence that the results obtained by applying the GRM fit with the corresponding results of other evaluation methods (traditional and blurred) and developed / used in our research or older evaluation methods (GRM)."}], "references": [{"title": "Fuzzy Sets, Uncertainty and Information, Prentice-Hall, London", "author": ["G.J.
