These functions are defined by weights dynamically obtained from each input vector x [0, 1] n. We show, among other things, that OWA functions are instances of DY OWA, and therefore functions such as: arithmetic method, median, maximum, minimum, and cOWA are also examples of DY OWA. In the second part of this paper, we present a specific DY OWA, called H, and show that it is ideal, symmetrical, homogeneous, shift-invariant, and furthermore has no zero divisors and no neutral elements. Since aggregation functions that satisfy these characteristics are widely used in image processing, we have tested their usefulness: (1) reduce the size of the images and an image reduction (2), resulting in a reduction in noise while increasing."}], "references": [{"title": "R", "author": ["D.
