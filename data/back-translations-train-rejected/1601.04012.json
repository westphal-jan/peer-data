INTRODUCTION", "text": "Among the multiple senses that the Oxford English Dictionary1, the most venerable dictionary in the English language, provides for the word event are: 1a the (actual or contemplated) fact that something happens; the occurrence of. 2a everything that happens or is considered to happen; an incident, an occurrence. 2d (in modern use mainly limited to) events of some importance. Although an event may refer to anything, we are usually interested in events that are of some significance. We would like to extract such events from text documents. In order to extract important events or events of a certain kind, it is likely that we must identify all events in a document to begin with. Consider the first paragraphs of the article on the Battle of Fredericksburg in English Wikipedia, which will be accessed on May 5, 2012."}, {"heading": "2 \u00b7 ...", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have established in the past."}, {"heading": "2. EVENTS IN LINGUISTICS AND PHILOSOPHY", "text": "In this section, we will give an overview of how real events are represented in relation to language. In particular, we will discuss the classification of events and characteristics that are necessary for such a classification. Afterwards, we will present the preferred way in which philosophers present events in relation to logic. We will end this section by presenting some of the structures attributed to events by linguists or philosophers working on an abstract level. The reason for including this section in the essay is to set the context for the discussions in the following sections on the practical task of extracting events. Practical systems usually do not follow linguistic subtleties, although they are inspired by linguistics or philosophy."}, {"heading": "2.1 Classifying Events", "text": "The primary focus when linguists discuss events is on the verb present in a sentence. Nouns, adjectives and other elements present in a sentence provide arguments for the verb. Aristotle (as presented in [Barnes et al. 1984]) classified verbs that denote something into three classes: actuality, movement and action. An actuality represents the existence of a thing or thing; this is referred to by others as a state (e.g. [Rosen 1999]). An example of actuality can be seen in the sentence Jon: a movement is sick. A movement is an incomplete process or something that takes time but has no inherent end. An example of movement is in the sentence Jon runs. An action is something that takes time and has an inherent end. An example of an action is present in the sentence Jon."}, {"heading": "4 \u00b7 ...", "text": "And Jon drives the car. - Achievements: Events that occur over a certain period of time and then end. Examples: Jon finished the finale in 45 minutes and the vase broke. - States: These are non-actions that apply over a certain period of time, but there is a lack of continuous times. Examples: Jon knows the answer and Jon likes Mary. [Smith 1997] adopts the same classification as Vendler and Dowty, but divides the achievements into two classes. The first is still called achievements, but the second is called achievements. In this new scheme, achievements are instantaneous (that is, the beginning of the event is the same as its end) and culminates the achievements into two classes. The first is still called achievements, but the second is achievements."}, {"heading": "2.2 Parameters of Event Classes", "text": "This year it has come to the point that it has never come as far as this year."}, {"heading": "2.3 Events in Logical Representation of Semantics", "text": "Mathematical logic is used to modify the semantics of language. In particular, we use logic to represent the meaning of individual sentences. Early work on events, e.g. Panini (as discussed by Parsons 1990) and [Hamilton et al. 1961], allows language to represent two types of information actions and non-actions; the verbs represent actions and nouns that represent non-actions or things. [Davidson 2001] suggests that events can be represented in such a way that they represent events in mathematical logic. This variable E is used to represent relationships represented by the verb and other constituents in the sentence. Davidson claims that events are logically spoken as things in which they can be variable and quantified. A question that arises is: how many arguments should dictate an event (in logic)?"}, {"heading": "8 \u00b7 ...", "text": "[Hobbs 1985] also proposes a logical form based on Davidson's approach, the main motivation behind Hobbs's approach being to be able to establish a satisfactory semantic representation when an event is expressed as a noun, or when we want to express the meaning of times, modalities, and adverbial modifiers. He also explains how so-called opaque adverbials, such as John being almost a man in the sentence, through which Davidson's approach can be represented, can be broadened by Hobbs. He also shows how the ambiguity between de re and de dicto meanings of sentences [Quine 1956] that discuss beliefs can be explained by his approach to the logical representation of sentences. Hobbs's representation is quite similar to other such representations based on Davidson, although there are some subtle differences that we are not discussing here. From a practical point of view, several research efforts in computational linguistics require Hobbs's logical form, and such a more recent approach is not possible [in the present time]."}, {"heading": "2.4 Event structure", "text": "In fact, it is such that most of them will be able to put themselves in a different world, in which they are able to move, in which they are able to move, in which they are able to move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they live, in which they are able to"}, {"heading": "10 \u00b7 ...", "text": "In fact, it is the case that one is able to live in a country where most people are able to unfold, and where most of them are able to unfold in order to unfold, and where they are able to unfold in order to unfold."}, {"heading": "2.5 Semantic Arguments and Syntactic Positions", "text": "Frequently, specific semantic arguments of a verb (also called thematic arguments) appear in characteristic syntactic positions, which has led to theories or suggestions regarding the association between the two. These theories state that specific semantic arguments belong in specific syntactic positions and that there is a 1-1 relationship between semantic argument and (initial2) syntactic position. These suggestions or theories include the Universal Alignment Hypothesis [Perlmutter 1978] and the uniformity of the Theta Assignment Hypothesis [Baker 1988], which are supposed to be universal because they are applied across languages and verbs. For example, agents appear across languages and verbs in subject positions. Thus, this mapping is universal. However, other assignments are not so universal. Thus, for example, the topic may occur in objects, subjects or indirect object positions, and the experiential researcher may indicate in subject or object positions that syntactical positions appear. A theory that can also explain the existence of a word-tactical position can appear in certain arguments."}, {"heading": "12 \u00b7 ...", "text": "(Verb: orth \"abandon\": subc ((np-pp: pval (\"to\")) (np)) (noun: eide \"abandon\": features ((countable: pval (\"with\"))) (Verb: orth \"abstinent\": subc (intrans) (pp: pval (\"from\")) (Verb: pval (\"for into from\")) (np-pp-pp: pval (for into from))) (possing) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np-as-np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np)) (np (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np (np) (np) (np) (np (np) (np) (np) (np) (np) (np (np) (np) (np) (np (np) (np) (np) (np) (np (np) (np) (np) (np (np) (np) (np (np) (np (np () (np) (np) (np (np) (np (np) (np () () (np) () () (np () (np (np (np"}, {"heading": "3. LEXICAL RESOURCES FOR ACTION OR EVENT REPRESENTATION", "text": "Discussions on the lexical representation of verbs have so far been based on efforts in which a small number of examples of linguists have been studied intensively before submitting the various proposals. From the 1980s, but even more so in the 1990s, when computer scientists began to focus more on the analysis of large corpora texts, it became apparent to some that the lexical analysis of pure linguists could be expanded by the knowledge gained from such corpora. This led to the development of the Comlex lexicon [Grishman et al. 1994], WordNet [Miller 1995; Fellbaum 2010], VerbNet [Schuler 2005], FrameNet [Fillmore and Baker 2001a; 2001b; Fillmore et al. 2003; Fillmore 2006] and other resources. Some of them may have begun without automatic analysis of corpora, but corpora was soon used to refine and improve the initial lexical resources. Comlex was a considerable resource, whose creators have devoted great efforts to enumination."}, {"heading": "3.1 Comlex and Nomlex Lexicons", "text": "Comlex was created at New York University as a computer dictionary providing detailed syntactical information on approximately 38,000 words [Grishman et al. 1994]. Of course, not all of these words were verbs or words describing actions. Comlex features offered were more detailed than commercially available dictionaries at the time such as the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (OALD) [Hornby 1980] and Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) [Pro 1981]. The original word list was derived from OALD. The dictionary used Lisp-like notation for dictionary entries. We see some sample entries for verbs in Comlex in Figure 1.ACM Transactions, Vol. N, January 2016. Comlex paid particular attention to providing detailed subcategories or complementary information for verbs."}, {"heading": "14 \u00b7 ...", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.2 Levin\u2019s Verb Classes", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to abide by the rules that they have applied in practice."}, {"heading": "3.3 WordNet", "text": "In fact, most of them are a pure conspiracy theory, which is indeed a conspiracy theory."}, {"heading": "16 \u00b7 ...", "text": "Although WordNet contains a sufficiently broad range of common words, it does not cover a specific domain vocabulary. It is general in nature and therefore difficult to use when specific vocabulary is required. Although WordNet is the most widely used online lexicon database in NLP applications, it is also limited in its range of verbs. English WordNet currently contains about 117,659 synsets, with each sunset corresponding to a sense of a word. It has 11,529 verbs belonging to 13,767 synsets. It also contains 117,798 nouns belonging to 82,115 synsets."}, {"heading": "3.4 FrameNet", "text": "FrameNet et al. 1998; Fillmore et al. 2003; Ruppenhofer et al. 2006] is another major publicly available lexical resource that has emerged independently of each other. It is based on the theory of frame semantics [Fillmore 1976; Petruck 1996; Fillmore and Baker 2001a; 2001b; Fillmore 2006], where a frame corresponds to a stereo-typical scenario with an interaction and participants in which the participants play some kind of role. The idea is that the meanings of most words are best understood in context. FrameNet proposes a small context called a semantic framework, a description of an event, relationship or entity and the participant in it. A frame has a name and this name is used to identify a semantic relationship that summarizes the semantic elements. Although frames largely correspond to verbs, there are frames that can be identified by nouns and adjectives."}, {"heading": "18 \u00b7 ...", "text": "FrameNet describes each frame element (or its representation, in fact) in at least three levels: a frame element name (e.g. Food), a grammatical function (e.g. Object), and a phrase type (e.g. NP). Only the frame elements are shown in the web-based user interface to reduce visual confusion, although all three are available in the XML downloads. FrameNet has defined more than 1,000 semantic frames. These frames are linked by frame relationships that relate more general frames to specific ones. This allows to be about events and intentional actions. As frames are semantic, they are often similar across languages. Thus, frames about buying and selling include frames that link buyers, sellers, goods, and money in each language. FrameNets were designed for languages such as Portuguese, German, Chinese, Swedish, and Japan.Van units are approximately 129.9 units on the net."}, {"heading": "3.5 PropBank", "text": "In fact, most of us are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves and are able to play by the rules that they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "20 \u00b7 ...", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "3.6 VerbNet", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before there is a result in which there is a result."}, {"heading": "3.7 Combining FrameNet, VerbNet and WordNet", "text": "[Shi and Mihalcea 2005] integrate FrameNet, VerbNet, and WordNet, previously discussed, into a single and richer resource with the goal of enabling robust semantic parsing. The reason for building connections between the three lexical resources is that similar syntactic patterns can often be realized in different semantic interpretations and similar meanings in many ways. The improved resource offers three improvements: (1) it expands the coverage of FrameNet, (2) it adds frame semantics to VerbNet's lexicon, and (3) it implements selective constraints using WordNet semantics classes. It uses knowledge of words and concepts from WordNet, information about different situations from FrameNet and verb lexicon with selective constraints from VerbNet. It extracts syntactical features and ACM actions, Vol. V, January 2016."}, {"heading": "22 \u00b7 ...", "text": "They identify the VerbNet verb class that corresponds to a FrameNet framework, and this allows them to analyze sentences that contain verbs that are not covered by FrameNet. They do this by exploiting a transitivity relationship via VerbNet classes: verbs that belong to the same Levin classes are likely to share the same FrameNet framework, and their FrameNet semantics can be analyzed, even if not explicitly defined in FrameNet. They use information from WordNet at multiple stages of the parsing process. VerbNet encoded argument constraints (e.g. + animate, + concrete) are mapped to WordNet semantic classes to provide selective constraints for better frame selection and role labeling in a semantic parser. In addition, mapping between WordNet verb entries and FrameNet hierarchical units allows them to expand the network authors to assign the network auxiliaries of the network 825% that are common."}, {"heading": "3.8 OntoNotes and Other Large-scale Annotated Corpora", "text": "In fact, it is as if most people who choose a different path have to choose other ways.

It is good to take notes here and there and place them in an event order or chronological order. Extracting an event-based structure of the medical record would help to better understand the medical record. Most systems process sentences in isolation, like most systems for event extraction at the present time. Therefore, events that exceed sentence boundaries cannot be detected."}, {"heading": "52 \u00b7 ...", "text": "A comparison between events and relations between individual countries, between individual countries, between individual countries, between individual countries, between individual countries and between individual countries, between individual countries, between individual countries and between individual countries, between individual countries and between individual countries, between individual countries and between individual countries, between individual countries and between individual countries, between individual countries and between individual countries, between individual countries and between individual countries, between individual countries and between individual countries, between individual countries and between individual countries, between individual countries and between individual countries, between individual countries and between individual countries, between individual countries and between individual countries."}, {"heading": "54 \u00b7 ...", "text": "In the Proceedings of the Cross-Framework and Cross-Domain Parser Evaluation.

The paper starts by giving an overview of how events are treated in linguistics and philosophy. We follow this discussion by surveying how events and associated information are handled in computationally. In particular, we look at how textual documents can be mined to extract events and ancillary information. These days, it is mostly through the application of various machine learning techniques. We also discuss applications of event detection and extraction systems, particularly in summarization, in the medical domain and in the context of Twitter posts.
