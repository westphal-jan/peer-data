Expert crowdsourcing involves macrotasks, like document writing, product design, or web development, which take more time than typical binary microtasks, require expert skills, assume varying degrees of knowledge over a topic, and require crowd workers to build on each other's contributions. Current works usually assume offline optimization models, which consider worker and task arrivals known and do not take into account the element of time. Realistically however, time is critical: tasks have deadlines, expert workers are available only at specific time slots, and worker/task arrivals are not known a-priori. Our work is the first to address the problem of optimal task sequencing for online, heterogeneous, time-constrained macrotasks. We propose tas-online, an online algorithm that aims to complete as many tasks as possible within budget, required quality and a given timeline, without future input information regarding job release dates or worker availabilities. Results, comparing tas-online to four typical benchmarks, show that it achieves more completed jobs, lower flow times and higher job quality. This work has practical implications for improving the Quality of Service of current crowdsourcing platforms, allowing them to offer cost, quality and time improvements for expert tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Jan 2016 19:26:04 GMT  (2309kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04038v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI", "authors": ["heinz schmitz", "ioanna lykourentzou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.04038"}, "pdf": {"name": "1601.04038.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "It\u2019s about time: Online Macrotask Sequencing in Expert Crowdsourcing", "authors": ["Heinz Schmitz", "Ioanna Lykourentzou"], "emails": ["h.schmitz@hochschule-trier.de", "ioanna.lykourentzou@list.lu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "We present the problem of Task Assignment and Sequencing (TAS), which adds a timeline perspective to expert optimization in crowdsourcing.

The family of optimization problems that our work falls into is assignment optimization, i.e. identifying which worker should work on which task and when to optimize one or more global performance indicators, which typically include cost, quality and number of acceptable tasks. This family of problems consists of two distinct optimization problems, task assignment and task sequence. Task assignment requires assignment of one or more work steps that require multiple selection."}, {"heading": "2.2 Optimizing Task Assignments", "text": "Regarding microtask assignment optimization, Karger et al. [23] work with homogeneous microtask tasks (all of which have the same difficulty level and do not differentiate between tasks \"topics\"), and propose a matching algorithm inspired by the standard belief-propagation algorithm to approximate maximum margins, which is optimal for regulatory purposes and minimizes costs. This study is one of the first to show that the problem of task matching in crowdsourcing can be transformed into a two-part graph design problem where workers are one part of the chart, tasks are the other, and the edges represent assignments of workers to tasks.

Heterogeneous rather than homogeneous tasks. We work with crowdsourcing tasks that require different skills and abilities from workers and that belong to multiple \"topics\" (rather than to a single one).Workers in this environment have a range of skills and are less interchangeable than crowdsourcing settings that take into account homogeneous tasks and skills (anyone can do any task).2. Macro rather than microtask tasks. While microtask masks accept binary or n-like (multiple-choice) labor inputs, their quality is defined by assigning multiple simultaneous workers to the task and then performing majority voting, macrotask functions and job entries (e.g. creating a product description)."}, {"heading": "3.2 The importance of the time element", "text": "Before we give the formal definition of the TAS optimization problem, let us illustrate with an example how important it is to add the perspective of time, and how this addition has a significant impact on performance in the field of expert crowdsourcing.

Since the availability of labor limits how often a single worker can be packed, we have a limited version of the multiple knapsack problem [25]. The difference from this classic problem is the optimization goal. While in TAS we want to maximize the number of jobs done in terms of their individual quality thresholds Qj, the goal in multiple knapsack is to maximize the sum of all the packed expertise, no matter how it is distributed among the different knapsack."}, {"heading": "3.4.2 Allocation of time slots: The Openshop perspective", "text": "On the other hand, we assume that a labor allocation is already set in such a way that all jobs reach their quality thresholds, and we must plan the selected workers along the time axis in terms of releases and availability of labor. Then, we can understand this partial problem as a problem of machine planning: Here, workers play the role of machines and jobs must be processed on these machines. Note that the order of processing in our model is irrelevant, that we demand sequence, and that the processing time of a job on a particular machine is either 0 or 1 per time span (depending on whether the worker in question is assigned to that job or not). Therefore, this aspect of the TAS is an unlimited-time problem with limited machine availability and release dates [27].

It follows that there is also no competitive online algorithm for TAS.

For these experiments, worker acceptance was modelled on the basis of a beta distribution with a mean of 0.5 and a variance of 0.15, so that most jobs require a quality of at least 0.6 of 1 and higher, requiring only a tail of jobs. The job cost threshold was then modelled as linear in terms of workplace quality. Workers and job arrivals were entered as Poisson processes with a total workload of 200 jobs per day or 20 workers per day, respectively, during which we were modelled on a system of 30 workers per \u00b5."}, {"heading": "30 10 1000 600", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 Upper bound calculation", "text": "First, using the optimal DPalgorithm for max knapsack, we calculate an upper limit on the number of tasks to be completed: Let's assume for each job that this is the first job for which we calculate a work order, i.e. all workers with at least one available time frame \u2265 rj are possible knapsacks independent of any other tasks. If the DP algorithm does not find any packaging within the budget and above the quality threshold, then this job cannot be done at all. In this case, it turns out that a maximum of 515 of the 600 tasks can be completed."}, {"heading": "5.2.3 Quality experiments", "text": "In terms of objective functionality, we note that tas-online not only reaches the number of completed jobs in our offline algorithm, but that it is much better than the other online algorithms (see Table 1). To get a more accurate picture, we want to compare these algorithms not only with this one measure, but also with other characteristics. Next, we ask how many workers are assigned to each job (not just the completed ones) and how long the flow times are, i.e., how many time intervals lie between the release date rj and the last employee assigned for j (see Table 2). In both cases, we take the averages of all jobs in the system (not just the completed ones). In cases where both values are equal, we have only compact jobs per job without any vacancies in between. While tas-online searches for these types of jobs, we find that tas-offline creates remarkable catch times, probably a price for jobs."}, {"heading": "5.3 Scalability experiments", "text": "Next, we conduct a series of scalability experiments to test the robustness of our proposed algorithm under different conditions of the simulated instance. Since worker volatility is the most uncontrollable factor in crowdsourcing, we vary two parameters: the expertise available and the number of workers available. Each parameter is modified independently, while all other parameters of the baseline instance depicted in Section 5.2 remain the same. The variables we measure are also the same as those measured for the baseline instance and include the objective function, as well as budget utilization, total flow time, the number of workers assigned per task, and the percentage of the average quality threshold reached. The experimental results of scalability are shown in Figures 3-5.

and Sequencing (TAS), which adds the timeline perspective to expert crowdsourcing optimization. Expert crowdsourcing involves macrotasks, like document writing, product design, or web development, which take more time than typical binary microtasks, require expert skills, assume varying degrees of knowledge over a topic, and require crowd workers to build on each other\u2019s contributions. Current works usually assume offline optimization models, which consider worker and task arrivals known and do not take into account the element of time. Realistically however, time is critical: tasks have deadlines, expert workers are available only at specific time slots, and worker/task arrivals are not known a-priori. Our work is the first to address the problem of optimal task sequencing for online, heterogeneous, time-constrained macrotasks. We propose tas-online, an online algorithm that aims to complete as many tasks as possible within budget, required quality and a given timeline, without future input information regarding job release dates or worker availabilities. Results, comparing tas-online to four typical benchmarks, show that it achieves more completed jobs, lower flow times and higher job quality. This work has practical implications for improving the Quality of Service of current crowdsourcing platforms, allowing them to offer cost, quality and time improvements for expert tasks.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
