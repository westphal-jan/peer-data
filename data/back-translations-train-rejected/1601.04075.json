Using 2015 data, we demonstrate that content popularity (or number of views per AnswerXchange question) can be predicted with reasonable accuracy based on attributes of the question alone. We also employ probabilistic topic analysis and uplift modeling to identify question features with the highest impact on popularity. We demonstrate that content popularity is driven by behavioral attributes of AnswerXchange users and depends on complex interactions between search ranking algorithms, psycholinguistic factors and question writing style. Our findings provide a rationale for employing popularity predictions to guide the users into formulating better questions and editing the existing ones. For example, starting question title with a question word or adding details to the question increase number of views per question. Similar approach can be applied to promoting AnswerXchange content indexed by Google to drive organic traffic to TurboTax.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Jan 2016 21:01:12 GMT  (669kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04075v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["igor a podgorny"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.04075"}, "pdf": {"name": "1601.04075.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Modification of Question Writing Style Influences Content Popularity in a Social Q&A System", "authors": ["Igor A.

Answer [1, 9, 13, 20] Quality and question usefulness in social Q & A systems have also been the focus of increasing attention. Research approaches included statistical analysis, natural language processing, expert evaluations of content quality, predictive modeling, and also automated classification of user votes. Good questions typically lead to a good answer, and at least one answer is typically required for the content of the search to be exposed to become popular. The likelihood of the question to be answered can also be predicted [4], based on the model showing similar attributes to the quality of the answer used for a variety of questions, such as the XA."}, {"heading": "DATA AND ANALYSIS Data Set and Seasonality Factors", "text": "Users have three options to view AnswerXchange content: Authenticated users typically consume content displayed on AnswerXchange's landing page (http: / / ttlc.intuit.com), and the remaining option is to view AnswerXchange content indexed by Google and other search engines.

If details are missing, the average length of the summary is 100 characters, but the length of the abstract goes back to 87 in the top 10% of the most popular questions. The next question to be asked is how abstract and details should be written to maximize the popularity of the question? This problem is further illustrated in Figure 5, where numbers of questions and views are plotted against the length of the question (the sum of question and question details length). There is a clearly defined local maximum number of questions around 170 characters (Figure 5A).

We start by dividing the model attributes (Table 1) into three groups. Group I includes the attributes responsible for the semantic meaning of the question, the time of the season, and the user type. By default, these attributes cannot be changed by the questioner. For example, it is unlikely that a user who asks a question about the tax deduction will change his topic from 10 to 18 (Figure 4), despite the fact that this change would increase the popularity of the question. Likewise, it is unlikely that the user who asks a question in April will wait until next year when the question is asked to lead to a more popular question."}, {"heading": "Predictive Model", "text": "In predicting the absolute number of views, it is helpful to move from the regression problem (i.e. predicting the number of views or ranking the question of popularity) to the classification problem (i.e. predicting whether the question belongs to the top 1%, 5% or 10% of the most popular questions). In the following, we switch to a categorical judgement based on a 10% cut-off value. Logistic regression is a form of regression in which the probability that an object belongs in one of two categories is predicted. Since the probabilities are always between 0 and 1, it can be threshold based on an empirically determined number of views to generate class predictions that follow a similar approach to that used in predicting Asker votes [15]. In this way, the logistic regression questions rank according to the expected number of views. The ranking can easily be recalibrated to the absolute number of views, so that the original AMS categorization results are insensitive to the final S."}, {"heading": "Model Performance", "text": "The range below the values of the curve (AUC) for the ROC curves shown in Figure 7 is 0.678 (group I), 0.759 (groups I-II), and 0.793 (groups IIII).

The most important attributes for the popularity model are the question details, and the first word of the summary and the length of the results summary. The model attributes that are important for predicting the votes of the questioners are usually irrelevant for predicting the popularity model and vice versa.

AnswerXchange is a social Q&A system supporting users working on federal and state tax returns. Using 2015 data, we demonstrate that content popularity (or number of views per AnswerXchange question) can be predicted with reasonable accuracy based on attributes of the question alone. We also employ probabilistic topic analysis and uplift modeling to identify question features with the highest impact on popularity. We demonstrate that content popularity is driven by behavioral attributes of AnswerXchange users and depends on complex interactions between search ranking algorithms, psycholinguistic factors and question writing style. Our findings provide a rationale for employing popularity predictions to guide the users into formulating better questions and editing the existing ones. For example, starting question title with a question word or adding details to the question increase number of views per question. Similar approach can be applied to promoting AnswerXchange content indexed by Google to drive organic traffic to TurboTax. Author", "creator": "Word"}}}
