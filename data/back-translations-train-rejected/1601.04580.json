This task takes on new significance in the age of social media, where citizen journalists can document events as they unfold (Lotan et al., 2011), but where repetition and unreliable information challenge the task of the reader in particular (Becker et al., 2011; Petrovic et al al al., 2010). A major technical challenge is to mix information from two heterogeneous data sources: textual content and time."}, {"heading": "2 Model", "text": "The basic task we are dealing with is to divide short text documents into an unknown number of storylines based on their textual content and their temporal signature. Textual content can be extremely sparse - the typical tweet is therefore in the order of ten words long - so the use of temporal information is crucial. In addition, the temporal signal is multi-scalable: in the 24-hour news cycle, some storylines will last less than an hour, while others, such as the disappearance of the Malaysian Airlines 370 plane in 2014, will continue for weeks or months. In some cases, the temporal distribution of references to a storyline will be unimmodal and well described by a parametric model (Marcus et al., 2011). In other cases, it may be irregular, with phases of activity followed by silence (He et al., 2007). Finally, it will be crucial to produce an implementation that has a scale to large companies."}, {"heading": "3 Inference", "text": "The key sampling equation for the dd-CRP is the lower probability, Pr (ci = j | c \u2212 i, w) \u0445 Pr (ci = j) P (w | c).The previous probability is defined in Equation 1. Let's show the probability under the partitioning that occurs when the linkage is intersected ci. Now, the probability concept has two cases: In the first case, j is already in the same interrelated component as i (even after cutting the linkage ci), so that no components are merged by setting ci = j. In this case, the probability P (w | ci = j) is exactly the same. In the second case, the setting ci = j causes two clusters to be merged. This results in the probabilities, P (w | ci = j, c c: c c: c c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c c: c: c c: c c: c: c: c c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c: c:"}, {"heading": "3.1 Online inference", "text": "While we strive to speed up the calculation of individual Gibbs samples, the complexity of the basic algorithm in the number of instances is superlinear, because for each sample, the probability of instance i joining any possible cluster must be calculated, while the number of clusters itself grows with the number of instances (this growth is logarithmic in the Chinese restaurant process).Scalability to the streaming setting therefore requires more aggressive optimizations. To return to linear time complexity, we use a fixed-delay method (Doucet et et et et al., 2000).Once we have instance i, we perform Gibbs samples only within the specified window [ti \u2212 GA, ti] with cj < ti \u2212 GA remaining fixed. This approximate sampling method implicitly alters the underlying model, because there is no way to link i with a later message to absolute Cluj samples, where we are only interested in determining Gibbs > the temperature."}, {"heading": "3.2 Hyperparameter estimation", "text": "The model has three parameters to estimate: \u2022 \u03b1, the concentration parameter of the dd-CRP \u2022 a, the offset of the distance function \u2022 \u03b7, the scale of the symmetrical dirichlet priority. In a procedure inspired by the Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (Wei and Tanner, 1990), we combine maximization-based updates of these parameters with samples. Specifically, we calculate gradients with respect to the probability P (c) with respect to \u03b1 and a, and perform gradient steps according to each specified number of samples. For the symmetrical dirichlet parameter \u03b7, we use the heuristics from Minka (2012) by setting the parameter to \u03b7 = (K \u2212 1) / 2 \u0445k log pk, where K is the number of words that occur exactly once, and pk the probability of selecting the kest word from the vocabulary under the universal distribution for the entire corpus."}, {"heading": "4 TREC Evaluation", "text": "To test the effectiveness of this approach, we evaluate on the Twitter Timeline Generation (TTG) task in the microblog track of TREC 2014.

We perform the task on 55 queries with different timestamps and compare our results with 13 groups representing 50 runs for this task in 2014.We consider the following systems: Baseline We replace the distance-dependent previous with a standard funnel before.

Recent non-Bayesian approaches focus on the overlap of strings (Suen et al., 2013), submodular optimization (Shahaf et al., 2012), and locality-sensitive hashing (Petrovic \u00e8 et al., 2010). In Bayesian storyline analysis, the basic models are Topics-OverTime (Wang and McCallum, 2006), which link parametric distribution over time to each topic (Ihler et al., 2006), and the dynamic Topic Model (Lead and Lafferty, 2006), which treats evolution as a linear dynamic system (Nallapati et al., 2007)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We present a simple non-parametric model for clustering short documents (such as tweets) into storylines that are conceptually coherent and time-focused.
