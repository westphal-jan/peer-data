Submissions: We construct a general theory of local descriptors for visual matching. Our theory is based on concepts for energy minimization and heat transfer.

Below, this is illustrated by a toy example. However, the example includes a univariate signal f (x), a pair of univariate templates p1 (x) and p2 (x), and a translation of the results so that f (x), f (x) can be expressed as a minimum after eliminating the equality of c2, c1 + c2 = 1, (c)."}, {"heading": "5 Deriving SIFT via the Diffusion Theory", "text": "This change leads to a limited robustness of the illumination changes [Dong and Soatto, 2015]. Nevertheless, the cost function remains convex and difficult to minimize. Such non-convex optimizations can be treated by diffusion and continuation by the theory of [Mobahi and Fisher III, 2015a]. We show that the SIFT descriptor turns out to be an approximation of this process if it is a similarity transformation, i.e., it is \u03c4 (x; \u03b8), esR\u03b1x + b, where \u03b8 (\u03b1, s, b). Approximation occurs from two sources. Firstly, the theory of [Mobahi and Fisher III, 2015a] proposes a continuation method by gradually decreasing the course of the minimizer while following the path. SIFT offers an approximation of this process by solving the optimization at only one value of Fisher, i.e. it ends after the first iteration of the algorithm function."}, {"heading": "5.1 Energy Function", "text": "Define the density of the gradient orientations of the image f as follows: h (\u03b2, x; f), X (f (x) \u2212 \u03b2) f (x), (14) where X denotes the Dirac ridge of the period 2\u03c0, i.e. X (x), \u2211 \u221e n = \u2212 \u221e \u03b4 (x + 2\u03c0n). The Dirac ridge takes into account the periodicity of the angle (gradient orientation). Leave the dissimilarity between a pair of densities over a region X as the negated point product d (f1, f2, X), \u2212 bay (\u03b2, x; f1) h (\u03b2, x; f2) d\u03b2.

Specifically, this descriptor can be derived by taking into account the diffusion of the transformation parameters (\u03b1, s, b). Note that these are more diffusion optimization variables than SIFT (which diffuses compared to SIFT (\u03b1, b))) and thus represent a better approximation to the theory of [Mobahi and Fisher III, 2015a], which suggests that diffusion must be applied to all optimization variables, i.e. to (c, \u03b8). This improvement in approximation fidelity could be an explanation for why DSP-SIFT works better in practice than SIFT.

However, we look at this identification using two lines. (Dong and Soatto, 2015) Our theory assumes that the scale pooling method should also be performed by Gaussian Convolution, i.e. (22). With this form, we represent a closed form of approximation, which consequently does not require a sample. Whether this approximation provides a satisfactory accuracy must be investigated by experiments. (Recall energy minimization of DSP-SIFT (22) has the following form, max. (\u03b1, s, b), max. (2).

We can extend the descriptor of how to handle similarity to affinized transformations. 2. Remember that the calculation of diffusion in SIFT and DSP-SIFT relies on some approximation. 2. Despite working with a larger transformation space, the new parameterization allows the derivation of exact and closed shape expressions for diffusion in all transformation parameters.
