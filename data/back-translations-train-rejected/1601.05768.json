SYNTAGMA's architecture", "text": "The second part of the book describes how the system works as a whole, and the last section shows how the system works selective parsing through an interaction between syntactic and semantic structures, allowing the correct interpretation of the input text. A scheme of the entire architecture is given in this context. SYNTAGMA is the result of research on parsing strategies initiated by the author. Development of the current architecture began in 2011 after some experiments in data processing, which led to the author developing radical new parsing mechanisms."}, {"heading": "2. Resources", "text": "The most important resources of the system are language-specific: the lexicon, the list of constituent patterns, the database of the argument structure and the semantic database. In the current version of SYNTAGMA, they are only available in Italian. However, other versions of the system aim to be multilingual. All data has been extracted from the same source dictionary, which ensures the internal coherence of the entire database and provides a strong correlation between the morphological, syntactic and semantic data of all lexical entries. In addition to the lexical database, there is a named entities database originating from DBpedia, which is primarily used by the PoS tagger. It contains semantic tags (such as Person, Place, Org) used by the filter module and the Ambiguity Solver to evaluate the semantic consistency (i.e. the internal congruence) of a given interpretation of the input string."}, {"heading": "2.1 Syntagma Lexical Database", "text": "The data that make up the Syntagma Lexical Database (SLD) has all been automatically extracted from the same source dictionary, originally in HTLM format4. The SLD contains a main table, Lemma (keyword), which lists the lexical entries with their grammatical characteristics. It also contains links to aliases or alternative forms. Word-specific constraints can be registered at this level. Each lexical entry is identified by a specific value in the LEX _ ID index field. The Forms table lists all inflexible forms and their morphological characteristics. Table forms are associated with the Lemma table through the LEX _ ID and Forms index fields. The PoS argument tagger is used to identify the words in the input string. Literature (i.e. their definition and semantic properties, links to their synonyms and forms) is collected in an argument called NLD."}, {"heading": "2.2 Constituent Patterns List", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 The structure of constituent patterns", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules that they have set themselves in order to play by the rules that they have played by."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Constraint expressions", "text": "The consequence is that most people who are able to move are able to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move, to move and to move."}, {"heading": "2.2.3 Pro, Traces and Gaps", "text": "In fact, it is an attempt to get a grip on the situation, both in the United States and in the United States.

They are arranged literally and associated with semantic information by the index MNG (Meaning). If a7 trace-antecedent governors must be assigned to the head of a subordinate constituent for intermediate and argumentation tracks, this rule is defined when the dependence of the pattern is set and obvious precursors such as relative, questioning and clicking pronouns as well as mediating tracks are influenced. It therefore guides the co-reference filter to search for the history of some tracks in the immediate superordinate syntactic context. Co-reference chains can therefore easily be unified in a process dealing with seemingly different types of phenomena. 8 examples of argument structures are given in the 3.word sense section, its members appear as records of this table."}, {"heading": "2.4 The Semantic Network", "text": "The fourth resource used by the parser is an automatically generated semantic network, based on the same source dictionary as the lexical database (SLD), which ensures the internal coherence of the resource database of the entire system, since all entries are indexed together. In order to create the semantic network, the dictionary glosses were first analyzed; then the output of the parsing process was transformed into semantic frames by a dedicated module. [9] In the semantic network, the semantic characteristics of the sense of words (identified by the MNG index) are formalized and reduced to \"primitive\" predicates such as perception, cognition, speech act, action, thing, person, animal, place, and sentences of hierarchically ordered \"primitive\" predicates, so that a verb such as \"progress\" is defined by the set: (action (change (place (forwarding))), resulting from the various forms expressed in the glossy."}, {"heading": "3.

Conclusions", "text": "This paper dealt with a currently fully functioning NLP system called SYNTAGMA, which includes a number of innovative solutions, including component generation and constraints management, as well as problems related to the reduction of syntactic ambiguities and the disambiguation of literal meaning. The description of the system's lexical, syntactic and semantic resources showed how they link up to form a coherent internal database within which all these different types of data relate to each other. Finally, it focused on how the parser works and how syntactic structures and sense-related features interact continuously, performing reciprocal selections at different levels, gradually leading to a coherent and accurate interpretation of the inputs."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "This paper discusses SYNTAGMA, a rule based NLP system addressing the tricky issues of syntactic ambiguity reduction and word sense disambiguation as well as providing innovative and original solutions for constituent generation and constraints management.
