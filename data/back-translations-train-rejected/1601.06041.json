It employs an online tracking module for detecting important changes in the evolving trajectory of each vessel across time, and thus can incrementally retain concise, yet reliable summaries of its recent movement. In addition, thanks to its complex event recognition module, this system can also offer instant notification to marine authorities regarding emergency situations, such as risk of collisions, suspicious moves in protected zones, or package picking at open sea. Not only did our extensive tests validate the performance, efficiency, and robustness of the system against scalable volumes of real-world and synthetically enlarged datasets, but its deployment against online feeds from vessels has also confirmed its capabilities for effective, real-time maritime surveillance.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 15:24:41 GMT  (3828kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06041v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["kostas patroumpas", "elias alevizos", "alexander artikis", "marios vodas", "nikos pelekis", "yannis theodoridis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.06041"}, "pdf": {"name": "1601.06041.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Online Event Recognition from Moving Vessel Trajectories", "authors": ["Kostas Patroumpas", "Marios Vodas", "Yannis Theodoridis"], "emails": ["kpatro@dblab.ece.ntua.gr", "alevizos.elias@iit.demokritos.gr", "a.artikis@unipi.gr", "mvodas@unipi.gr", "npelekis@unipi.gr", "ytheod@unipi.gr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keyword AIS \u00b7 Event Detection \u00b7 Geostreaming \u00b7 Moving Objects \u00b7 Trajectory K.

Figure 17 shows the results of the experiments under different window sizes and distributed configurations. First, we used a single processor to perform CE recognition for all 6,425 vessels, 3,966 ranges and 64 ports. Then, we employed several processors running RTEC in parallel by following a data partitioning scheme. We divided the network that traversed the monitoring area into several sub-grids (groups of adjacent cells) whose number of processors used in parallel was the same. Each processor was responsible for the areas and ports running in, and the vessels running through its assigned sub-grid. We used three distributed settings: performing CE detection on two, four and twelve processors. We made an attempt to evenly distribute the load of MEs among the different processors by exhaustively looking for the best configuration."}, {"heading": "5.2.3 Tolerance to irrelevant events", "text": "In the experiments presented so far, the input stream consisted of critical MEs, i.e. all events of the input stream were part of the CE pattern and thus activated the detection process. In several applications, however, the CE detection module has to deal with input streams, including several events that are irrelevant to the CE detection module. In order to test RTEC's tolerance to irrelevant input events, we have conducted experiments in which, in addition to critical MEs, we maintain a share of normal events, i.e. those that are not commented as critical by the trajectory detection module. In these experiments, RTEC has to skip the normal events to find the critical MEs that express the CE pattern. Figures 18 and 19 show the results from this group of Ex-periments; the percentage of normal events ranges from 0% (the input stream stream stream) to 100% (the input streams consists of critical MEs)."}, {"heading": "5.2.4 Artificially enlarged data streams", "text": "To further enhance the performance of RTEC, we created extended data streams by inserting additional critical MEs to the real datasets. There are no normal events added to these experiments. For each vessel, we extended its trajectories by a certain number of times (increase factor), but the replicated trajectories were assigned to new vessels that do not exist in the original datasets, opening more than half of the windows. An increase in factor X implies that we have exactly X times as many critical MEs and X times as many ships, compared to the original datasets of 16,000,000 CE terms that do not exist. We varied the increase factor of 20, producing datasets of 128,000 containers that create data of 1,280,000 MEs, data of 1,280,000 containers and 3,280,000 containers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive of CE maritime evaluation techniques."}, {"heading": "6 System Deployment", "text": "In order to verify its operational capabilities, we have set up our system to monitor the live AIS feeds of ships in the Aegean Sea. Fresh positions are periodically fetched from a database (managed by the University of the Aegean) that receives all the transmitted AIS messages. Each data set retrieved contains only ship identification, geographical position and a time stamp. Currently, fresh inputs are fetched every hour (the sliding step \u03b2 of the window used in this case), although a different time period can be chosen. Typically, we observed that up to 40,000 fresh data sets per hour can be retrieved, which represents a rather moderate amount of geostreaming data simulated in our empirical validation (see Section 5). As soon as each batch of fresh data arrives, it is consumed by the online mobility tracker to identify all critical points over the course of each ship. The resulting points with their notes are then stored in a QL, which is currently used to verify its operational capabilities."}, {"heading": "7 Summary & Future Work", "text": "This year we have it in our hands until we will be able to find a solution with which we will be able to find a solution to all the problems, \"he said."}], "references": [{"title": "Efficient pattern matching over event streams", "author": ["J.
