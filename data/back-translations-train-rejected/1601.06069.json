Overview", "text": "This year, it is only a matter of time before we reach an agreement."}, {"heading": "2. Challenges and Capabilities", "text": "A planning tool for coalition warfare must provide numerous capabilities to address a number of key challenges. Such capabilities fall into several broad categories: asset and task modeling Hostile environment Coordination of team efforts Autonomous ActionIn this section, we examine some examples of such capabilities and their possible relationships to coalition operations from a functional, domain-oriented perspective."}, {"heading": "Modeling of assets and tasks", "text": "As the modelling progressed, we captured the variations caused by a variety of different aspects of the employment cycle. For example, work with the Battle Command Battle Lab-Huachuca was able to perform a detailed breakdown of the sub-tasks involved in the restoration, take-off and positioning of a drone, and the possibility of simultaneous assignment was considered, with reconnaissance along the intrusion / exit route. The impact of UAV use on ground manoeuvres was greater than initially anticipated."}, {"heading": "Adversarial environment", "text": "Assumptions and expectations regarding the enemy are particularly challenging in a coalition where the doctrine of multi-nation staff officers can vary significantly and the political and strategic objectives of the participating nations can be at odds with each other (Riscassi 1993). Manual war games typically describe the enemy in a template, literally a standard tactical formation adapted to a specific terrain in a particular situation. Thus, the aim is to model the enemy over time and move it along the approach paths toward the friendly force. In practice, there are several aspects to considering how the enemy affects friendly actions. In particular, any action taken by one of the two combatants is likely to trigger an adversary's reaction and it may be possible to negate the response with the corresponding countermeasures. In addition, a fast, reliable conflict resolution model (CRM) is required to determine the impact of each deployment on the combatant."}, {"heading": "Action/reaction/counter-action", "text": "Any action that is possible by friendly or enemy units warrants consideration of potential responses. This is complemented by further analysis to determine whether there is a countermeasure that can be used to minimize the impact of the response or completely negate its impact.Figure 3 CADET estimates personnel and weapons systems that mimic the assessments carried out by Army experts. Figure 4 CADET modifies the start of the seize activity so that it occurs after all necessary derivative activities have been terminated in order to reduce harassing and criminal fires when there is a credible counter-battery threat. The potential countermeasure is that the launcher unit that fired first carries out its own counter-battery operations.In fact, U.S. forces have sometimes fired in the hope of dragging the enemy into counter-battery fire, with the express purpose of destroying enemy artillery by means of counter-battery fire.In a coalition environment, a variety of planning tools and models must easily reflect the expectations of the coalition members."}, {"heading": "Conflict Resolution Modeling (CRM)", "text": "Although the Dupuy (1990) approach offers many advantages for use in a system such as CADET, with the modest data requirements one of them, we found that it produced results that did not match users \"expectations. After consulting expert panels of military officers, both active duty and retired, we modified the equations and coefficients provided in Dupuy (1990) to match the expertise and experience of current practitioners (Kott, Ground and Langston, 1999). In a coalition planning process, it may be desirable to either select from a library of multiple models or rapidly modify an existing model to take into account the perspectives and experiences of coalition members (Elron et. al., 1999)."}, {"heading": "Coordinating team efforts", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Coordinating timing and movement", "text": "Coalition warfare exacerbates the need for careful, thoughtful coordination of the temporal and spatial aspects of all tasks within an operation. Field Manual 3-0, the US Army's key operational manual, states: \"Detailed war games, planning and rehearsals help us develop a common understanding of the deployment plan and control measures (Field Manual 3-0).\" CADET users can enter time relationships for high-level activities into a plan. Expert experts and user feedback provided us with important information on how a commander understands the temporal relationships between activities. For example, does an attack in an area begin when the unit begins to move into the designated area when the unit attacks the designated area, or when the unit enters the designated area? In CADET, this problem is solved by identifying what we call anchor points for each activity. If the user says that two specific activities should begin at the same time, he or she has a specific idea of which activities should begin at the same time."}, {"heading": "Coordinating supporting relationships", "text": "Common errors that occur in manual COA analysis include under-utilization of resources, the obligation of resources to provide support when resources are out of reach, and resource binding. Figure 5 CADET interactively works with the user to identify questionable activities, enabling the user to accept or correct resource binding when a more complete solution for verification and decision-making is available. CADET tracks the use of resources to allow users to know where resources are not being fully utilized, a capability that can be used to find places where resources could be deployed elsewhere. CADET considers the effective range of supporting resources, such as logistics facilities, to determine whether they are close enough to achieve the mission."}, {"heading": "Operating in three dimensions", "text": "In practice, human planners tend to focus exclusively on close combat, without taking due account of the full depth of the battlefield. Leaders lacking experience with U.S. Army attack helicopters, for example, tend to diminish or disregard their value. A deep attack usually leads to serious enemy attrition, but carries the risk of friendly losses. If Army attack helicopters are lost behind enemy lines, it requires a combat search and rescue (CSAR) mission. On the other hand, a deep attack could reduce the enemy's strength to the point where the enemy is forced to abandon the attack. Whenever assets are available, a deep attack should be considered. Coalition staff officers can use CADET's ability to analyze airstrikes to build air-weapon COAs, where air and ground resources can belong to different coalition members."}, {"heading": "Autonomous action", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to play by the rules they have imposed on themselves."}, {"heading": "3. Technical Approach", "text": "Let's briefly look at how CADET addresses some of the implicit technical challenges in the above-mentioned capabilities; integrating planning and planning is accomplished through an algorithm for tightly intertwined incremental planning and planning; the design step results in an incremental set of tasks by applying domain-specific \"expansion rules\" to these activities in the current state of the plan that require hierarchical decomposition; the design step results in a time restriction of deployment (both lateral and vertical within the hierarchy); and plans the newly added activities according to available resources and time periods (Kott, 1992; Sadeh, 1996; Kott, Ground Budd, 2002); and the networking mechanism is also used to integrate creative steps of routing, mapping, and consumption estimation."}, {"heading": "4. Experimental Comparisons \u2013 CADET vs. Manual Approaches", "text": "A recent experiment, one of several series (Rasch, Kott and Forbus, 2002; Kott, Ground and Budd, 2002), comprised five different scenarios and nine judges (active service members of the U.S. military, primarily Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel), the five scenarios were derived from several exercises conducted by the U.S. Army. The scenarios were all brigade-sized and offensive, but still differed in terrain, mixture of friendly forces, nature of opposing forces, and maneuvering system. For each scenario / COA, we were able to view the COA sketches assigned to each planning staff, and the synchronization matrices produced by each planning staff. Participants, experienced observers of many planning exercises, estimated that these are usually conducted by a team of 4-5 officers, over the period of 3-4 hours, amounting to about 16 person-hours per planning product."}, {"heading": "5.
