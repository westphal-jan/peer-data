For each combination of features, we conducted an experiment with a tenfold cross-validation on the dataset. We also standardized all characteristics by z-score. We randomly calculated all characteristics to balance the majority class, i.e. 50% of positive examples and 50% of negative examples; these accounts for a random baseline of 0.5. We also standardized all characteristics by z-score. The experiments were conducted using SVM (Vapnik, 1995), in particular libSVM (Chang & Lin, 2011) under its default settings. The results are reported in Table 6; all marginal tests are computed by z-score."}, {"heading": "7. Discussion", "text": "While UL and GN are distinguished by a skilful blend of all prototypical features combined, with none of the features showing clear superiority over the others, UL and FT readability (READ) and affect (AFF) play an important role. As the summary in Table 9 shows, ALL features together have the highest average value of F1, but READ is the most powerful subset of features in all experiments, followed by AFF, NER and TIMEX, which perform reasonably well. Generally, these experiments have demonstrated the quality of our features in distinguishing UL from FT and GN within a machine learning framework and confirm the results obtained from the part of the quantitative analysis. In particular, as expected, these features provided the best results in the GN-FT experiments, showing that these two genres represent the extremes of a continuum in which ULs are placed.Features F1\u00b5 XL F148 FALLE 8690.106 80.770 IME:"}, {"heading": "8.
