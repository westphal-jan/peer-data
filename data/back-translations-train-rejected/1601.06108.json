We describe integrated algorithms, and a tool capable of translating a high-level concept for a tactical military operation into a fully detailed, actionable plan, producing automatically (or with human guidance) plans with realistic degree of detail and of human-like quality. Tight interleaving of several algorithms -- planning, adversary estimates, scheduling, routing, attrition and consumption estimates -- comprise the computational approach of this tool. Although originally developed for Army large-unit operations, the technology is generic and also applies to a number of other domains, particularly in critical situations requiring detailed planning within a constrained period of time. In this paper, we focus particularly on the engineering tradeoffs in the design of the tool. In an experimental evaluation, reminiscent of the Turing test, the tool's performance compared favorably with human planners.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 19:13:06 GMT  (748kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06108v1", "A version of this paper appeared in the Applied Intelligence journal"]], "COMMENTS": "A version of this paper appeared in the Applied Intelligence journal", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alexander kott", "ray budd", "larry ground", "lakshmi rebbapragada", "john langston"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.06108"}, "pdf": {"name": "1601.06108.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Decision Aids for Adversarial Planning in Military Operations: Algorithms, Tools, and Turing-test-like Experimental Validation", "authors": ["Alexander Kott", "Ray Budd", "Larry Ground", "Lakshmi Rebbapragada", "John Langston"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "2The use of intelligent decision-making tools can help reduce the challenges of planning complex operations. We describe built-in algorithms and a tool capable of translating a high-level concept of a tactical military operation into a fully detailed, actionable plan and automatically (or under human guidance) creating plans with realistic levels of detail and human quality. Closely intertwined multiple algorithms - planning, enemy estimation, planning, route planning, wear and usage estimates - comprise the computational approach of this tool.

Other researchers (e.g. [8, 9, 10, 4]) deal with another (and previous) phase of the process, the very interesting and challenging problem of generating the high-level COA maneuver. By looking at the style of human interactions and decision-making tools, we emphasize the incremental style of the mixed initiative (even if CADET allows such a style) in favor of a rapid style of creating a complete plan from a high-level COA followed by manual modifications. Among the motivations is the desire to minimize the time-consuming aspects of a mixed initiative process; to avoid significant dependencies on the style of user interfaces; and to eliminate the additional complexity of the still inadequately understood problems of a mixed initiative in an already very complex problem."}, {"heading": "Integration of Multiple Problem Aspects", "text": "This year, it is as far as ever in the history of the city, where it is as far as never before in the history of the city."}, {"heading": "Planning Against a Dynamic Enemy", "text": "This year, the time has come for an agreement to be reached, and it will only take a few days."}, {"heading": "Knowledge Representation", "text": "In fact, most of them are able to survive themselves and survive, while others are able to survive themselves.

Will such tools encourage the over-fixation on analytical aspects of command, through the book and by numbers? Will they distract from intuitive, adaptable, art-like aspects of military command decision-making? Will they make plans and actions more predictable for the enemy?
