It is critical to understand the student's skills, i.e. how much he or she knows at the time he or she is teaching, in order to provide appropriate feedback. (2) Students are not fully involved in the TA's teaching. To take full advantage of learning-by-teaching, the student must actively participate in teaching. However, it is difficult to keep the student motivated all the time, especially if the TA is passive in interactions and unable to provide personalized answers. Therefore, it is important to monitor the student's motivation level and to have appropriate feedback for the student to have the TA's existing ability to generate the responses most of the problems."}, {"heading": "2.2 Persuasive Teachable Agents", "text": "This year it is more than ever before."}, {"heading": "2.3 Educational Games and Virtual Environments", "text": "As digital natives, most students today have played games, and some have even made the game an integral part of their lives.

The Goal-Net methodology was first proposed in 2005 by Dr. Shen [16] to model goal-oriented actors. In Goal Net, an actor pursues his goal by completing a sequence of sub-goals. A Goal-Net can be composed of four basic units: states, transitions, arcs, and diversions. States are used to represent the goals of an actor. A state can be atomic or composite. A composite state can be further broken down into several atomic states. These atomic states represent the sub-goals that need to be fulfilled in order to fulfill the goal designated by the composite state.

Elaboration in the ELM refers to the process in which the recipient of the persuasive message engages in cognitive thinking in connection with the persuasive topic.

The proposed system architecture (as shown in Figure 4.1) focuses on the design of the control structure of the agent. The system architecture retains a certain degree of abstraction and is reusable as: (1) It is independent of the learning topics, deployment environment and execution form of the PTA; (2) It guides, but does not restrict, the way of implementing a PTA.

The one that was addressed by most of the focus group participants is the lack of flexibility of the current PTA. The instance implemented in VS Saga is specific to topics in the scientific field. Greater flexibility needs to be included so that the PTA and the educational game can be adapted to different learning topics. To do this, there is a need to propose a convenient way to modify the agent's models and change the content of the knowledge base. One way to include this kind of flexibility is to design an authoring tool for the PTA so that the design and implementation process of the PTA can be linked more smoothly. This is an area that future research in the PTA can address.

By incorporating the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), the PTA is able to provide more up-to-date and personalized feedback based on the student's ability and motivation, which previous TAs were unable to do. However, the existing PTA model still has some limitations. Firstly, the existing agent model has only proposed positive feedback for Persuasion Reasoning, while there are no Goal Net models for Teachability Reasoning and Practicability Reasoning. Secondly, the FCM model for Persuasion Reasoning is difficult to reuse as it is highly context dependent. Thirdly, there is a gap between the theoretical models and the practical implementation of the PTA."}, {"heading": "7.2 Future Work", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "7.2.1 Quantitative Assessment of PTA", "text": "During the focus group study, no statistically significant analysis can be drawn from the results because the number of participants is too small.

Therefore, a quantitative evaluation of the PTA must be performed in order to statistically analyze the effectiveness of the PTA. VS Saga can be used for evaluation purposes on various platforms, such as desktops and tablets. Assessment can be performed with a pre-test, a post-test and a series of questionnaires. The pre-test and post-test can contain questions to assess the student's understanding of the content knowledge. By comparing the results of the two tests, the student's knowledge gain can be evaluated by teaching the PTA and his or her learning outcomes.

Therefore, before the PTA can be widely used, it must build up the flexibility to accommodate different learning topics. On different learning topics, the learning goal and related expertise would be different. Therefore, there is a need to suggest a convenient way to modify the agent's models and change the content of the knowledge base. [11] One way to integrate this kind of flexibility is to design an authoring tool for the PTA. Referring to the design of the authoring tool that Ailiya has proposed for the Affective Teachable Agent [11], a similar design for the author's tool for the PTA (Figure 7.1) can be proposed. A dedicated component for creating and editing learning goals, content knowledge, and game tasks can be created.

However, in VS Saga, the assessment of motivation and performance levels is largely based on immediate event data and only 3 of these 7 types of events are tracked. In future studies, efforts may be directed toward increasing the type of events. By analyzing other event sources, the PTA will be able to more accurately assess the student's motivation and performance level. In addition, future research could examine the use of educational data mining to analyze the relationship between different types of student behavioral data and the degree of motivation and ability."}, {"heading": "Paper Submitted", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "Title", "text": "Virtual world based on pedagogical data mining"}, {"heading": "Abstract", "text": "The virtual environment is not only an efficient and engaging learning tool, but also has the potential to be integrated with Educational Data Mining (EDM) to meet the emerging needs of educational evaluation.
