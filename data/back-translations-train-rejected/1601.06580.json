SWARM INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHMS WITH DEVELOPED PROCEDURES TO COMPOSE MAZES", "text": "Swarm intelligence is an algorithmic description of the coordinated movements that all swarm intelligences perform together, based on the communication between them when information about the environmental conditions is passed on to optimize the movement strategy. In this article, we will focus on two algorithms that simulate ant colonies and bee colonies. In nature, ants search for food sources. Information about their locations is left for other ants in special traces of pheromones. In this article, we will focus on two algorithms that simulate ant colonies and bee colonies. [28] It is also possible to model a colony of bees. Information about their locations is passed on to other ants in a kind of dance, which bees perform in the hive when a nectar source is found, for example, this algorithm can be applied to both D algorithms."}, {"heading": "A. Artificial Ant Colony Algorithm", "text": "The artificial Ant Colony Algorithm (AACA) was inspired by the life of ants and more specifically by the search for food. Ants are able to find a way back to the nest, mark it for other ants and also carry many times more weight of food home. This particular modeling of nature inspires people to optimize it, allowing them to return to the nest or reconstruct a path to food. In any case, it is about finding food and finding a food source on the way home. In AACA, the movement of ants is possible in both directions because they leave a trail of pheromones that allows them to return to the nest or reconstruct a path to food. Any ant that leaves the house can follow tracks of others if the number of ants is more than one way. This pheromonization is carried out by all ants in the home."}, {"heading": "B. Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm", "text": "When bees are on the lookout for nectar sources, they can inform each other about the quality of the hives found and communicate with other people by finding the place where the best nectar is to be found. In the algorithm, there are different types of bees based on their role in the hive; the first group are scouts who randomly look for food and communicate with others by dancing in the hive; the second group is a group of observers who select the best areas for exploration; the last are bees who look for the best quality in the designated areas; all of them communicate to pass on the information; and the model of this process is carried out in subsequent iterations."}, {"heading": "C. An Adaptation of AACA and ABCA to Create Mazes", "text": "Customizing the presented swarm intelligence algorithms to create labyrinths requires additional operations to get an image of the labyrinth. Each of the presented algorithms returns a set of values (ants an array of pheromones, bees the map of meadow) that represent the labyrinth, each of which is calculated by the following functions: (y) = (y) = (y) < (0) Space y (1 > walls, (11) for which it represents the limit for which it will create a wall from the labyrinth. Displayed AACA and ABCA algorithms are used Algorithm 3: The algorithm for swarm intelligence labyrinth design is 1: Start, 2: Algorithm 1 or Algorithm 2 to create a labyrinth, 3: Create a bitmap I, 4: for all values v in array 5: >, when array v is 0.5, then when array v: 7 is less than 0.5."}, {"heading": "D. Stop Condition", "text": "In order to adjust the AACA and ABCA algorithms described in subsections II-A and II-B, a special stop condition must be adjusted to create a road from the entrance to the exit of the labyrinth. To this end, the queen (a moving supervisor) is added to each of the algorithms. After each iteration, the queen is called to check if a passage through a constructed labyrinth exists. When the passage comes out, the algorithm is complete and the labyrinth is ready. Otherwise, the next iteration begins, as the queen is not satisfied with the work of her subordinates. In search of an exit, the queen moves according to the Cartesian metric defined in (3), where we assume Lij = 1. (12) The possibility of leading diagonally through the labyrinth is thus blocked, which helps to ensure that the queen moves only in horizontal or vertical lines."}, {"heading": "III. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "We have performed benchmark tests on various dimensions of boards. Let's present sample results for: \u2022 square labyrinths (fig. 1 and fig. 2) with parameter values n = 30, r = 20, \u0443 =, ABCA (m = 10% n), AACA (\u03b1 = 0, 4, \u03c1 = 0, 3), \u2022 rectangular labyrinths (fig. 3 and fig. 4) with parameter values n = 200, r = 120, \u0445 =, ABCA (m = 10% n), AACA (\u03b1 = 0, 4, \u03c1 = 0, 3). Fig. 5 shows a diagram of the time comparison for creating labyrinths using both AACA (blue line) and ABCA (orange line). Up to 3000 fields in the labyrinth AACA is less efficient compared to ABCA. If the labyrinth we create contains between 3000 and 6000 fields AACA, we use the efficiency of both AACA equal to 10000."}, {"heading": "IV. FINAL REMARKS", "text": "The results suggest that swarm intelligence is capable of creating labyrinths. Figure 5 shows that the labyrinth of complex up to 3000 fields is best suited for ABCA in Section II-B, but for larger labyrinths, AACA in Section II-A seems to be the better choice. Creating labyrinths is quite a complex process, but the results are very satisfactory labyrinths that are randomly created, which gives a feature of uniqueness. As a result, the algorithms presented in this paper can be used to create not only labyrinths, but also environments for 2D or even 3D games, and also to apply smart cities models for prediction and evaluation purposes."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This work was partially supported by the PRIME project, financed by the Italian Ministry of Universities and Research under POR FESR Sicilia 2007-2013."}], "references": [{"title": "Genetic algorithms and the optimal allocation of trials", "author": ["J.
