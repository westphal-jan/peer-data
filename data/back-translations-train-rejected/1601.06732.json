Standardized approaches to combining concepts, such as fuzzy set theory, have proved insufficient [Osherson and Smith, 1981]. Composite labels often have \"emerging attributes\" [Hampton, 1987] that cannot be explained by splitting the label into its constituent parts. We argue that in this case, a new concept is generated. This project aims to determine the conditions for such concept generation using multi-agent models of language development."}, {"heading": "1.1 Thesis Outline", "text": "The project is divided into three parts. Firstly, we have developed a model of concept combination within the semantic framework of the label, as explained in [Lawry and Tang, 2009], which is inspired and reflects the results of [Hampton, 1987], in which membership in a network concept can be presented as a weighted sum of memberships in individual concepts. Secondly, we need to show that compositionality can develop within a population of interacting agents. Preparatory work in this area will examine the ability of a population of agents to merge into a common number of dimensional weights. Thirdly, we will investigate the generation of new unit concepts from existing network concepts based on the multi-agent model."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "This work is based on the framework of label semantics [Lawry, 2004; Lawry and Tang, 2009], together with the prototype theory [Rosch, 1975], where belonging to a concept is based on proximity to a prototype and conceptual spaces [Ga \ufffd rdenfors, 2004]. The latter considers concepts as regions of a space consisting of quality dimensions and equipped with distance measurement, e.g. the RGB color space. Label semantics suggests that agents use a series of labels LA = {L1,..., Ln} to describe a conceptual space equipped with distance measurement d (x, y). Labels Li are associated with prototypes Pi \u0441\u0442 and uncertain thresholds \u03b5i, which are drawn from probability distributions \u03b5i. The threshold \u03b5i captures the notion that an element x-i is sufficiently close to Pi (\u03b5ix) to be called Li."}, {"heading": "3 A New Model of Concept Composition", "text": "Experiments in [Hampton, 1987] suggest that the human conceptual combination (coarse) can be modeled as a weighted sum of attributes such as \"has feathers,\" \"speaks\" (for the concept of \"bird\") These attributes differ from quality dimensions in conceptual spaces: they tend to be binary, complex and multidimensional. Therefore, we consider each attribute as a label in a conceptual space and combine these attributes in a binary space {0, 1} n, as shown in Figure 1, where a conjunction of these terms \u03b1 = 1 \u00b1 Li is assigned to a binary vector."}, {"heading": "4 Convergence of Dimension Weights Across a Population", "text": "We are investigating how a population of agents in a multi-agent simulation playing a series of language games could converge to a common set of dimensional weights. Agents with identical names L1 = L2 = < 1, d, U [0, 1] > basis weights 1 = [0, 1] (d is Euclidean distance) and randomly initiated weights \u03bb [0, 1] enter a series of dialogs about elements in the terminology and adjust their weights after each dialogue is complete. At any time, speaker agents make claims that \u03b1i = \u00b1 L1 \u00b1 L2 about the elements that define the dimensions, ~ x \u00b2 2 that maximize the dimensions. \u2212 x \u2212 x = Predicting elements in the terminology L1 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) \u00b5L2 (x2) definitions that define the positive dimension."}, {"heading": "5 Further Work", "text": "We are currently working on analytical results to predict the value of \u03bb to which the active ingredients converge. In certain circumstances, such as in the case of w = 1 or with a modified update model, analytical results are possible. We will expand this work to investigate the benefits of using conjunctival claims within these simulations, and the work in the third year will focus on investigating how new concepts might emerge from the combination of existing concepts. We will build on the language development model currently under development."}], "references": [{"title": "Conceptual spaces: The geometry of thought", "author": ["P.
