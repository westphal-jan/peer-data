Elements from an underlying metric space then have graduated membership in a concept, depending on their similarity to a prototype for the concept. There is some evidence that humans use natural categories in this way, as shown in experiments described in [25]. Blurred set theory [30] was proposed as a basis for the calculation and modification of graduated membership concepts, and was extended in [32] to linguistic variables that use words as values rather than numbers."}, {"heading": "2.2 Conceptual Spaces", "text": "Conceptual spaces are proposed by Ga \ufffd rdenfors in [14] as a framework for the representation of information at the conceptual level. Ga \ufffd rdenfors juxtaposes his theory with both a symbolic, logical approach to concepts and an associationist approach in which concepts are presented as associations between different types of basic information elements. Rather, conceptual spaces are geometric structures based on quality dimensions such as weight, height, hue, brightness, etc. It is assumed that conceptual spaces are metric spaces, with a corresponding measure of distance. This may be Euclidean distance or another appropriate measure. Distance measurement can be used to formulate a measure of similarity as required for prototype theory - similar objects lie closely together in the conceptual space, very different objects are far apart from each other. In order to develop the conceptual spatial framework, Ga \ufffd rdenfors also introduces the notion of integral and divisible dimensions as a value reference in another dimension that is an integral part of a value reference."}, {"heading": "2.3 Label Semantics", "text": "In this context, agents use a series of labels LA = {L1, L2,..., Ln} to describe an underlying threshold that has a distance metric d (x, y) between the points. In this case, it is sufficient that d (x, y) can be a pseudo-distance. If x or y is a threshold, say Y, we take d (x, Y) = min {d (x, y): y). In this case, the set Y is considered an ontic set, i.e., a set in which all elements are prototypes in common, as opposed to an epistemic set that describes a precise but unknown prototype, as described in [11]. Each designation Li is first associated with a set of prototype values Pi, and secondly with a threshold over which the agents are uncertain."}, {"heading": "3 Approaches to linguistic hedges", "text": "In fact, it is not that one sees oneself in a position to position oneself in a way that one imagines oneself to be.

However, our hedges have an intuitive meaning: if I think that the threshold for a concept \"small\" has a certain width, then the threshold for the concept \"very small\" will be narrower. On the other hand, the threshold for the concept \"quite small\" is wider. The proposed hedges are examples of \"type 1\" hedges, i.e. they operate equally across all dimensions of the hazy set associated with a concept. The first result presented is somewhat similar to a powerful modifier, since the core and support of the set remain the same. In [3, 22] it is argued that this property is undesirable for hedges used in hazy expert systems, because when a query returns a series of answers, this type of hedge does not diminish this problem, although we do not."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and further work", "text": "We have presented formulas for two simple linguistic hedges, \"very\" and \"fairly.\" These formulas are functional, therefore easy to calculate, but also semantically grounded, since they are naturally derived from the conceptual framework of label semantics in connection with the theory of prototypes and concept spaces, and in the most concrete case do not require additional parameters. We have also shown that two further formulations [2, 8, 24] can be derived from this framework with equal or fewer parameters. We have shown that hedges can be assembled and have described their behavior within the boundaries of composition. Further work could concern the testing of the usefulness of these hedges, in particular of classical hedges, in order to compare their performance with the classical hedges and with those used by e.g. [3, 22] and also to investigate a compromise between the accuracy and the number of parameters used. Alternatively, the study of semantically grounded possibilities for extending or reducing prototypes could have a similar effect."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgements", "text": "Martha Lewis is grateful for the support of the EPSRC grant number EP / E501214 / 1"}], "references": [{"title": "A fuzzy linguistic approach generalizing boolean information retrieval: A model and its evaluation", "author": ["G.
