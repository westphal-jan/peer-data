We expand this work to include assertions that have been modified by the words \"very\" and \"quite\" and show that this improves performance in two respects. Using the hedging \"very\" improves the level of convergence achieved. The use of hedging \"quite\" reduces the overlap within an agent's label set.

Agents use labels to describe a conceptual space. At each time step, agents are randomly paired into speaker and listener, and each pair is given a specific element x *. The speaker makes a claim regarding the element based on his label set. The listener then updates his own label set to be more similar to that of the speaker, based on this claim and a parameter w that can be imagined as the age of the speaker. The update made by the speaker is a combination of shifting the prototype of the relevant label and changing the size of the threshold. The goal is for label sets in the population to converge to a common group of shared categories after a number of timesteps."}, {"heading": "2.2 Conceptual models", "text": "At the beginning of the simulations, the Pi thresholds are evenly distributed in space.

Therefore, each active substance has a label LA = {L1, L2,... Ln}. These labels can be secured in such a way that they form a sentence LA + = LA, all Li: i = 1,..., n}.

If overall convergence is important, a high prior likelihood of assertion of contraction hedges should be used to improve the performance of APD metrics. Conversely, if the ability of agents to distinguish precisely between objects in the environment is more important, then expansion edges, along with lower probabilities of assertion of positive labels, should be used to maintain a low level of ALO while improved performance is based on APD metrics."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have studied the utility of sound claims in developing a common language and have shown that it improves the ability of actors to make sound claims to develop common categories in two ways. Firstly, the use of contraction safeguards, i.e. words such as \"very,\" enables a higher degree of convergence to common categories, while the degree of overlap between labels slightly improves. Secondly, the use of expansion safeguards, or words such as \"well,\" allows the development of label sets that are more discriminatory to the environment and also exhibit a higher degree of convergence. However, both improvements go hand in hand with a slower rate of development of common labels. It may be possible to improve these speeds by adjusting other parameters such as the actors \"age span or the values of the safeguards used."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "Martha Lewis is grateful for the support of the EPSRC grant number EP / E501214 / 1"}], "references": [{"title": "Adjusting the core and/or the support of a fuzzy set-a new approach to fuzzy modifiers", "author": ["P.
