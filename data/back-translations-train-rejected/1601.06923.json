In the common cluster model, the symptom variable shortness under Y27 is grouped with sighing and three other symptom variables. In the common cluster model, sighing and the other variables are excluded. Short breathing may therefore need to be regrouped with other symptom variables from other countries in order to properly model the dependence between the variables. In Lantern, there is a search procedure that decides whether a regrouping is necessary and how it should be performed. In the common cluster model for Qi deficiency, short breathing is automatically merged with Y26 (chest compression, palpitation) and a new W is generated."}, {"heading": "4.5 Syndrome Classification", "text": "In fact, it is not as if people are able to survive themselves, as if they are able to survive themselves, and as if they are not able to survive themselves.

All of these symptoms can be found in our classification rule for blood deficiency (Section 4.5). The symptoms with the highest scores are blurred vision and dry eyes, reflecting the characteristics of the population studied, which consists of patients with VMCI and older than 50 years. According to the TCM theory, seniors usually suffer from kidney deficiency, which can lead to liver deficiency (liver and kidney come from the same source), and therefore poor vision (the opening of the liver is located on the eye). According to our quantification results for the syndrome (Section 4.4), blurred vision and dry eyes with the highest probabilities (0.82 and 0.69) occur in the blood deficiency class. Palpitations and insomnia also occur with a high probability (0.56 and 0.60)."}, {"heading": "5.1.2 Results on Blood Stasis", "text": "According to the TCM theory, the key factors for determining blood stasis are locally intangible stabbing pain and color changes on the face, lips and tongue. In our blood stasis classification rule, the symptoms with the highest values are consistent purple or dark lips, dark complexion, blackish lower eyelid. The rule also includes tongue with ecchymosis and dark tongue. However, our rule does not correspond well to the TCM theory regarding local non-groping pain. In the VMCI dataset, there are only symptoms of stabbing pain, i.e. stabbing headache. stabbing pain in other parts of the body was not included in the survey due to its absence in the TCM literature on chi dai dai or dai bing. Stabbing headache occurred with very low frequency (< 3%) and it is negative and poorly correlated with other blood stasis symptoms."}, {"heading": "5.1.3 Results on Qi Deficiency", "text": "According to the theory of TCM, the key factors for determining Qi deficiency are lack of strength, shortness of breath and inertia of the limbs and the body. In our classification rule for Qi deficiency, these are among the symptoms with the highest values. In addition, the four symptoms of waist or knee pain, urinary incontinence, chest and heart palpitations also have high values, reflecting the characteristics of the population studied. Patients in the population are elderly and therefore likely to suffer from kidney deficiency, which manifests itself in painful waist or knees and urinary incontinence. Patients in the population all suffer from vascular MCI (mild cognitive impairment).The vascular factors can affect the heart and lead to chest and heart palpitations.According to our quantification results, the symptoms of chest pressure, palpitations and painful waist or knees are most likely to occur in the Qi deficiency class.

In our fire-heat classification rule, dry stools or constipation and thirst for cold drinks have high values. The other top score symptoms are aphtha in the mouth or on the tongue, fatty halitosis, acid swallowing or epigastric mood, insomnia, throbbing headache and restlessness or short-term temper. In TCM, these symptoms are considered manifestations of excessive heat. However, the symptoms of flushface, red tongue, yellow tongue and fast pulses are not present in our classification rule.

Accordingly, oily tongue membrane and slippery pulse have high values in our mucous membrane moisture classification rule. Dizziness and dizziness (invisible mucus) are also present. The important role of dizziness and dizziness in general is consistent with TCM's claim that mucus blockage of brain collateral is an important pathogenic factor."}, {"heading": "5.1.7 Results on Yin Deficiency", "text": "According to the theory of TCM, the manifestations of yin deficiency fall mainly into two categories: those caused by the lack of intestines and organs due to the lack of yin fluid, and those caused by the relative excess of yang due to the failure of yin to rein in yang. In our classification rule for yin deficiency, the symptoms of yin deficiency are painful waist or knee, blurred vision, dry eyes and tinnitus representative symptoms of the first category, while insomnia, dreaminess, palpitations, expectation are representative symptoms of the second category. According to the theory of TCM, the key features of yin deficiency in internal heat are red and dry tongue, little tongue fur and thin and fast pulse. In our rule to distinguish between yin deficiency II (with internal heat) and yin deficiency I, the main features of yin deficiency in internal heat are dry tongue and red tongue, and fast and thin powder and powder."}, {"heading": "5.1.8 Results on Yang Deficiency", "text": "Our classification rule for yang deficiency syndrome fits well with the TCM theory in the sense that all of the symptoms usually contained are closely related to yang deficiency according to the TCM theory. In fact, the symptoms are fear of cold or cold limbs, thirst for hot drink, undigested food in the stool and diarrhea before dawn, the cold symptoms of yang deficiency. Symptoms of painful waist or knees, blackened lower eyelids, frequent night urination and a weak complexion indicate a kidney deficiency. In addition, palpitations and breast suppression lead to rapid heart rate. Weak spleen yang leads to malnutrition of muscles and meridians, which leads to sluggishness of the limbs and body. Note that the three symptoms lead to painful waist or knee, blackened lower eyelid thirst and dizziness in both Yang deficiency and general calf disturbance."}, {"heading": "5.2 Uses of Results", "text": "Our classification rules are based on scores and are therefore convenient to use. In fact, they can be applied in three scenarios. Firstly, a major weakness of TCM is the lack of gold standards for syndrome medication differentiation. In clinical practice, different physicians can draw different conclusions about the syndrome type of the same patient. This affects the effectiveness of treatments and undermines patient confidence. Secondly, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can be widely used to determine the effectiveness of TCM treatments. To perform RCT for treatment with a TCM syndrome type, these types must be used as the basis for developing syndrome differentiation standards for VMCI. Secondly, use randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the effectiveness of TCM treatments."}, {"heading": "5.3 Strengths and Limitations", "text": "In this paper, we address the problem of classifying VMCI patients into TCM syndrome types. Results are quantitative in nature. Eight syndrome types are identified, and prevalence and score-based classification rules are obtained for each of the syndrome types. Results are obtained using the latent tree analysis method. Consequently, they enjoy stronger evidence support than solutions that could be obtained with the alternative approaches, namely expert standardization and monitored quantification approaches [19]. Expert standardization, on the other hand, establishes solutions for the syndrome classification by expert panels. In supervised quantification, experts are asked to identify the syndrome types of individual patients. In both cases, the results strongly depend on who the experts are. However, the latent tree analysis method is based only on symptom data. Results are relatively more objective. One limitation of our work is that the data collected for all purposes of the study in North China would be of interest to other parts of the country, as it is mainly used in other parts of the country."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "By analyzing symptom data collected from 803 VMCI patients 50 years of age or older using latent tree models, we have concluded that there are eight types of TCM syndromes in the population: anaemia, hemostasis, phlegm humidity, fire heat, qi deficiency, qi stagnation, yang deficiency and yin deficiency. In addition, two subtypes of yin deficiency have been identified, namely yin deficiency with and without internal heat. The prevalence and probability of symptoms occurring for the syndrome types and subtypes have been determined, and appropriate classification rules have been established. Results are well in line with TCM theory and enjoy the strongest evidence currently possible.Cometing Interests' The authors explain that they have no competing interests, financial or non-occurring probabilities for the syndrome types and subtypes."}], "references": [{"title": "Global prevalence of dementia: a Delphi consensus study", "author": ["CP Ferri", "M Prince", "C Brayne"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Clinico-neuropathological correlation of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in a community-based case series", "author": ["A Lim", "D Tsuang", "W Kukull"], "venue": "J Am Geriatr Soc", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1999}, {"title": "Vascular dementia in a population-based autopsy study", "author": ["DS Knopman", "JE Parisi", "BF Boeve"], "venue": "Arch Neurol", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2003}, {"title": "Relative frequencies of Alzheimer disease, Lewy body, vascular and frontotemporal dementia and hippocampal sclerosis in the state of Florida brain", "author": ["WW Barker", "CA Luis", "A Kashuba"], "venue": "bank.
