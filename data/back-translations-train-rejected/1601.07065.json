One of the issues in MOOCs which is the lack of interactivity with the instructor has brought conversational bot into the picture to fill in this gap. In this study, a prototype of MOOCs conversational bot, MOOC-bot is being developed and integrated into MOOCs website to respond to the learner inquiries using text or speech input. MOOC-bot is using the popular Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) to develop its knowledge base, leverage from AIML capability to deliver appropriate responses and can be quickly adapted to new knowledge domains. The system architecture of MOOC-bot consists of knowledge base along with AIML interpreter, chat interface, MOOCs website and Web Speech API to provide speech recognition and speech synthesis capability. The initial MOOC-bot prototype has the general knowledge from the past Loebner Prize winner - ALICE, frequent asked questions, and a content offered by Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM). The evaluation of MOOC-bot based on the past competition questions from Chatterbox Challenge (CBC) and Loebner Prize has shown that it was able to provide correct answers most of the time during the test and demonstrated the capability to prolong the conversation. The advantages of MOOC-bot such as able to provide 24-hour service that can serve different time zones, able to have knowledge in multiple domains, and can be shared by multiple sites simultaneously have outweighed its existing limitations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 Jan 2016 15:23:29 GMT  (2956kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07065v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ser ling lim", "ong sing goh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.07065"}, "pdf": {"name": "1601.07065.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Ling Lim", "Ong Sing Goh"], "emails": ["goh@utem.edu.my,", "limserling@hotmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "The MOOC-bot has a knowledge base together with an AIML interpreter, a chat interface, the MOOCs website and the Web Speech API to provide appropriate answers and be quickly adapted to new areas of knowledge.

Since normally only one instructor holds a course, students will not be able to receive the full attention or help of the instructor when they encounter problems, which will ultimately be frustrating for students. On the other hand, faculty will feel overwhelmed to process so many student requests at once. Moreover, it is inefficient for the instructor to repeat the answers many times, causing additional workload. In addition, MOOCs are designed to provide students with flexibility to learn for their own convenience because they may have a full-time job or other obligations, while offering MOOCs to participants from around the world, meaning they can live in locations with different time zones."}, {"heading": "1.4 Research Questions", "text": "Based on the issues mentioned in Section 1.3, the research questions for this study are identified as follows: 1.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the area of study that inspires the exploration of many useful applications with a computer or machine, and one of these is conversation messages. Conversational messages are sometimes referred to as conversation robots, conversation agents, chatbots, chatterbots, or simply \"bots,\" but they have the same goal, which is to generate meaningful conversations with human users in natural language. To this end, Turing Test (TT) is the known measurement used to evaluate the performance of a conversation bot, and many parties use TT as an assessment of conversation messengers such as the Loebner Prize and Chatterbox Challenge contest, although it is the modified version of the original TT. There are many types of conversation messengers that have been researched and developed over the years, ranging from general conversation messengers that may not specialize in conversation bots, to those that can be used for such conversations."}, {"heading": "2.2 Massive Open Online Courses", "text": "In fact, it is the case that most of them are in a position to go into a different world, in which they are able to move, in which they move, in which they move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they, in which they are able to move, in which they are able to move, in which they are able to move, in which they are able to move, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they live, in which they, in which they are able to live, in which they, in which they"}, {"heading": "2.3 Artificial Intelligence", "text": "The term \"artificial intelligence\" (AI) was first introduced at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, which saw the need to separate it from other fields of study (Russell and Norvig, 2010). AI is a branch of computer science that attempts to create intelligent machines that may exhibit behavior similar to human intelligence. Essentially, it is an attempt to simulate the intelligence of the human mind. According to Russell and Norvig (2010), the AI system can be divided into four categories, namely human thought, rational action, human action, and rational action, as shown in Figure 2.1. Today, AI is used in many areas. Some of the examples are natural language comprehension, speech recognition, planning and planning, vision, robotics, and expert systems. There have been many successes or successful applications in AI history."}, {"heading": "2.4 Turing Test, Loebner Prize and Chatterbox Challenge", "text": "Alan Turing was a very influential pioneer in computer science and a brilliant mathematician who surpassed the required data storage. In 1950, through his famous article \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" he proposed a behavioral intelligence test, which he called the \"Imitation Game.\" However, his challenge to \"Can machines think?\" in the newspaper brought attention to the point of view of machine intelligence. The test, better known as the Turing Test (TT), suggested that a computer is considered \"intelligent\" if a human questioner who asked some written questions cannot tell whether the written answers come from a human or a computer, as illustrated in Figure 2.3.Turing (1950), believed that in about fifty years from that date (which should be assumed, year 2000), computers will have reached the storage capacity of about 109 that would reach the result of the test: \"an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of correctly identifying.\""}, {"heading": "2.5 Conversational Bots", "text": "It was developed by Weizenbaum (1966) to play the role of a psychotherapist to a patient. This research was considered a breakthrough in AI at the time because it showed a form of communication between human and computer in natural language. Although ELIZA was far from passing the real TT, but was able to convince the questioner to continue the conversation with the program, it led people to believe that it had shown the reactions in a Turing-like test. Figure 2.4 shows a sample dialogue of ELIZA from Wheat Tree (1966).How ELIZA simulated a Roman psychotherapist, it was able to rephrase the trick of presenting the patient's statements as questions and the patient will likely open up his personal problems that will continue the conversation.

Speech recognition is an alternative input method that works by accepting speech input and converting it to text. Voice input has several advantages, for example, it improves accessibility for visually impaired users and provides a hands-free input method (Adorf, 2013). On the other hand, speech synthesis is the act of converting text to speech. Voice synthesis is integrated into Text-to-Speech (TTS) applications to provide a better user experience.Although the specification of the Web Speech API is included in HyperText MarkupLanguage 5 (HTML5), it is currently only supported by Google Chrome and Apple Safari browsers (Walther, 2015).One of the drawbacks of the Web Speech API is that the user of the application is allowed to use the microphone for voice recognition."}, {"heading": "2.8 Summary", "text": "This chapter gives an overview of MOOCs from a few perspectives, such as types of MOOCs, advantages and challenges. One of the problems in MOOCs is the lack of interactivity with the instructor who brought the conversation bot into the picture to fill this gap. Conversational bot, which is considered part of the application of AI, is always measured in the Turing test planned by Alan Turing. Although some may have criticized TT as a focal point in AI research, the Loebner Prize and Chatterbox Challenge competition has kept it alive over the past 20 years, with annual prizes to attract participants. To date, the Loebner Prize grand prize has not been claimed, but the techniques in the conversation bot have evolved with AIML by ALICE as one of the most powerful outcomes. AIML may not be a completely intelligent technology, but its ability to provide adequate answers in domain-restricted areas (Schumaker etal, 2006; Miketal. OLICE, Baretan, 2012-OCHER, and MEZ-GER) is sufficient."}, {"heading": "3.1 Introduction", "text": "The research methodology is important to solve the research problem systematically.

Having reviewed the AIML technology in the previous chapter, it is now applied in the MOOC bot to play the role of a conversation boat that can respond to course-related queries. The prototype of the MOOC bot has the domain knowledge of the \"MITI 5113 Artificial Intelligence\" course taught at the UTeM."}, {"heading": "3.2 Type of Research Method", "text": "This study is based on qualitative research because it is not as easy to quantify as quantitative research requires. Initially used mainly in psychology and the social sciences, the use of qualitative research has increased in recent decades due to trends towards empirical research in conjunction with modernity (Flick, 2009). Qualitative research is an approach that includes inductive data analysis and data interpretation by the researcher (Creswell, 2013), many of which are carried out by qualitative methods for research with talking robots (Benotti et. al., 2014; Ghose et Barua et.al., 2013; Dybala et.al., 2009), since turing tests popular among researchers in this field are also based on qualitative assessment (Browne, 1991)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Research Design", "text": "To build MOOC robots, the software development model of the prototype is used to ensure rapid development in a more cost-effective manner. Prototype is a direct method to provide users with the image of the proposed system. According to Pressman and Maxim (2014), prototype evaluated by the user can be used to refine the requirements of the software. Prototype can be customized to meet the requirements of the user and at the same time the developer can have a better understanding of the requirements based on feedback. The changes and suggestions that are made at the prototype stage can avoid sudden changes after completion of the system.Prototype methodology has two strategies: requirement prototype, which is also known as disposable prototype, and evolutionary prototype. The development of MOOCbot would be using evolutionary prototype prototype, because the prototype is being discarded to a prototype."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Planning Phase", "text": "The evolutionary prototype methodology was chosen for its advantage in providing end-users with a working model to better understand how MOOC-Bot would work before the complete system.

This test can be performed by using some of the past questions posed by the jurors in the Conversation bot competition, such as the Loebner Prize and the Chatterbox Challenge Competition."}, {"heading": "3.4 System Architecture", "text": "MOOC-bot is built into MOOC-bot's website as a chat interface, just like any other web application, it operates according to the client-server concept; the MOOCs website and AIML interpreter are hosted on the Apache web server, while the database and knowledge base use MySQL, which runs on the server; the web server works by translating PHP codes into the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), while the web client such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, etc. translates the client script like JavaScript before it is displayed to the user. If the user uses Google Chrome browser and opts for speech recognition, the Web Speech API converts language into text before it is sent to the AIML interpreter, displaying the result in text and language; the general database is used to save web-related information such as the user profile, the course and so on."}, {"heading": "3.4.1 Chat Interface", "text": "The chat interface of the MOOC bot is integrated into the MOOC website, and the chat interface is located at the bottom of the website as shown in Figure 3.3. The function of the chat interface is to receive text or voice input from the user and forward it to the AIML interpreter. In order to detect speech, the user must press the microphone button and allow the application to receive voice input, and the results of the interpreter are displayed and read to users when the speaker is turned on. Figure 3.4 shows the chat interface itself."}, {"heading": "3.4.2 Knowledge Base", "text": "The knowledge of the MOOC bot consists of the knowledge of the course, the FAQ of the course and the general knowledge derived from AAA files. Knowledge of the course is \"Artificial Intelligence,\" offered by UTeM, and the syllabus is presented in Table 3.3. The FAQ of the course can be inserted into the knowledge base by means of backward log file analysis by the botmaster, by reading the logged conversations and searching for frequently asked questions in the dialogue and adding the answers to the knowledge base using AIML file. This ensures that the most frequent requests are taken into account. AAA files form the brain of the award-winning conversation boat ALICE. The availability of these files for free download on Google Code makes cloning the brain of ALICE easy. An AIML file can be created with any text editor such as Notepad + + and stored with the extension \"aiml.\" The knowledge of the course is a derivation of a course XL file with an IML file."}, {"heading": "3.4.3 AIML Interpreter", "text": "MOOC-bot uses program O as an AIML interpreter. Program O is an AIML engine written in PHP and uses MySQL database to store the information of the boat, including the AIML files used to generate the boat's responses. Program O is suitable for MOOC-Bot because it is implemented in a web environment that can be run independently and thus allows integration into the MOOCs website. Text or speech input from the chat interface is processed by the interpreter by performing pattern matching with the AIML content in the knowledge base using depth scanning. The first matching response is returned to the chat interface.Support for recursion in AIML makes it simple, yet powerful in pattern matching."}, {"heading": "3.4.4 MOOCs Website", "text": "The MOOCs website is an initiative of UTeM to provide large open online courses to students. It is hosted for the prototype at http: / / ainibot.com / bot / mooc.php. A student can enroll in a course, download lecture notes, create quizzes, submit assignments and participate in a forum from here. A student's progress can also be tracked and monitored by the instructor. Integration of the MOOC bot chat interface into this website complements the role of the website."}, {"heading": "3.5 Summary", "text": "In fact, most of them will be able to survive on their own."}, {"heading": "4.3 Knowledge Base Creation", "text": "For the purpose of the prototype, only \"MITI 5113 Artificial Intelligence\" courses are added. For FAQ knowledge, the answers can be added from time to time by studying the conversation logs. As for general knowledge, note ALICE AIML (AAA) files from ALICE AI Foundation provide the convenience of cloning their general knowledge in MOOC Bot. More general knowledge that is not available in AAA files is also added to make MOOC-Bot smarter in dealing with general questions. There are two ways to add knowledge to the knowledge base. First, the knowledge can be made available directly in the user interface of Program O."}, {"heading": "4.4 Chat Interface", "text": "The standard chat interface provided by Program O, as illustrated in Figure 4.16, can be used for initial development, but integration with MOOC's website requires designing a more appropriate chat interface that matches the website. Furthermore, the chat interface must be equipped with the Web Speech API for speech recognition and synthesis, as it was not included in Program O. The chat interface designed for MOOC's website is shown in Figure 4.21. The \"webkitSpeechRecognition\" object and the \"SpeechSynthesisUtterance\" object must be added to the JavaScript of the chat interface for speech recognition and synthesis, both of which are currently supported only in the Google Chrome and Apple Safari browsers (Walther, 2015). Figure 4.22 shows the voice recognition code snippet, and Figure 4.23 shows the voice synthesis code snippet used in MOOC messages."}, {"heading": "4.5 Summary", "text": "Software installation and development environment are critical to ensuring that the development work can be carried out smoothly. To develop the MOOC bot, the knowledge base plays an important role in determining the intelligence of the conversational bot. Therefore, sufficient knowledge must be added to ensure that most queries can be processed. MOOC Boat's chat interface is designed to complement MOOC's website while providing the user with the convenience of real-time interaction. With speech recognition and speech synthesis, users have alternative input and output methods for conversation. CHAPTER 5EVALUATION AND RESULT5.1 IntroductionThis chapter explains the evaluation process and outcome of the MOOC bott.After MOOC Bot prototype has been prepared, it is important to evaluate and improve its performance whenever necessary.

Therefore, errors or limitations in these programs are also reflected on MOOC-bot. Among the deficiencies of Program O that were detected during development, sometimes includes the use of punctuation marks in the queries that can affect the results that are returned. Web Speech API is currently supported only by the Google Chrome and Apple Safari browsers. In addition, the need to give the application permission to use the speech recognition microphone after each pause could discourage the user from using it."}, {"heading": "6.5 Conclusion", "text": "The evaluation results showed that MOOC-Bot has great potential to be a conversation bot that can interact with end users. Although the knowledge in this study is limited to a single course, further courses may be added in the future to offer a wider range of courses in MOOCs. Advantages of the MOOC boat, such as the 24-hour service, which can operate in different time zones, have knowledge in multiple areas, and a conversation bot can be used from multiple locations simultaneously, have outweighed the existing limitations, which are mainly due to external factors."}, {"heading": "6.6 Future Work", "text": "One example is the provision of tutoring services in MOOCs to help students in their learning process. For example, the Conversation bot can help students with exercises or quizzes by providing explanations as needed. As for the limitation of speech recognition in this research, other technologies that are not browser-type can be explored for better results."}, {"heading": "6.7 Summary", "text": "This chapter summarizes and concludes the overall progress of the study.

MOOC-bot is using the popular Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) to develop its knowledge base, leverage from AIML\u2019s capability to deliver appropriate responses and can be quickly adapted to new knowledge domains. The system architecture of MOOC-bot consists of knowledge base along with AIML interpreter, chat interface, MOOCs website and Web Speech API to provide speech recognition and speech synthesis capability. The initial MOOC-bot prototype has the general knowledge from the past Loebner Prize winner ALICE, course\u2019s frequent asked questions, and a course\u2019s content offered by Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM). The evaluation of MOOC-bot based on the past competition questions from Chatterbox Challenge (CBC) and Loebner Prize has shown that it was able to provide correct answers most of the time during the test and demonstrated the capability to prolong the conversation.
