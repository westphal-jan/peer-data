Therefore, the problem of disambiguity is related to the specific case of WSD [1,2], especially with the name of someone who is also the word. Today, along with the growth of the web on the Internet, it is difficult to determine whether a website associated with the intended person is correct and appropriate, especially with the presence of semantic meaning as synonymy and polysemy.

In the experiment, we use a maximum of 1000 snippets for search terms representing an actor. Web snippets generate the word list for each actor and output very rare words due to the variety of his vocabulary. For example, for a named actor, \"Abdul Razak Hamdan\" runs a list of 26 candidate words. For example, we have up to 85 websites in our data set about Abdul Razak Hamdan. By using Yahoo! Search, we perform the query \"Abdul Razak Hamdan\" and a keyword \"science,\" then we get 39 websites that contain the name \"Abdul Razak Hamdan\" and a word \"science,\" and in accordance with our data set, we get this maximum value = 82% dust and we get this data system = 387-46% Razdan = Razdan 11."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "The overlap-based approach has the potential to be integrated into existing methods for extracting personal characteristics such as keywords.
