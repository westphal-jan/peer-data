ONLINE INTERACTIONS: THE MIRROR OF THE SOUL", "text": "Social media offers Internet users the ability to interact for a variety of purposes, from planning social events to engaging in commercial transactions. Online user behavior modeling and analysis deserves attention for a variety of reasons. In addition, online behavior analysis helps detect fictitious and fraudulent accounts that can spread spam or lead to bias in public opinion. [3] Current research on online behavior uses various techniques, such as social and interactive graphics. [5], textual content [1], [6] and other complex data representations. Defining a unifying approach is an open challenge, so we are introducing the novel term digital DNA sequences to characterize users \"behavior on social media."}, {"heading": "II. CONCEPT AND INSTANCES OF DIGITAL DNA", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Biological DNA", "text": "The human genome is the complete set of genetic information about man (Homo sapiens), encoded as nucleic acid (DNA) sequences. DNA sequences are sequences of characters (i.e. strings) that indicate the sequence of nucleotides within DNA molecules. Possible signs are A, C, G, and T, which represent the four nucleotide bases of a DNA strand: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Biological DNA stores the information-conducting functions and characteristics of a living organism. DNA sequences are analyzed using bioinformatics techniques. Sequence matching and decoding are among the best-known methods of analysis to find similarities and repetitions of sequences. By analyzing common sub-sequences, it is possible to predict specific characteristics of the individual and reveal relationships between different individuals."}, {"heading": "B. Digital DNA as a proxy of user online behavior", "text": "Inspired by biological DNA, interactions are characterized by the way in which users interact, in which they represent the sequence of a user's online actions. Each individual action (e.g. the publication of new content that follows a user) can be encrypted with a different character, similar to the DNA sequences in which users \"characters have behaved in their own way. In accordance with this paradigm, online user actions are the basis of their digital communication, the different types of user behavior can be observed on the Internet [6] and digital DNA is a flexible and compact way to model such behaviors. Its flexibility lies in the ability to identify the behavior of people."}, {"heading": "A. Mining groups of digital DNA sequences", "text": "The basic assumption of digital DNA fingerprinting technique is to view behaviors as sequences of action and to characterize and recognize social spambots by grouping similar sequences. Therefore, our approach falls into the broad field of sequential data mining, but it presents differences to the tasks that are usually performed when working with sequential data. Sequences are ordered lists of symbols from an alphabet B, namely s = {s1, s2,.. sn}, with si-B and are used in information retrieval, part-of-speech tagging, genomics, time series analysis - to name a few. Tasks that are frequently performed with such sequences are those of sequential supervised learning, sequence classification of sequences. For example, in sequential supervised learning, we are not able to find a sequence s = {s1, s2, sn}, the goal being to find a sequencing."}, {"heading": "IV. DIGITAL DNA FINGERPRINTING FOR SPAMBOT DETECTION", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "A. Characterizing spambot behavior", "text": "The digital DNA fingerprinting process has four main steps: (i) collecting behavioral data, each representing a string; (ii) extracting DNA sequences; (iii) comparing DNA sequences; (iv) evaluating DNA accounts. In order to perform a rigorous evaluation of our detection technology, we have created records of verified spambots and real Twitter accounts. All accounts in our datasets have undergone manual verification, in particular 50.05% (991 accounts) of Bot1 accounts and 89.29% (464 accounts) of Bot2 accounts have been certified as spambots. Then, we have built a dataset of human accounts by contacting users randomly and asking them simple questions in natural language. All 3,474 accounts that have been certified as human. For all 4,929 accounts in our datasets, we have collected behavioral data by performing the second step of their digital extraction."}, {"heading": "B. Uncovering novel Twitter spambots", "text": "This, in turn, can cause us to suspect a high level of automation for these accounts that behave in a similar way. Building on the promising results we have obtained with the tweet type DNA, we are using the characteristics of LCS curves below to effectively detect groups of Twitter spambots. Our detection techniques can be applied to a group of accounts that are not tagged to verify that there are accounts with suspiciously similar behavior. In a group of mixed accounts and genuine accounts, almost only bot accounts will have long DNA substrings in common. Thus, by identifying the group of accounts that share a long LCS, we can get a number of suspicious accounts."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "The novelty of our proposal is based on modeling behaviors in a DNA-inspired way. Therefore, we allow analysts to use a range of powerful tools - developed over decades for DNA analysis - to validate their working hypotheses on online user behavior. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we have conducted an extensive experimental campaign using Twitter as a benchmark and targeted spambot detection, and the results show that our proposal outperforms the best algorithms commonly used for this task. Finally, we argue that the proposed method could also be used in other contexts, paving the way for further research."}], "references": [{"title": "Predicting elections for multiple countries using twitter and polls", "author": ["A.
