In many real world applications such as bioinformatics, web mining, and text mining, comparing a random couple of sequences makes no sense. In fact, each instance of each bag may have structural and/or temporal relation with other instances in other bags. Thus, the classification task should take into account the relation between semantically related instances across bags. In this paper, we present two novel MIL approaches for sequence data classification: (1) ABClass and (2) ABSim. In ABClass, each sequence is represented by one vector of attributes. For each sequence of the unknown bag, a discriminative classifier is applied in order to compute a partial classification result. Then, an aggregation method is applied to these partial results in order to generate the final result. In ABSim, we use a similarity measure between each sequence of the unknown bag and the corresponding sequences in the learning bags. An unknown bag is labeled with the bag that presents more similar sequences. We applied both approaches to the problem of bacterial Ionizing Radiation Resistance (IRR) prediction. We evaluated and discussed the proposed approaches on well known Ionizing Radiation Resistance Bacteria (IRRB) and Ionizing Radiation Sensitive Bacteria (IRSB) represented by primary structure of basal DNA repair proteins. The experimental results show that both ABClass and ABSim approaches are efficient.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Jan 2016 21:15:10 GMT  (302kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00163v1", "Submitted to Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Journal"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Journal", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["manel zoghlami", "sabeur aridhi", "haitham sghaier", "mondher maddouri", "engelbert mephu nguifo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.00163"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.00163.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A multiple instance learning approach for sequence data with across bag dependencies", "authors": ["Manel Zoghlami", "Sabeur Aridhi", "Ha\u00eftham Sghaier", "Mondher Maddouri", "Engelbert Mephu Nguifo"], "emails": ["manel.zoghlami@gmail.com", "sabeur.aridhi@aalto.fi", "sghaier.haitham@gmail.com", "maddourimondher@yahoo.fr", "mephu@isima.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords Multiple instance learning; classification of sequence data; across bag dependencies; prediction; bacterial ionizing radiation resistance"}, {"heading": "1.

The feature extraction step is very important as it affects the classification results.This step should deal with many parameters, such as criteria for selecting features (e.g. frequency and length) and the type of linkages (i.e. accurate or inaccurate with gaps).After adapting the input data format, a conventional classification methodology is appliced.In sequence-based classification, a distance function should be defined to determine the similarity between a pair of characteristics (e.g. frequency and length) of the sequence method and inaccuracy of the next (i.e., relative to the neighbor)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches", "text": "This year it is so far that it will be able to mention the aforementioned lcihsrcsrteeSe rf\u00fc eid nlrrrteeaeaeKi rf\u00fc eid nlrteeeeeeeeeoiKe rf\u00fc eid nlrrsrteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeteeteeteerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"}, {"heading": "4.

To evaluate the naive approach and approach to bag classification, we first encode the protein sequences of each bag using a set of features / motifs generated by an existing motion extraction method. We then apply an existing classifier to the coded data. In our tests, we used DMS [12] as a motivation extraction method.
