HEALER's sequential plans (built using knowledge of social networks of homeless youth) choose intervention participants strategically to maximize influence spread, while reasoning about uncertainties in the network. While previous work presents influence maximizing techniques to choose intervention participants, they do not address three real-world issues: (i) they completely fail to scale up to real-world sizes; (ii) they do not handle deviations in execution of intervention plans; (iii) constructing real-world social networks is an expensive process. HEALER handles these issues via four major contributions: (i) HEALER casts this influence maximization problem as a POMDP and solves it using a novel planner which scales up to previously unsolvable real-world sizes; (ii) HEALER allows shelter officials to modify its recommendations, and updates its future plans in a deviation-tolerant manner; (iii) HEALER constructs social networks of homeless youth at low cost, using a Facebook application. Finally, (iv) we show hardness results for the problem that HEALER solves. HEALER will be deployed in the real world in early Spring 2016 and is currently undergoing testing at a homeless shelter.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Jan 2016 21:59:27 GMT  (3663kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00165v1", "This is an extended version of our AAMAS 2016 paper (with the same name) with full proofs of all our theorems included"]], "COMMENTS": "This is an extended version of our AAMAS 2016 paper (with the same name) with full proofs of all our theorems included", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["amulya yadav", "hau chan", "albert jiang", "haifeng xu", "eric rice", "milind tambe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.00165"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.00165.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Using Social Networks to Aid Homeless Shelters: Dynamic Influence Maximization under Uncertainty - An Extended Version", "authors": ["Amulya Yadav", "Hau Chan", "Albert Jiang", "Haifeng Xu", "Eric Rice", "Milind Tambe"], "emails": ["tambe}@usc.edu", "xjiang}@trinity.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Categories and Subject Descriptions I.2.11 [Distributed AI]: Multiagent SystemsGeneral Terms Algorithms, HIV Prevention Keywords POMDP; Influence Maximization; Social Networks; Multi-Level Planning"}, {"heading": "1.

Indeed, previous studies show that homeless youth in 10X are at greater risk of HIV infection than stable host populations."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "First, we discuss work related to maximization. There are many algorithms for finding \"seed sets\" of nodes to maximize influence in networks [10, 14, 1, 25]. However, all of these algorithms assume no uncertainty in the network structure and select a single seed set. In contrast, we select several seed sets sequentially in our work to select intervention participants. Also, our problem takes into account uncertainty about the network structure and influence status of network nodes (i.e. whether a node is affected or not). Finally, we use a different diffusion model, as we will explain later. Golovin et. al. [8] introduced adaptive submodularity and discussed adaptive sequential selection (similar to our problem), and they proved that a greedy algorithm has a (1 \u2212 1 / e) approximation guarantee. Unlike our work, they do not assume any uncertainty in the network structure."}, {"heading": "3. HEALER\u2019S DESIGN", "text": "It consists of two main components: (i) a Facebook application for collecting information on social networks; (ii) a DIME solution approach that solves the DIME problem (introduced in Section 5). We first explain the components of HEALER and then explain HEALER's design. Facebook Application: HEALER collects information on social connections in the social network of the homeless by interacting with young people via a Facebook application. We choose Facebook for collecting information as Young et. al. [31] show that approximately 80% of homeless young people are active on Facebook. Once a fixed number of homeless young people are registered in the Facebook application, HEALER analyzes the Facebook contact lists of all registered homeless young people and creates the social network between these young people. HEALER adds a connection between two people when and only if both people are friends on Facebook; and (ii) are registered in its Facebook application."}, {"heading": "4.

We assume that steered edges are rated as sometimes homeless shelters, that the influence in a friendship is very non-directional, and that non-directional follower links to Facebook are taken into account. Otherwise, friendships are coded as two non-directional edges. Undetermined network is a steered channel G = (V, E) with independent nodes and | E | = M edges. The Kante Set E consists of two separate subsets of edges: Ec (the set of certain edges, i.e. friendships we are safe) and Eu (the set of unsafe edges, which we are safe) and Eu (the set of uncertain edges, less safe, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, unknown, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain edges, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, unknown, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain, unknown, uncertain, uncertain, uncertain edges."}, {"heading": "4.2 HEALER\u2019s Facebook application", "text": "HEALER creates an insecure network by (i) using its Facebook application to generate a network with unclear edges; (ii) using well-known link prediction techniques such as KronEM [11] to derive probabilities of existence u (e) for all sorts of missing edges that are not present in the network; (iii) to determine a threshold probability \u03c4 (in consultation with homeless shelters) so that we only add a missing edge as an insecure edge when the derived probability of existence u (e) > \u03c4; and (iv) asking homeless shelters to provide p (e) estimates for network boundaries. The selection of: Rice et. al [18] shows that real homeless youth networks are relatively sparse.

HEAL: DIME PROBLEM SOLVER", "text": "The theories above show that DIME is a hard problem, as it is difficult to get any reasonable approximations at all. We model DIME as POMDP [16] for two reasons. Firstly, POMDPs are a good fit for DIME, because (i) we perform several interventions sequentially, similar to sequential POMDP actions; and (ii) we have a partial observation (similar to POMDPs) due to uncertainties in the network structure and the influence of nodes. Secondly, POMDP solvers have recently shown great promise in terms of generative politics efficiently [23]. We will now explain how we do DIME on a POMDP.States. A POMDP state in our country is a pair of binary tuples s = < W > F >, where W and F are lengths."}, {"heading": "6.1 HEALER\u2019s DIME Solver", "text": "Similarly, PSINET-W [29] was simply unable to meet the real demands of the real world (as shown in our experiments), so we propose to use a new heuristic network based on a novel hierarchy: it creates ensembles of imperfect (and smaller) POMDPs in two different levels, in a hierarchical manner (see Figure 6). HEAL's top layer creates a group of smaller intermediate POMDPs by dividing the original insecure network into several smaller partitioned networks. [13] Each of these partitioning techniques is then grouped into a POMDP and these intermediate POMDPs by dividing the original insecure network into several smaller partitioned networks."}, {"heading": "7. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "All our experiments are run on a 2.33 GHz 12-core Intel machine with 48 GB of RAM. All experiments are averaged over 100 runs. We use a metric of \"indirect influence\" in this section, which is \"indirectly\" influenced by the number of nodes. Thus, the total number of affected nodes could be 26 (say) and thus the indirect influence is 26 \u2212 20 = 6. In all experiments, the propagation and existence probability values on all network margins are uniformly set to 0.1 and 0.6, based on the results in Kelly et al. [9] We loosen these parameter settings later in the section. All experiments are significant."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper focuses on the important problem of selecting participants in sequential interventions organized by homeless shelters in order to raise awareness of HIV prevention practices among homeless youths. This is an extremely important problem, since homeless youths are at high risk of HIV (approximately 10% of homeless youths are HIV positive). While previous work attempts to solve this problem, it simply fails to extend it to the actual sizes and requirements of the real world. HEALER presents the problem as POMDP and uses a completely new set of algorithms (HEAL, TASP and Evaluates) to achieve a 100-fold acceleration in moderate networks, a new software agent to solve this problem that scales up to the requirements of the real world. HEALER presents the problem as POMDP and uses a completely new set of algorithms (HEAL, TASP and Evaluates) to achieve a 100-fold acceleration over the state-of-the-algorithms-meets-the-solution-quality-during-algorithms."}], "references": [{"title": "Maximizing Social Influence in Nearly Optimal Time", "author": ["C.

plans for use by homeless shelters, who organize these interventions to raise awareness about HIV among homeless youth. HEALER\u2019s sequential plans (built using knowledge of social networks of homeless youth) choose intervention participants strategically to maximize influence spread, while reasoning about uncertainties in the network. While previous work presents influence maximizing techniques to choose intervention participants, they do not address three real-world issues: (i) they completely fail to scale up to real-world sizes; (ii) they do not handle deviations in execution of intervention plans; (iii) constructing real-world social networks is an expensive process. HEALER handles these issues via four major contributions: (i) HEALER casts this influence maximization problem as a POMDP and solves it using a novel planner which scales up to previously unsolvable realworld sizes; (ii) HEALER allows shelter officials to modify its recommendations, and updates its future plans in a deviation-tolerant manner; (iii) HEALER constructs social networks of homeless youth at low cost, using a Facebook application. Finally, (iv) we show hardness results for the problem that HEALER solves. HEALER will be deployed in the real world in early Spring 2016 and is currently undergoing testing at a homeless shelter.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
