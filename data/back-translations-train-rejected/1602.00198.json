See simplest IPU 2-1 IPU in Appendix 2. A mathematical function is an IPU: P: I \u2192 O. Such a function with N-bit variables and M-bit function value is an N -M IPU.3. However, a software with well-defined input and no context dependency is an IPU. Such software with N-bit input and M-bit output is an N -M IPU. Many statistics software would fit into this category. 4. A CPU with a certain limitation so that it has no context is an IPU. Such a CPU could actually be considered one of the mathematical functions (but its definition is complicated). For example, one can learn 64-bit CPU if we take a certain restriction is an IPU.5. A machine learning software is an IPU. Of course, its processing can change (learn).6."}, {"heading": "4 Why Mechanical Learning?", "text": "We define mechanical learning and learning devices that can do effective work for certain tasks. Simply put, mechanical learning is indeed an important prerequisite for improving the ability to process information according to a set of simple and fixed rules, but why are we interested in a set of simple and fixed rules? First, let's explain our thoughts about how many current machine learning programs are not on the mechanical side, but they emphasize how to make computer systems that learn from data better, and how to do so better. So is it necessary to bring up the term mechanical and post-mechanical requirements for learning? Against this background, Jeff Hawkins gave a very strong point to build a learning machine that has the potential to become the next generation of computer systems, it must be independent of the learning tasks. Recall the history of computer science could help us see this better. Before the Neumann architecture, there were many systems or devices that could do effective work for certain tasks."}, {"heading": "5 How to Approach Mechancial Learning", "text": "How to approach and study mechanical learning is not an easy question, but luckily we have a better guide than the pioneers of computer technology. We can recall the history of computer technology to gain some invaluable guidance. Before modern computer technology, people have been thinking about mechanical thinking and mechanical computer technology for many hundreds of years. In fact, people have developed many devices for such purposes, from ancient Abacus to tablets working in this direction, even Babbage's mechanical computer. And on the theoretical side, people are fascinated by the mechanical aspects of human thought, especially computer technology, and wonder how to explore and use such aspects. Such thoughts motivate many great scientists and mathematicians working in this direction."}, {"heading": "6 About Further Works", "text": "The current article is the first for our discussions on mechanical learning and learning machines. We will continue to work on the two directions discussed in the last section. We would like to enumerate a few topics here. We would be very pleased to see further studies on these topics from all possible angles."}, {"heading": "About Building Universal Learning Machine", "text": "In order to build a universal loan machine, we think that the following topics are important and fruitful: 1. Which way could universal learning be achieved? As we have discussed, any parameterized learning could not be universal, but how can we avoid being parameterized? This is not at all easy. If we use known mathematical functions or sophisticated software as the basis of the learning machine, it would inevitably be parameterized, since all these mathematical functions and software are parameterized. We think that from this point of view, connectionist viewpoints become important.2. Spatial learning first, then the transition to temporal learning. Here, for the purpose of simplification, we are only discussing spatial learning. However, temporal learning is absolutely necessary. We should first study complete spatial learning, then, armed with the knowledge and tools from such studies, we move to temporal learning and then to spatial and temporal and temporal collective learning. We suspect that transit might not be super difficult to inspire us from the human brain."}, {"heading": "About Descriptions of Mechanical Learning", "text": "In order to describe mechanical learning well, we can list some areas below. Generalization. Generalization is very desirable for a learning machine. That is, we just need to teach some things to the learning machine, then the learning machine could automatically and correctly generalize more things. Can a mechanical learning machine do this? Why does this intelligent behavior seem to be achieved by a mechanical learning machine? And how? We would certainly like to go into depth to answer this question. In fact, this is the exact reason why we propose to study generalization. As a generalization, abstraction is also very desirable for a learning machine. Many researchers have already thought that abstraction could be the key to the further development of machine learning. In the first step, we need to describe abstraction well in mechanical learning."}, {"heading": "Appendix", "text": "It is not the first time that the EU Commission has taken such a step."}, {"heading": "2-1 IPU", "text": "2-1 IPU is the simplest IPU. For a 2-1 IPU there are a total of 16 (22 2 = 16) possible processing steps. We can see all processing steps in the following value table.Table 1.
