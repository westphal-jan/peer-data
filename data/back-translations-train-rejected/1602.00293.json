Frequent changes, abbreviations, acronyms and neologisms have left our language in an uninterrupted state of Xiv: 160 2.00 293v 1Change and Regeneration. These social media-specific forms have made the language \"bad\" and do not meet our expectations in terms of vocabulary, spelling and syntax [2]. However, these forms have accelerated real-time typed conversation; on mobile phones they have minimized the inconvenience of typing with tiny keys, and on Twitter they have helped us wrap our thoughts / feelings within 140 characters. Not only is the social media language very rich in a wide range of linguistic innovations, including emoticons, abbreviations, extensions, etc. [3] In this work, we categorize these out-of-battle vocabularies (these categories represent at least six different categories before they are fully over-interpreted)."}, {"heading": "Dataset description", "text": "We collected Twitter's 1% random sample of tweets from July 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013. For analysis, we included users who specified English as their language in their profile. We also performed a second filtering of tweets using voice recognition software1 to remove all non-English tweets from the dataset. Data is then tokenized with the same tokenizer used by the CMU POS tagger [5]. In total, the dataset consists of one billion Tweets.1https: / / github.com / saffsd / langid.py"}, {"heading": "Categorization of OOV words", "text": "We use GNU Aspell dictionary2 to find out the OOV words from the group of tweets, while selecting other words relatively easily. We then select the 3500 stable OOV words that occur every month over a period of 2.5 years, and manually identify 6 main categories for these OOV words: emoticons, expressions, abbreviations + abbreviations, own terms, word extensions, word markings. Five of the authors have labeled the words separately, but the match between the commenters is very high (Fleiss'\u0432 = 0.96). Out of 3500 words, we have reached a consensus of 3259 words. The remaining ambiguous words are not considered for further studies. Table 1 shows, for example, OOV words belonging to each of these categories. Figure 1 shows the monthly distribution of other OOV words per tweet that appear with a specific OOV word for each category."}, {"heading": "Automatic classification of OOV words", "text": "In this section, we propose a classification model for automatically categorizing OOV words into one of the last four categories in Table 1. To perform the classification task, we consider a random sample of 5000 tweets for each OOV word, and then learn three main characteristics: Lexical characteristics - characteristics related to the lexical properties of the words around OOV words; Content characteristics - characteristics related to the content of the tweets in which the OOV words appear; Context characteristics - including positioning and placement information of different units in the tweets; Lexical characteristics: Distribution of POS tags of the words that appear with the OOV word: We use the standard CMU POS tagger [5] to identify the POS tags of the words in the tweets. We then consider fractions of the words that belong to each of the 21 POS tag categories as characteristics."}, {"heading": "Content features:", "text": "The length of the OOV word: The length of an OOV word is important in determining the category to which it belongs. Abbreviations, abbreviations are generally of shorter length, while expressions, word extensions and word mergers are usually of longer length. Word diversity: This property tells us how diverse the words associated with an OOV are. If Di is the document that contains all the tweets in which OOV Oi appears, and p (w | Di) is the probability of a word belonging to the document Di, then the word diversity of the hashtag Oi is the entropy of p (w | Di). Avg. hashtag clarity: hashtag clarity, a metric that quantifies in [4] Topic Unit of all tweets in which the hashtag Oi appears. The clarity of the hashtag variety of the hashtag Oi is the entropy of p (w | Di). Avg Clarity Op-Topic: the clarity of the Topic of the Hashtag-Topic-Topic: the clarity of the Oi appears in the document."}, {"heading": "Performance evaluation", "text": "We perform a 10-fold cross-validation and achieve an accuracy of 81.26% with high precision and retrieval rates (see Table 2 for details). Both classifiers provide very similar classification performance; however, the logistics regression model considers a better area below the ROC curve compared to SVM. The number of topics (K) of LDA tweets does not have a significant effect on classification results. We observe that content features are the strongest type of trait, while context features are relatively weak (see Table 3). For individual characteristics, we consider them in descending order of the chi-square value and note that the length of LDA tweets does not have a significant impact on intake (biological process), approval (spoken category), topical characteristics of LDA and topical diversity characteristics of oxidation of oxidation of oxidation of oxidation values. Even if we consider a random tweet of less than 0.72 OV-words, we achieve an accuracy of O1000%."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have examined different categories of OOV words and proposed an automatic method to classify them into six disjunct classes. Our proposed classification framework achieves a high accuracy of 81.26% with high precision and memory. We observe that the content features are the most discriminatory, contributing alone to an accuracy of 77.83%. This leads us to believe that there are strong semantic differences in different categories of OOV words that could be used to identify them and would also be very effective in classifying previously unseen OOV words, which are very frequently introduced on the social media platform. This classification technique could also be used as a springboard to improve the accuracy of word processing algorithms in social media texts and other linguistic analyses - for example, if we can use this algorithm to identify the combined words well, we can use techniques that may track these words into their constituents as different linguists may be interested in dividing them over time, as well as in different categories of linguists."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2016, "abstractText": "Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.
