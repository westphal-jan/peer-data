Various clinical decisions are needed to manage the screening process; those include: selecting the screening tests for a woman to take, interpreting the test outcomes, and deciding whether or not a woman should be referred to a diagnostic test. Such decisions are currently guided by clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), which represent a one-size-fits-all approach that are designed to work well on average for a population, without guaranteeing that it will work well uniformly over that population. Since the risks and benefits of screening are functions of each patients features, personalized screening policies that are tailored to the features of individuals are needed in order to ensure that the right tests are recommended to the right woman. In order to address this issue, we present ConfidentCare: a computer-aided clinical decision support system that learns a personalized screening policy from the electronic health record (EHR) data. ConfidentCare operates by recognizing clusters of similar patients, and learning the best screening policy to adopt for each cluster. A cluster of patients is a set of patients with similar features (e.g. age, breast density, family history, etc.), and the screening policy is a set of guidelines on what actions to recommend for a woman given her features and screening test scores. ConfidentCare algorithm ensures that the policy adopted for every cluster of patients satisfies a predefined accuracy requirement with a high level of confidence. We show that our algorithm outperforms the current CPGs in terms of cost-efficiency and false positive rates.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Feb 2016 03:21:46 GMT  (1448kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00374v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ahmed m alaa", "kyeong h moon", "william hsu", "mihaela van der schaar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.00374"}, "pdf": {"name": "1602.00374.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "ConfidentCare: A Clinical Decision Support System for Personalized Breast Cancer Screening", "authors": ["Ahmed M.

Data Description", "text": "We are conducting all the experiments in this section using an unidentified data set of 25,594 individuals who underwent mammogram, MRI, and ultrasound screening at UCLA Medical Center. Each individual includes: age, breast density, ethnicity, gender, family history, age at menarche, age at birth of the first child, and hormone history. Each person has been subjected to at least one of three screening tests: a mammogram (MG), an MRI, an ultrasound (US), or a combination thereof. a BI-RADS Score is associated with each test performed. Table IV shows the input of the data set and the characteristics associated with each patient. The data set is marked with 0 for patients with negative diagnosis and 1 for patients with positive diagnosis (malignant tumor). The data set exhibits a sampling distortion effect in the sense that 2016 patients who made an MG are more than the 0.21 or 0.21% of those who had the MAFG."}, {"heading": "B. Learning the distance metric", "text": "Let us remember from Section IV that the clustering of the patient's personal characteristic space was carried out using a distance metric that combines both characteristic values and risk assessments as calculated by the Gail risk model using the DRAFT22 parameter \u03b2. Determining the parameter \u03b2 = 0 corresponds to risk stratification, whereas determining \u03b2 = 1 corresponds to stratification of the personal characteristic space, disregarding the previous information of the Gail model. As the Gail model does not include all characteristics of the patient (e.g. family history), the best choice is expected to be \u03b2 between 0 and 1, since both the patient's personal characteristics and risk assessments (non-redundant) contain information about the patient's similarity. As shown in Fig. 4, for an FNR restriction of p = 0.1 and confidence parameter of g = 0.05, we found that \u03b2 = 0.75 is the best choice for the patient's distance metric = 0.1."}, {"heading": "C.

ConfidentCare performance evaluation", "text": "We compare the performance of ConfidentCare with that of the current clinical guidelines to assess the value of personalization in terms of cost effectiveness. We compare the monetary costs of ConfidentCare with that of the American Cancer Society (ACS) screening guidelines of 2015 [?]. The reason for selecting this specific CPG representative is that it already applies a rough form of risk stratification: low, average and high-risk women are recommended to take different groups of tests. In Fig. 11, we plot the distribution of ConfidentCare's normalized monetary costs along with that of the ACS across different risk conditions. It is clear that ConfidentCare can save a significant amount of screening costs by supporting a layering of patients, and recommends screening tests only for patients who need them based on their two characteristics, the results of the previous tests they may have taken. The comparison in Fig. 11 is in fact subject to the choice of care and confidence limitations."}, {"heading": "E. Discussions and future work", "text": "The screening policy considered in this paper concerned the management of the short-term screening process, i.e. the policy recommended a sequence of screening tests for the patient based on the results of these tests, and such tests are expected to be carried out at relatively short intervals. To see how our framework can be extended to the long-term results of the patients, we record the risk of screening over time for the representative agents (centroids) of 4 clusters built up in a realization of the algorithm in Fig. 13. Each cluster exhibits a different rate of risk growth over time, i.e., while clusters 3 and 4 in Fig. 13 include women of the same age, patients in Cluster 3 develop a risk of breast cancer faster than patients in Fig. 4 due to other factors (e.g. history) a risk that clusters 3 and 4 in Fig. 13 include women of the same age."}, {"heading": "VI. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this article, we introduced ConfidentCare: a clinical decision support system that derives a personalized screening policy from electronic health data. ConfidentCare works by layering a woman's characteristics and learning cost-effective and accurate screening guidelines that are tailored to these characteristics and accurate with a high degree of confidence.The ConfidentCare algorithm iteratively layers the patient's trait space into fragmented clusters and learns active classifiers that are linked to each cluster. We have shown that the proposed algorithm has the potential to improve the cost-effectiveness and accuracy of the screening process compared to current clinical practice guidelines, as well as state-of-the-art algorithms that do not take personalization into account."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "We would like to thank Dr. Camelia Davtyan (Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center) for her valuable help and comments on the medical aspects of the essay.

Various clinical decisions are needed to manage the screening process; those include: selecting the screening tests for a woman to take, interpreting the test outcomes, and deciding whether or not a woman should be referred to a diagnostic test. Such decisions are currently guided by clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), which represent a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach that are designed to work well on average for a population, without guaranteeing that it will work well uniformly over that population. Since the risks and benefits of screening are functions of each patients features, personalized screening policies that are tailored to the features of individuals are needed in order to ensure that the right tests are recommended to the right woman. In order to address this issue, we present ConfidentCare: a computer-aided clinical decision support system that learns a personalized screening policy from the electronic health record (EHR) data. ConfidentCare operates by recognizing clusters of \u201csimilar\u201d patients, and learning the \u201cbest\u201d screening policy to adopt for each cluster. A cluster of patients is a set of patients with similar features (e.g. age, breast density, family history, etc.), and the screening policy is a set of guidelines on what actions to recommend for a woman given her features and screening test scores. ConfidentCare utilizes an iterative algorithm that applies K-means clustering to the women\u2019s feature space, followed by learning an active classifier (decision tree) for every cluster. The algorithm ensures that the policy adopted for every cluster of patients satisfies a predefined accuracy requirement with a high level of confidence. We show that our algorithm outperforms the current CPGs in terms of cost-efficiency and false positive rates.", "creator": null}}}
